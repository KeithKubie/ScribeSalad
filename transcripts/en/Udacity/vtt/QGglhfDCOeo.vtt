00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.030
We have travelled quite a bit
in our QMV diagrams here.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.510
We started by asking questions as to how
one should detect anomalies in data.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.170
We thought we could detect
outliers in distributions.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.620
We inspected distributions and
looked at correlations between them.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.780
We derived certain variables.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.040
We used two variables
to form some model.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.499
The models we looked at could have
been parametric, non-parametric, or

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:30.600
mathematical.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.610
We concentrated on
the non-parametric models and

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.020
derive some single variable
kernel density estimates.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.030
&gt;From the single variate kernel density
estimate, we look for optimal models.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.040
We used mean integrated square error
to look for optimal bandwidths.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.210
We introduced the KL divergence.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.040
We also found some multivariate
kernel density estimators and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.700
looked at joint probability
distribution functions.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.890
For the multivariate methods,
we looked at outliers in the models.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.070
We used Mahalanobis distance
to find the outliers and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.820
we left it up to you to find out what
these outliers may mean in our data.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.240
This completes this part of our lesson.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.370
At this point,
we will leave behind this diagram.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.680
However, you can see there
are many points we could have

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.000
further enhanced this diagram.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.440
In fact,
this is always the case with our Q and

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.510
V diagrams to find the flow of
logic in model building process.
