Jacob: Welcome to Crash Course Economics,
I'm Jacob Clifford...

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.840
Adriene: ...and I'm Adriene Hill. The world
is full of inequality. There's racial inequality,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.040
gender inequality, health, education, political
inequality, and of course, economic inequality.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.760
Some people are rich, and some people are
poor, and it can seem pretty impossible to fix.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.020
Jacob: Well, maybe not.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.880
[Theme Music]

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.760
Jacob: So there are two main types of economic
inequality: wealth inequality and income inequality.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.260
Wealth is accumulated assets, minus liabilities
so it's the value of stuff like savings, pensions,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.440
real estate, and stocks. When we talk about
wealth inequality, we're basically talking

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.329
about how assets are distributed. Income is
the new earnings that are constantly being

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.280
added to that pile of wealth. So when we talk
about income inequality, we're talking about

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.760
how that new stuff is getting distributed. Point is,
they're not the same. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.220
Adriene: Let's look at both types of inequality
at the global level. Global wealth today is

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.560
estimated at about 260 trillion dollars, and
is not distributed equally. One study shows

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.389
that North America and Europe, while they
have less than 20% of the world's population,

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:17.130
have 67% of the world's wealth. China, which
has more people than North America and Europe

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.549
combined, has only about 8% of the wealth.
India and Africa together make up almost 30%

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.310
of the population, but only share about 2%
of the world's wealth. We're teaching economics,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.100
so we can focus on income inequality. These
ten people represent everyone on the planet,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.689
and they're lined up according to income.
Poorest over here and richest over here. This

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.090
group represents the poorest 20%, this is
the second poorest 20%, the middle 20%, and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.090
so on. If we distributed a hundred dollars
based on current income trends, this group

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.710
would get about 83 of those dollars, the next
richest would get 10 dollars, the middle gets

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.800
four, the second poorest group would get two dollars
and the poorest 20% of humans would get one dollar.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.399
Branko Milanovic, an economist that specializes
in inequality, explained all this by describing

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.689
an "economic big bang" - "At first, countries'
incomes were all bunched together, but with

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:17.670
the Industrial Revolution the differences
exploded. It pushed some countries forward

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.629
onto the path to higher incomes while others
stayed where they had been for millennia."

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.319
According to Milanovic, in 1820, the richest
countries in the world - Great Britain and

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.110
the Netherlands - were only three times richer
than the poorest, like India and China. Today,

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.740
the gap between the richest and poorest nations is like
100:1. The gaps are getting bigger and bigger.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.560
Thanks, Thought Bubble. The Industrial Revolution
created a lot of inequality between countries but today

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.439
globalization and international trade are accelerating it.
Most economists agree that globalization has

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:58.530
helped the world's poorest people, but it's
also helped the rich a lot more. Harvard economist

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.579
Richard Freeman noted, "The triumph of globalization
and market capitalism has improved living

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:10.599
standards for billions while concentrating
billions among the few." So, it's kind of

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.560
a mixed bag. The very poor are doing a little better, but
the very rich are now a lot richer than everybody else.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.680
There are other reasons inequality is growing.
Economists point to something called "skill-biased

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:27.280
technological change." The jobs created in
modernized economies are more technology-based,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.430
generally requiring new skills. Workers that
have the education and skills to do those

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.489
jobs thrive, while others are left behind.
So, in a way, technology's become a complement

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.859
for skilled workers but a replacement for
many unskilled workers. The end result is

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.310
an ever widening gap between not just the
poor and the rich, but also the poor and the

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.530
working class. As economies develop and as
manufacturing jobs move overseas, low skill

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.840
low pay and high skill high pay work are the
only jobs left. People with few skills fall

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.079
behind in terms of income. In the last thirty
years in the US, the number of college-educated

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:09.109
people living in poverty has doubled from
3% to 6%, which is bad! And then consider

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:14.060
that during the same period of time, the number
of people living in poverty with a high school

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.540
degree has risen from 6% to a whopping 22%.
Over the last fifty years, the salary of college

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.810
graduates has continued to grow while, after
adjusting for inflation, high school graduates'

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.590
incomes have actually dropped. It's a good
reason to stay in school!

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.470
There are other reasons the income gap is
widening. The reduced influence of unions,

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.820
tax policies that favor the wealthy, and the
fact that somehow it's okay for CEOs to make

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.060
salaries many, many times greater than those
of their employees. Also, race and gender

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.690
and other forms of inequality can exacerbate
income equality.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.970
Jacob: Let's dive into the data for the United
States. We'll start by mentioning Max Lorenz,

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.350
who created a graph to show income inequality.
Along the bottom we have the percent of households

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.830
from 0-100% and along the side we have the
percent share of income. By the way, we're

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.390
using households rather than just looking
at individuals because many households have

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.580
two income earners. So this straight line
right here represents perfect income equality.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.540
So every household earns the same income.
And while perfect income equality might look

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.340
nice on the surface, it's not really the goal.
When different jobs have different incomes,

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.210
people have incentive to become a doctor or
an entrepreneur or a YouTube star - you know,

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.410
the jobs society really values. So this graph, called
the Lorenz curve, helps visualize the depth of inequality.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.180
Now, for 2010, the US Census Bureau found
that the poorest 20% of Americans made 3.3%

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.260
of the income. And the richest 20% made over
50% of the income. So that's pretty unequal

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.460
but has it always been like this? Well, in
1970, the bottom group earned 4.1% of the

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.900
income and the top earned 43.3%. By 1990,
things were even less equal so the 2010 numbers

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.380
are just a continuation of the trend. And
it isn't just the poorest group that's losing

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.550
ground. Over those 40 years, each of the bottom
groups or 80% households earned smaller and

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.190
smaller shares of the total income.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.200
Now, from the Lorenz curve we can calculate
the most commonly used measure of income equality

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.020
- the GINI Index. Now without jumping into
too much of the math, it's basically the size

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.660
of the gap between the equal distribution
of income and the actual distribution. Now,

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.960
0 represents complete equality and 100 represents
complete inequality. Now, you might be surprised

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.240
to learn the US doesn't have the highest income
inequality, but it does have the highest among

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.490
Western industrialized nations. The UK has
the highest in the EU.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.550
Adriene: The debate over income equality isn't
about whether it exists. It obviously does.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.580
The fight is over whether it's a problem and
what should be done about it. Let's start

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.580
with those who don't think it's a big deal.
They tell you that the data suggests that

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.940
the rich are getting richer and the poor are
getting poorer, but that might not be the

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.140
case. Instead, it could be that all the groups
are making more money but the rich's share

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.910
is just growing faster. Like, let's say you
own an apple tree and we pick 10 apples. You

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:57.930
keep 6 and give me 4. A week later we pick
20 apples, you take 15 and give me 5. So my

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:05.200
share of the total went down from 40% to 25%
but each of us still got more apples. So it's

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.920
true that people in the lowest income bracket have
earned a little more money in the last 40 years, but in

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:18.080
the last 20 years, that average income has been falling.
Meanwhile, the rich have continually gotten richer.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:23.240
So, what's the richest guy on earth have to
say about it? Bill Gates said, "Yes, some

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.740
level of inequality is built in to capitalism.
It's inherent to the system. The question

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.140
is, what level of inequality is acceptable?
And when does inequality start doing more

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:39.050
harm than good?" There's a growing group of
economists who believe income inequality in

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:45.300
the US today is doing more harm. They argue
that greater income inequality is associated

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.560
with a lot of problems. They point to studies
that show countries with more inequality have

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:56.300
more violence, drug abuse and incarcerations.
Income inequality also dilutes political equality,

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:01.110
since the rich have a disproportionate say
in what policies move forward, and the rich

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.490
have an incentive to promote policies that
benefit the rich.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.780
So, how do we address this inequality? There's
not a lot of agreement on this. Some argue

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:13.780
that education is the key to reducing the
gap. Basically, workers with more and better

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:18.150
education tend to have the skills that earn
higher income. Some economists push for an

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.750
increased minimum wage, which we're going
to talk about in another episode. There's

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:27.050
even an argument that access to affordable,
high quality childcare would go a long way.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.740
And some think governments should do more
to provide a social safety net, focus on getting

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.950
more people to work and adjust the tax code
to redistribute income.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.810
Jacob: Some economists call for the government
to increase income taxes and capital gains

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:44.320
taxes on the rich. Income taxes in the US
are already somewhat progressive, which means

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.560
that there are tax brackets that require the
rich to pay a higher percent of income. Right

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.090
now, it peaks at around 40% but some economists
call for increases up to 50 or 60%. One idea

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:59.380
is to fix loopholes that the rich use to avoid
paying taxes. Other economists argue that taxing

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:04.440
the rich won't be as effective as reducing regulation
and bureaucratic red tape. It's unclear which path

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.860
we're going to take but extreme income inequality
at the national and global level needs to be addressed.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:15.100
Motivation to improve income inequality may come
from a genuine desire to help people and level the

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:21.300
playing field, or the fear of Hunger Games-style social
upheaval. But either way, the issue can't be ignored.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:27.160
Adriene: Even Adam Smith, the most classical
of classical economists, said, "No society

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:33.030
can surely be flourishing and happy of which
the far greater part of the members are poor

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.280
and miserable." Thanks for watching, we'll
