00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:09.209
Mysteries of vernacular:

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.454
Keister,

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:12.991
a person's buttocks.

00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:14.966
Though the modern meaning of keister

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.291
refers somewhat indecorously

00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:19.080
to a person's behind,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.431
the word's history does not begin with the rear end.

00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:24.344
Instead, it can be traced back

00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:27.732
to the Proto-Indo-European kista,

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:30.555
which described a woven container.

00:00:31.247 --> 00:00:33.432
Kista influenced the creation of words

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:35.574
like the Greek kiste,

00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:37.729
meaning basket or box,

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:40.649
and later, the Latin cista,

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.288
which meant box or chest.

00:00:43.288 --> 00:00:46.831
In proto-Germanic, a sturdy, box-like container

00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:49.735
was described by the word kista,

00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:53.034
which eventually gave us chest in English.

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:54.739
For every locked chest,

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.640
there is both a key and a lock pick,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.751
and the history of keister

00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:02.348
draws us into this world of petty crime

00:01:02.348 --> 00:01:04.658
and speculative etymology.

00:01:04.658 --> 00:01:08.596
Keister may have come from the British dialect kist,

00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:11.349
which was the northern form of chest.

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:14.524
In the underworld jargon of the late 1800s,

00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:19.018
it referred to a burgler's tool kit that can be locked,

00:01:19.018 --> 00:01:21.491
and by the early 20th century,

00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:24.494
it meant safe or strong box.

00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:27.686
Numerous theories about keister's connection

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:29.772
to the buttocks abound,

00:01:29.772 --> 00:01:33.190
one being, that is courtesy of the slang sense,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.444
used by pick-pockets to describe

00:01:35.444 --> 00:01:38.669
the treasure of a rear trouser pocket.

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:42.305
Unfortunately, what isn't safe in your kist

00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:45.631
may not be safe near your keister either.
