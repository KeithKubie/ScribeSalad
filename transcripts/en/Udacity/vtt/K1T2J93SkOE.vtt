00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] The answer is 8.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's try this in the Python interpreter to see why.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
These are the first 2 assignments, and after these assignments

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we can see that agent has the same value as spy.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Both spy and agent have the value a list containing 3 elements.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The element values are 0, 0, 7, and

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
they're actually the same list object because both agent and spy refer to that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
same list that we created in the first assignment.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This means the value in agent position 2 is the number 7.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
When we do the third assignment we're assigning into position 2 of spy

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the value at position 2 of agent plus 1.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The value at position 2 of agent is 7, add 1 to that we get 8,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and we put that in position 2 of spy.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Since agent and spy refer to the same object that changes the value of both spy and agent,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and we can see that both agent and spy now contain the value 8, and position 2.
