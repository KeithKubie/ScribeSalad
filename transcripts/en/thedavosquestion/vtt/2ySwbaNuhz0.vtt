00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.720
chronic disease: Heart disease, diabetes,
cancer are all issues that

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.949

the Indian economy if

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.760
something isn't done about it.
The solutions are simple.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.130
India has the health care infrastructure and
the IT skills to do

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.330
something about it.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.019
You can put in interventions in the workplace
for as little as 300

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:40.539
rupees a person a year that would prevent
diabetes, heart disease,

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.659
cancer.
If you do that, India will become a superpower.
