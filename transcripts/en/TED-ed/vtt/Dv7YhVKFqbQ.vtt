00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:08.016
Escaping slavery;

00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:10.049
risking everything to save her family;

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:11.866
leading a military raid;

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.383
championing the cause 
of women’s suffrage;

00:00:14.383 --> 00:00:16.665
these are just a handful 
of the accomplishments

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:19.310
of one of America’s most
courageous heroes.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.821
Harriet Tubman was born Araminta Ross
in Dorchester County, Maryland,

00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:25.319
in the early 1820s.

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:30.474
Born into chattel slavery, Araminta, 
or Minty, was the fifth of nine children.

00:00:30.474 --> 00:00:33.917
Two of Minty’s older sisters 
were sold to a chain gang.

00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:35.367
Even as a small child,

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:37.319
Minty was hired out to different owners,

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:39.997
who subjected her to whippings 
and punishment.

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:43.698
Young Minty’s life changed forever 
on an errand to a neighborhood store.

00:00:43.698 --> 00:00:47.999
There, an overseer threw a two-pound 
weight at a fugitive enslaved person,

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.633
missed, and struck Minty instead.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.386
Her injury caused her 
to experience sleeping spells,

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.708
which we know of today as narcolepsy,

00:00:55.708 --> 00:00:57.385
for the rest of her life.

00:00:57.385 --> 00:00:59.304
Minty’s owner tried to sell her,

00:00:59.304 --> 00:01:03.344
but there were no buyers for an enslaved 
person who fell into sleeping spells.

00:01:03.344 --> 00:01:06.304
She was instead put to work 
with her father, Ben Ross,

00:01:06.304 --> 00:01:08.338
who taught her how to lumber.

00:01:08.338 --> 00:01:10.872
Lumbering increased 
Minty’s physical strength

00:01:10.872 --> 00:01:15.381
and put her in touch with free black 
sailors who shipped the wood to the North.

00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:18.325
From them, Minty learned about 
the secret communications

00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:20.106
that occurred along trade routes,

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:24.058
information that would prove 
invaluable later in her life.

00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:28.728
In this mixed atmosphere of free 
and enslaved blacks working side by side,

00:01:28.728 --> 00:01:33.321
Minty met John Tubman, 
a free black man she married in 1844.

00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:37.853
After marriage, she renamed herself 
Harriet, after her mother.

00:01:37.853 --> 00:01:40.492
Harriet Tubman’s owner died in 1849.

00:01:40.492 --> 00:01:43.843
When his widow planned to sell 
off her enslaved human beings,

00:01:43.843 --> 00:01:47.294
Harriet feared she would be sold away 
from everyone she loved.

00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:49.381
She had heard of 
an “underground railroad,"

00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:51.589
a secret network of safe houses,

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:52.748
boat captains,

00:01:52.748 --> 00:01:54.046
and wagon drivers

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:58.240
willing to harbor fugitive enslaved people
on their way north.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.458
So Tubman fled with two of her brothers, 
Ben and Harry.

00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:04.731
They eventually turned back, 
fearing they were lost.

00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:06.389
But in one of her sleeping spells,

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:09.427
Harriet dreamed 
that she could fly like a bird.

00:02:09.427 --> 00:02:13.208
Looking down below, 
she saw the path to liberation.

00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:17.313
And in the autumn of 1849, 
she set out on her own,

00:02:17.313 --> 00:02:21.088
following the North Star to Pennsylvania, 
and to freedom.

00:02:21.088 --> 00:02:25.353
Tubman returned to the South 
13 times to free her niece,

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:26.180
brothers,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.043
parents,

00:02:27.043 --> 00:02:28.651
and many others.

00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:30.801
She earned the nickname Black Moses

00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:33.473
and worked diligently 
with fellow abolitionists

00:02:33.473 --> 00:02:35.668
to help enslaved people escape,

00:02:35.668 --> 00:02:38.701
first to the North, and later to Canada.

00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:41.386
Harriet Tubman worked 
as a Union army nurse,

00:02:41.386 --> 00:02:42.166
scout,

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:44.043
and spy during the Civil War.

00:02:44.043 --> 00:02:48.375
In 1863, she became the first woman 
in United States history

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:50.938
to plan and lead a military raid,

00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:55.112
liberating nearly 
700 enslaved persons in South Carolina.

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:59.350
After the war, the 13th Amendment 
to the U.S. Constitution

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.243
legally abolished slavery,

00:03:01.243 --> 00:03:03.481
while the 14th expanded citizenship

00:03:03.481 --> 00:03:07.705
and the 15th gave voting rights 
to formerly enslaved black men.

00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:10.532
But she was undaunted, and she persisted.

00:03:10.532 --> 00:03:13.486
She raised funds 
for formerly enslaved persons

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:17.168
and helped build schools 
and a hospital on their behalf.

00:03:17.168 --> 00:03:22.140
In 1888, Tubman became more active
in the fight for women’s right to vote.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.443
In 1896, she appeared 
at the founding convention

00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:29.514
of the National Association 
of Colored Women in Washington D.C.

00:03:29.514 --> 00:03:33.383
and later at a woman’s suffrage 
meeting in Rochester, New York.

00:03:33.383 --> 00:03:35.113
There she told the audience:

00:03:35.113 --> 00:03:38.256
“I was a conductor 
on the Underground Railroad,

00:03:38.256 --> 00:03:41.017
and I can say what many others cannot.

00:03:41.017 --> 00:03:45.366
I never ran my train off the track, 
and I never lost a passenger.”

00:03:45.366 --> 00:03:47.131
As her fame grew,

00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:50.042
various friends and allies 
helped her in the fight

00:03:50.042 --> 00:03:53.604
to collect a veteran’s pension 
for her service in the Union Army.

00:03:53.604 --> 00:03:58.304
In 1899, she was finally 
granted $20 a month.

00:03:58.304 --> 00:03:59.996
In a fitting twist of fate,

00:03:59.996 --> 00:04:02.920
the United States 
Treasury announced in 2016

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.351
that Tubman’s image will appear 
on a redesigned twenty dollar bill.

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:11.699
Harriet Tubman died on March 10, 1913.

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.103
Even on her deathbed at age 91,

00:04:14.103 --> 00:04:16.776
she kept the freedom 
of her people in mind.

00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:18.489
Her final words were:

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.435
"I go away to prepare a place for you.”
