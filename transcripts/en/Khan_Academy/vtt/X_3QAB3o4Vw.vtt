00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:01.639
- [Voiceover] In the last video we learned

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.516
that there are a class of
stars called Cepheid variables.

00:00:06.516 --> 00:00:08.101
And these are the super giant stars,

00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:10.641
as much as 30000 times
as bright as the sun.

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:14.480
A mass, as much as 20
times the mass of the sun.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.086
And what's neat about them is, one,

00:00:16.086 --> 00:00:17.690
because they're so large and so bright,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.560
you can see them really really far away.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.286
And what's even neater about them

00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:23.643
is that they're variable,
that they pulsate.

00:00:23.643 --> 00:00:26.304
And because their pulsations are related

00:00:26.304 --> 00:00:28.052
to their actual luminosity,

00:00:28.052 --> 00:00:30.632
you know if you see a
cepheid variable star

00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:32.075
in some distant galaxy,

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:35.143
you know what it's luminosity actually is

00:00:35.143 --> 00:00:37.012
if you were kind of at the star,

00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:38.821
because you know you can see

00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:41.299
how it's period of pulsation.

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:43.127
And so if you know it's actual luminosity,

00:00:43.127 --> 00:00:45.586
and you know it's obviously
apparent luminosity,

00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:47.861
you know how much it's gotten dimmed.

00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:49.345
And the more dim it's gotten

00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:50.421
from its actual state,

00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:52.310
you know the farther away it is.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.408
So that's the real value of them.

00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:55.094
What I want to do in this video

00:00:55.094 --> 00:00:58.161
is to try to explain
why they're variables.

00:00:58.161 --> 00:00:59.625
Why they pulsate.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:02.165
And to do that, to do that,

00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:03.423
what we're gonna think about

00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:07.833
is doubly and singly ionized helium.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.478
And just to review, helium,

00:01:09.478 --> 00:01:12.830
so neutral helium, let
me draw a neutral helium,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.675
neutral helium's got two protons,

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:18.803
it's got two protons, two neutrons,

00:01:18.803 --> 00:01:20.835
two neutrons, and then two electrons

00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:22.928
and obviously this is not drawn to scale.

00:01:22.928 --> 00:01:26.179
So this is neutral helium right over here.

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.271
Now, if you singly ionize helium

00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:30.323
you knock off one of these electrons.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:31.706
And these type of things happen in stars

00:01:31.706 --> 00:01:32.741
when you have a lot of heat,

00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:34.570
easier to ionize things.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.114
So singly ionized helium

00:01:36.114 --> 00:01:37.658
will look like this.

00:01:37.658 --> 00:01:39.872
It'll have the same nucleus,

00:01:39.872 --> 00:01:41.722
two protons, two neutrons.

00:01:41.722 --> 00:01:43.551
One of the electrons gets knocked off

00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:45.318
so now you only have one electron.

00:01:45.318 --> 00:01:48.020
And now you have a net positive charge.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.372
So here, let me do this
in a different color,

00:01:51.372 --> 00:01:53.606
this helium now has a net charge,

00:01:53.606 --> 00:01:54.846
we could write one plus here,

00:01:54.846 --> 00:01:55.882
but if you just write a plus

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:58.848
you implicitly mean a
positive charge of one.

00:01:58.848 --> 00:02:00.678
Now you can also double the ionized helium

00:02:00.678 --> 00:02:03.360
if the environment is hot enough.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.615
You can doubly ionize helium

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:07.198
and doubly ionizing helium is essentially

00:02:07.198 --> 00:02:09.658
knocking off both of the electrons.

00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:12.684
So then it's really just a helium nucleus.

00:02:12.684 --> 00:02:15.915
It's really just a
helium nucleus like this.

00:02:15.915 --> 00:02:18.760
This right here is doubly, doubly

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.100
ionized helium.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.559
Now I just said in order to do this

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:24.875
you have to have a hotter environment.

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:26.662
There has to be a hotter environment

00:02:26.662 --> 00:02:27.638
in order to be able to knock off

00:02:27.638 --> 00:02:30.097
both these, this electron
really doesn't want to leave,

00:02:30.097 --> 00:02:31.478
to take an electron off of something

00:02:31.478 --> 00:02:33.387
that's already positive is difficult.

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:37.105
You have to have a lot of
really pressure and temperature.

00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:38.426
This is cooler.

00:02:38.426 --> 00:02:39.970
And this is all relative,

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.612
we're talking about the insides of stars.

00:02:42.612 --> 00:02:43.586
So, you know, it's hot,

00:02:43.586 --> 00:02:45.192
this is a hotter part of the star

00:02:45.192 --> 00:02:47.203
versus a cooler part of the star

00:02:47.203 --> 00:02:48.910
I guess is a way you think about this,

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.905
it's still a very hot environment

00:02:49.905 --> 00:02:52.952
by our traditional, every day standards.

00:02:52.952 --> 00:02:56.306
Now the other thing about
the doubly ionized helium

00:02:56.306 --> 00:02:58.784
is that it is more opaque.

00:02:58.784 --> 00:03:01.121
It is more opaque,

00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:03.416
which means it doesn't transmit,

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:04.636
it doesn't allow light to go through it,

00:03:04.636 --> 00:03:06.281
it actually absorbs light.

00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:07.663
It is more opaque,

00:03:07.663 --> 00:03:09.857
it absorbs light.

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:12.315
It absorbs light.

00:03:12.315 --> 00:03:12.823
Or in another way,

00:03:12.823 --> 00:03:15.038
it absorbs that light energy

00:03:15.038 --> 00:03:16.038
that energy will make it even hotter.

00:03:16.038 --> 00:03:17.948
So that's just something to think about.

00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:20.441
Now, the singly ionized helium

00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:22.575
is more transparent.

00:03:22.575 --> 00:03:25.439
This is more transparent.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:26.455
More transparent,

00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:28.731
it allows the light to pass through it.

00:03:28.731 --> 00:03:31.087
So it doesn't get heated as much

00:03:31.087 --> 00:03:33.790
by photons that are kind of going

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.740
near it, or through it, or whatever.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.040
It allows them to go through it here

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.848
the photons are going to actually heat up,

00:03:38.848 --> 00:03:40.169
heat up the ion.

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.749
So let's think about how this might cause

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.167
cepheid variable to pulsate.

00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:46.935
So assuming that cepheid variables

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:50.470
have a large enough
quantity, I should say,

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.075
of these ions,

00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:56.646
we can imagine that when
a cepheid variable is dim,

00:03:56.646 --> 00:03:59.105
so let me draw a dim cepheid variable,

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:04.105
so I'll draw that like, I'll
draw this in a dim color

00:04:04.245 --> 00:04:07.658
so this is a dim cepheid
variable right here.

00:04:07.658 --> 00:04:09.893
It's dim state, and it's dim state

00:04:09.893 --> 00:04:10.766
just like this,

00:04:10.766 --> 00:04:15.259
you have a lot of the
doubly ionized helium,

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:17.918
you have a lot of doubly ionized helium

00:04:17.918 --> 00:04:18.853
in the star,

00:04:18.853 --> 00:04:21.819
at least kind of the
outer surface of the star.

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:23.851
Doubly ionized helium.

00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:25.313
And so this does not allow

00:04:25.313 --> 00:04:27.244
a lot of light to pass through.

00:04:27.244 --> 00:04:28.889
So this is the dim part of

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.038
the pulsation of the cepheid variable.

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:36.793
Now because this doubly
ionized helium is opaque

00:04:36.793 --> 00:04:38.540
it is absorbing the light,

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.165
it is getting heated.

00:04:40.165 --> 00:04:43.538
It is getting heated.

00:04:43.538 --> 00:04:45.956
It is getting heated.

00:04:45.956 --> 00:04:47.337
And because it's getting heated,

00:04:47.337 --> 00:04:49.470
it'll cause the star to expand.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.014
So because it's getting heated

00:04:51.014 --> 00:04:52.782
it'll become more energetic

00:04:52.782 --> 00:04:55.687
and the star will actually expand.

00:04:55.687 --> 00:04:58.938
The star will actually expand.

00:04:58.938 --> 00:05:00.198
Now, as the star expands,

00:05:00.198 --> 00:05:02.047
because this doubly ionized helium

00:05:02.047 --> 00:05:03.855
is getting heated, what's going to happen,

00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:05.135
the further away you are from

00:05:05.135 --> 00:05:06.252
the core of the star,

00:05:06.252 --> 00:05:07.817
the cooler it gets.

00:05:07.817 --> 00:05:09.564
So this expanded because it was getting

00:05:09.564 --> 00:05:10.377
heated,

00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:11.616
but then because it expanded

00:05:11.616 --> 00:05:14.785
the outer layers of
the star become cooler.

00:05:14.785 --> 00:05:16.431
And since they're cooler,

00:05:16.431 --> 00:05:18.381
helium won't be doubly ionized anymore,

00:05:18.381 --> 00:05:20.088
it'll start to get a couple of,

00:05:20.088 --> 00:05:21.835
it'll get an electron from,

00:05:21.835 --> 00:05:23.745
each helium atom can now get an electron

00:05:23.745 --> 00:05:25.817
from the plasma, I guess you can say,

00:05:25.817 --> 00:05:27.565
to become singly ionized helium.

00:05:27.565 --> 00:05:31.709
So now we have singly ionized helium.

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:34.310
We have singly ionized helium.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.707
And now the star is going
to be more transparent,

00:05:36.707 --> 00:05:39.369
it's going to allow more
light to pass through it.

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:40.852
So now this is the bright part

00:05:40.852 --> 00:05:43.412
of the pulsation.

00:05:43.412 --> 00:05:45.688
It's going to allow more light through,

00:05:45.688 --> 00:05:47.902
so now it is bright.

00:05:47.902 --> 00:05:49.121
The star is bright.

00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:50.381
But what's happening now?

00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:52.250
Because the light is no longer

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.896
or it's not being absorbed as well

00:05:53.896 --> 00:05:55.216
by the helium

00:05:55.216 --> 00:05:57.695
when it was a doubly ionized helium,

00:05:57.695 --> 00:05:58.975
now it's letting most of the light,

00:05:58.975 --> 00:06:00.539
or a lot more of the light,

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:01.494
get through

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.445
it's not going to get heated as much.

00:06:03.445 --> 00:06:05.050
And so it won't have the kinetic energy

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.041
to kind of keep pushing out,

00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:08.321
to keep moving outward,

00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:10.881
and so it'll collapse back into the star.

00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:12.608
And so then this will cool down

00:06:12.608 --> 00:06:14.599
and collapse back in.

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:16.041
And when it collapses back in

00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:17.849
what's going to happen?

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:20.897
When it collapses back in,

00:06:20.897 --> 00:06:22.827
when these helium atoms get closer

00:06:22.827 --> 00:06:24.554
to the center of the star,

00:06:24.554 --> 00:06:25.854
to the core of the star,

00:06:25.854 --> 00:06:27.683
they're going to be heated again,

00:06:27.683 --> 00:06:29.328
because they're closer now to the core,

00:06:29.328 --> 00:06:30.365
and when they get heated

00:06:30.365 --> 00:06:32.227
they're going to become,

00:06:32.227 --> 00:06:34.651
they're going to become doubly ionized.

00:06:34.651 --> 00:06:38.288
So then we have doubly
ionized helium, again.

00:06:38.288 --> 00:06:39.304
Doubly ionized,

00:06:39.304 --> 00:06:40.503
and then the cycle will go again,

00:06:40.503 --> 00:06:41.864
it is now opaque,

00:06:41.864 --> 00:06:43.754
it will now absorb more energy,

00:06:43.754 --> 00:06:45.846
that'll cause it to
have more kinetic energy

00:06:45.846 --> 00:06:47.146
to expand,

00:06:47.146 --> 00:06:49.117
once it expands, it'll get cool again,

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.149
and transparent and bright.

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:53.729
And so this is the current best theory

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.842
of why cepheid variable stars

00:06:55.842 --> 00:06:58.504
are variable to begin with.

00:06:58.504 --> 00:06:59.641
It's this whole notion of having

00:06:59.641 --> 00:07:01.754
the doubly ionized helium

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:03.461
versus the singly ionized helium

00:07:03.461 --> 00:07:08.461
in kind of the outer
layers of the star itself.
