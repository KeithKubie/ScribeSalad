Let's go through the answers together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
For sentence 1, this open tag for bold--bold Baroque music!--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
must be paired, must be balanced with a closed tag for bold.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That looks like this. It's the left-angle slash token.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Then the bold closes off.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Down here Johann Sebastian Bach was--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
this looks like the beginning of an italics tag,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and you see that we're closing it off later.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
For this to be valid HTML, we really need to make this a well-formed tag.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Johann Sebastian Bach was German.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In fact, he was born around 1685 and is known for his fugues.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
They repeat in a structure that's actually surprisingly similar to regular expressions

00:00:46.000 --> 09:59:59.000
or context-free grammars. More on that later.
