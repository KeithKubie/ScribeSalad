JESSICA HARROP: Hi, I'm Jessica.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.956
And I'm going to be talking
about a chemical demonstration

00:00:10.956 --> 00:00:14.670
today that I like
to call let it snow.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.210
MIT's Dr. John Dolhun--

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.460
here he is-- and his
assistant, Arielle,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.220
are going to perform two
magic tricks involving

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.260
super absorbent polymers.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.960
Let's watch as they show us
the first one at the Cambridge

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.500
Science Festival.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.000
[WHOOSH]

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.930
JOHN DOLHUN: And
what I'm going to do

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.299
is I'm going to pour some
water into the beaker

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.400
that she's holding.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.880
And you keep your
eyes on the beaker.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.220
Bring it down just a bit.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.850
Hold it firmly.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.200
Turn it to-- we are making snow.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.015
We're making snow
today, Arielle.

00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:56.985
ARIELLE LUBIN: Oh, boy.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.070
It's so cold and wet.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.237
It's just like real snow.

00:01:02.237 --> 00:01:02.736
Look!

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:05.930
[WHOOSH]

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.304
JESSICA HARROP:
So what happened?

00:01:07.304 --> 00:01:08.990
Well, Arielle was
holding a beaker

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.780
containing some sodium
polyacrylate, which

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.820
is a polymer.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.560
Now a polymer is a
big molecule that's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.350
a chain of repeating units.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.210
This is the unit.

00:01:25.036 --> 00:01:26.785
And this is what it
looks like in a chain.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.700
Now, different chains are
held together by cross links.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.780
The et cetera just
means that this could

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.760
be thousands of carbons long.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.880
This is just a small part of
the chain and the polymer.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.940
Now when water is
added to the polymer,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.280
it wants to rush into
the material because

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.365
of the presence of so many
sodium and carboxylate ions.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.640
The water displaces the
sodium ions leaving negatively

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.980
charged carboxylic ions.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.230
These repel each other
and the repulsion

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.050
causes the polymer, which
starts out wound together,

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.350
to unwind, swell, and stretch.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.680
The cross lengths, which connect
the polymer chains together,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.890
prevent them from breaking
apart in the water.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.530
And the fake snow that's
created is the same snow

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.110
they use in
Hollywood movie sets.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.650
Now, let's watch Dr. Dolhun and
Arielle turn this same polymer

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.570
into something
totally different.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.250
[WHOOSH]

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.250
JOHN DOLHUN: OK, so I've got
another beaker she's holding.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.075
And I'm going to pour some
water in it and observe.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.490
Turn it over, Arielle.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.300
You don't have to hold
your hand under the hole.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.630
That's the same polymer.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.090
Only this time
the polymer is not

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.760
as cross-linked
as the first one.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.500
It's more of the
straight chain polymer.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.800
And it can absorb many more
times its weight in water.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.120
You'll recognize this.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.020
This is the diaper polymer.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.380
You know now, right?

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.880
[WHOOSH]

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.550
JESSICA HARROP: So Dr.
Dolhun uses the same polymer

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.040
with a different amount
of cross linking.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.440
The sodium polyacrylate
that makes diaper gel

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.750
has fewer cross-links
and therefore can

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.600
absorb more water than the
sodium polyacrylate that

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.890
turned into snow.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.820
Overall, this polymer can
absorb up to 800 times

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.760
its own weight in distilled
water and about 30

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.050
times its own weight in urine.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.900
It's the main ingredient
in baby diapers

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.345
used to keep the baby dry.

00:04:15.345 --> 00:04:15.970
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.290
Hope you enjoyed the video
and I'll see you next time.
