00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700
- [Voiceover] So in the last video,

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.154
I was talking about
various functions of money.

00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:06.304
The first was that it's
a medium of exchange.

00:00:06.304 --> 00:00:07.715
If you want to trade for things,

00:00:07.715 --> 00:00:08.951
typically you give someone money

00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:11.585
and they give you the thing,
rather than trying to barter.

00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:14.300
Trading apples for oranges
or horses for legal services

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.668
or things like this.

00:00:15.668 --> 00:00:18.186
The second is that it's a store of value.

00:00:18.186 --> 00:00:19.617
If you hold onto your money,

00:00:19.617 --> 00:00:21.404
it's value isn't just going to evaporate.

00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:23.716
Whereas if you hold
onto a bunch of apples,

00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:26.799
as they rot and degrade away
they're no longer valuable.

00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:28.686
And the third is that
it's a unit of value,

00:00:28.686 --> 00:00:30.851
it's a way that we
assign a number to items

00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:32.647
to say how valuable is this?

00:00:32.647 --> 00:00:34.549
That something that's 100 dollars

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:37.343
is about twice as valuable as
something that's 50 dollars

00:00:37.343 --> 00:00:39.243
and having this sort of
number system for value,

00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:41.575
makes it a lot easier to
compare different goods.

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:43.976
What I want to do in this video
is talk about a circumstance

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.532
where these functions of money breakdown,

00:00:46.532 --> 00:00:49.815
and what I'm thinking of is
the case of hyperinflation.

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:51.065
Hyperinflation.

00:00:52.408 --> 00:00:55.667
Now inflation means that
prices are increasing.

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:58.248
So if you look at the
price of a carton of milk

00:00:58.248 --> 00:01:00.129
and let's say it's one dollar one day,

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.014
it would be if it increases later on.

00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:05.183
So maybe it's $1.20, and
if the prices of all goods

00:01:05.183 --> 00:01:07.819
as a whole in the economy
tend to be increasing,

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:10.767
it's not just milk is getting
rarer or something like that,

00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:13.784
it's called inflation, and
hyperinflation is basically

00:01:13.784 --> 00:01:16.563
a case where this is just
happening really, really quickly.

00:01:16.563 --> 00:01:19.198
So Sal has some videos
talking about inflation itself

00:01:19.198 --> 00:01:21.576
and the root causes and I'm
not going to go into that here.

00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:23.621
In this case, all you
need to know is the idea

00:01:23.621 --> 00:01:26.112
that prices increase
really, really quickly.

00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:27.672
And just to give an example,

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:29.169
there's been lots throughout history

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:31.320
and this isn't necessarily
the starkest example,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.931
but it'll be interesting to us in terms of

00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:34.980
what the ultimate solution was.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.429
Brazil in the 1980's and early 1990's,

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.012
so 1980's and a little
bit into the 1990's,

00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:46.246
was undergoing very fast inflation,

00:01:46.246 --> 00:01:48.772
and to give a feel for the kind
of rates we're talking about

00:01:48.772 --> 00:01:52.605
at it's peak it was around 80% per month.

00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:57.116
And what this means is that every month

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:58.527
the prices of general goods,

00:01:58.527 --> 00:02:00.476
a carton of milk, or a chair,

00:02:00.476 --> 00:02:02.580
or the price of land, things like that,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.997
would generally get
multiplied by a factor of 1.8.

00:02:05.997 --> 00:02:08.594
Now if you compound this over a full year

00:02:08.594 --> 00:02:10.931
and every month it's increasing by 1.8.

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:13.760
So you multiply it in 12 different times.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.942
This is actually an increase by

00:02:15.942 --> 00:02:18.247
more than a factor of 1,000.

00:02:18.247 --> 00:02:20.464
So that would mean if you
have something that costs

00:02:20.464 --> 00:02:23.011
100 dollars one day, it's
gonna cost after a year,

00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:26.482
if inflation increases at
this rate, 100,000 dollars.

00:02:26.482 --> 00:02:30.326
So the annual inflation
rate, the percentage per year

00:02:30.326 --> 00:02:33.743
would actually be 100,000% per year.

00:02:36.341 --> 00:02:38.162
Now there have been
inflation rates in history

00:02:38.162 --> 00:02:41.243
faster than this but this
is still really insane.

00:02:41.243 --> 00:02:42.780
And just to get our minds around

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.442
what it might feel like to
be in en economy like this

00:02:45.442 --> 00:02:48.360
let's just imagine a
super simplified economy

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.259
where you have only four different people.

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:52.943
So we'll have four different people here,

00:02:52.943 --> 00:02:56.359
and let's say let's name these guys,

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.758
person A, person B,
person C, and person D.

00:03:00.758 --> 00:03:03.695
I guess I should give person D some eyes.

00:03:03.695 --> 00:03:05.415
And let's say it's the case that the way

00:03:05.415 --> 00:03:07.985
that this economy works is that

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:10.469
A buys all of his things from B.

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.567
So A will give B maybe let's
say it was 50 dollars a month

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:16.129
for all of his things.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.715
And B in response gives A things.

00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:21.631
And then B, she buys all
of her things from C,

00:03:21.631 --> 00:03:22.942
and she pays that same amount.

00:03:22.942 --> 00:03:25.258
She takes the full 50
dollars that she earned

00:03:25.258 --> 00:03:27.867
and she gets various things
that she needs in life from C,

00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:31.714
and then similarly C buys
all of his things from D.

00:03:31.714 --> 00:03:34.676
And let's say just for simplicity
that it's the same amount

00:03:34.676 --> 00:03:38.220
and then D buys all of her things from A.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.282
And this is obviously way
over simplified as an economy,

00:03:41.282 --> 00:03:42.413
but I do think it gives a good

00:03:42.413 --> 00:03:44.257
feel for the cyclic nature of things.

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:47.579
That one person's income is
another person's expenses.

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:48.982
Now let's say that you're in a

00:03:48.982 --> 00:03:51.157
hyperinflationary circumstance where

00:03:51.157 --> 00:03:53.247
you have this 80% increase per month.

00:03:53.247 --> 00:03:55.677
Something that costs 100 dollars one day,

00:03:55.677 --> 00:03:58.399
a month later is gonna cost 180 dollars.

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:00.431
If you were person A and you knew

00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:02.328
that prices of things are gonna increase,

00:04:02.328 --> 00:04:05.348
you might in anticipation
raise your prices

00:04:05.348 --> 00:04:07.579
as you're selling things to
D you might raise your prices

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.116
and say well actually today
I think I'm gonna charge you

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:12.829
51 dollars because things
are getting more expensive

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.166
so I want to earn more.

00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:16.563
And then D in response says
geez now I have to pay more

00:04:16.563 --> 00:04:17.798
so I'm gonna have to charge my

00:04:17.798 --> 00:04:20.136
customer C a little bit more as well.

00:04:20.136 --> 00:04:21.698
I'm gonna charge him 51.

00:04:21.698 --> 00:04:23.582
And then C says I'm gonna
have to charge my customer

00:04:23.582 --> 00:04:25.414
more as well in order to make ends meet.

00:04:25.414 --> 00:04:28.482
And everybody has to increase
their prices to keep up.

00:04:28.482 --> 00:04:29.928
And when the next day rolls around,

00:04:29.928 --> 00:04:32.547
no one wants to be the last
one to increase their prices

00:04:32.547 --> 00:04:34.804
so maybe this time B says oh

00:04:34.804 --> 00:04:36.730
yesterday I had prices increase on me,

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.390
and I was earning less but
then I had to spend more,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.260
so today I'm gonna make sure
that I'm not the last one

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.766
so I'm gonna increase my prices.

00:04:42.766 --> 00:04:46.293
I'm gonna increase them maybe
she says 53 just to be sure.

00:04:46.293 --> 00:04:48.111
And then A, noticing the
prices have increased

00:04:48.111 --> 00:04:51.294
has to keep up as well
so he needs to do this.

00:04:51.294 --> 00:04:52.611
And of course the cycle continues.

00:04:52.611 --> 00:04:54.149
Everyone in order to make ends meet

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:55.861
has to increase their prices.

00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:58.928
So this circumstance where
you're changing your prices

00:04:58.928 --> 00:05:00.932
in anticipation of future change

00:05:00.932 --> 00:05:02.887
is what distinguishes hyperinflation

00:05:02.887 --> 00:05:06.161
in a qualitative sense
from regular inflation.

00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:08.242
I think there's a quote
that I really like.

00:05:08.242 --> 00:05:09.478
I think it's by Napoleon.

00:05:09.478 --> 00:05:12.829
It's "Quantity sometimes has
a quality all of it's own."

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:14.803
And that's definitely the
case with hyperinflation

00:05:14.803 --> 00:05:16.545
because ordinary inflation,

00:05:16.545 --> 00:05:19.097
ordinary inflation like
let's say that which

00:05:19.097 --> 00:05:21.463
the United States dollar is
undergoing around these days

00:05:21.463 --> 00:05:25.709
typically ends up being around 1% to 3%,

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:28.376
it depends, but 1% to 3% per year.

00:05:28.376 --> 00:05:30.000
So obviously this is dramatically less

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.161
than 100,000% per year.

00:05:32.161 --> 00:05:34.475
But the idea is that
hyperinflation isn't just

00:05:34.475 --> 00:05:36.092
that it's a much bigger number.

00:05:36.092 --> 00:05:38.526
It's that there's a psychological
difference in the society

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:41.229
where people are starting
to anticipate changes

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.923
and change their prices accordingly.

00:05:42.923 --> 00:05:44.632
And this is how things
spiral out of control.

00:05:44.632 --> 00:05:47.725
This is how you get insane
numbers like 80% per month.

00:05:47.725 --> 00:05:49.676
Now why am I talking about this?

00:05:49.676 --> 00:05:51.075
This is about functions of money.

00:05:51.075 --> 00:05:52.585
Why am I talking about hyperinflation?

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:54.555
Well let's take a look at
these functions of money

00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:57.273
and analyze whether or
not they still apply

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.359
in a hyperinflationary economy.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.610
Now medium of exchange,

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.907
money is still being used
as a medium of exchange.

00:06:02.907 --> 00:06:05.365
People are still buying things
using the national currency.

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.692
So that one stays intact.

00:06:06.692 --> 00:06:09.260
Store value however, this
one clearly breaks down,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.541
because if you're holding on,

00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:13.145
let's say you have 100
dollars in savings today

00:06:13.145 --> 00:06:14.479
and then you know that
things are increasing

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.779
by 100,000% per year it's gonna be

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:19.877
1,000 times less valuable after a year.

00:06:19.877 --> 00:06:23.583
So most certainly it is no
longer a store of value.

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.091
And you could argue by the way

00:06:25.091 --> 00:06:27.303
that even in an ordinary
inflation circumstance

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:30.430
money doesn't quite serve this
function as a store of value

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.856
because even if prices are increasing

00:06:31.856 --> 00:06:33.650
only very slowly every year,

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.082
it's still the case that a
dollar that you hold on to,

00:06:36.082 --> 00:06:39.020
you're not investing it or
collecting interest rate,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.404
slowly degrades over time.

00:06:40.404 --> 00:06:43.066
So you could argue that even
in an ordinary circumstance,

00:06:43.066 --> 00:06:46.065
store of value doesn't quite
apply due to inflation.

00:06:46.065 --> 00:06:48.648
But let's consider this
third function of money.

00:06:48.648 --> 00:06:49.915
Unit of value.

00:06:49.915 --> 00:06:52.680
If you're living in this
hyperinflationary circumstance

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.323
the numbers that you're seeing

00:06:54.323 --> 00:06:56.669
no longer really correspond to value.

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:58.018
Right, if you had something that

00:06:58.018 --> 00:07:00.072
originally was 50 dollars of value,

00:07:00.072 --> 00:07:02.570
and then after a year it's 50,000 dollars,

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.577
you're not thinking of
the value of that thing

00:07:04.577 --> 00:07:06.521
in terms of the national currency.

00:07:06.521 --> 00:07:07.853
And often throughout history,

00:07:07.853 --> 00:07:10.904
people started thinking of
the value of various items

00:07:10.904 --> 00:07:13.402
in terms of another nation's currency.

00:07:13.402 --> 00:07:15.872
So if your own currency, all
of the numbers are fluctuating

00:07:15.872 --> 00:07:17.953
very rapidly and they're
increasing very rapidly,

00:07:17.953 --> 00:07:19.986
you look for a more stable number.

00:07:19.986 --> 00:07:21.306
So if you want to know how much

00:07:21.306 --> 00:07:22.869
should a carton of milk cost?

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:24.767
Rather than thinking in
your own nation's currency

00:07:24.767 --> 00:07:28.139
maybe so oh it's analogous
to 1.5 British pounds

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:30.939
or something that seems
a little bit more stable.

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:33.890
So this unit of value
property no longer applies

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.743
in the case of hyperinflation.

00:07:35.743 --> 00:07:36.838
And notice that that's distinct.

00:07:36.838 --> 00:07:38.092
That is something different between

00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:39.940
hyperinflation and regular inflation.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.456
Because even in let's say
the United States these days,

00:07:42.456 --> 00:07:44.103
even though prices slowly increase,

00:07:44.103 --> 00:07:45.592
we still think about the value of things

00:07:45.592 --> 00:07:47.673
in terms of the U.S. dollar.

00:07:47.673 --> 00:07:49.706
This still serves as our unit of value.

00:07:49.706 --> 00:07:51.337
So that's one of the core distinctions.

00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:53.103
I think that's actually very important for

00:07:53.103 --> 00:07:56.288
what distinguishes
hyperinflation from inflation

00:07:56.288 --> 00:07:58.344
in a qualitative sense.

00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:02.009
Now why did I choose to think
about Brazil's hyperinflation

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:03.360
as opposed to a lot of other ones,

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.319
like post World War I Germany,

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:07.121
or Zimbabwe or places where you've had

00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:08.919
even faster rates of hyperinflation.

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:11.769
And basically because there
was a really interesting

00:08:11.769 --> 00:08:14.243
way that they went about solving it.

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:16.478
Any solution has to address
the underlying causes

00:08:16.478 --> 00:08:18.892
of inflation and this video
isn't necessarily about those.

00:08:18.892 --> 00:08:21.011
So there's gonna be things
associated with making sure

00:08:21.011 --> 00:08:23.040
that the government is
still fiscally responsible

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.925
and balancing budgets and things like that

00:08:24.925 --> 00:08:26.942
but a different component
that needs to be addresses

00:08:26.942 --> 00:08:30.377
is that money is no longer
serving as a unit of value.

00:08:30.377 --> 00:08:32.647
So one really interesting
thing that Brazil did

00:08:32.647 --> 00:08:35.496
in the early 1990's is they introduced

00:08:35.496 --> 00:08:38.774
a fake currency that they called the URV,

00:08:38.774 --> 00:08:41.658
for unit of real value,
or really it was in the,

00:08:41.658 --> 00:08:44.279
really it's the Portuguese
words for these,

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:46.015
I think Unidade Real Valor,

00:08:46.015 --> 00:08:47.847
I don't really know Portuguese

00:08:47.847 --> 00:08:49.931
but the initials are the same, URV.

00:08:49.931 --> 00:08:51.352
And what they started doing is saying

00:08:51.352 --> 00:08:54.014
okay everybody continue paying
in the national currency

00:08:54.014 --> 00:08:56.380
which at the time was the crucero

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.647
I'm probably pronouncing
that wrong but crucero.

00:08:58.647 --> 00:08:59.906
So they're still paying for everything

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:01.453
in terms of their crucero.

00:09:01.453 --> 00:09:03.625
That's serving as the medium of exchange

00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:05.226
but what they did is they said

00:09:05.226 --> 00:09:06.932
every time that you're pricing something

00:09:06.932 --> 00:09:09.685
please list your prices not
only in terms of the crucero.

00:09:09.685 --> 00:09:12.728
In this case I've written
dollars, so let's pretend

00:09:12.728 --> 00:09:15.643
this says 53 crucero, 51
crucero, things like that.

00:09:15.643 --> 00:09:19.337
In addition to listing it
there, please also list

00:09:19.337 --> 00:09:22.258
the price in terms of units of real value,

00:09:22.258 --> 00:09:23.805
which in this case might
have been like, 50,

00:09:23.805 --> 00:09:25.739
because everything started off being 50.

00:09:25.739 --> 00:09:28.656
And they loosely pegged
this fake currency,

00:09:28.656 --> 00:09:31.104
this made up number, to the U.S. dollar.

00:09:31.104 --> 00:09:33.784
So over time even though the
price in terms of cruceros

00:09:33.784 --> 00:09:36.469
was increasing, it might be
53 cruceros, and then 55,

00:09:36.469 --> 00:09:37.687
and then everyone's paying more

00:09:37.687 --> 00:09:39.106
and more in terms of cruceros,

00:09:39.106 --> 00:09:41.234
the unit of real value
would stay the same,

00:09:41.234 --> 00:09:43.005
because it had no reason to increase.

00:09:43.005 --> 00:09:44.784
It's just a made up number
that you're pegging on things

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:47.734
just to keep straight how
valuable things actually are.

00:09:47.734 --> 00:09:49.236
So what they're basically doing,

00:09:49.236 --> 00:09:51.691
is they said currency, our current money,

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:54.153
is not serving this
function as a unit of value

00:09:54.153 --> 00:09:56.404
so let's just make up
a new thing that does.

00:09:56.404 --> 00:09:59.067
So at this time the
crucero was still serving

00:09:59.067 --> 00:10:01.104
the function as a medium of exchange.

00:10:01.104 --> 00:10:04.276
Nothing was really
serving the store of value

00:10:04.276 --> 00:10:05.902
except for hard goods like land.

00:10:05.902 --> 00:10:07.699
And then this made up number was serving

00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:09.503
the function as a unit of value.

00:10:09.503 --> 00:10:11.809
And over time, as people
started getting used to the idea

00:10:11.809 --> 00:10:13.537
that you go out to buy milk

00:10:13.537 --> 00:10:15.192
and you know that it's gonna be

00:10:15.192 --> 00:10:17.065
let's say one unit of real value,

00:10:17.065 --> 00:10:18.485
and then you just have to look up,

00:10:18.485 --> 00:10:20.401
okay how many cruceros corresponds

00:10:20.401 --> 00:10:22.506
to a unit of real value today?

00:10:22.506 --> 00:10:24.845
People start actually thinking
in terms of this number

00:10:24.845 --> 00:10:27.295
even though they're paying
in terms of another.

00:10:27.295 --> 00:10:28.816
And after this had kind of set

00:10:28.816 --> 00:10:30.410
into the psychology of the society,

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.943
and of course while certain
fiscal responsibility

00:10:33.943 --> 00:10:36.239
on the side of the government
was being addressed,

00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:38.185
they made the switch to make

00:10:38.185 --> 00:10:40.708
units of real value an actual currency

00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:43.145
and printing money in terms of these URVs

00:10:43.145 --> 00:10:45.306
and abandoning the crucero,

00:10:45.306 --> 00:10:47.041
and telling people they
could trade in their crucero

00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:50.243
for these URVs and that was
gonna be the new currency.

00:10:50.243 --> 00:10:52.375
And because people were used
to the idea that this was

00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:54.979
a stable number and they
were thinking of prices

00:10:54.979 --> 00:10:56.439
in terms of this stable number,

00:10:56.439 --> 00:10:59.222
and because the underlying
causes of inflation

00:10:59.222 --> 00:11:01.523
had started to be addressed,
it actually worked!

00:11:01.523 --> 00:11:02.929
And the number would stay stable

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:05.205
and instead of having
prices increase 80% a month

00:11:05.205 --> 00:11:06.998
it decreased drastically to something

00:11:06.998 --> 00:11:09.678
that's much closer to a healthy economy's

00:11:09.678 --> 00:11:11.431
level of inflation.

00:11:11.431 --> 00:11:13.656
And I think that's
really powerful actually

00:11:13.656 --> 00:11:16.539
that you can recognize that
one of the functions of money

00:11:16.539 --> 00:11:18.914
has broken down and then
address it specifically

00:11:18.914 --> 00:11:21.873
and invent something new that
addresses that same function.

00:11:21.873 --> 00:11:23.208
Sure it's a made up currency,

00:11:23.208 --> 00:11:24.819
it's just a number
you're assigning things,

00:11:24.819 --> 00:11:26.196
but it's serving this function.

00:11:26.196 --> 00:11:28.193
And then apply that in a very real setting

00:11:28.193 --> 00:11:29.730
on the scale of an entire nation

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.363
and solve an economic problem.

00:11:31.363 --> 00:11:33.375
So hopefully this sheds
a little bit of light

00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:35.193
on why it might be useful to break down

00:11:35.193 --> 00:11:36.778
the functions of money in terms of

00:11:36.778 --> 00:11:38.908
these three different categories.

00:11:38.908 --> 00:11:42.325
And with that I will see you next video.
