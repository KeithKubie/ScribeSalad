00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.100
So our friends play a game called "Dead Body."

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.500
And it's where one of you pretends to be a dead body

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.420
and the other person has to get you to the bed

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.740
comfortably.  Without hurting you.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.380
Brad: "Right."

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.580
So we're going to start with me as a dead body

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.500
and since Brad is stronger than me

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.720
I'm going to start on top of him and he has to

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.220
get me all the way there without hurting me.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.440
So I'm going to take off my glasses.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.800
So I'm just gonna--

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.180
You have to lay down.  Yeah.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.180
Ok which way should I lay down?

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.880
Lay down face up.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.700
No.  But yeah, handicap on your stomach.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.740
And so you're--

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.400
So I'm a dead body.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.320
So I have to imagine that you're dead?

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.740
Yeah.  You have to get me to the bed comfortably without hurting me.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.960
How much time am I allowed to like, cry?

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.940
While I think about your death?

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.580
None.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.920
No, that makes for a boring video.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.640
*sobbing*

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.160
No one wants to see white male tears.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.820
All right.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.600
Oh, my neck just cracked.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.880
See?  I'm just helping you.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.380
Yeah.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.620
Even though you're--after you're dead.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.740
Oh, Congo is coming!

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.760
Oh he gonna eat my dead body.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.540
Ok, so...

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.960
Oh hi Congo!

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.280
Ahahaha!

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.260
You want to help, Congress?

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.800
So this, uh.  This isn't going to work.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.920
The way I was trying this.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.420
Ok.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.980
So I'm going to back down.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.480
Ok.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.640
And I'm gonna--I'm gonna roll you off.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.640
Ok.  Don't roll me over the cat.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.880
If you hurt the cat you're disqualified too.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.340
That's not Congress, that's your pony tail.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.000
Oh, okay.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.840
Where's Congress?

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.480
I don't know, I'm a dead body.  I can't see anything.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.660
Oh, that hurts my hands.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.880
That hurts your hand?

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.080
You're not supposed to talk.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.000
But if I'm in pain I gotta tell you.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.940
Well how much did it hurt?  Not that much right?

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.960
Not a lot but it's still painful.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.820
There.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.720
I feel like this is too easy for you.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.260
This is too easy for me?  No!

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.940
I feel like I should be holding weights as like a handicap.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.820
No, you started on my back.  That's a good handicap.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.680
Ah!

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.580
What hurts?

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.620
It's cause I worked out the other day so

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.760
*loud grunting*

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.020
It's still tough.  You're not helping.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.440
Oh no, watch out for Congress!

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.860
Watch out for Congress!

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.860
Ow!

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.700
*laughing*

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.720
Overreactions.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.440
No, you hit me!

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.540
Now you have to put me on the bed nicely too.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.920
Right?

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.420
Good job!

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.060
One hand on a kitty.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.600
That's the way you're supposed to be buried.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.220
Good job.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.200
I feel like that was way too easy for you.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.100
Okay!  My turn!

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.240
Cat Intermission.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.880
We have a new cat!

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.960
She's a big one.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.060
And she's so cute.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.640
And her name is Ghost.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.440
And she likes to meow a lot.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.540
Yeah, she's a meower.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.460
New kitten challenge:  everybody gets a new kitten.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.920
Everybody just gets a new kitten.  That's the challenge.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.860
I don't know how I'm going to do this.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.140
Brad is heavy.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.860
Ok.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.360
You can lie down.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.440
I'm not not winded.  I am winded.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.940
Ok.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.660
So it wasn't like super easy.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.280
Just lay down.  Just lay down.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.920
On your back.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.660
I'm gonna lay down.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.540
On your back.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.160
You don't need to--

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.720
You don't need to keep telling me.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.360
Lay down.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.040
I'm already laying down.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.480
Be a dead body.  Dead bodies don't have their legs like that.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.280
Your dead body is not good.  Ok.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.500
You're going to critique my dead body?

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.360
Yeah!

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.300
It's like that movie with Daniel Radcliffe.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.400
The farting one?

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.880
Yeah, I'm going to like fart.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.560
Don't do that.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.760
I'm going to kill you with my fart.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.500
This is just a challenge where you take off my shirt.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.300
Ugh!

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.580
Oh God.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.480
I feel like I'm going to get hurt.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.280
That's not...that's uh...

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.680
That seems like it's bound to happen.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.320
Why are your shoes coming off?

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.040
I'm not doing anything.  I'm dead.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.140
I shouldn't have squatted yesterday.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.660
Haha.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.800
Pretty good!  Pretty good!

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.760
This is a new kind of workout!

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.560
Ahh!

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.800
*grunting*

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.680
Ow!

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.660
Haha.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.160
Ow!

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.240
I'm sorry!

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.540
This isn't how I lay in a bed!

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.960
You're going to pull off my pants.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.080
That's how I want to be buried.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.680
Naked, with a cat.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.640
Ok.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.060
Hahaha.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.740
Oh, I scared the cat away!

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.800
Haha.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.720
Let's move the pillow to you!

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.840
Move the pillow to me!

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.620
Wow.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.360
All that crossfit.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.040
It's the hip thrusts, is what do it.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.920
Without the hip thrusts, that wouldn't have happened.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.340
You would have had to use some sort of pulley device.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.880
You're in your casket sir, alive now.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.260
That's the "Dead Body" game...that our friends play.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.380
I don't know why.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.940
I'm a zombie now!

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.840
I don't ever want to play that game again.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.740
And you can check out Brad's channel by clicking anywhere on his face.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.720
Click on my face.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.520
I'm not dead, I swear.
