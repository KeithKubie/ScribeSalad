00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
 Let's talk about love. 

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.760
 But when it comes to love, I have a show in "Single By 30". 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.920
 This is an album originally created by Youtube Red. 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.040
 It is now in the heat! 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.500
 Ok, I know how to fall in love. 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.780
 There should be no more than one right. 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.700
 Some people are together because of rationality 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.180
 Socially economically and intellectually 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.280
 We are very commensurate 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.500
 I agree that we should be partners 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.260
 I also agree with this conclusion. 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.080
 We should start from today and start kissing next week. 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.580
 Then start making love in a month 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.080
 I am a more confident person. 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.240
 I ask you to consider three weeks before we start making love. 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.300
 I will consider looking 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.500
 Transaction 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.580
 thank you 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.700
 you are welcome 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.040
 Some people will be together for convenience 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.040
 You are very close to me, you are my person. 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.420
 We are together 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.500
 Then I have to admit that when I like someone, 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500
 I am the kind of person I am. 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.880
 I will fall in love at first sight. 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.520
 Elysia, I didn’t do anything. 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.580
 Have! You are there! 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.300
 Nothing! 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.060
 *Fantasy* 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.260
 Are you listening to Ah? 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.620
 That feeling is very strong 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.340
 When I fell in love, I really fell into it... 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.820
 Water is good ice! 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.420
 I know what you are going to say? 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.540
 Save it! I already know what you want to say. 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.340
 That’s not love, it’s just a flower idiot. 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.980
 It’s just that desire is just a delusion. 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.000
 Yeah, I admit that I am thinking about it. 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.380
 I met a person and started to fantasize 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.660
 Fantasy that he is a good person 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.280
 Then we will be perfect if we are together 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.020
 How beautiful will we have for the rest of our lives? 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.300
 In a wonderful marriage 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.060
 When he said nothing: 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.340
 Hi, I am called a mustache. 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.500
 But what I heard is: 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.180
 I won't mind if you have a few cats. 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.400
 Because I didn't fall in love with this person. 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.160
 I fell in love with this concept. 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.320
 I am "love" a person 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.620
 No matter how many warnings he shows 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.320
 In fact, I don't think it is necessary to have a monogamy. 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.040
 I am carrying a girl who has been dating before. 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.960
 I don't want to raise a child. 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.880
 I refuse to find a job and I don't want to help people. 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.160
 That's why I haven't paid taxes for about four years. 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.980
 Oh 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.100
 Can you wait for me? 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.420
 Pretty sure it was my girlfriend’s call. 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.460
 Hey 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.120
 I gradually learned about this after I grew up. 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.160
 I have judged more than before. 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.220
 Now I meet people who have eyes, I will think 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.000
 All these feelings are not love 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 It’s just being attracted by the opposite sex. 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.740
 Are all Hormons 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.840
 I like you~ I like you~ 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.700
 Oh! I also like you~ 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.820
 Oh~ I like you~ 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.160
 Handsome guy, where are you going~ I like you~ 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.300
 I like you~ Hey! I like you~ 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.780
 Then I like you too~ 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.820
 But maybe you are a reasonable person. 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.240
 Will only fall in love with those 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.020
 I have known for a long time 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.520
 Already know their advantages 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.860
 Friend of people 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.300
 It’s like Harry and Kina in "Single By 30" 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.180
 The transition animation on Youtube Red is very smooth. 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.500
 That transition animation is really smooth 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.140
 I am honored to play Harry Shum's 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.120
 My sister is called Grace in "Single By 30" 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.360
 This is a painful but lovely romantic comedy on WongFU. 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.420
 Now the entire chapter can be found on Youtube Red. 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.600
 So don't forget to rush your subscription. 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.800
 You may see me in the play or around Christmas. 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.640
 Or who knows sometime next year? 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.300
 I may be able to occupy the entire Youtube Red flat 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.400
 Ok, then 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.440
 I am Anna Akana. 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.060
 I actually said my name wrong.
