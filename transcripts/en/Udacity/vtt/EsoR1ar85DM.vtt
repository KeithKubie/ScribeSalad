00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, the answer is that changing hand_rank wouldn't help anything

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
because it really is a tie, and hand_rank really does return the same value.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If we both have straight flushes ace high,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
hand_rank should return exactly the same thing for both.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Just because we have different suits doesn't mean they should have a different hand_rank.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But we could change poker to return

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
a list of everybody that tied rather than arbitrarily choose one of them.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Or we could invent a new function, say,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we might want the function "pokerwithties."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So either of those would be okay.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I think the best is not to introduce this new function

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
because once we have that, who would really want the poker function?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Who would want to say "Let's play a game of poker

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
where we don't do ties correctly?"

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I think we really want to handle ties correctly,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
so I think that's the best approach of the 3,

00:00:58.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but either approach would do.
