00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.059
WINNIE LAM: Hi, everyone.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.053
Hi.

00:00:05.053 --> 00:00:06.440
So I'm Winnie Lam.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.300
I know it must be hard to pay
attention when there is a much

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.672
cuter turtle on the
big screen.

00:00:11.672 --> 00:00:14.500
But anyway, it's my pleasure
to welcome all of you guys

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.110
here to the talk today, and of
course, our speaker, Dr. Caleb

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.000
McClennen, who is the Marine
Conservation Director at the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.240
Wildlife Conservation Society.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.280
So he's going to talk to
us today about oceans

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.770
conservation, about turtles,
and how we can help by

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.549
participating in swimming
with turtles in Belize.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.970
So let me tell you about how
Caleb and I first met, which

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.260
he's looking at me
nervously about.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.184
I don't know why.

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:43.290
But anyway, so when Caleb and I
met for the first time a few

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.800
years ago, I remember that day,
I was wearing the exact

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.940
same thing that I'm wearing
right now, which is this

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.040
funky, ridiculous-looking
turtleneck.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.700
Literally, a turtleneck.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.860
Anyway, so we got chatting.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.960
We hit it off, got talking
about turtles.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.930
And then sometime later, he
told me that he needed

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.900
volunteers to help his
scientists with a turtle

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.090
population survey in Belize.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.870
And so as far as me being a
big turtle fanatic, I was

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.390
like, yes, please sign me up,
and I'll bring a bunch of

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.460
Googlers with me, too.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.140
And so there we were last year
in Belize swimming in one of

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.480
the most beautiful oceans
of the world.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.480
And I was really excited that I
got the chance to touch and

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.280
hug a turtle.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.530
And I'd like to think that he
was hugging me back, too.

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:35.300
Anyway, so without further ado,
please help me give a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.850
really warm welcome to
Dr. Caleb McClennen.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.401
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:44.850
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN:
Thanks, Winnie.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.605
And thank you all for taking
some time out of

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:48.390
your day to be here.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.710
It's really a great pleasure.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.300
And we look forward to talking
a bit more about turtle

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.030
conservation, a little bit about
what WCS, the Wildlife

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.970
Conservation Society,
does in Belize and

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.660
elsewhere for turtles.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.980
And then how, like Winnie said,
some of you may be able

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.470
to help if you're able to come
down and spare a week in the

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.430
tropical seas swimming
after turtles.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.015
And there's a few folks here who
did the trip last year, so

00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:16.500
I might call on to just provide
the real story behind

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.760
what I'm saying in terms
of the turtle surveys.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.220
But the results we got back
last year is that it was a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.910
really positive trip, and we
tweaked a few things to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.500
hopefully make it even
better this year.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.100
So look forward to questions
throughout.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.760
I'm sure the style here is if
you've got something to ask,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.090
no need to wait for the end.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.495
But also leave some time
for questions.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.730
Today we'll just talk a little
bit first about turtles just

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.420
to get a sense of why--

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.470
besides the fact that
they're cute, yes--

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.350
but why we care and why we're
spending a lot of time and

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.450
effort, and why it's worth your
guys' time besides the

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.010
ancillary benefit of nice
weather and maybe a tan or a

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.730
sunburn to think about them.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.300
So I'm just going to provide
an overview of the three

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.590
turtle species we primarily see
at Glover's Reef, which is

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.820
where the survey takes
place in Belize.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.030
The three turtles we'll talk
through are loggerhead turtle,

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.460
green turtle, and hawksbill
turtle.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.930
So this is a photo of a
loggerhead turtle similar,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.560
actually, to Winnie's photo.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.882
This is in the New
York Aquarium.

00:03:20.882 --> 00:03:23.230
The photos often for loggerheads
are very popular

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.050
aquarium species.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.640
And so you'll get these crystal
clear shots, which if

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.440
anyone says was taken in the
wild generally are taken at

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.910
the aquarium.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.190
Loggerheads we see down in
Belize but are actually one of

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.370
the main turtles on the
southeast US coast.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.640
Most of the nesting and a lot
of loggerhead habitat is in

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.620
the Southeast US.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.690
So the United States government
and a lot of

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.470
community organizations in
Florida, Carolinas, throughout

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.310
the Gulf, have a big role
in the conservation

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.970
of loggerhead turtles.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.560
Of course, the Caribbean plays
an important role as well.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.260
They use the Caribbean
grounds.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.430
But in some ways, the Caribbean
experiences the

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.120
benefits or costs of good
or poor US management.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.350
You may see some loggerheads
down at Glover's, but it's not

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.560
necessarily the dominant
species.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.800
One of the biggest impact for
loggerheads is by catch and

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.020
trawl nets.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.870
You've probably heard a lot
in the news of trawl nets

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.220
scraping over the bottom.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.649
US has done quite a lot, and
other countries as well, to

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:22.500
try to design nets that
don't catch turtles.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.890
But still, there's quite
a lot of damage.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.940
And just recently, I think
there's a lawsuit launched on

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.410
the West Coast here in
California on loggerhead

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.380
mortalities for the Pacific
population.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.880
Because they think about
1,000 a year are

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.530
killed in net drownings.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.940
Turtles breathe air, so if they
get dragged under for too

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.820
long, they drown and die.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.200
So anyway, the Northwest
Atlantic loggerhead might see.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.780
The second one is the green
turtle, one of the largest

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.240
turtle populations
historically.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.710
Historically, green turtle
populations were 30 to 90

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.940
million individuals in the
Caribbean population,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.500
Caribbean and Western
Atlantic.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.440
And now they're down to less
than 300,000 is the estimate.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.250
We don't absolutely know,
because there's not a perfect

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.900
annual turtle census.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.100
But this is massive orders
of magnitude.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.130
So sort of post-Columbus surveys
coming in say that

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.310
green turtles were just
everywhere as far as the eye

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.620
could see, similar to what you
think about as cod up on the

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.740
East Coast or some
of the salmon

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.950
fisheries you have here.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.410
Just massive quantities.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.440
But the big problem with
green turtles is they

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.870
taste really good.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.170
Green turtles eat sea grass.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.510
They're the only fully
herbivorous sea turtle.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.700
And they're consumed
by populations

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.450
for hundreds of years.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.670
They're also very easy to keep
alive on colonial ships and

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.760
trading ships.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.420
You simply turn them upside
down and you can keep on

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.830
feeding them and keep them alive
for a very long time.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.400
So green turtle populations were
decimated historically,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.750
and then even in some places
until the present day.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.730
This photo is of a green turtle
on sea grass beds,

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.800
which is where the dominant
green turtle habitat is.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.330
So usually you'll see green
turtles on sea grass beds.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.460
But you'll also see them
at Glover's Reef.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.130
And so it's our second-most
common turtle that we have out

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.420
there in the atoll.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.090
And then, the most iconic turtle
for coral reefs is a

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.240
hawksbill turtle.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.920
And this is a turtle that's also
known-- you'll see turtle

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.370
shells in general are quite
charismatic, but particularly

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.530
the hawksbill shell was used
for turtle jewelry.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.880
And still in some places
today, even though it's

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.140
illegal, is used for
turtle jewelry.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.760
They feed over 90% on sponges.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.200
So they're feeding on
sponges on those

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.065
reefs, those big, barrel--

00:06:32.065 --> 00:06:34.350
They eat all the different
colors and shapes and sizes

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.540
you see on coral reefs.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.840
And their populations as well--
estimates range from

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.510
the sort of pre-contact
populations of half a million

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.570
to 1.5 million in
the Caribbean.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.380
So in order of magnitude,
less than green turtles.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.770
But now they're thinking about
12,000 nesting females of

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.040
hawksbills in the entire
Caribbean right now.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.690
So when you see a hawksbill,
that's a few blocks of the

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.140
city of San Francisco.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.370
12,000 individual female
nesting hawksbills.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.310
So very small population.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.780
But you do see quite a
few at Glover's Reef.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.480
And interestingly, it's a lot
of juveniles that are there.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.170
So it's a quite important
habitat for a life stage.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.350
And it also lets you, as you
see Winnie hugging the

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.530
hawksbill, they don't actually
look too big when you see them

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.360
there, because they can be
close to a little over a

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.480
quarter of a meter when they
first come and arrive.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.820
But primarily being focused
on coral reefs as well.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.790
I didn't mention about green
turtles-- green turtle nesting

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:29.880
is huge in the Caribbean.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.910
Tortuguero in Costa Rica is
maybe a place a lot of people

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.290
have heard of, has historically
been a very

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.130
important nesting ground for
green turtles and has been

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.020
very successful there.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.450
And hawksbills tend to nest in
a lot more sporadic areas.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.980
So even the smallest of islands
in Belize and other

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.920
places in the Caribbean can
be quite important for

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.560
hawksbills.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.580
They nest all over
the Caribbean.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.080
So these are the three species
that you'll see

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.370
when you're out there.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.740
Of course, many other people
know of leatherbacks, olive

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.610
ridleys, Kemp's ridleys.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.020
There's a number of other
species that are out there.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.600
These are the ones
that you see.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.220
And of all of them, the
hawksbill is the most

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.950
threatened out at
Glover's Reef.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.880
And for that reason,
it's a big priority

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.450
for WCS right now.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:16.110
So what makes the turtles
so vulnerable?

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.880
There's the issue of the
historic catch, and I'll talk

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.280
about it in a little bit.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.790
One of them is they have this
life stage that makes them

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.870
incredibly accessible but
incredibly vulnerable.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.690
So we all know of nesting
turtle beaches.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.950
And one of the biggest successes
in the amount of

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.630
effort we put out there
to protect turtles.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.750
This is a turtle nesting in
South Water Caye, just west of

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.730
Glover's Reef, so a little
closer to the mainland.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.830
And it's a hawksbill laying
its eggs in the sand.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.730
But right at that moment of
nesting, there's a number of

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:43.799
different things that
can happen.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:47.700
You can take the turtle and
eat it in some places.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.700
The eggs can be crushed.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.740
The eggs can be predated
on by other animals.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.870
And beaches can be used
for development.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:55.680
Lots of lights can go up.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.810
So the nesting process for
turtles has made them

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.800
incredibly vulnerable.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.940
That explains a lot
of the loss.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.070
Once they get out, as probably
most of you know--

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.460
this is bigger than life
size right here.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.000
So when they first come out,
they're very small.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.560
This is a baby hawksbill
actually off of our program in

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.720
Nicaragua where we protect a
great number of hawksbill

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.820
nesting beaches in the
Pearl Keys on the

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.640
Caribbean coast of Nicaragua.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.250
And a typical clutch will put
out a little over 100 eggs,

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.980
but only about 1% of those will
survive, because as they

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.130
come out in the water, they're
extremely vulnerable.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.790
How many people have been to
turtle nesting beaches and

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.730
seen this either on vacation?

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.840
And then how many people
have seen it on TV?

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.070
OK, right.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.090
So you've all sort of
got a sense of it.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.710
If you haven't seen it, one
of these times when

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:40.830
you're in the tropics--

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.150
and usually you've got to go out
late at night-- it's very

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.780
much worth your while to go
check out a nesting beach and

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.830
see that act of either a turtle
laying their eggs or

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.010
the hatchlings being released.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:53.670
But this second part of their
life stage or wherever you

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.000
[INAUDIBLE] also incredibly
vulnerable.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.750
Not only the getting off the
beach and getting out into the

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.610
ocean, but then they're
essentially floating around in

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:01.980
the middle of the ocean
for a while in

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.130
these convergent zones.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.220
So the Sargasso Sea in the
Atlantic is quite important,

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.300
because a lot of marine life
aggregates there in their

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.620
developmental stages.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.460
And they're just going to float
around there until they

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.270
get to be about 20 or
25 centimeters.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.710
And then they'll swim back to
some feeding grounds where

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.780
they can survive.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:24.290
So you have a very vulnerable
strategy for them as well,

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:29.090
which they're in trouble with
just natural predators.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.350
But then when we bring in human
impacts-- so this is a

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:37.600
historic map of St. George's
Caye in 1764 recreated for a

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.260
publication in the 1960s.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.610
And I'm not sure if you
can read it there.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.910
But on this map of this small
settlement, there was a

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:43.960
trading post--

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.030
are a bunch of turtle corrals,
so places where they brought

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.030
the green turtles in and kept
them until traders came and

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.560
they could sell them.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.550
It's estimated that
for about 200

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.790
years in Belize's history--

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.730
which was British Honduras
at the time--

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.140
turtles was the primary fishery,
the primary marine

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.350
economic engine of the colony,
which is not something that

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.570
even enters our mind today that
sea turtles could be the

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.450
primary driver of economic
activity.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.540
So this historic hunt and
harvest of turtles was a big

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.990
part of the decimation.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.110
And then still in the 1960s,
people were actively and

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.900
legally harvesting in
Belize, in this

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.410
case, loggerhead turtles.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.470
They have a bunch of loggerheads
stashed up, and

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.240
then cleaning out
the carcasses.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.810
Turtles are going to take
anywhere from 30 to 50 years

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:32.730
to have their first clutch.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:36.190
So things that happened in the
'60s, '70s, and '80s are still

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.500
having their impact today.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.990
A one-year commitment
to turtles

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.870
doesn't really mean anything.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.640
A 10-year commitment to turtles
doesn't mean anything.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.370
It's a very long-term commitment
to start seeing the

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.310
results of your actions
take place.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.240
But this historic meat-first
meat harvest.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.110
And then in the Victorian Age,
in the late 1800s, turtles

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:55.580
started to be used
for jewelry.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.270
So the hawksbill shell was
starting to become a prize

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.760
jewelry until fabricated
materials

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.250
started to replace them.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.290
So that played a significant
contribution.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.770
You see some examples of the
hawksbill jewelry, which you

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.630
say, oh yeah, I bought
sunglasses

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.760
that look like that.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:16.330
So the pattern imprint of
hawksbill shells are still in

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.190
our fashion design
sense today.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.730
Or maybe a barrette you have.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.110
Even though, most likely, most
of that that you have now or

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.730
hopefully what you have now,
unless it was passed on from

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.820
grandparents, is not from
hawksbill shells.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.790
But you see the volume of
carapaces that can be

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.620
collected for this
type of trade.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.150
And then also, this is actually
a photo from only the

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.480
last 10 years in Nicaragua where
direct harvesting of

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.040
eggs takes place just to eat
the eggs directly, not to

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.490
raise them up or anything
like that.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:50.180
So a number of different uses of
the shell and the products

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.790
of the turtle.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.250
So we talked about the historic
hunt of sea turtles.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.720
But just to continue to paint a
grimmer and grimmer picture

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.180
for what, frankly, in marine
conservation is something that

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.000
we've done a lot of
good things for.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.120
But it's just important
to recognize

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.770
that this is happening.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.370
Still in the Caribbean, there
are legal hunts of turtles

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.470
going on today.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.160
And then, as I think probably
most of you know, turtles are

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.610
swimming throughout
all the countries.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.070
So a turtle we find in Belize
one year might be over in Cuba

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.230
later on in its life stage.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.930
And it may have been born
in the Windward

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:21.770
Islands in the Caribbean.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.150
So they're moving around
quite a bit.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.020
But these are photos from our
program in Nicaragua where

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:31.200
it's estimated still about
10,000 green turtles are taken

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.210
a year in a traditional harvest,
not for export but

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.440
for meat consumption.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.780
So there's still a great amount
of pressure on sea

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.250
turtles today.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.870
The expression--

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.360
I just thought I would mention
it here, though it's a little

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.500
bit morbid to say it--

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.370
of turning turtle comes from
once you turn a turtle over,

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.760
they can still survive,
obviously,

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.520
for a very long time.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.380
They're still breathing air.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.260
This is how they'd be
transported on ships across

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.400
the ocean for their meat.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.700
They would stay fresh,
but they weren't

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.510
going to be going anywhere.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:03.290
And then finally, like I
mentioned with the loggerheads

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.070
earlier, the issue of bycatch
is something you

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.000
hear quite a bit--

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.570
turtles getting caught
up in shrimp trawls.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.640
Any type of bottom trawl is
catching the same things that

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.680
turtles are eating.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.060
So those are big opportunities
for turtles to be taken up in

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.080
those trawls.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.490
A lot has been done.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.440
Turtle exclusion devices or TEDs
have been innovated to

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.900
try to inhibit the amount of
turtles that are taken up.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.210
But still, as long as you're
fishing on the sea floor,

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.130
there's a good chance
that you could be

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.490
collecting marine turtles.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.550
Sometimes you think about
wildlife conservation or any

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.400
type of conservation, and
there's one major thing you

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.530
have to do.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.160
And you can potentially, if you
do that one major thing

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.970
like create a protected area
or stop the trade in ivory,

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.780
then maybe that's going to make
a significant difference.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.550
And with turtles, there's just
all these different components

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.510
to the threats that have
happened through different

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.490
timelines that are also
happening with different

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:55.770
constituencies.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:59.836
And what I would like to do next
is move towards some of

00:14:59.836 --> 00:15:00.840
the optimism side.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.380
So a lot of this stuff has
happened in the past.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.800
And now there's a patchwork, but
internally, increasingly

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.340
turning into a considerable
amount of effort by WCS of one

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:15.240
of many groups that is out there
helping to save turtles

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.370
and protect turtles.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.620
And a lot of governments that
are out there as well.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.390
And Belize is really an
interesting story and where

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.760
the work we're going to talk
about at the end comes in is

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.850
an interesting time in the
history of protecting turtles,

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:28.990
essentially.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.990
So here's a review that was done
by Piniak and Eckert two

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.790
years ago just looking
at how turtles are

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.220
protected in the Caribbean.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:41.120
The gray areas are complete
protection.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.290
The dotted areas are protected
with some exceptions.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.980
Most of those exceptions are for
traditional or artisanal

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.510
or customary type hunts.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.600
Those could vary from the
Nicaragua case of being

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.690
thousands and thousands of
turtles to only a few turtles

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.460
taken every year in some
jurisdictions.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.660
And then you have, actually,
full legal fisheries still

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.280
happening in some countries
as well.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.570
So even though some parts of
turtle exploitation are

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.010
well-governed and protected,
there's still a patchwork of

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:10.770
management.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.300
And as I mentioned before,
turtles are going to move

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.060
between jurisdictions
quite a lot.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.890
This, by the way, are the
exclusive economic zones of

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.240
countries out to 200 nautical
miles or the halfway point

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.160
between countries if they abutt
each other, as they do

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.130
in the Caribbean.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:32.370
But Belize, in many ways, has
come almost full circle.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.440
It was on the map as under full
protection, because there

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.420
is still the potential for an
exception for customary take,

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.330
although it's not used.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.750
Has come the whole way in terms
of turtle protection,

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.130
such that now, the Fisheries
Department of Belize, who

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.970
you'll be working with when
you're there on the trip, is

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.850
taking care of turtles,
untangling them from gear.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.240
And if anyone ever were to be
harvesting turtles, has a

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.350
relatively robust enforcement
effort out there protecting

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.140
for a number of different
marine things.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.900
So the Fisheries Department of
Belize, the country of Belize

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.970
has come quite a long way from
historically, when that was

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.200
the dominant part of
their economy.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.500
Just to trace it back a little
bit, the first efforts to

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.700
protect turtles in Belize
were in the late '70s.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.920
Under the Wildlife Act, there
was an attempt to protect

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.780
turtles fully.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:24.210
But it conflicted with the
Fisheries Department that was

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.560
trying to have some sort of
catch controls and managing

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.430
the harvest.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.780
So really, for the late '70s all
the way through the '80s,

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.810
there was still ongoing
take-and-harvest of turtles.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.690
Another effort was made in the
early '90s that was a full

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.690
protection of hawksbill
turtles.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.090
If you remember from the
beginning, now we're talking

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.910
only about 12,000 nesting
females today in the Caribbean

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.280
of hawksbill, so extremely
vulnerable.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.630
So a full protection of
hawksbill and then size limits

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.270
for other turtles happened
in the early '90s.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:59.620
And it wasn't until 2002 that
Belize put in the full

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.810
protection for all species
of turtles.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:05.640
But now, I don't know how much
you talk to people who are

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.020
working in conservation, but you
hear about what the real

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.320
law is and then what the reality
is on the ground.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.660
And it's taken quite
a long time.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.980
But now, for the most part,
most turtle harvesting the

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.990
people have heard about
in Belize has stopped.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:21.890
So for three decades, there's
been this slow wrench-down on

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.570
turtle harvesting to the point
where it's quite rare today.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.830
You still have entanglements or
things where they'll need

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.500
to be freed, but there's not a
direct and there isn't too

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.180
much of any sort of black market
activity going on.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.690
Interestingly, Belize, because
it was part of the British

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.270
government when CITES, the
Convention on International

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.730
Trade in Endangered Species,
stopped trade in turtle

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:46.510
exploitation around the world
that was signed in the '70s

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:49.150
when Belize was still
part of the UK.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.750
And so when Belize declared its
independence afterwards,

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.850
there was a sort of a convenient
ignoring of the

00:18:54.850 --> 00:19:00.180
fact that they had signed
it when they

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.200
were part of Britain.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.230
And so it was not actually
in effect until the

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.670
late '80s for Belize.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.920
So the Japanese imports of
hawksbill turtle carapaces and

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.480
turtle products in the '80s
were still spiking quite

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.060
considerably from Belize.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.890
So there's still these pulses
in the '80s while wildlife

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.590
protection measures are trying
to happen on the ground, not

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.180
having the impact
that they have.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.760
But today, turtles are
quite protected.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.310
Belize also leads as one
of the most robust

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.350
marine-protected area
systems on the

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.520
Mesoamerican Barrier Reef.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.140
So this is a map of Belize.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.170
The Barrier Reef is on the
east side right there.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.580
You can see it extending all
the way down from Bacalar

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.530
Chico to Sapodilla Keys.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:41.000
Glover's Reef is just
the offshore atoll.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.140
You can see it's all in green,
meaning it's all part of a

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.310
marine reserve.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.340
And so the government of Belize
not only has been

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.920
protecting turtles but is
increasingly protecting a

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:56.000
number species, setting aside
areas for no fishing zones,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.150
and creating a number
of different places.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:06.330
And just about a month ago,
Turneffe Atoll right here was

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.480
just declared as the newest
marine reserve in Belize.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.660
So the government is continuing
to advance not only

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.530
protection of turtles but the
entire marine ecosystem.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.770
Which when you think about all
those different impacts, is

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.165
what it's going to take
to conserve turtles.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.810
So just a quick background of
WCS in Belize to get us to the

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.510
point where we'll talk
about the trip that

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:29.510
we're thinking about.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:33.270
This is an aerial view of
Glover's Reef atoll where now

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.110
one of our base of
operations is.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.810
WCS has been operating in Belize
since the early 1980s.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.720
And we worked to help declare
some of the first marine

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.190
reserves or the first marine
reserve in Belize--

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.250
Hol Chan Marine Reserve has
since moved on to help manage

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.620
Glover's Reef, South Water
Caye, and to helping the

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.230
government of Belize and a
number of their different

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.350
measures, historically,
to protect

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.010
turtles, to reform fisheries.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.300
We have a large program to work
on shark conservation

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.060
throughout Belize.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.800
So we're doing quite a lot in
Belize to help manage the

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.450
marine environment.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:08.090
Belize, as you probably know,
is a global priority for

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.790
marine conservation, because it
sits on a very biodiverse

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.070
Mesoamerican Barrier Reef.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.280
We have about 20 staff in
country, a lot of them out on

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.715
the station, some of them in
Belize City that you'll meet

00:21:19.715 --> 00:21:23.720
as well, most of them Belizean
who are working to

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.530
conserve the area.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:28.190
Just a few shots of some of the
other things that exist.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.220
So we're talking about turtles,
but other really

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.310
important species and iconic
species that are out there on

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:35.100
the reef as well.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.040
Anyone know what these are?

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:37.995
Gander?

00:21:37.995 --> 00:21:38.390
Failure.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:39.055
No.

00:21:39.055 --> 00:21:40.230
So they're Nassau grouper.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.440
You can tell by this little
spot back here.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.730
And Nassau grouper are
ecologically extinct

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.570
throughout a lot of
the Caribbean.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.590
They have this unfortunate
habit, similar to turtles, of

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.950
coming together at part of their
life stage where they

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:52.810
become really vulnerable.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.260
They come together to spawn.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.720
Historically, fishermen have
decided to put nets around or

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.540
hooks and catch them.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.790
But we do quite a lot throughout
Belize to protect

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.770
Nassau groupers.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.600
And now, all known spawning
aggregations of Nassau

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.350
groupers are protected,
including Northeast Point at

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:10.190
Glover's Reef, which has a big
spawning event in February,

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:11.890
March every year.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.860
Belize has cetaceans like a
number of other countries.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.620
This is actually the
first dive I ever

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.740
took at Glover's Reef.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:21.200
And I turned around and heard
the whistling of a beaked and

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.000
bottlenosed dolphin that
just swam right by.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.260
There's not any exploitation
with these species going on

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.020
right now, so they're safe.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.390
But they do obviously have a
historical legacy in they

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.820
change the dynamic of
the environment.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.910
Elkhorn coral is very
vulnerable.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.950
It's on the endangered species
list in the US because of

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.360
disease and climate impacts.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.560
And it's the main reef-building
coral.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.250
If you see this when you're in
Belize and in the Caribbean in

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:48.010
general, you're quite lucky,
because a lot of stocks have

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:51.350
been decimated in the '90s, and
now they're starting to

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.160
come back as well.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.300
But Elkhorn is one of many
species of coral that is quite

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.735
important and worth thinking
about conserving.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.630
So here's a shot
of Middle Caye.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:05.750
This is the research station
on the north point of the

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.450
island, which is actually
the left side of your

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:08.520
screen right now.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.440
The rest of the island is now
being left to restore its

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.790
natural habitat.

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.130
And there's a trail that goes
around the outside.

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.960
This is where we conduct all of
our research operations as

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.200
well as we host the Fisheries
Department that runs all their

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.760
enforcement patrols from
the station as well.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.000
They have an enforcement tower
as well as a number of

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.430
different equipment in their
boat that they can go out to

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.860
look for violations of
the marine reserve.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:35.100
And you run into them there
as well on your turtle

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.770
monitoring.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:40.340
The station itself has several
dormitories, a galley, the

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.170
Fisheries base classroom.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.090
We are as solar as we
can possibly be.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.900
We have a very large solar
array that basically can

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.080
manage the load when
people are there.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.620
Although we do have backup
generators if the demand is

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.410
really high, if people are using
a lot of electricity.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.500
We also take all of our water's

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:03.200
coming off of the roofs.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.270
The toilets are all compost,
but they smell quite fine.

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:10.630
As much as possible,
we try to be an

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.960
eco-friendly research station.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.140
It's great for our mission, and
it's great for the planet.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.470
It's also the way to
live on islands.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.750
For any of you that have been
on remote islands or out in

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:26.390
the remote desert, it just makes
economic sense as well.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.240
So here's another photo of
the team from last year.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.530
And going in now to talk about
the surveys that you'll be

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.770
doing in Belize or at least some
of your friends will be

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.196
doing in Belize.

00:24:37.196 --> 00:24:39.550
I think a really important
question is to hear why, with

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.400
everything we talked about,
why is it important to be

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.500
conducting these surveys?

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.900
These are the only in-water
surveys for

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.450
marine turtles in Belize.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.810
Right now, if you remember, the
hawksbill, which is the

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.630
dominant species we see out
there, is the most critically

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.720
endangered of all the
turtles in Belize as

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.510
well as in the Caribbean.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:02.450
There's this long life cycle
issue from when they are born

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.420
to when they start having
offspring as well.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.930
So if we don't monitor and
learn about what habitat

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:10.420
they're using, what's happened
to the populations at a number

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.160
of places around the Caribbean,
these species can

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.050
blink out before you necessarily
know it.

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:18.450
And so at this point in time,
while the population levels

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.470
throughout the Caribbean are at
the bottom of their curve,

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.660
we hope, or potentially still
declining, monitoring simply

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.880
the status of a population,
getting a sense of their size,

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.910
how old are they, getting a
sense of their health, their

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.540
use of the reef, do they
use certain parts

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.490
of areas over others?

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.500
Because if they do, maybe we
should have more protections

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.290
there just to make sure there's
no incidental catch.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.850
That type of information
is really critical.

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:43.910
Plus you'll see the Belize
Fisheries Department, some of

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:47.800
our staff, and some of your
students from local schools

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.180
come out building up national
pride around sea turtles and

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.930
about understanding their
biology and their importance

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:55.390
is quite strong as well.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.240
So the sea turtle monitoring
absolutely is a core

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.390
priority for us.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:03.480
And the thing that makes this
trip interesting is we need

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.870
the human power to do it.

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:05.560
We can't do it.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.180
We only have a few staff on
the station, so we need a

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.330
bunch of people out there.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:14.150
As the folks that did it last
year will tell you, it is

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:14.830
difficult work.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.400
It's a lot of work out
there swimming.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.690
But it is what's critical
for us to achieve our

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:21.060
conservation.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.580
So I think I'll just
take a moment here.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.750
This is one of the Belizeans
coming up with a hawksbill.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.520
The basic idea of the turtle
surveys is we transect the

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.140
entire atoll with a number of
different line transects.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.790
And you're looking both for
sightings of turtles and then,

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.260
if possible, you're
capturing turtles.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.920
Not forever, but capturing them
to measure them and to

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.070
take health assessments and a
number of different things.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.890
Obviously, the capture rate is
quite different than the

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:48.580
sighting rate.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.260
And so we're not able
to capture as many

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.880
turtles as we can sight.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.870
And last year, a few of the
volunteers were able to

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.930
capture some, but we're
still able to

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.580
capture 20 or 30 turtles.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:02.750
I guess with this slide up here,
I should ask if someone

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.100
who was here last year maybe
say one or two things about

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.420
the experience out on
the water while

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.040
they were on the trip.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:09.920
Want to go for it?

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.920
AUDIENCE: Basically, the
water is amazing.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.843
So sometimes you'll have really
good visibility, and

00:27:15.843 --> 00:27:21.200
you can actually see the ocean
down to 100-feet deep.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.810
You can see from the boat
down to the bottom.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:25.900
You can see sharks and coral.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.430
So basically, you're
floating along the

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:30.870
top looking for turtles.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:35.170
And if you spot one, you kind
of raise your hand, and you

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:40.450
can wait for one of the
Fisheries guys to come help

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:41.070
you catch it.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.650
Or you can kind of attempt to
free-dive and catch a turtle.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:48.570
But these guys can free-dive
to 75-feet deep, so maybe

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:52.300
that's kind of a little deep
for your average swimmer.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.330
But basically, you got to kind
of sneak up behind them if

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.960
they're sitting on the ground.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.330
Because if they see you,
they'll kind of dart

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:00.300
off and swim away.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.620
So you kind of try to come
up behind them and

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.390
kind of grab them.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:06.500
So these guys right here--

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:07.900
I think they're doing
a relay, because the

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.050
turtle is so far down.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.790
So they would actually grab
it and then pass it off to

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.110
another guy, because they're
holding their breath really

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.450
long and these turtles
are kind of

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:18.406
fighting for their way.

00:28:18.406 --> 00:28:19.590
You want to add something?

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:20.502
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:20.502 --> 00:28:21.865
It's a bit of teamwork.

00:28:21.865 --> 00:28:22.950
Catching the turtles definitely

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.366
takes a bit of teamwork.

00:28:24.366 --> 00:28:27.900
Often, we'd send one person
to go down and--

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.265
as Elaine was saying, you have
to sneak up on them.

00:28:30.265 --> 00:28:33.480
And you can burn a lot of air
waiting until you grab it and

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.660
then hand it off to somebody
else who's maybe a little

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.610
fresher to swim it up
to the surface.

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:40.710
And then there's other people
on the boat who take it from

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:42.790
you as you pull him
out of the water.

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:46.990
And they are ready with tape
measures and things like that

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:49.905
to weigh them and tag them.

00:28:49.905 --> 00:28:51.850
AUDIENCE: But it's pretty
amazing, because once you get

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:55.510
them to the top, we get to do
measurements like how wide

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:59.040
they are, how long they are, and
take little tissue samples

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.330
for them to send back to a lab
and do analysis on them.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:04.930
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: Great.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.390
AUDIENCE: You just have to work
a little bit to focus on

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.320
the task at hand and not get
distracted by all the pretty

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.810
things in the ocean.

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.880
The visibility is ridiculously
good by

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.236
Northern California standards.

00:29:16.236 --> 00:29:16.980
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: Great.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.230
Thanks, guys.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:22.860
Yeah, so we do want to
have a sense of that.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.150
I hope you got that it is some
work as well as fun, but

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:27.090
there's obviously
some wonderful

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:27.850
distractions to have.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:28.820
Did you have a question?

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah, do you
ever use scuba?

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:30.972
Or it's all--

00:29:30.972 --> 00:29:32.840
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: Not for
capturing the turtles.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.480
So we do do scuba for a number
of the different type of

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.760
surveys that we do
and the research

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.210
we do out at Glover's.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.390
But not for this, because
you have to bring

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:42.850
them up to the surface.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.840
So the decompression issues.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.295
Yeah?

00:29:46.295 --> 00:29:48.410
AUDIENCE: How long are they
out of the water?

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:49.910
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:52.150
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: It's about
a half hour that you can

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:52.890
keep them up there.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:56.990
Did you guys have it timed, set
you had to worry about?

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.450
AUDIENCE: I think
Winnie's been--

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:02.390
I don't think we had them
out for half an hour.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:05.800
WINNIE LAM: Well, so,
I have to confess.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.842
I was the weakest swimmer
on the trip.

00:30:08.842 --> 00:30:12.760
And I discovered this pretty
much on Day One.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.550
I was swimming in the transect,
and then the WCS

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:18.890
person on the boat kept telling
me, swim faster, you

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:20.100
got to keep up with the crowd.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.405
So eventually, I just ended up
staying on the boat most of

00:30:22.405 --> 00:30:24.310
the time to do the measurements
and the tissue

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.650
sampling that Elaine
was talking about.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:29.370
But in terms of how long we were
spending, I think it was

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:33.860
probably half an hour for
each kind of excursion.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:37.390
And then we would take the boat
off for a 20-minute ride,

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:39.425
and then we would go off to
another spot, and then we

00:30:39.425 --> 00:30:41.930
would do another survey at that
other spot, et cetera.

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:44.030
So I would say it's probably
a half hour to an

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.070
hour for each stint.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:48.390
AUDIENCE: Then we were in water
and the turtle was out

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:51.580
of the water for maybe, I don't
know, 5 or 10 minutes,

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.510
as long as it takes to weigh
them and measure them and

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.340
sample them and tag them.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.749
WINNIE LAM: Yeah.

00:30:58.749 --> 00:30:59.730
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: Great.

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:03.850
Obviously, the minimum amount
of time as best as possible.

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:06.420
Well, let me go through a
couple more slides here.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.230
So a turtle comes up
to the surface.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:13.710
And if you're lucky, that's you
or your friend who spotted

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.390
the turtle, and they went down
and got it or passed it off.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:18.470
Then there's this measuring of
the carapace, which we used to

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:20.410
be able to get the age
of these turtles.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:22.230
And you see some of them,
again, are quite small,

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:25.400
because Glover's is really an
important area for juvenile

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:31.070
hawksbills and some
adult greens.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:33.800
And then you're there getting
ready to put the turtles back

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.205
in eventually.

00:31:34.205 --> 00:31:36.380
As soon as you got all
the work done, they

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.210
go back in the water.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:41.070
We can put mercury capture tags
on them if they haven't

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.810
been marked before.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:45.070
A lot of these turtles have
spent over a year at Glover's,

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:46.390
particular the hawksbills.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:48.220
So they have already been
tagged, and so we'll just make

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.640
that note in the data set.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.460
I'll keep on taking questions
on the trip

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.610
in a second as well.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:58.020
But as just a quick overview
to give a sense of--

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:01.110
this is Glover's Reef in
a quick schematic form,

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.940
absolutely not Google Earth.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.780
But we're looking at about 50
kilometers long lengthwise,

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.660
and then all the transects
that were swum by

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.070
the team last year.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:13.480
And the blue is the hawksbill
turtle on those pie charts.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.390
And this is the summary, is
the vast majority of the

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:20.410
turtles you're collecting are
hawksbill turtles in blue, and

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.000
then greens, and then
a few loggerheads.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.500
As well as a few unknowns when
the turtles were too far in

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:26.970
the distance out there.

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:29.410
But you see last year we caught
between 70 and 80

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:30.900
turtles, which is
actually a lower

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.540
number than years before.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.690
So hopefully, things do tend to
go up and down as we-- so

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:38.940
we have that maybe we'll see a
few more this year as well.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:42.999 --> 00:32:45.300
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: Yeah.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.130
Some of the statistics that we
do is sort of taking into

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:50.700
account how the data
that's coming in.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.190
And so sometimes, maybe there's
multiple people seeing

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:56.390
the same turtle, so we have to
take into account that sort of

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:58.390
duplication of effort.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:32:59.170
Is that what you were
pointing out?

00:32:59.170 --> 00:32:59.860
Or something different?

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.652
AUDIENCE: We had some problems
getting in line with

00:33:02.652 --> 00:33:03.902
[INAUDIBLE].

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.070
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN:
Oh, I see.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:08.630
Yeah, making sure you're not
running over people's

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:09.650
transects or moving.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:12.430
Yeah.

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:16.100
So just this is not Glover's
Reef, and it's not a mistake.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.470
So this year, we're going to be
purchasing a satellite tag,

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:21.430
so that you can live with your
turtles for long after you

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:22.740
leave Belize.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:26.590
And there's a great website,
seaturtle.org, which is a

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.130
nonprofit in and of itself but
also a coalition of nonprofits

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.400
working on sea turtles.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.530
And they'll publish the results
up on their website,

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:33.990
so you can track your turtle.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:38.280
This is actually a leatherback
from Gabon from a partner

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.500
organization, University
of Exeter, that we

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.640
worked with in Gabon.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.930
And you can see tracking a
turtle all the way across the

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:44.810
Atlantic Ocean.

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:48.280
Your turtles in the Caribbean
most likely will not go all

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.230
the way across the Atlantic,
but we'll see.

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:51.710
So this year, we're going to add
that element, which will

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.990
add a little bit more to the
time in the surface, because

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:57.050
you actually have to fix
on the satellite tag.

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:58.750
We'll have one or two of those,
which would make for

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:02.360
some interesting data
coming out as well.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.980
As well, we're going
to be looking at

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.130
fibropapilloma virus.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:11.500
It's a disease primarily in
green turtles in the Pacific.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.510
It hasn't been investigated
yet in

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:14.889
Belize, so we're going--

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:18.170
WCS as well is running
conservation programs around

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:20.389
the world, also runs
four zoos and an

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:21.770
aquarium in New York City.

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:24.790
And a great side benefit of
that, or a primary benefit, is

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:26.880
we have tremendous veterinary
capacity.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.800
So our chief vet's going to come
down this year and help

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.940
do some health examinations of
the turtles there to see how

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:37.580
healthy they are, what type of
disease they may or may not

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:38.060
have as well.

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.310
So that'll be another thing
keeping some of the turtles

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:42.710
out of the water just a little
bit longer this year but also

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:44.630
add to some more information
we can learn about the

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:48.270
population, particularly for
hawksbills, where we want to

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:51.370
try to mitigate any sort
of impact that's

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:52.790
experiencing them.

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:55.469
So just to close, and then
I'll take on any other

00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:59.160
questions we have, a reminder
is this turtle survey is one

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.500
piece of our efforts
at Glover's Reef.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.090
It's a very important piece.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:04.785
We're doing a lot of other
work at Glover's Reef.

00:35:04.785 --> 00:35:08.660
You will do some transects and
work on corals as well as a

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:10.930
sort of side benefit of this.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:12.830
But we're doing a lot
of work there.

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:16.470
Also, for the turtle work, we
spend a lot of time and effort

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:18.740
in Nicaragua where there's
great mortality of green

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.060
turtles, like I mentioned in
the beginning, still today.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.260
We work to protect hawksbill
beaches in the

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.920
Pearl Keys in Nicaragua.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.150
We work with some partners in
Panama to protect hawksbill

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.840
turtles as well.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.380
And then we have
a set of sites.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.810
We work in the waters of 20
countries around the world.

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:37.080
We have about 250 staff,
mostly nationals of the

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.710
countries, where we're working
on different types of ocean

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:45.350
conservation for coral reefs and
hawksbill turtles in the

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:47.410
Caribbean, western Indian Ocean,
and the Coral Triangle

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:51.330
here, as well as some of the
most important areas for

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:55.460
whales, coastal dolphins,
leatherback turtles in Central

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.160
Africa, as you saw on
that previous image.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.100
So this is a piece
of what we do.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.060
It's a very important piece, but
you're also partnering up

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.730
with an organization that's
doing quite a bit for ocean

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:05.400
conservation.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.190
And so it's an exciting
organization to work for and I

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:11.330
think an exciting organization
to join, at

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:12.720
least on this trip.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.830
So with that, I'll just
take any questions.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:18.090
I sort of threw a lot at
you in 40 minutes about

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:18.770
what's going on.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:21.720
So I'd love to answer any
questions about turtles,

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.000
conservation, or other.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:23.428
Yeah?

00:36:23.428 --> 00:36:25.140
AUDIENCE: I actually
have two questions.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.010
How long are you in
the water per day?

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.255
Because it's like half hour
stations, so is it--

00:36:29.255 --> 00:36:30.380
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: Yeah.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.860
Well, so there's a morning
session and

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.860
an afternoon session.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.920
The morning you will spend
monitoring the turtles, and

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.225
then the afternoon, some
days you have flex.

00:36:39.225 --> 00:36:41.690
So obviously, you're an adult,
so if you decide you don't

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.630
want to go in the water, no
one's going to be whipping you

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.620
and getting you in the water.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:46.970
But several hours
in the mornings.

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:48.410
Is that about what you guys
spent when you were on the

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:48.990
turtle surveys?

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:50.770
But then when you're not in the
water and you're on the

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:52.170
survey, you're in the boat.

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.510
So moving from one transect
to the next.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:56.800
So it's quite a lot of
time in the sun.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.670
And so you see most people
are wearing skin

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:01.940
suits, hats, all that.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.210
You need sunscreen, but you
also want to make sure you

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:07.770
have as much material on
your skin as possible.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:10.460
And then when you're not on
the turtle survey, there's

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.580
other transects that we're doing
for coral health and

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.620
other pieces.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.970
We had talked about, actually,
at lunch, an idea, which is,

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:20.810
we are really good
at conservation.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.940
We're not technical experts in
thinking about how to manage

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.960
information, how to collect
information in the way that

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.650
you guys are.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.590
And so this would be the
second year of this

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:34.150
partnership, provided we have
eight people sign up.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.640
And it would be really great
to think about, well, what

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.680
could you guys bring in terms
of technical capacity and

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.600
thinking about how your
expertise could combine with

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.230
our expertise.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:46.630
And so some people I talked to
about potentially bringing

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:50.220
some underwater cameras to fill
underwater image archives

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.730
or automated image collection or
a range of different ideas.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:55.335
So we'd be really open to
hearing about that either when

00:37:55.335 --> 00:37:57.420
we're on the trip or beforehand
as you're signing

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.900
up, saying, I got a great idea,
and I've got someone I'd

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.680
like to trial it with.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.190
AUDIENCE: And my second
question is--

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:06.625
I was just in Gili, and there's
turtles there as well.

00:38:06.625 --> 00:38:07.240
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN:
In Indonesia?

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.890
And we were told explicitly
by dive masters

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.166
not to touch them.

00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:15.180
Is that just a--

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.480
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: Well, you
should absolutely not touch

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.040
turtles or coral or anything
in the water.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.640
It's better not to touch them.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.640
And so these slides which we've
shown are not a slide

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:29.320
of, hey, you should book a
vacation to Belize, go to a

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.015
hotel, and go grab a turtle.

00:38:32.015 --> 00:38:34.000
If that's the take-home message,
then I should be

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.620
fired and I will be putting in
my application to work at some

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:37.280
other place.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.490
No.

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:40.260
It's a cost benefit of--

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.600
in order to save these species,
which are critically

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.070
endangered, we need to
understand them more, we need

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:48.840
to be protecting them, and we
need to understand if our

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.030
protections are working
or not.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:53.100
Because so far, there's a lot
of decline in populations.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.040
So some of the cost is the
tactile aspect of touching

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.840
these animals, doing
health investments.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.760
None of that is done for just
pure, ha, I wonder type

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.810
science investigations at this
point, because they're so

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.060
threatened.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.800
So by no means should this be
thought of that, yeah, you

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.670
should touch things when
you're on recreation.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:12.720
We do fully believe when you're
in the ocean, you

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.840
shouldn't be touching things.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.100
And if you think about it, the
number of people who are doing

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.200
research is a pretty small
amount of people.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.540
If you take that amount of
touching and then say, all

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:25.410
people that happen to go on a
hotel vacation in the tropics,

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:27.260
your impact magnifies
pretty quickly.

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:30.130
So that was a long way of
saying, no, they're

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.090
right, and I'm wrong.

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:34.340
Other questions?

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:39.940
AUDIENCE: What are the
currents like?

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.180
I assume it's protected since
it's a reef, but--

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.385
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: Well, you
are on the outside and most of

00:39:44.385 --> 00:39:47.680
the transects on the outer
shelf-- and it is pretty much

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.350
a wall in most of the places.

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:51.470
If there's heavy currents-- and
you guys correct me if I'm

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:55.270
wrong if you went out when there
was too heavy currents--

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.900
if conditions are unsafe, we're
not going to have you

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.900
doing surveys.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.500
Because sometimes there
are big seas.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.790
I was just at Glover's in
October, and we had 6- to

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:03.695
8-foot seas.

00:40:03.695 --> 00:40:04.680
And we're scuba diving.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.750
That's quite a lot to
be bobbing around.

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:09.410
So generally, we want
to be doing them in

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:11.790
close-to-flat water.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:14.455
There's a dive master and a boat
captain on the boat that

00:40:14.455 --> 00:40:16.000
would just be making that
call and making

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.860
sure it's not unsafe.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.760
Obviously, currents also mess
with your transects.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.430
So generally, it's
not very good.

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:23.610
Did you guys have much current
when you were--

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:25.940
Yeah.

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:28.360
Incidentally, Glover's is known
as one of the best dive

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.620
spots in the Caribbean
as well.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.590
And that's not because it has
a ripping current that will

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.560
sweep you out into the ocean.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:38.040
It's just got fantastic
wall dives.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.280
Yeah.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:39.953
Yeah?

00:40:39.953 --> 00:40:42.740
AUDIENCE: Do you have tanks of
air or anything [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:43.330
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: Yeah.

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:45.520
We are not a scuba operator.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.390
We're not an eco-tourism
operator there.

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:49.870
But there are great eco-tourism
and scuba outfits

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:54.490
there that we will set people up
with who we've worked with

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:55.160
for a long time.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.090
And they're raising the profile,
so that's absolutely

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:01.600
an option in your time off
when you're not doing the

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.280
turtle surveys.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.870
Well, I've got mixed reports
where either you'll be

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:07.405
extremely exhausted or you'll
have extra energy at the end

00:41:07.405 --> 00:41:07.800
of the day.

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.080
But definitely, you should take
advantage of diving when

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.290
you're down there as well.

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:13.000
And if you don't decide to
go on this trip, going to

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.830
Glover's Reef and signing up
with those resorts to dive on

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:17.450
your own is a great
idea as well.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:18.970
Yup.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:20.350
You're right there
in the middle.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:21.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] so
we can go back again.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:21.620
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: Yeah.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:22.600
You can also book them.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.330
Some people, I don't know
if they took advantage.

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:26.340
But we did say the rain forest
is pretty amazing

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:27.650
in Belize as well.

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:30.960
WCS helped set up the
jaguar reserve there

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.650
a long while ago.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:35.710
And so the rain forest and all
the other sites in Belize are

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:37.004
quite important.

00:41:37.004 --> 00:41:38.220
And the zoo as well.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.165
We've got a vote for
the zoo as well.

00:41:40.165 --> 00:41:41.609
Right after you go
to the Bronx zoo.

00:41:41.609 --> 00:41:42.078
Yes?

00:41:42.078 --> 00:41:43.954
AUDIENCE: What's the fitness
requirement?

00:41:43.954 --> 00:41:46.611
I know you said that a few hours
in the water, but how

00:41:46.611 --> 00:41:47.706
long do we actually
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:47.706 --> 00:41:49.595
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: You should
be a strong swimmer.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:56.015
I think if you're a strong
swimmer, you'll be fine.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.900
So if you're just learning to
swim or if you're not so sure,

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.440
if you couldn't say, yeah,
I'm a strong swimmer--

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.650
I don't mean Olympic swimmer.

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:08.950
But if you just know you could
spend an hour or two in the

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:11.230
ocean no problem, you're fine.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:12.490
But I wouldn't underestimate.

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:15.950
I think we learned a bit is that
you do need to be quite

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:17.870
able to hold your own
in the water.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:20.010
But that being said, there's
also work on

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:21.580
the boats as well.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:24.480
So if you have a question about
that, we could chat

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.374
about it more and
figure it out.

00:42:26.374 --> 00:42:28.759
AUDIENCE: Does WCS have other

00:42:28.759 --> 00:42:31.630
conservation efforts in Belize?

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:34.582
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: Well,
so we work in--

00:42:34.582 --> 00:42:39.640
And just to quickly show you
the Belize map here.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:43.200
We work in South Water Caye,
which is to the west.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.950
And then we have shark
conservation work off of

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:48.540
Gladden Spit and also throughout
the country.

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.830
We have a number of different
shark conservation projects,

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:53.240
particularly Lighthouse Reef.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.600
I thought it would be easy
to go back, but it's

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.120
taking a long time.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:00.800
So just to quickly show you, so
we work in Glover's South

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.390
Water Caye.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:04.906
These two make up about 33%
of the affected areas.

00:43:04.906 --> 00:43:07.136
Lighthouse for shark tagging.

00:43:07.136 --> 00:43:10.015
And then we do have some shark
research going for a number of

00:43:10.015 --> 00:43:11.520
different places as well.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.480
We do not have current
terrestrial projects right

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.120
now, if that's what
you're asking.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:16.490
Yeah?

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:17.909
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:17.909 --> 00:43:21.220
question, but is there an
internet connection from where

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:22.166
we would based?

00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:23.545
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: I
don't know why you

00:43:23.545 --> 00:43:24.795
would ask that question.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.200
I need to make a joke
about last year.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:33.200
Last year we had our
presentation here, and our

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.240
computer didn't work for like
half of the presentation.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.210
It was like, of all
the places!

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:39.940
There's Wi-Fi, and it apparently
worked quite well.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:43.320
I think you can do everything
you need to do.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.000
You're not going to be able to
stream video, but there's

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.260
Wi-Fi at the station itself.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.660
So in the evenings, a lot of
people use their computers and

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.510
do what they need to do.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.895
Sorry.

00:43:51.895 --> 00:43:53.726
AUDIENCE: Sorry, the question
was related to what you said

00:43:53.726 --> 00:43:56.136
earlier on that you were asking
about people who could

00:43:56.136 --> 00:43:59.028
use their skill sets and people
who could use data

00:43:59.028 --> 00:43:59.510
skill sets.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:00.956
Would they be able to do
it from the island?

00:44:00.956 --> 00:44:02.402
Or would it be before
or after?

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.730
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: It's a big
issue for us to figure out

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:07.930
how to better manage our data.

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:11.160
People were asking about, when
are we done with all the

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.040
results from last year?

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.250
And we're still working
on the processing.

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:16.820
A lot of it's just capacity,
but we could start the

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.360
conversation before.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.030
But I think when you're
there, you'll be--

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:22.560
Robin Coleman is our Assistant
Country Director, and she's

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.080
the scientific PI on this.

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.740
She would be there to talk you
through, OK, this is how we

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:28.390
manage our data.

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:30.270
And if you had ideas or
if anyone [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:32.740
trip ideas about how to improve
that, make it more

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.510
accessible, get it out,
we'd love them.

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:38.450
Like I said, we're focused on
the conservation, and there's

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:40.550
a lot of areas we can improve
on that side.

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:41.500
So absolutely.

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.686
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] your
contact information and

00:44:43.686 --> 00:44:44.614
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:44.614 --> 00:44:45.542
discussions.

00:44:45.542 --> 00:44:47.030
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: Yeah.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:48.370
I left a few brochures
up here.

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:51.560
One just with the what we do for
oceans generally, one on

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.880
our Belize program generally,
so you can get a bit more

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.040
background idea.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.950
And there's a sign-up sheet,
which you don't really need,

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:59.450
because you can use the email
that was sent to you and the

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:00.440
website and all that.

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.090
But if you feel like signing
up just to get more

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:04.880
information, we'll make sure we
kick out some more to you.

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.120
Yeah?

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.120
AUDIENCE: How well are
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.120
protected?

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:12.620
Is there a lot of illegal
fishing or shark finning

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:14.620
pressures or anything
like that?

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.820
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: So most
of the marine reserves in

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:20.850
Belize, the areas that are part
of the marine reserves,

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:23.540
almost all the shark fishing
has been effectively

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:26.370
controlled through a lot of
intense investment and

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:27.070
enforcement.

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:29.270
However, it is still
legal to fish shark

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:30.800
outside of the reserves.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.100
Within the reserve itself-- so
if this is a marine reserve,

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.080
only a portion, I believe,
is a true no-take zone.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.380
So in Glover's Reef, it's the
southern portion of the reef

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:43.490
that is a no-take zone where
there's no fishing whatsoever.

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:45.360
And then a smaller portion which
is absolute wilderness,

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:48.190
which is pretty rare
in the ocean.

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:49.970
Enforcement varies per area.

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:52.330
So we've been working at
Glover's for a while, and I

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:54.800
would say I am very biased.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.210
But if you trust me and I say
I'm being objective, our

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:59.700
enforcement numbers are very
strong in terms of compliance

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:00.960
at Glover's Reef right now.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.510
We've just moved to South
Water Caye, which is the

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:06.970
biggest reserve in Belize and
has a very large no-take zone.

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:09.000
And the Fisheries Department is
saying, we need help with

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.520
enforcement, we know there's
infractions.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:13.480
And we're trying to figure out
solutions to help them and

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.190
putting more resources
into South Water.

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:20.590
So it's not perfect, but some
areas are quite well enforced.

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:23.910
Most of what you see on there as
a marine reserve has people

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:25.400
on the ground or in the
water that are out

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.740
there, are able to.

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.400
It's a matter of if they
have enough people.

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:30.570
Yeah?

00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:32.305
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:32.305 --> 00:46:35.746
you said earlier, the
surrounding areas were very

00:46:35.746 --> 00:46:37.983
dependent on turtle
harvesting.

00:46:37.983 --> 00:46:41.200
Has that changed?

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.620
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN:
Historically, Belize before it

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:47.430
was Belize, when it was British
Honduras, as a colony,

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:50.200
the turtle fishery was the
dominant fishery for several

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:50.880
hundred years.

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.620
It was the most lucrative and
the biggest thing that was out

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.700
there, which says something
about the relative size of the

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.670
colony but also the abundance
of turtles at that time when

00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:59.670
you're talking several
orders of magnitude.

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:03.090
Today, turtles are worth
a lot for eco-tourism.

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:06.270
They're not worth anything in
terms of financial resources.

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:08.610
In other countries like
Nicaragua, people are selling

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:12.070
green turtles on the local
market, 100% for meat

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.670
for $25, $35 each.

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:15.540
So there's a small

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.700
micro-economic dependence there.

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.120
In reality, it's actually more
of a protein dependence,

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.320
because 10,000 turtles is
quite a lot of meat.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:27.030
But as a driver of trade, CITES,
the regime I mentioned

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:30.230
previously, has effectively
banned most turtle trade for

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:32.260
the shell or for the meat.

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.790
So now, if you looked
at analysis--

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:36.110
I'm sure there are
some out there--

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:38.640
the value of turtles is
tremendously larger in terms

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.680
of just scuba diving and
people seeing them.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.550
But not anymore.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:45.460
Fisheries are still
quite valuable.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:49.077
And shark, as you mentioned,
shark fin is quite valuable in

00:47:49.077 --> 00:47:50.860
the places that don't
protect shark.

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:54.860
There's a lot of money coming
in for the fin in Belize and

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:57.480
everywhere in the world.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:01.070
AUDIENCE: Will you still be
doing the lionfish surveys?

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:03.250
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: The
lionfish surveys will be part

00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:04.200
of the coral transects.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.560
I think we're deciding what
we want to include in the

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.440
non-turtle transects.

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.880
So that's still up in the air,
and we're deciding exactly

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.210
what that will be.

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:15.500
So yeah.

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.300
The other half, when we weren't
surveying turtle last

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:19.850
year, we did lionfish surveys,
because lionfish is an

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:25.050
invasive species that's now
pretty much ubiquitous in the

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:27.170
Caribbean, unfortunately.

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:29.740
It used to be that you saw them
out in Asia and Papua New

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:30.450
Guinea and Fiji.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:32.150
And you thought, this is
amazing, I haven't see a

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:33.440
lionfish, wonderful.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.410
And now that moment is ruined.

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.290
But you also look at them in the
Caribbean and think, oh,

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:43.870
it's just really devastated
the areas.

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:46.260
Other--

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:47.200
This is the last question.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.094
AUDIENCE: Oh!

00:48:48.094 --> 00:48:48.990
[INAUDIBLE] shouldn't
waste it.

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:50.880
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN:
No, waste it!

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.905
AUDIENCE: I just didn't
know why they're

00:48:52.905 --> 00:48:53.620
devastating the area.

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:54.335
Do they eat coral?

00:48:54.335 --> 00:48:56.180
DR. CALEB MCCLENNEN: There's no
known predators right now

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.900
for a lionfish, and they
do eat to survive.

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:03.230
And they eat a lot of smaller
reef fish that you'll see.

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:07.090
And they've only been around
for about 15 years, so the

00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:08.990
impact we don't really
know yet.

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:11.370
But we know that other cases of
an introduced species have

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:14.380
been quite devastating.

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:16.150
We're trying to encourage things
like lionfish hunting.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:18.710
There's a lot of ideas out
there about what to do.

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:22.745
They're here to stay, in
reality, because of currents.

00:49:22.745 --> 00:49:23.290
Great.

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:24.600
Well, thank you so
much, everyone.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.770
Really appreciate the time.

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:28.770
And probably, for any of you
that know more in depth on one

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:29.790
of the topics we covered today,

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:31.230
there's a lot more here.

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:34.190
And I hope some of you anyway
could come or pass the word to

00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:36.790
come to Belize and learn more,
and like a few of you

00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:39.550
indicated, help us think about
ways to advance our

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:41.600
conservation through what
you know about.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:42.720
But great pleasure.

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.220
Thank you.

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:47.130
