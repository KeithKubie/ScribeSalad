00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:02.066
What is space time?

00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.266
You already know.

00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:06.800
You have never met
someone at a place

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.433
unless it was also at a time.

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:10.934
You have never met someone
at a time unless it was--

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:11.800
OK, I get it.
I get it.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.600
So we--

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.033
Whoa, well, wait a minute.

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:19.500
What happens to a photon
from 13 billion 0.800

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.066
million years that comes
this way and enters

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:27.166
my eye so I can see it?

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:31.333
Where's space involved in that?

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:36.900
It entered your eye at a
time and at a place right here.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.867
That's all that matters here.

00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:40.333
Is that all we're saying?

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:43.400
Well, once you have
formalized space and time

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.433
and know that they're
conjoined, then

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:47.500
you can make all kinds of
fascinating calculations

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.567
with relativity.

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:49.600
Well, what is all
that the train's going

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.667
and I'm walking down there.
- Exactly!

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.200
I'm walking down the train.
I'm walking on--

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.133
And the time change.

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.433
And the time is
going to change.

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:55.800
What is all that?

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.233
That's all the consequences
of thinking about space and time

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:00.967
as conjoined.

00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:02.433
But it's confusing.

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:03.300
So?

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.800
And not only is it--

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.834
The universe is under
no obligation to make

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:08.100
sense to William Shatner.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.266
OK?

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.900
No, but William Shatner's
under the obligation

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.100
to make sense of the
universe, as you are doing.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.567
And why do I slow down as I
approach the speed of light?

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:20.333
It doesn't apply to
a photon 13 billion--

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.133
No.

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.333
You want to freak out?

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.734
I don't want your
head to explode.

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:24.834
You ready?
- Yeah.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:25.700
- OK.
- No, you're not ready.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.567
Are you ready?
- No, I'm ready.

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:27.633
I'm ready.
- OK, OK.

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:29.166
The faster you go,
the slower time ticks.

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.433
Say that again.

00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:33.600
The faster you move, the
slower time ticks for you

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.667
as seen by others.

00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:37.600
Right.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.333
As you approach
the speed of light,

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.133
time continues to slow down.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.133
WILLIAM SHATNER: Yes.

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:46.000
At the speed of
light, time stops.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.033
Which means for a photon moving
at the speed of light, when it

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:54.667
is absorbed in
your retina, it is

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:58.934
the same instant it was
emitted at the Big Bang

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:00.800
14 billion years ago.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.867
That's what I thought.

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:04.133
The photon gets emitted.

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:05.266
Bam!

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:07.767
As far as it's concerned,
it is in your eye

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:08.800
in that same instant.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.367
Can we measure that
photon and observe--

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:11.200
Yes!

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.600
WILLIAM SHATNER: --the Big Bang?

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.734
I know that that came from the
Big Bang, and I'm watching it.

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:17.567
And it's taken 13.8
billion years to reach you.

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:20.066
But if you are that
photon, it does

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:22.367
not experience that time delay.

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:23.633
What a great
science fiction story.

00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:24.433
That--

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:25.300
Instantaneous.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.300
[applause]
