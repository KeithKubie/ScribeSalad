00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:10.669
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm here at Google I/O with GoGrid.
And would you please a little bit about yourselves

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:12.230
and you go ahead.
&gt;&gt; SHEEHAN: Sure, I'm Michael Sheehan and

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.250
the technology evangelist for GoGrid.
&gt;&gt; KITAGAWA: And I'm Justin Kitagawa and I'm

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.939
a senior technical product manager at GoGrid.
&gt;&gt; And so, what is GoGrid?

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.770
&gt;&gt; SHEEHAN: GoGrid is a Cloud computing infrastructure
provider. And we provide a variety of traditional

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:38.270
data center type of components like load balancers,
servers, Windows and Linux in storage but

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:46.690
we do it in a Cloud. And so, it's on demand,
dynamically scalable, billable by usage. And

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.960
the really neat thing is that it's all accessed
through a Web browser.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.399
&gt;&gt; And so, what kind of name you guys are
using for the Web client?

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.379
&gt;&gt; KITAGAWA: We use GWT, the GWT to build
our rich internet applications. And so when

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.090
we're building on GoGrid we're going to be
redefining server technology. And we knew

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.569
that we wanted to have a really full-featured
console. And at that time we were looking

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:23.579
at other AJAX applications and we wanted to
kind of push the potential of what we're doing.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:29.990
And so, the idea was to kind of create a thick
client application inside the browser. And

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.249
with GWT we've been able to do that.
&gt;&gt; Was there any technical reasons why you

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:41.979
chose GWT than with other, it got--well, it's
similar but it's not exactly the same--or

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.049
like JavaScript libraries?
&gt;&gt; KITAGAWA: Yeah, so, when we first started

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.389
building it I myself had--I've been building
applications for a really long time and I

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:58.219
had been using a bunch of different toolkits.
And I've used YUI in the past and I've use

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:05.029
Dojo and GWT actually had just come out. And
you run into a lot of obstacles using other

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:10.840
toolkits. Oftentimes what will happen is some
of them are, for instance, like a Scriptaculous,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.890
it's kind of cool animations or something
and so forth. But you really can't do anything

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.480
other than the animations that they give you.
YUI has some amount of functionality that

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:32.000
you can change and tweak but it's a little
bit limited. Dojo, very rich, but it's also

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.950
very unconfigurable. You can really only use
it in the way that they want you to use it.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.500
And, really, if you need to change something
it's very difficult. Even if you know JavaScript

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.200
and you're going to the source code to try
to understand it, it can be a nightmare. There

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.870
are case statements if it's an IE or if it's
Firefox to do something right. And oftentimes

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.320
like even in the demos, we'll go to a demo
and it works great in IE but then you go into

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.600
another browser and it just doesn't work.
And so, the beauty of GWT is in its inter-browser

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:16.170
operability. You can really code it once and
it works across the browsers. I often talk

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.480
about how difficult it is to build an application
like GoGrid inside the browser. We use a lot

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.030
of layers. We need to know exactly where things
are positioned on a screen to be able to position

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.180
and center things properly. And to do that
effectively you need to have a consistent

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:41.280
way to even understand like where it is on
the screen. And using GWT it has really allowed

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.370
us to unlock and I often say this is that
if you dream it or if I dream it we can build

00:03:47.370 --> 00:04:04.110
it with GWT, and so, it's very cool.
&gt;&gt; And so, it seems like you have a lot of

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.550
experience with GWT and JavaScript and is
there anything that you'd like to share other

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.883
in involvements any tips and tricks?
&gt;&gt; KITAGAWA: Yeah, I really liked--there are

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.819
a lot of things within GWT--really the dome
classic I think it is just great. The dome

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:19.100
extraction within GWT and you're just able
to--they have made it in a very clean way

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:26.360
that you're able to essentially really do
anything that a browser is capable of doing.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.840
In my last interview I have spoken of that
preview. And I think that it is also another

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:41.050
untapped, an untapped feature that not a lot
of people use. The history support is also

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.659
really nice as well and just being able to
make sure that the back binding works properly

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:54.789
and so on and so forth.
&gt;&gt; Has the Web community been helping with

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.919
you in, you know?
&gt; KITAGAWA: Definitely. I love the forums

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:03.789
and our teams uses them all the time whenever
there's an issue or a bug or some things more

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:08.669
often than not you can just go up and ask
a question or get a lot of insight in some

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:15.460
of the forums have been really great. The
blog itself is actually really helpful too.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:23.240
I find a lot of helpful links checking periodically,
sometimes even thinking about something. And

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.770
I, in fact, I know that in--last time I was
asked this question, two things that I was

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:36.139
asking about Comet support and Maven integration
it was literally a couple of months later

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.879
that they just started to pop up and some
good legs came on the blog and so.

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:45.009
&gt;&gt; And so, it's like you're looking at the
new features? What new features in the latest

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:54.020
release are you willing to sign over?
&gt;&gt; KITAGAWA: One of the things--GoGrid is

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:01.819
a very rich application and there's a lot
of Tabs and it's very full-featured. And so,

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:08.389
the code separation and being able to split
out the JavaScript code so that it can be

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:14.749
broken up into chunks and then downloaded
kind of on demand that seems to--I'm really

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:21.629
excited about that and we'll definitely make
use of that, also the need of hosting and

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:27.599
so being able to debug in the Web browser
that also looks to be very exciting as well

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:32.150
because right now we kind of have to compile
and browse and you can actually step through

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.210
the code. And so, it will be nice to be able
to do it so that if you see a bug in a particular

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.650
browser you'll be able to kind of clear up.
&gt;&gt; Is there anything else that you'd like

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.729
to add?
&gt;&gt; KITAGAWA: Now, I'd like to thank the team

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:49.629
for keeping on producing a great product.
&gt;&gt; SHEEHAN: And for inviting us to the show.

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:51.069
&gt;&gt; KITAGAWA: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; SHEEHAN: And being in the showcase.

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:53.029
&gt;&gt; Thank you for coming.
&gt;&gt; KITAGAWA: Definitely, and so, thank you

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:58.979
very much.
&gt;&gt; Great, thanks for the good time and that

00:06:58.979 --> 00:06:58.990
you're here with us at Google I/O. Let's go
out.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.456
&gt;&gt; SHEEHAN: Thank you.
