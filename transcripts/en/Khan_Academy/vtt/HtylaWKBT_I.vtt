00:00:00.364 --> 00:00:02.721
- [Voiceover] The graph
above in the ta-plane

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:06.284
approximates the Apollo 8's altitude, a,

00:00:06.284 --> 00:00:10.290
in kilometers, t seconds after lift-off.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.682
Approximately how many
kilometers per second,

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:15.584
how many kilometers per second

00:00:15.584 --> 00:00:19.158
was the Apollo 8 traveling between 156

00:00:19.158 --> 00:00:23.187
and 184 seconds after lift-off?

00:00:23.187 --> 00:00:24.708
Alright, so let's look at this chart.

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:26.879
They're calling it the
ta-plane because our horizontal

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.201
axis is the t-axis measuring time,

00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:31.905
our vertical axis is the a-axis measuring

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:33.822
altitude in kilometers.

00:00:33.822 --> 00:00:35.307
This is time in seconds,

00:00:35.307 --> 00:00:37.547
this is altitude in kilometers.

00:00:37.547 --> 00:00:39.742
Now they wanted to
know, well what was the,

00:00:39.742 --> 00:00:41.600
how many kilometers per second

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.283
was the Apollo 8 traveling between

00:00:43.283 --> 00:00:45.825
156 and 184 seconds.

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:47.577
And they labeled those points for us,

00:00:47.577 --> 00:00:49.946
this right over here,
this right over here,

00:00:49.946 --> 00:00:53.626
this point tell us what was the altitude

00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:57.875
of Apollo 8 at 156 seconds,
you see the 156 seconds

00:00:57.875 --> 00:00:59.396
right over here.

00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:01.741
So our t coordinate I guess you could say

00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:04.864
is 156 and this right over here tells us

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:08.694
the altitude at 184
seconds, it's 96 kilometers.

00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:11.063
At 156 seconds, it's 70 kilometers,

00:01:11.063 --> 00:01:14.058
at 184 seconds, it is 96,

00:01:14.058 --> 00:01:16.636
it is 96 kilometers.

00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:19.641
So if we wanna find,
if we wanna approximate

00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:22.056
how many kilometers per
second was the Apollo 8

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:24.180
traveling between those two points,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.759
well kilometers per
second, we're figuring out

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.336
the rate of change of altitude.

00:01:29.336 --> 00:01:31.379
And we should really be
talking about kilometers

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:35.535
per second in the vertical,
in the vertical direction,

00:01:35.535 --> 00:01:38.320
is I guess what we should
assume if we wanna be

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.339
a little bit more precise.

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:43.313
But that would be just the rate of change

00:01:43.313 --> 00:01:46.018
in altitude, or the rate
of change in altitude

00:01:46.018 --> 00:01:47.516
with respect to time.

00:01:47.516 --> 00:01:49.035
But we can approximate that by finding the

00:01:49.035 --> 00:01:53.493
slope of the line
between these two points.

00:01:53.493 --> 00:01:54.817
So what's the slope of that line?

00:01:54.817 --> 00:01:56.803
Well it's gonna be change in altitude

00:01:56.803 --> 00:01:59.810
over change, over,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.340
over change in time.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.442
So let's see, change in altitude is going

00:02:04.442 --> 00:02:07.645
to be 184 kilometers,
and I can even keep it in

00:02:07.645 --> 00:02:09.908
kilometers or write the units down,

00:02:09.908 --> 00:02:11.499
make it a little bit clearer,

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.762
minus 156 kilometers.

00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:16.178
And then our change in time

00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:19.857
is going to be 96 seconds

00:02:19.857 --> 00:02:22.144
minus 70 seconds.

00:02:22.144 --> 00:02:23.027
So what's that going to be?

00:02:23.027 --> 00:02:27.329
185 minus 156 is...

00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:31.862
that's about 20, let's see, if it was 154

00:02:31.862 --> 00:02:34.927
it would be 30, so this is
going to be 28 kilometers.

00:02:34.927 --> 00:02:37.596
This is gonna be 28 kilometers,

00:02:37.596 --> 00:02:39.501
over, what is this?

00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:41.962
26 seconds.

00:02:41.962 --> 00:02:44.806
Over 26 seconds.

00:02:44.806 --> 00:02:47.522
So this is going to be a little bit more,

00:02:47.522 --> 00:02:49.624
so slightly more, so
28, this is going to be

00:02:49.624 --> 00:02:54.599
28 over 26 kilometers per second.

00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:56.972
So this value right over here, this is

00:02:56.972 --> 00:02:58.807
a little bit more than one.

00:02:58.807 --> 00:03:01.708
One would be 26 over 26, so this is,

00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:03.542
yeah you could view this as one

00:03:03.542 --> 00:03:05.609
and two twenty sixths,

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.024
or you could write this
as one and one thirteenth.

00:03:08.024 --> 00:03:10.752
So a little bit more than
one kilometer per second.

00:03:10.752 --> 00:03:13.167
So let's look at the
choices right over here.

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:14.687
Now you look at the choices here

00:03:14.687 --> 00:03:17.544
and you, only one of 'em is
a little bit more than one.

00:03:17.544 --> 00:03:19.342
This is less than one,
so you rule that out,

00:03:19.342 --> 00:03:21.549
this is a lot more than one,
and a lot more than one,

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:22.988
so we would go,

00:03:22.988 --> 00:03:25.514
we would go with that one right there.
