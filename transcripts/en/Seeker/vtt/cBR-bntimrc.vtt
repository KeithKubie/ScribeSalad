00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
In the past we all thought the future of cooking
would like adding a drop of water to a pill

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.080
and poof a turkey dinner. Well it’s 2015
and the closest we’ve got is a cup of noodles.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.210
So while we scale back our visions of Just
Add Water food pills, what does the future

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.990
of cooking actually look like?

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.990
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.090
For most of human history cooking required
raw ingredients and applied heat, usually

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.439
in the form of fire. And all that peeling
and slicing, to boiling and baking cooking

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.040
took a lot of time. Not to mention just heating
up a pot of water meant heating up the whole

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.690
fire or stove which heated up the whole kitchen
or house. So cooking was laborious and time

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.899
intensive.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.200
Then little inventions like the refrigerator
and microwave changed everything. The countertop

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.370
microwave hit the scene in 1967 and suddenly
dinner could be ready in a matter of minutes.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.020
So it’s been nearly 50 years since then,
so how would a kitchen 50 years from now look?

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.910
The former CTO of Microsoft, Nathan Myhrvold,
came out with a high tech, high price tag

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.320
cookbook of the almost future. Many of the
recipes and suggestions in Modernist Cuisine

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.909
are currently used by chefs in very fancy
kitchens. But they’re mostly out of reach

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.100
for the average joe. But it’s certainly
fascinating look into what happens when a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.710
scientist steps into the kitchen.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.560
The most within-in reach is a recent trend
sweeping cooking in the Western world is sous-vide

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.950
[soo-veed] cooking. This is essentially slow
cooking food by vacuum-sealing it plastic

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.700
bags and placing the bags in a temperature
controlled water bath. When I say slow, I

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.960
mean slow, a few days at least. This keeps
the meat evenly cooked throughout. So it’s

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.060
not over cooked on the outside and undercooked
in the middle, it also keeps the moisture

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.470
in. My old roommates actually used a thing
like this to cook their food sometimes. It

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.470
was pretty tasty.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.360
The book also suggests some tools you’d
more likely see in a scientific lab than in

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.759
a kitchen. homogenizers and centrifuges and
liquid nitrogen. The liquid nitrogen is used

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.950
to cryo-fry meat and vegetables. A quick dunk
in the LN tank before it goes in the frier.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.530
This makes the outside of the food hot and
crisp but doesn’t over cook the middle.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.549
Industrial kitchen sized centrifuges can costs
tens of thousands of dollars which basically

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.620
looks like a typical washing machine. But
instead of a spin cycle for your dirty jeans,

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.379
it can puree peas. If you’ve ever used one
of the table top versions in a lab, you know

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.310
pretty much what a centrifuge can do. It spins
the peas, or whatever so fast that is actually

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.140
separates the different layers of juice, starch,
and fat.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.959
And even the blender, a steady kitchen staple,
gets an update in modernist cooking. A rotor-stator

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.590
homogenizer, again, something you’re used
to in a lab, can suck up your ingredients

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.470
spin them around really fast, and shoot them
back out through holes located in the tip.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.849
Basically, it mixes better and blends food
better and smoother than traditional blenders.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.849
While many of these gadgets already exist
and are used frequently in scientific labs,

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.620
high tech and a high quality chefs are bringing
them into the kitchen. Even writer Corby Kummer

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.209
who reviewed the Modernist Cuisine for the
MIT Technology Review said that he "came away

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.890
convinced that these techniques and ingredients
will be essential for cooks of the future."

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.140
But the modernist cuisine is just one look
into the future. Other companies and organizations

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.190
get all heated up when thinking about the
kitchens of the 21st century and beyond.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.500
Innit®, a new company that manages and connects
food information, are designing what they

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.150
call “the self-driving car of ovens”.
It’s a broiler, baking, convection, and

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.440
microwave oven all in one. The oven knows
what food you’ve put in it and knows exactly

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.989
how long to cook it thanks to built in sensors.
But the sensors don’t stop there.

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.489
Innit envisions a kitchen covered in sensors.
Sensors in your fridge could tell you exactly

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.250
what you have in there, how long it’s been
sitting there, and how to turn those ingredients

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.909
into the perfect meal.

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.930
Even your cutting board will be covered in
sensors. It can tell you how to chop that

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.909
tomato and what sort of recipes will go along
with it. While these inventions could help

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.260
making cooking for people like me a little
easier, they also cut down on waste.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.780
I always leave cucumbers in the back of the
fridge and forget about them for weeks, so

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.170
I wind up throwing them out. But if my fridge
at a sensor on it, it could remind me of food

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.720
that’s been sitting there for a while and
how exactly it’s best to use that food now

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.900
that it’s a little softer than it should
be.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.930
While some of us take our modern kitchens
and even our microwaves for granted, other

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.459
places in the world struggle to have basics
like electricity and still use open fire to

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.019
cook. Be sure to check out our other episode
on Seeker Stories, where we discovered how

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:25.940
constant blackouts and a lack of electricity
in general impacts daily life in Tanzania,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:34.500
and

poverty, visit One.org/energy

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.740
Since all of this fancy kitchen stuff is still
a little far off, for now I’ll stick microwaving

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.960
my mac and cheese. Speaking of microwaves,
how do they cook your food anyways?

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.800
Find out how in this episode, right here.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.130
So what sort of gadget would you like to see
in your kitchen in the future?
