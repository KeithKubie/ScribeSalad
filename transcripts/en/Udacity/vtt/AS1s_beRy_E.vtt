00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.300
So the CCR5 delta 32 allele is a

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.230
Frameshift mutation that causes a severely shortened CCR5

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.980
protein, so dysfunctional that it doesn't even make

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.810
it to the surface of T cells and it's

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.030
not available for HIV to latch onto and

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.640
enter in. Thus it makes these cells resistant

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.470
to HIV infection compared to the normal functioning

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.180
allele. So here's your third question about this scenario.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.870
Which of these two alleles is dominant? Is it

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.520
the normal CCR5 allele or the CCR5 delta 32 with

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.800
the Frameshift mutation? I want you to select the correct

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.010
answer and then justify it in the text box here.
