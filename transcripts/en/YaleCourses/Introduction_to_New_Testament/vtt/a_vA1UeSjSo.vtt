1
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.650
We last week talked about the issue of women and early Christianity and I

2
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:12.960
obviously didn't address all the different texts in early Christianity that are

3
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:16.610
relevant for your discussion last week on women.
Uh,

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.010
but we concentrated on the pastoral epistles first and second Timothy and Titus

5
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.370
as representing one kind of early Christian way of handling women in their early

6
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:27.300
communities and then we talked to the x,

7
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.710
talked about the acts of Paul and Thecla as a very different kind of way to do

8
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:34.260
that.
We're going to shift gears for this week,

9
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.470
this week we'll also have something of a theme about it and the theme this week

10
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.640
is the interpretation of scripture.
How do you interpret texts?

11
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.060
So I'm going to change gear from what could be the basic method I've been using

12
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:54.000
in the class all along,
which is the historical critical method,

13
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.250
which I've talked about sometimes.
Explain to what that is.

14
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.300
We're going to talk about is that the only way for Christians to interpret

15
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:02.040
scripture today?

16
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:07.041
I get into that by talking about the letter to the Hebrews as one very good

17
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.510
example from the first period of Christianity of the interpreter of

18
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:14.220
interpretation of scripture themselves.

19
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.470
This is how Christians themselves interpreted,

20
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.540
interpreted their scripture and the ancient world.
So Hebrews,

21
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:24.360
this will be a lecture on Hebrews to kind of talk about the content of the

22
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:26.130
letter of the Hebrews,
but the main,

23
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.730
it's also used to shift our gears away from a purely historical critical

24
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.540
analysis of scripture and show how ancient people did it themselves.

25
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.140
And then the next class period on Wednesday I want you,
uh,

26
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.320
we'll talk about medieval exit,
Jesus,

27
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.040
late ancient and medieval exit Jesus interpretations of the Bible.

28
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.630
Now I got the feeling last week when I was lecturing about the acts of Paul and

29
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:56.580
Thecla that there are quite a few of you in attendance who perhaps had not

30
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.540
printed out and actually read the acts of Paul and Thecla.

31
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.440
I had a few blank faces and blank eyes when I was bringing up things from that

32
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:05.274
text.

33
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.230
So I know it's going to take work for you actually to download then reading for

34
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:13.410
Wednesday cause it's not your Bible.
Uh,
download it.

35
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.450
I would actually prefer that if you don't carry your computer around and can

36
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.720
read the text because I want you to look at the Teks as we're talking about it

37
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.270
on Wednesday.
Just like I want you to look at Hebrews today,

38
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.440
but printed out if you need to and bring it to class because I will be talking

39
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:31.650
about that.
And this is also your reading for Wednesday is not part of the Bible.

40
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.510
It's from a very,
very,
very important book.
One chapter,

41
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.540
uh,
which you probably should all rush right out and buy.

42
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.800
It's so brilliant and so wonderfully written.
Uh,

43
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.980
I published the book last summer.
It's called pedagogy of the Bible.

44
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.110
And let me just,
I'll set that a little bit of context.

45
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:53.970
What that is is I actually went around and studied 10 different seminaries and

46
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:56.550
divinity schools around the country,
all Protestant seminaries,

47
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.451
but very different.

48
00:02:57.451 --> 00:03:00.400
Some of them were very conservative with conservative denominations and
churches.

49
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.170
Some were very liberal and progressive.

50
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.490
And what I did was I interviewed both professors about 50 professors and about

51
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:07.540
50 students,

52
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.830
most of whom were planning to be ordained into the Ministry of some sort.

53
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.090
So most of these students are people who are studying theology and scripture

54
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.280
precisely because they are.

55
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.280
We'll end up preaching about this and working in churches for most and most of

56
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:24.040
their cases,
and I asked them,
how do you,

57
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.500
how are you taught to study the Bible?

58
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.490
And I reported that material back in the first chapter of that book,

59
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.720
pedagogy of the Bible.
I basically just said,
well,

60
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.840
here's what I found and I of the main thing I found was that almost all these

61
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:40.030
people,
although they were really being taught,

62
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:43.780
they were supposed to be taught how to read this text as a theological document

63
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:44.950
for modern Christians.

64
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.160
They actually are pretty much only being taught historical criticism,

65
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.140
what the text meant in the ancient world,

66
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.080
just like I'm teaching you in this class now.

67
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:56.140
I think that just makes perfect sense for me to use the historical critical

68
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:58.600
method to teach you because this is a secular environment.

69
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.340
I don't assume that you're a Christian.

70
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.930
I don't assume that you're religious at all.

71
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.230
I don't assume that you're coming into this class with the interest of studying

72
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:08.620
the new testament as a document for your faith.
For some of you,

73
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:11.140
that's clearly the case,
but that's not the structure of this course,

74
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.300
as I explained from the very beginning of the semester.

75
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.470
So I use the historical method as the way to introduce you to this material

76
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.700
simply because it's an easy way to introduce modern students to a historical

77
00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:23.200
document as we approach it that way.

78
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:25.150
But I've also said several times in the class,

79
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.010
that's not the only way to read these texts.

80
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.830
And so what we're going to talk about this week is water,

81
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:32.500
other ways to read these texts.
That's what I did in that book.

82
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:36.460
Then the second chapter of that book was a introducing theories of

83
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:40.960
interpretation,
some of which I'll do today,
textual theory,
uh,

84
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:42.100
and interpretation theory.

85
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.280
The third chapter of the book was I think that third chapter was pre modern

86
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:50.590
interpretation of scripture,
which is the chapter that I'm asking you to read.

87
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.660
And that's where I take certain key figures among the church fathers such as

88
00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.460
origin Augustan,
the vulnerable beat,
the venerable be bead,

89
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.190
hard to say in England,
uh,

90
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.300
Bernard of Clairvaux in the Middle Ages and Thomas Aquinas.

91
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.840
And I show how those people read the Bible before the invention of the modern

92
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.950
method of historical criticism.

93
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.210
And I don't just do that because I think it's interesting I'm putting it in that

94
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:23.770
book because I'm trying to advocate in that book how schools should change their

95
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:28.030
curriculum,
how Christian theological schools should change their curriculum.

96
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.820
So they were better teach people who are going to be ministers,

97
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:33.880
how to interpret scripture theologically and not just historically.

98
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.250
So the third chapter is his pre modern stuff.

99
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.510
The Fourth Chapter of that book would,

100
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:41.530
you won't read unless you rush right out and order it from amazon.com and read

101
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:44.590
it on your own time is on theological interpretation.

102
00:05:44.591 --> 00:05:47.750
What does it mean to talk about a theological interpretation of a text?

103
00:05:47.751 --> 00:05:50.500
This is not the same as historical interpretation.
I explained that,

104
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:53.620
I have examples of it and then the last chapter of the book of Fifth Chapter is

105
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:58.621
when I lay out what I would propose as a new for theological education and what

106
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:00.830
the role of scripture should be in that.

107
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.610
I talk about that precisely because I want you to know that when you're reading

108
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:08.090
that chapter for Wednesday,
and I do want you to read it ahead of time,

109
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:09.150
I'm not going to cover everything at the time,

110
00:06:09.151 --> 00:06:11.600
so please read it ahead of time before you come to class on Wednesday.

111
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.830
I'll use examples from it.

112
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.040
You'll realize that that's part of a bigger project that I had,

113
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.640
which was to address the difference between historical interpretation and

114
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:23.100
theological interpretation.
So that's one of the things that the one,

115
00:06:23.101 --> 00:06:25.370
the things I'm going to talk about today is some of this stuff also that you

116
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:28.160
would've gotten in chapter two of that book had I assigned it.

117
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.440
What does the text mean?
How do you ascertain what a text means?

118
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:35.300
We've talked about this a bit already in the course,

119
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:39.140
but we're going to concentrate on today when there are different and even

120
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:43.220
contradictory interpretations of the text,
whether it's the Bible,

121
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.330
the constitution of the United States,
state laws,

122
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.100
a contract in business.

123
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.980
When we have disputes about the interpretation of the text,

124
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.630
how do you settle those disputes to honest people,
both of goodwill,

125
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:57.800
both basically intelligence.

126
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.310
I'll just read the same text and think it means something different.

127
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.630
How do you adjudicate disputes about a text?

128
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.080
Meaning where does a text meaning lie?

129
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.400
Is it with what the author intended the text to mean?

130
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.090
Is it in somehow the literal words that how they will be read by an inch

131
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.020
educated,
intelligent native speaker,
uh,
is our,

132
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.400
our text aloud to have multiple meanings.
Uh,

133
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.730
w what kind of texts are interpreted in what manners?

134
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.780
All of these things are fall under the philosophical,
uh,

135
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.830
field of hermeneutics or hermeneutical theory,
which is just a fancy word,

136
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.450
meaning interpretation,

137
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:43.451
theory and especially the term hermeneutics in theological education means the

138
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:46.880
interpretation of the Bible and how that should be done.

139
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.660
So I talked about one time previously,
adoption is Christology.
Remember this?

140
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.880
And I said there were obviously some early Christians who believe,

141
00:07:56.881 --> 00:08:01.280
not that Jesus had always been divine,
but at some point in his life,

142
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.520
he was adopted by God either at his birth or his baptism or his resurrection.

143
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:07.671
And in fact,

144
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:12.671
I cited Luke three 22 where according to Luke's version of the baptism of Jesus,

145
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.030
a voice comes from heaven,
and at least in some of the manuscripts says,

146
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:20.600
today I have been gotten.
You remember that?
And of course,

147
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:25.601
if that today is a quotation from Psalm from psalm 22 but the person quoting it

148
00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:31.631
is implying that Jesus was adopted by God or forgotten by God at his baptism,

149
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.520
not at his birth or before.
Now,

150
00:08:34.521 --> 00:08:37.280
if you disagreed with that interpretation,

151
00:08:37.281 --> 00:08:39.290
and if you're a good Orthodox Christian,

152
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:43.430
you should disagree with that interpretation because that's not now Christian

153
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.940
Orthodoxy,
Orthodoxy in the way we think of it now.
It didn't exist,
of course,

154
00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:51.290
in the first century,
in a fully defined way,
it took a few centuries to develop.

155
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.010
But at this time,
if you're an Orthodox Christian,
you're not supposed to,

156
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.620
that Jesus was simply adopted by God at his baptism.

157
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.280
So if someone came to you with that reading of that text in the gospel of Luke

158
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.200
arguing for an adoption as Christology,

159
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.080
how would you argue against that interpretation?

160
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.920
You might have argued,
for example,
by saying,
okay,

161
00:09:11.921 --> 00:09:14.170
let's look at how this story is told in say,

162
00:09:14.171 --> 00:09:17.790
the gospel of mark or in other places where that today I had gotten,
used,

163
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.120
not found,
and you'd say,
well,

164
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.850
we're supposed to use mark in order to interpret loop,

165
00:09:21.851 --> 00:09:23.530
but the other pregnancy could just come back and say,
well,

166
00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:25.690
mark didn't include it,
but that's not a denial of it.

167
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.540
And Luke obviously included for some other reason.

168
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.230
So,
and you could also say,
well,
that's probably not what Luke meant,

169
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.610
the author of Luke meant to say,

170
00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:40.590
because Luke seems to have other passages in Luke and acts where it seems he's

171
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:43.950
accepting that Jesus was divine in some sense before his baptism,

172
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:47.130
maybe even at his birth because the angels announced and there's the worship of

173
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:49.470
Jesus that happens then.
So you might say,
well,

174
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.370
we have to look at other parts of Luke in order to interpret this verse and not

175
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:57.570
just take this first,
but they could just come right back and say,
well,
who says,

176
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.170
I mean,
this is the clearest key in Luke of wind.

177
00:10:00.171 --> 00:10:02.820
Precisely a g is actually becomes a son of God,

178
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.340
is not contradicted by anything else in Luke.

179
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.480
So you should take this verse much more heavily than what you're wanting to take

180
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:13.440
it.
One of the ways,
I don't know if I mentioned this before,

181
00:10:13.441 --> 00:10:17.850
is did I talk about how some ancient Christians pointed out that the dove

182
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.330
descends upon Jesus at his baptism in these texts,
right?

183
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.920
And the Greek word for dove is Patty Stada.

184
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.380
Did I talk about this already?
Okay.

185
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.270
I can't remember what I talked about in my different lectures on this and what I

186
00:10:31.271 --> 00:10:32.104
don't.

187
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.093
<v 1>Okay.</v>

188
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.340
<v 0>It's the Greek word for dove.
And that's in the text.</v>

189
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:43.370
When the dove comes down to on Jesus's baptism and some of these creased

190
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:48.750
Christian exigence said,
well,
if you took all the Greek letters here,

191
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:52.770
you don't have Greek letters,
like Hebrew letters have numerical value,
right?

192
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.750
So if you give each of these letters,

193
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.630
it's numerical value and you add them all up,

194
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:02.900
n equals 801 that's proof.

195
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.220
It's right there in the text.
801 right?

196
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.780
You don't know what 801 is.
You don't know your neurology very well.

197
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.500
What if I told you that 801 also is the addition of Alpha because it's obviously

198
00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:23.700
one and what do you think 800 would be?

199
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.260
I'm want to make a guess.

200
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.760
Omega Alpha Plus Omega is 801 and what do we know about Alpha Plus Omega?

201
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.200
That's the nature of God.

202
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.580
That's the numerical value of God and Christ at the end of the book of

203
00:11:41.581 --> 00:11:45.660
revelation.
So they went to revelation.
The last part of revelation where God,

204
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.090
God at one point says it,
and Jesus has says,

205
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.910
I am the Alpha and the Omega,
ah,

206
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:56.960
Alpha Omega equals 801 petty Stada added together equals 801 that proves that

207
00:11:57.761 --> 00:11:58.810
the fullness of God,

208
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:03.811
the Alpha and the Omega came upon Jesus in the form of this dove at his baptism,

209
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.220
numerical textual,
proof of their Christology.

210
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.660
It's right there in the text.
You could say,
but that's not what the text says,

211
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.050
but they can just say,
of course it says it's right there.
Add up the numbers.

212
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:17.884
You idiot.

213
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.050
You see how we would not accept that interpretation of this text,
right?

214
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.040
Because we don't practice that kind of textual interpretation most of the time.

215
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.280
That just sounds too foreign to us.
We just say,
that's not what the text means.

216
00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:31.210
You're just playing with the text.

217
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.520
You're getting these numbers and just you can make numbers mean all kinds of

218
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:36.580
things.
Do you know they're actually a good many people in the modern world,

219
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.400
Christians in the modern world who still do this sort of thing.

220
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:44.710
You can buy a book called Theo Maddix that adds up all the numbers,

221
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.580
all the letters of the Bible in different ways and shows you how different

222
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:52.930
things in the Bible numerically refer to other kinds of prophecy events and all

223
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:53.764
this sort of thing,

224
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.340
so they're a chili religious people now who still practice this form of

225
00:12:57.341 --> 00:13:00.850
interpretation.
How would you argue against that form of interpretation?

226
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.830
If you just want to say,
that's not what the text says,

227
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.380
there's nothing you could do that would basically prove to a person who believes

228
00:13:08.381 --> 00:13:12.250
that,
that that's not what the text says.
You can't just go to mark and say,

229
00:13:12.251 --> 00:13:15.790
but look,
let me read it to you.
Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
That's not what it says,

230
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.490
and they can just say,
no,
you just read it.
Of course it's what it says.

231
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.200
You just read it.
The numbers were there when you read them.
There's no way,

232
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:28.201
just appealing to a text itself can settle disputes about the meaning of a text

233
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.230
unless you and the other person doing the arguing.

234
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.970
Share the basic presuppositions about what counts as a good interpretation and

235
00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:38.680
what doesn't count as a good interpretation.

236
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.800
You have to share assumptions about method of interpretation before you can even

237
00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:46.780
come to an agreement about the meaning of the text.

238
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.880
And what that proves is that the text can't control its own meaning.

239
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.020
The meaning of the text is not contained there in the text is simply to be

240
00:13:56.021 --> 00:13:57.790
passively seen by someone.

241
00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:02.350
You have to interpret it and you have to learn the methods of interpretation

242
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.310
that are appropriate in your society for particular texts.

243
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.410
There's so the,

244
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.990
the fact though is the way ancient people interpreted texts as this example

245
00:14:13.991 --> 00:14:18.991
shows is not the way I've been teaching you in this class to interpret texts.

246
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:24.790
So what we want to do is put our imaginations back what counted for early

247
00:14:24.791 --> 00:14:29.791
Christians as a good interpretation of the text and see what methods they used

248
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.200
and stretch our imaginations a bit more.

249
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.780
It's not hard to do because the new testament writers themselves are repeatedly

250
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.660
interpreting scripture for themselves.
Now remember,

251
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.560
they're the new testament writers aren't interpreting the New Testament as

252
00:14:44.561 --> 00:14:47.230
scripture because they are writing the New Testament.

253
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.540
The New Testament didn't exist yet as scripture,

254
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:54.350
so when we read a Gospel writer who has Jesus interpreting scripture,

255
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.980
the scripture he's interpreting is what Christians would call the Old Testament

256
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.990
or what Jews would call the Hebrew Bible.
For them it was just scripture,

257
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:03.770
Jewish scripture.

258
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.290
That was what that was all the scripture that existed for the earliest

259
00:15:06.291 --> 00:15:07.970
Christians was Jewish scripture,

260
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.600
so when they're interpreting what we today might call the Old Testament,

261
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:12.920
they're not in terms of the New Testament,

262
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.240
but this is great because we have new testament writers who now occupy

263
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:22.190
descriptor for Christians interpreting other scripture that was scripted for

264
00:15:22.191 --> 00:15:26.930
them as we can so we can see how they did it.
Look for example at some,

265
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.490
well,
I've already done that.
I'm not to do that.

266
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.370
Psalm 22 if you want to look at that.

267
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.010
Some point is the song that talks about Jesus's up the Nazi.
I said,

268
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.840
I did it myself.
It's not talking about Jesus.

269
00:15:35.841 --> 00:15:40.841
Psalm 22 in its historical context is talking about King David or some heroic

270
00:15:40.851 --> 00:15:43.010
figure who's suffering a righteous man who suffers,

271
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.850
but it talks about someone's hands and fear,
feet being pierced.

272
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.570
It talks about them dividing his garments and casting lot for his clothes.

273
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:55.280
It talks about a drinking vinegar and gall mixed together or wine.

274
00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:59.210
It sounds like someone being crucified,
and sure enough,

275
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:04.340
early Christians interpreted that song as a prophetic psalm about the

276
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.880
crucifixion of Jesus.
And in fact,
when you see the crucifixion of Jesus,

277
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.700
the different things that happen in the gospel accounts of the crucifixion of

278
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:15.650
Jesus are echoing the things in that song because the later writers said,

279
00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:18.170
well,
the song 22 must be talking about Jesus' crucifixion.

280
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.410
So we'll add details to the account to make it fit.

281
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.500
Psalm 22 but you also,
so in that case,

282
00:16:24.501 --> 00:16:27.530
what you already got his Christian writers,
followers of Jesus,

283
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:32.590
very quickly taking a interpreting the text there holy texts to be not about the

284
00:16:33.891 --> 00:16:37.790
historical Jewish king that the text originally referred to or that we as

285
00:16:37.791 --> 00:16:40.400
historical critics would say,
historical critics would say no.

286
00:16:40.401 --> 00:16:44.450
That psalm 22 was not about Jesus.
It's about some king.
And uh,

287
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.570
the ancient near eastern situation,
centuries before Jesus,

288
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.880
that's not the way the early Christians did it.
They said,
no,

289
00:16:49.881 --> 00:16:50.840
it's gotta be about Jesus.

290
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:55.490
So they're already doing something that modern historical critics within a

291
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.130
reject.
In my lecture next time on medieval excuse,

292
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:03.230
I'm actually going to walk you through some of the basic presuppositions of

293
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:07.610
modern historical critical method that you've been learning in this class.

294
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.430
And I'm going to make it explicit what you've already been learning.

295
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.710
So you'll have the method clear in your head.

296
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.490
And I'm also going to talk about how did this method arise in the modern world

297
00:17:16.491 --> 00:17:18.110
and why did it arise in a modern world.

298
00:17:18.111 --> 00:17:19.220
So we'll talk about that a little bit later,

299
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.640
but let's just look at how new testament writers then interpret texts.

300
00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:23.570
Look at mark 10.

301
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:32.320
This is when some pharisees come and they questioned Jesus about divorce.

302
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:39.350
Is that okay?
In his teaching for a man to divorce his wife?

303
00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:40.184
Now,
of course,

304
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.030
notice it's already put in a patriarchal context cause it's not about how a wife

305
00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:47.920
can divorce her husband or how both of them can go to one another.
We've art.

306
00:17:47.921 --> 00:17:50.820
We're already in a patriarchal context because the question is phrased is,

307
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.250
is that all right for a man to divorce his wife

308
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:59.850
and look at 10 verse three he answered them.
What did Moses Command you?
Ah,

309
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:02.100
that's a good thing.
Let's just look at scripture.

310
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.480
Scripture will probably tell us where the divorce is allowed by gun.
They said,

311
00:18:06.481 --> 00:18:09.720
Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her.

312
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:15.270
So Jesus says,
well,
there's your answer.
No,
that's not what Jesus says.

313
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:19.260
Right?
Jesus said to them,
because of your hardness of heart,

314
00:18:19.261 --> 00:18:22.110
he wrote this commandment for you.
But from the beginning of creation,

315
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.410
God made them male and female.
Well,
that sounds like a quotation.

316
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:30.450
Where's that a quotation from?
I can't hear you.
Thank you.

317
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.330
I'm not asking these questions to hear myself talk.

318
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:38.070
I know there were torical questions.
Just answer them anyway.
Okay,
so that's one,

319
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.340
a quotation from genesis,
but then the next,
for this reason,

320
00:18:41.341 --> 00:18:43.920
a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife.

321
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.570
That's also from say it genesis,

322
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.380
but are these two quotations from the same part of Genesis?
No,

323
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:56.220
they're from two chapter two separate chapters.
So notice what's going on here.

324
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.880
Jesus first says,
what did Moses write?
Which seems to think he's saying,
okay,

325
00:18:59.881 --> 00:19:01.860
we'll just go to scripture and scriptural.
Tell us and it'll,

326
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.590
and it'll give us read scripture like a rule book and it'll tell us where the

327
00:19:04.591 --> 00:19:07.260
divorce is allowed.
Then they quote back,

328
00:19:07.261 --> 00:19:11.640
what is exactly the proper scripture they're quoting Deuteronomy.

329
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.880
Uh,
whereas Deuteronomy 24,

330
00:19:14.881 --> 00:19:18.900
the 24th chapter of Deuteronomy in the law of Moses,
it says,

331
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.780
if a man wants to divorce his wife,
that's fine.
But what he says,

332
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:26.160
he has to give her a written certificate of divorce.
Send her away.

333
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.530
She's free to remarry somebody else.

334
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.310
But if she do is she is divorced from the second husband,

335
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.000
she can't go back and be a joined again to the first husband.
In other words,

336
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.160
the law is you can divorce your wife,

337
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.310
but once you divorced her and she ends up with another guy,

338
00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:45.870
you can't take her back again.
So that was the ruling in the,
in the law of Moses,

339
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.590
they site a text that's actually about divorce.

340
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.190
Jesus doesn't accept that text.
And he basically,

341
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:57.570
his interpretation sets aside that law,
that rule by saying,
oh,

342
00:19:57.571 --> 00:20:00.480
well that was a concession that Moses did for your hardness of heart.

343
00:20:00.481 --> 00:20:01.890
That really wasn't God's will.

344
00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:06.810
God's will on this is seen in a different text and I'll quote you that text.

345
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.890
But where in genesis one and two is divorced,

346
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.050
ever mentioned nowhere.

347
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:18.720
The genesis passage that Jesus quotes here is not about divorce.

348
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.760
It's about marriage.

349
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:27.390
And Genesis doesn't forbid divorce explicitly.
It just says,
you know,

350
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.130
men and women will get together and get married.

351
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:34.050
God made them male and female man to leave his wife and cleave.
It was mental.

352
00:20:34.051 --> 00:20:37.620
He was a parents included to his wife.
There's nothing in genesis.

353
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:42.740
Jesus is basically breaking one of the major rules of textual interpretation of

354
00:20:43.021 --> 00:20:45.930
hermeneutical theory.
That's not only around in the modern world,

355
00:20:45.931 --> 00:20:48.400
but also was around even in the ancient world,
which is

356
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.860
interpret the obscure by reference to the clear.

357
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:55.511
In other words,

358
00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:58.960
if you have a text that you're not clear about the interpretation of it,

359
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:04.650
it's okay in ancient interpretation theory to go to another text that might shed

360
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:09.820
light on that,
uh,
that cloudy text.
But if you've got a text,
it's clear.

361
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.740
Don't go looking for an Emr,

362
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.750
obscure text and try to illuminate the clear text with the obscure text that of

363
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:19.450
course this against common sense,
right?

364
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.820
But that's exactly what Jesus is doing here.

365
00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:27.050
He feels that he has the liberty to basically set aside a clear teaching that

366
00:21:27.431 --> 00:21:32.080
permits divorce and he goes and looks for two other texts that don't say

367
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:36.400
anything about divorce and he uses them to express God's will.

368
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.370
Of course,
what he has to do is add to the text.

369
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.460
He basically has to add to the genesis text that not only is this a teaching

370
00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:43.294
about marriage,

371
00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:48.430
but therefore it is implicitly therefore a teaching against divorce.

372
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.080
Whereas you and I might read that genesis text and not see anything about

373
00:21:53.081 --> 00:21:54.100
divorcing it at all.

374
00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:59.850
So what this shows is Jesus himself is presented as interpreting scripture in

375
00:22:00.701 --> 00:22:05.500
ways that would be completely unacceptable in a modern context to most scholars

376
00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:07.810
of the Bible who are going to say no,

377
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.840
you're breaking several rules about interpretation.

378
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.620
There's all kinds of things on this.
We remember when we talked about Galatians,

379
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:20.130
I read you Paul's interpretation of the Hagar and Sarah Story from Genesis.

380
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.700
Remember how the story goes?
Abraham's married to Sarah,

381
00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.980
but she's not having any children.
She's barren.

382
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.820
At least that's in the ancient world.
It was always the women woman's fault.

383
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.300
It was the woman who was barren,
never the man in come ways of thinking.

384
00:22:34.301 --> 00:22:35.710
Of course we no different than that now,

385
00:22:35.711 --> 00:22:37.900
but they always presented as Sarah was barren.

386
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.910
So Abraham has a child with Hagar,
Sarah's slave.

387
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:48.310
Then Paul,
instead of taking Sarah as representing Judaism,

388
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.720
the Torah,
Moses,
the law,
and Jerusalem,

389
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:57.550
he makes Hagar represent the law,

390
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.290
the current Jewish people and Jerusalem,
Jerusalem of the Jews.

391
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.990
Paul also seemed,

392
00:23:03.991 --> 00:23:08.050
feel free to perfectly free to turn this text of genesis,

393
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:12.310
which seems like simply a historical talk about how did Abraham start having his

394
00:23:12.311 --> 00:23:15.430
descendants,
one through his wife and one through is a slave.

395
00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:20.850
And he flips that around into being an allegory about gentiles and Jews and how

396
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:26.350
non Jews would be taken into Israel and at least some of Israel,

397
00:23:26.351 --> 00:23:30.130
it would be rejected by God and that the law would be put aside.

398
00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:35.440
So Paul also interpret scripture in what ways that seem to us not only very free

399
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.780
but actually rather bizarre in some ways if you're not used to seeing this in

400
00:23:39.781 --> 00:23:43.150
ancient world.
So what we're going to,
let's look at Hebrews now.

401
00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:48.180
Cause what Hebrews is is one extended sermon that is also an interpretation of

402
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:50.204
Jewish scripture.

403
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.600
But what's really odd is that Hebrews is a text that uses interpretation of

404
00:23:56.091 --> 00:24:01.091
Jewish scripture to argue against the superiority of Jewish worship and

405
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:07.640
tradition.
Okay,
first thing,
what is Hebrews and what is it not?

406
00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.600
I said from the very beginning of the semester it was called the epistle to the

407
00:24:11.601 --> 00:24:16.220
Hebrews,
the epistle to the Jews.
And I said,
it's not really either.
It's not a,

408
00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.480
it's not a letter.
In fact,

409
00:24:17.481 --> 00:24:21.650
it even tells you in chapter 13 that it's a sermon of admonition.

410
00:24:21.651 --> 00:24:23.420
It says a speech of encouragement.

411
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:28.070
He says in chapter 13 verse 22 so it's not a letter really.

412
00:24:28.071 --> 00:24:31.640
It has a a letter closing attitude a bit,
but it's not really a letter.

413
00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:36.050
It's a sermon and it even looks like it quite possibly could have been written

414
00:24:36.051 --> 00:24:40.380
to be spoken out loud as a sermon.
It's also not by Paul.
Now.

415
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.650
It doesn't claim to be by Paul,
but some,

416
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.730
some Christians throughout the centuries have assumed it was by Paul and that's

417
00:24:46.731 --> 00:24:50.300
why it's often,
it's included in the Canon after Paul's letters.

418
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:55.160
But notice how Hebrews is a long document and we've noticed that the order of

419
00:24:55.161 --> 00:25:00.161
canonicity in Paul's letters in the New Testament is by length of book.

420
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.450
They didn't follow a chronological order.

421
00:25:02.451 --> 00:25:04.670
They put Romans first because it's the longest.

422
00:25:04.671 --> 00:25:09.260
And then the letters of Paul come in the Canon more or less with some exceptions

423
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:14.240
by length.
So you get to file Lehman as the last of the 13 letters of Paul.

424
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.750
And it's of course very short,
one little page.
But then you have Hebrews,

425
00:25:17.751 --> 00:25:19.790
which is a big book.
Uh,

426
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:23.570
so what's clearly going on is that it sort of got connected up to the letters of

427
00:25:23.571 --> 00:25:26.630
Paul in antiquity,
even though it doesn't claim to be by Paul.

428
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.390
And some people in antiquity thought it was by Paul.
In fact,

429
00:25:29.391 --> 00:25:32.300
some people believe that's how it got into the Canon because it was kind of a

430
00:25:32.301 --> 00:25:34.590
controversial letter in the ancient world.
Uh,

431
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.440
so some people didn't want it in the Canon.

432
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.710
Some people think it got into the Canon precise because some people claimed,

433
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:42.810
oh well it's really by Paul after all.
Who is who,

434
00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.400
who wrote it though of Paul didn't,
there'd been guesses all over the place.

435
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.680
Some people say Luke wrote it,
cause it looks like a very,

436
00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.020
it looks very good Greek.
For example,

437
00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.200
there's some books in the new testament that are really lousy Greek.

438
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:56.210
The book of revelation is lousy Greek.
Yes sir.

439
00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:02.540
Uh,
well sometimes people say it was Luke,

440
00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:06.470
the physician who also was the author of Luke and acts and then also of Hebrews

441
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.290
or some people say it was whoever wrote Luke,

442
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.320
although we don't know who that was so that people have a proposed different

443
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:13.100
theories.

444
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:18.100
But since the pistol to the Hebrews does look like it's has some influence from

445
00:26:18.291 --> 00:26:19.700
Pauline type theology,

446
00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.450
which has led some people to say since Luke was a traveling companion of Paul,

447
00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.920
even if the gospel of Luke was not by Luke,
maybe Luke who is more educated,

448
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:30.560
he's caught a physician in acts.
Maybe he was one who wrote it.

449
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:33.130
So there've been lots of theories.
Uh,

450
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:38.140
some people have said Apollo's cause remember Apollos is called a in acts,

451
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.330
someone who really has a really,
uh,
a good gift of speech.

452
00:26:41.331 --> 00:26:44.790
He's a great rhetorician of policies depicted in acts as a great rhetorician.

453
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.990
Well this is good rhetoric.
So somebody said,

454
00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.050
maybe this is by Apollos just doesn't have his name.

455
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.870
Some people said maybe it's by a Barnabas.
Remember it says it's,

456
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:56.520
it causes a speech of encouragement.
And we're told an acts that Barnabas,

457
00:26:56.521 --> 00:26:59.400
his name was given to him because it means son of encouragement.

458
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.170
So as I'm gonna say,
maybe Barnabas wrote,
uh,

459
00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.030
this and in some people it was asked last week whether a woman may have written

460
00:27:06.031 --> 00:27:09.060
the acts of Paul and Thecla.
And I said,
probably not.

461
00:27:09.061 --> 00:27:12.360
Since there is a second century author who says he knows who wrote it,

462
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:15.510
that's disputed.
But,
uh,
some people would've said,

463
00:27:15.511 --> 00:27:20.370
Prisca may be the author of this letter.
So maybe a woman was actually written.

464
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.790
Maybe a woman has actually written one piece of our new tech summit after all.

465
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.720
But the problem with all these suggestions is that their absolute guesses.

466
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.870
We have no evidence at all,
neither from the letter itself,
uh,

467
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.260
nor from an ancient,
ancient world.
In fact,

468
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.940
the smartest exigent in the ancient world was a church father named origin.

469
00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:42.720
And he said he gave some different guesses about who may have written it.

470
00:27:42.721 --> 00:27:46.440
And then at the end he said,
God knows God knows who the author of Hebrews is.

471
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.350
And God's the only one apparently who knows who wrote Hebrews.

472
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.040
It is a word of encouragement though.
It's a sermon.

473
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.280
It uses Hellenistic Jewish style speech styles and rhetoric and Hellenistic

474
00:27:59.491 --> 00:28:02.520
Jewish exegetical techniques.
In fact,

475
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:07.820
it's an example of a certain kind of Jewish Platonism or popular Platonism

476
00:28:08.101 --> 00:28:11.760
because it contrasts the real and the apparent,

477
00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:17.340
the eternal versus the temporal.
The spiritual is superior,

478
00:28:17.341 --> 00:28:21.520
for example,
to the physical and the shadow.
So you got the,
the,
the,

479
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:25.080
the spiritual is contracted with the shadow of things.

480
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:29.730
All these are dualisms that come up and sort of popular plate Ising rhetoric of

481
00:28:29.731 --> 00:28:34.470
the time now.
So it's clearly,
that doesn't mean it's written by a Jew.
A,

482
00:28:34.471 --> 00:28:34.920
it could,

483
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.630
could have been written by a gentile who just happens to be very well educated

484
00:28:39.631 --> 00:28:44.130
in Jewish scripture and knows has picked up also this Jewish exegetical kind of

485
00:28:44.131 --> 00:28:46.290
technique,
which is why he uses,

486
00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:50.580
I should also say this exegetical technique I'm talking about was not special to

487
00:28:50.581 --> 00:28:53.430
the Jews.
Greeks could read texts like this also.

488
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.970
So there were all kinds of attempts to read homer,
for example,

489
00:28:56.971 --> 00:29:00.990
the Iliad or the Odyssey as allegories for physical science.

490
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.160
The different gods represented air or fire or other elements of the universe.

491
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:08.370
So by the first century when this was,
this speech was composed,

492
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:13.610
this way of interpreting texts was already well known to educate people more

493
00:29:13.681 --> 00:29:18.030
broadly,
not just Jews,
but Jews use it also in reading scripture.
In fact,

494
00:29:18.031 --> 00:29:22.680
the most famous was Phylo of Alexandria who lived a bit before the time of Paul.

495
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:27.840
Um,
while he was around the same time,
but he probably died before Paul died.

496
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:32.430
And phylo has lots and lots of texts in which he interprets the Jewish scripture

497
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.430
through these allegorical kinds of methods among other methods.

498
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.030
I've given you an outline to the letter of Hebrews.

499
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.470
So look at that and I'm going to walk you through it real quick because one of

500
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:45.940
the things you can tell immediately about this text is that it's very carefully

501
00:29:45.941 --> 00:29:48.700
constructed.
If you're just reading through in one sitting,

502
00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:51.940
you might not catch all this.
So I've made the outline and talk you through it.

503
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.410
First.
There's the introduction and the thesis.

504
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:01.150
The verse two verses me.
Get there first.

505
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:02.463
<v 1>Okay.</v>

506
00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.710
<v 0>More.
I wish I knew a new testament song so I would know exactly where to find</v>

507
00:30:08.711 --> 00:30:09.544
Hebrews.

508
00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:11.003
<v 1>Okay.</v>

509
00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.700
<v 0>Okay.
Long ago,</v>

510
00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:19.350
God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the profits.
Okay?

511
00:30:19.351 --> 00:30:22.890
So we know this is going to be about the message of God given through the Jewish

512
00:30:22.891 --> 00:30:23.670
prophets.

513
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.960
But in these last days he has spoken to us by his son whom he appointed heir of

514
00:30:27.961 --> 00:30:30.840
all things through him.
He also created the worlds.

515
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:36.080
So he's going to contrast what was said long ago through the profits with what

516
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.790
we,
followers of Jesus have learned through him.

517
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.680
So already this contrast of things is going on.
That's the,
the,

518
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:47.900
the thesis of the whole speech is the old and the new and the superiority of the

519
00:30:48.331 --> 00:30:52.500
new over the old.
So the next section,

520
00:30:52.501 --> 00:30:56.160
section two on your handout,
the introduction to the superiority of Jesus.

521
00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.890
So the first part is one,

522
00:30:58.891 --> 00:31:03.891
three through to 18 he shows that Jesus is superior to the angels.

523
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:08.310
To what?
Angel.
Did God ever say you are my son.
Oh,

524
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.620
I'll put the in [inaudible].
So he,

525
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:15.830
he takes quotations from the psalms that God is addressing to the Davidic King

526
00:31:16.081 --> 00:31:21.050
in the psalms.
He takes those as being references to Jesus and he sows the G.

527
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:25.050
God never made these kinds of promises,
uh,
to angels.
Therefore,

528
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.960
Jesus appeared angels be He.

529
00:31:27.961 --> 00:31:32.100
And from three one to four 13 Jesus is superior to Moses.

530
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:34.680
So he shows through quoting scripture again,

531
00:31:34.681 --> 00:31:37.110
Jewish scripture that God says things to Jesus,

532
00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:39.510
that he doesn't say to Moses and to Joshua,
of course,

533
00:31:39.511 --> 00:31:41.940
Josh wears just the one who inherited Moses position.

534
00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:46.200
So He's included in this superiority of Jesus to both Moses and Joshua.

535
00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:51.380
And see from four 15 to five 10 gs is superior to the old high priesthood

536
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:56.750
Israelite high priesthood.
Then you've got,
I've put them in bold a dis.

537
00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:00.360
I digression as kind of curses and the main outline,

538
00:32:00.361 --> 00:32:04.770
and these are very important because these are very skillful digressions that

539
00:32:04.771 --> 00:32:08.040
will foreshadow something that's going to come up later in the same sermon.

540
00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:11.160
So this one he talks,
he talks a bit about Mel Kisa deck.

541
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:16.910
And so this little section after five 10 is foreshadowing what we'll see in

542
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:22.350
Roman numeral five down further on your handout.

543
00:32:22.351 --> 00:32:26.160
So the foreshadowing of Melchizedek.
Then you have Roman number three,

544
00:32:26.161 --> 00:32:31.020
which is a digression of that goes from five 11 to six 12 and there you get a

545
00:32:31.021 --> 00:32:34.020
longer digression,
which is an invitation to hire doctrine.
He says,

546
00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:36.210
you need to stop being babies.
You've been drinking milk,

547
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.210
I'm going to give you some meat.
So we're going to go on to higher things.

548
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:42.740
So that's a digression,
which the invitation.
Then there's another uh,

549
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:47.800
foreshadowing dimension of examples of faith at six 12 for shadows what will be

550
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:52.190
in section seven below when he gives a long list of examples of faith from the

551
00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:53.024
Jewish scripture.

552
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.630
Then Roman number for the introduction to the second half of the sermon,

553
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.220
which is our assurances.

554
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.150
We can be assured as followers of Jesus that we have blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

555
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:06.380
So six 13 to six 20 is the introduction to the second half of the sermon.

556
00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:11.690
Then in section five,
Roman numeral five,
Jesus is compared to Mal Kisa deck.

557
00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.870
I'll talk about that a little more detail in minute.
First,

558
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:20.590
a muck Hasidic is superior to Abraham and the Levitical priesthood in chapter

559
00:33:20.661 --> 00:33:24.500
seven one through 14 then be Jesus is himself.

560
00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:29.530
The new melk is a deck seven 15 through seven 28 Roman numeral six,

561
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.970
the reality compared to the shadow.

562
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:36.170
Now this is where you get this thing of the reality is always superior to the

563
00:33:36.171 --> 00:33:40.070
shadow and he makes Jesus and the liturgy,

564
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:43.460
the service,
the worship that Jesus introduces,

565
00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:48.080
superior to the shadow that is the previous Jewish high priesthood and

566
00:33:48.081 --> 00:33:49.070
Tabernacle Liturgy.

567
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.030
So you have a comparison here between earthly and heavenly liturgies.

568
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.660
Then section seven,
this is called para nieces.

569
00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.350
That Greek word just means ethical instruction.

570
00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:05.030
I've introduced this where before when I was talking about James,

571
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:10.010
so this is the paramedical section of the sermon.
Therefore,

572
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.060
he says in chapter 10 19 you should do this.
So you have a,

573
00:34:14.061 --> 00:34:18.140
an introduction to these things.
Be Do this in spite of sufferings.

574
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:22.670
See several examples of faith in chapter 11 chapter 11 is basically a list of

575
00:34:22.671 --> 00:34:25.680
examples of faith and Jewish scripture.
D,
uh,

576
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.120
encouragement chapter chapter 12.
Then practical,

577
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:34.070
detailed para nieces and chapter 13 didn't finally a call to leave the camp

578
00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:37.100
chapter 13 eight through 16 which I'll come back to in a minute.

579
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:40.880
And then in closing admonition and bid addiction,
now notice what you've got.

580
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:43.760
This is a very well structured,

581
00:34:43.761 --> 00:34:48.350
well outlined speech and it even has hints of what's going to come later.

582
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:52.610
So you have four shadows of things and you have reminders of things that are

583
00:34:52.611 --> 00:34:54.290
coming that have come about.

584
00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:56.183
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

585
00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:03.220
<v 0>But the basic point of the letter then is the superiority of Jesus is led,</v>

586
00:35:03.921 --> 00:35:06.620
Tore Ghia.
This is from the Greek word.

587
00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:15.210
This is where we get the English word liturgy and modern English.

588
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.740
It refers to worship services.

589
00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:20.210
So the liturgy of a worship service is what you do.
Do you cross yourself?

590
00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.730
Do you bow?
Do you kneel?
What prayers do you say?
What is your prayer book saying?

591
00:35:23.731 --> 00:35:26.520
That sort of thing.
Those are all literally liturgy and English,

592
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:27.990
but it comes from the Greek word,

593
00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.040
which meant a much had a much broader reference him in any kind of service.
So,

594
00:35:32.041 --> 00:35:32.874
for example,

595
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:38.030
when a rich man gave a bunch of money to a town and they had a big sacrifice in

596
00:35:38.401 --> 00:35:42.000
a parade,
in a festival that was called a liturgy,
electric [inaudible],

597
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.390
it was a service to the gods,
but it was also a service to the town.

598
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:50.120
So these were,
so this comes to mean a broader sense of,

599
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:52.620
of service,
our worship and all that sort of thing.

600
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:56.730
And that's the Greek word that's translated as service.
In fact,

601
00:35:56.731 --> 00:35:59.850
the word lead tore gos the same word,

602
00:35:59.851 --> 00:36:02.490
but with o s on the intimate means a servant.

603
00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.520
And that's what he calls,
um,
uh,

604
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:11.490
angels in Hebrews one seven and one 14.
So angels are called servants.

605
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.460
They're using the same word.
And in most of Hebrews,

606
00:36:14.461 --> 00:36:19.461
therefore I said is a comparison between two liturgies to let Torigian.

607
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:25.110
One is between that of the Moses and the Tabernacle,

608
00:36:25.111 --> 00:36:26.370
as we see in the Hebrew Bible.

609
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.460
And the other is that if Jesus introduced by his priesthood,
and in fact what we,

610
00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:32.910
we have another Greek word.
So you get all this good Greek,

611
00:36:32.911 --> 00:36:37.310
you can use a cocktail parties and impress your friends.
And you know,
make,

612
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:38.820
get new jobs.

613
00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.553
<v 1>Okay.</v>

614
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:45.150
<v 0>You know that the Wall Street banks,
we be really impressed that,
you know,</v>

615
00:36:45.151 --> 00:36:49.380
some Greek words,
right?
The Greek word for comparison is sin.

616
00:36:49.381 --> 00:36:54.210
Crysis as we get,
we don't have,
we have an English word.

617
00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.970
Nope.
We don't have any where that comes from that do we?

618
00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.350
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

619
00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:02.560
<v 0>Syncretic is not as different than synchronous.
So that's the,
it's,</v>

620
00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:06.190
it comes from the Greek word for judgment creases and we get crisis from him,

621
00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.830
which means a judgment or some critical thing happening.

622
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:13.390
And w the Greek word for with,
so when you judge something with something else,

623
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.500
that's a comparison.

624
00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:19.830
So synthesis is a rhetorical term used by ancient education to describe

625
00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:24.340
precisely this kind of speech,
a comparison of one thing to another.

626
00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.060
So if you were a high school boy,
you need to learn rhetorical styles,

627
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:31.720
you would been practice and how to give a synchronicity speech,

628
00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:32.680
a speech of comparison.

629
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:36.220
Sort of like in high school you were taught to do a compare and contrast essay,

630
00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.620
right?
So you're taught a form.
That's what Hebrews is,

631
00:37:39.621 --> 00:37:43.780
is a speech in the synchronous form.
And these two things.
Now notice,

632
00:37:43.781 --> 00:37:48.520
so what the means of demonstration in and look at eight seven,

633
00:37:48.521 --> 00:37:52.300
Hebrews eight seven what is he?
He's going to prove to you that the hearers,

634
00:37:52.301 --> 00:37:55.330
of course you're not gonna need a whole lot of proof because you're already in

635
00:37:55.331 --> 00:37:56.800
this Christian community.

636
00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:59.350
You wouldn't be listening to the sermon if you weren't already a believer.

637
00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:03.910
So He's trying to convince you that what you've got in Jesus is superior to

638
00:38:03.911 --> 00:38:07.720
anything that the Jews could give you.
When it comes to this liturgy,

639
00:38:07.721 --> 00:38:11.620
electric [inaudible].
So eight seven he says,
how do you know what superior for?

640
00:38:11.621 --> 00:38:15.180
If that first covenant had been faultless,
there would've been no need for.

641
00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:17.710
Look for a second one.
And that's very interesting.

642
00:38:17.711 --> 00:38:21.190
Basically he's saying because Christianity exists,

643
00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:24.580
that proves it's superior to Judaism

644
00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:29.140
because otherwise God wouldn't have brought it about.

645
00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:34.000
So the very existence of the second liturgy,
he says the second service,

646
00:38:34.001 --> 00:38:36.730
that is the service,
the initiated by Christ.

647
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:41.330
The very existence is used to prove for this writer that it's superior to what

648
00:38:41.331 --> 00:38:42.400
it supplanting.

649
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:48.130
But the main way he proves though this point is proofs from scripture.

650
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.010
And so we're going to look at a few more of that all the way through here.

651
00:38:51.011 --> 00:38:53.440
He's quoting texts that are from the Hebrew Bible.

652
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:55.540
He's actually quoting them from the Greek Bible.

653
00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:59.540
He probably doesn't read Hebrew according them from Greek translations of of

654
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.040
Hebrew scripture.
But most of them don't talk about the temple.

655
00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:05.560
You might be reading like when he talks about the high priesthood and the way

656
00:39:05.561 --> 00:39:07.420
the temple of the way these structures was,

657
00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.740
cause he even talks about the building.

658
00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.570
He's not talking about the temple in Jerusalem.

659
00:39:10.571 --> 00:39:12.100
He's talking about the tabernacle,

660
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:16.810
the big tent that is described in exodus because that's what the people of

661
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:19.090
Israel are using when they're going through the desert,

662
00:39:19.091 --> 00:39:20.500
before they enter the promised land.

663
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:25.660
They've constructed according to mosaic instructions given to Moses by God

664
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:30.190
exactly how this big tent,
we'll look what,
what materials will have,

665
00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.400
what decorations.
That'll have its structure in different compartments.

666
00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:34.690
And that's what they were.

667
00:39:34.691 --> 00:39:39.510
They believed God Yahweh was living in the camp with them as they wandered

668
00:39:39.511 --> 00:39:40.344
through the desert.

669
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:44.740
So this writer reads the descriptions of the tabernacle given an exodus,

670
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:47.590
and he reads the descriptions of the priesthood,
what they're supposed to wear,

671
00:39:47.591 --> 00:39:49.540
what's supposed to do,
sacrifices.

672
00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:53.290
And he says the real meaning of all that stuff is not at all.

673
00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:57.870
The ancient Israelites wandering around in the desert is talking about us.

674
00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:02.710
It's not about us as the new house of God is the new Tabernacle of God is

675
00:40:02.711 --> 00:40:05.530
talking about Christ priesthood as the new priesthood.

676
00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.660
So everything in the exodus,

677
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.020
he just reads through the Lens of Christ himself.

678
00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:16.080
Christ becomes this lens that all of ancient scripture then can be read through.

679
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:22.350
And so what God says to somebody and knows the author of scripture is not in

680
00:40:22.691 --> 00:40:26.890
Hebrews Moses necessarily,
although he would believe Moses did ride it.

681
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:31.870
He takes the main author of scripture to be God or the Holy Spirit.

682
00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:34.600
He said,
it's called,
um,
the

683
00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.630
well,
and it can even,
you can even refer to Christ in 1126.

684
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.480
Christ can be the speaker in scripture.

685
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:48.780
So God or the Holy Spirit are Christ are the actual authors of this text,

686
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:50.530
even though it had human authors.

687
00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:54.550
So this is one way where he's already showing a very different world from our

688
00:40:54.551 --> 00:40:55.384
modern world.

689
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:59.980
He's not too concerned about what the human author thought or what the human

690
00:40:59.981 --> 00:41:03.190
author intended.
He believes that God's the author of this text.

691
00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:06.400
And so you can figure out God's mind from reading the text itself.

692
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:08.920
So the center God is the author of the text,

693
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.430
this in trouty of Christ as key for scriptural interpretation.

694
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.940
And it's from the very beginning.
He said it in the mirror and the thesis,

695
00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:20.590
we've learned this now through the sun,
not through the profits,
just the profits.

696
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:21.903
Um,

697
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:26.590
so let's look at one particular passage and we'll talk about this briefly and

698
00:41:26.591 --> 00:41:29.770
then I'm going to stop and if I need to come back to this with the beginning of

699
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:32.410
next lecture,
I will,
because there's a few other things I want to cover.

700
00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.410
But look at Chapter Seven.
This is where he talks about this milk,

701
00:41:35.411 --> 00:41:36.290
his index finger,

702
00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:39.903
<v 1>okay.</v>

703
00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:46.680
<v 0>This king [inaudible] of Salem priest of the most high God met Abraham as he was</v>

704
00:41:47.651 --> 00:41:50.680
returning from defeating the kings and blessed him and to him,

705
00:41:50.681 --> 00:41:53.740
Abraham apportioned one 10th of everything.
Okay,

706
00:41:53.741 --> 00:41:56.620
so the basic story is referring back to the genesis account.

707
00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:02.310
Abraham has gone off to liberate some of his kinsmen who had been kidnapped for

708
00:42:03.251 --> 00:42:07.450
ransom.
And so Abraham raises a little army of his own.
He goes off,

709
00:42:07.451 --> 00:42:11.980
he defeats these United kings and he gets his kinsmen.
He gets his slaves,

710
00:42:11.981 --> 00:42:16.390
he gets all he liberates.
Everybody gets the booty,
the plunder of the war,

711
00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:20.620
and he's traveling back home and he comes to this place called Salem,

712
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:25.450
which just happens to be Jerusalem.
You see,

713
00:42:25.451 --> 00:42:27.670
of course Salem means peace,
Shalom.

714
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.320
But this writer's taking it that a deck is the king of Salem and connecting it

715
00:42:32.321 --> 00:42:35.200
to Jerusalem.
Mel Milky.
And so he says,

716
00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.400
so the story is Abraham then gives a tithe,

717
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:43.930
a 10th of the spoils of war to Melchizedek as an offering.

718
00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:45.101
In other words,

719
00:42:45.101 --> 00:42:49.900
Mel Abraham is recognizing Malkin Codec as being a priest of Yahweh,

720
00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.800
and so he's good.
He gives a tithe of the,
as far as a war.

721
00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:59.020
So to him,
Abraham apportioned one 10th of everything.

722
00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.350
His name in the first plane means King of righteousness.

723
00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:06.880
Melek means king and Hebrew.
SEDAC means righteousness.
Now,
as I said,

724
00:43:06.881 --> 00:43:09.460
he's using Greek,
but he must have some kind of word key.

725
00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.820
He knows enough Hebrew that he knows how to interpret this Hebrew word,

726
00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:17.200
milky Melchizedek's to mean King of righteousness.
So he's taking the,

727
00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:22.060
the name as having a hidden meaning.
Next,
he's called the king of Salem.

728
00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.630
Well,
Shalom means peace.
So that means he's also the king of peace.

729
00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.310
So he takes this again without father,
without mother,

730
00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.090
without genealogy,
having neither beginning of days,
nor end of life.

731
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:36.220
So why does he say that?
Well,
no,

732
00:43:36.221 --> 00:43:39.760
because it comes up in the text of genesis without us knowing anything else

733
00:43:39.761 --> 00:43:43.060
about him.
You know how in genesis and the other parts of the Hebrew Bible,

734
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:45.670
it'll say so and so begat so and so begets so and so.

735
00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.200
It tells you everybody's lineage.
It tells you who's everybody's father is,

736
00:43:48.201 --> 00:43:51.600
even their names,
son of so and so is,
is a,

737
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:55.870
a reference to their father,
their and their,
their ancestors.

738
00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:58.840
And he noticed mill kids that it just comes out of the text out of nowhere.

739
00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:00.910
And so he takes that as a sign.

740
00:44:00.911 --> 00:44:04.000
That milk is that it actually had no father or mother.
He sprang out.

741
00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:06.610
I'll talk than us just all on his own.

742
00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:10.540
He has no descendants because they're not mentioned in the text.
Well,

743
00:44:10.541 --> 00:44:15.010
who else comes out with who else is the King of righteousness?

744
00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.210
Who else is the king of peace?

745
00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:19.780
Who else does not have a human father and a human mother in an informal way?

746
00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:24.850
Who else has no genealogy?
Who else,
uh,
has no,
uh,
end of days or end of life?
Well,

747
00:44:24.851 --> 00:44:25.930
Jesus,

748
00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.280
so a deck is simply a foreshadowing.

749
00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:34.860
He's a sign of Jesus.
See how great he is?

750
00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:35.701
Even Abraham,

751
00:44:35.701 --> 00:44:39.630
the patriarch gave him a 10th of the spoils and those descendants of Levi who

752
00:44:39.631 --> 00:44:42.870
received the priestly office have a commandment in the law to collect ties from

753
00:44:42.871 --> 00:44:44.580
the people that is from their kindred.

754
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:46.230
Though these are that there's enough from Abraham,

755
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:50.430
but this man who does not belong to their ancestry milk has a deck,
wasn't a Jew.

756
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:54.210
He's saying he was not part of that lineage of Abraham,

757
00:44:54.211 --> 00:44:57.720
obviously collected ties from Abraham and blessed him who had received the

758
00:44:57.721 --> 00:44:58.230
promise.

759
00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:02.040
It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior and the one

760
00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:05.950
case ties are received by those who are mortal and the other by one of whom it

761
00:45:05.951 --> 00:45:09.750
just testified they lives.
One might even say that Levi himself,

762
00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:14.040
that is the father of the Jewish priests who receive ties,

763
00:45:14.041 --> 00:45:18.240
paid ties through Abraham for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when

764
00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:22.260
[inaudible] met him.
Now let me explain what's going on here.
This one,

765
00:45:22.261 --> 00:45:26.730
besides a little bit of ancient genetic theory,
a little biology,

766
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:30.810
okay.
According to ancient ideas,

767
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:36.380
inside the body of every man are not just little sperm swimming around,

768
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:43.320
but each of those little things is a hum.
Humunculus.
A little person

769
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.983
<v 2>tiny</v>

770
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:50.170
<v 0>in the body of Abraham were millions,</v>

771
00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:52.660
<v 2>teeny tiny bit.
I</v>

772
00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:57.220
<v 0>say like Maddow,
Rachel Maddow on TV.
Don't.</v>

773
00:45:58.530 --> 00:45:59.890
I'm in love with Rachel Maddow.

774
00:45:59.891 --> 00:46:01.270
I didn't know how to start sounding like her butt.

775
00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:06.660
So the ancient gynecological theory was in the side of every man,

776
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.690
at least we're actually every one of his descendants would he would ever have

777
00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:14.560
his sons,
his daughters,
his grandchildren,
his great grandchildren,
his great,

778
00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.670
any of their descendants,
they all exist inside your inside the body.

779
00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:23.560
So Abraham who carried within his own body,
all these tiny,
tiny,
tiny,
tiny,

780
00:46:23.561 --> 00:46:26.950
tiny little Jews,
they would all come out eventually.

781
00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:33.580
Now Levi,
who's the head high priest who then who?
The first priest,

782
00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.040
all Levi's,
descendants at of Levi's body,

783
00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:41.530
they were in Levi's body even when Levi's body was inside Abraham's body.

784
00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.040
So even the Levi priests of the Jews,

785
00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:47.380
we're all sacrificing to milk is a deck.

786
00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:49.720
When Abraham was sacrificing to my kids a deck,

787
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:51.370
because they're all in Abraham's body.

788
00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.490
When Abraham sacrifices to milk is a deck or gives his ties to milk is a deck.

789
00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:58.570
Notice what this is.
The entire Jewish people,
all the Israelites,

790
00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:02.050
whoever existed then and whoever exists,
we're all inside Abraham's body.

791
00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:06.010
So they all ties to milk is a now Kiradech wasn't a Jew.

792
00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:12.040
This prove.
And so then he says,
notice how mckissick also blesses Abraham.
Well,

793
00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:16.210
if you're blessed by one,
you're not blessed by someone who's inferior to you.

794
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:17.380
You're blessed by the Bishop.

795
00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.980
So when the bishop that proves the bishop superiority by blessing you in the

796
00:47:20.981 --> 00:47:24.310
first place,
so that proves that no kids,
that it was superior to Abraham.

797
00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:29.730
And then w when Abraham gave ties to Mick is a deck and Levi in body was there

798
00:47:29.931 --> 00:47:31.330
for tithing to milk is the deck.

799
00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:36.450
This proves that the Jewish priesthood itself recognizes the superiority of

800
00:47:36.551 --> 00:47:41.440
milk,
his index priesthood.
Wonderful old proof from scripture.

801
00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:43.203
Right?

802
00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:49.020
Next time I'll start my lecture by finishing up the how the letter of Hebrews

803
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.390
ends book.

804
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:54.950
And then we'll set that aside as an example of ancient scriptural exegesis,

805
00:47:54.951 --> 00:47:55.784
Jesus by Christians.

806
00:47:56.230 --> 00:48:00.130
And then I want you to read the chapter online cause that we'll talk about then

807
00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:03.850
later Christian x Jesus of scripture up until the medieval period.
