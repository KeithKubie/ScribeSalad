00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.970
Incremental Auth is a feature of
Google+ sign-in that allows you

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.370
to ask users for
permissions, as you need to.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.290
Users who are new
to your app may

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.920
hesitate when being asked to
grant multiple permissions up

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.710
front.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.610
However, if they see these
requests, when it makes sense,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.140
they can better understand
how their data will be used.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.250
Asking for consent
in context may reduce

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.660
friction, lead to more completed
sign-ins, and a more engaged

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.610
audience.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.360
Take a look at 8tracks.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.210
When I first signed in, I was
asked for only the permissions

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.130
they need to get me started.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.600
Now that I've found out that
they can recommend music

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.740
based on my favorite YouTube
channels, when they ask me

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.420
for permission to access
YouTube, it makes sense.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.170
Before I know it, I'm listening
to music recommended to me

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.649
by 8tracks, and it
couldn't be easier.

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.190
Check out our
developer docs to learn

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.570
how simple it is add
Incremental Auths to your apps.
