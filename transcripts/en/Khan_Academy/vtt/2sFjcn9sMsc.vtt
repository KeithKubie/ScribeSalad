00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.393
- [Instructor] When you first learn about

00:00:01.393 --> 00:00:03.679
the Constitutional Convention in 1787

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:05.617
and the debates and the compromises,

00:00:05.617 --> 00:00:07.320
it's easy to assume that, okay,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.147
that's interesting from a
historical point of view,

00:00:10.147 --> 00:00:12.256
but how does it affect me today?

00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:15.127
Well the simple answer is,
it affects you incredibly,

00:00:15.127 --> 00:00:18.526
those compromises that were
made over 200 years ago.

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:19.939
So the most obvious question is,

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.459
well what were those compromises?

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:25.393
Well, to even start to
appreciate the compromises,

00:00:25.393 --> 00:00:28.506
let's start with this
picture, or this chart,

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:32.284
of the census in 1790, so it
gives a pretty good snapshot

00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:34.812
of what the United States looked like

00:00:34.812 --> 00:00:37.500
after the Constitution was ratified.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.831
So, as you can see, the
population as a whole

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.826
was much smaller than it is today,

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:44.443
it was roughly, a little
under four million people,

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:47.392
today the United States is
over 300 million people,

00:00:47.392 --> 00:00:49.154
and then you also see a pretty big

00:00:49.154 --> 00:00:51.478
population difference between the states.

00:00:51.478 --> 00:00:53.226
You have big states, like Virginia,

00:00:53.226 --> 00:00:55.747
which, at the time, had 750,000 people,

00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:58.275
and then you had small
states like Delaware,

00:00:58.275 --> 00:01:01.694
that had 60,000 people,
or you have Rhode Island,

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:04.435
that has a little under 70,000 people.

00:01:04.435 --> 00:01:06.597
And so you can imagine, the Virginians,

00:01:06.597 --> 00:01:08.511
or the people from
Massachusetts might have said,

00:01:08.511 --> 00:01:11.790
hey we want representation
in the legislative,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.277
in Congress, to be based on population.

00:01:14.277 --> 00:01:16.049
It should be, you know,
we have a lot of people,

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.387
we should get more of a say,

00:01:17.387 --> 00:01:19.746
while someone from, say, Delaware,

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.362
might say, wait, hold on a second,

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:22.581
under the Articles of Confederation

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.159
we were a sovereign state, we don't wanna

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.443
just become, you know, do
whatever the Virginians

00:01:26.443 --> 00:01:28.797
or the people from Massachusetts wanna do,

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:30.928
we wanna have a more equal say,

00:01:30.928 --> 00:01:32.782
and of course, the big
state folks would have said,

00:01:32.782 --> 00:01:35.349
whoa, no, then your population,
people in your population,

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:38.396
in your state, are going
to be overrepresented.

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:40.584
And so this was a serious debate,

00:01:40.584 --> 00:01:45.344
and it resulted in what is
called the Great Compromise.

00:01:45.344 --> 00:01:47.817
The Great Compromise, which is probably

00:01:47.817 --> 00:01:51.807
the most cited compromise coming
out of the US Constitution.

00:01:51.807 --> 00:01:55.113
And it's the notion of, okay,
well let's have it both ways.

00:01:55.113 --> 00:01:57.722
In the legislative,
let's create two houses,

00:01:57.722 --> 00:02:00.860
let's do one house that
is based on population,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.803
so the House of Representatives,

00:02:03.803 --> 00:02:07.213
where Virginia will get more
representation than a Delaware,

00:02:07.213 --> 00:02:10.382
but let's make another
house called the Senate,

00:02:10.382 --> 00:02:12.969
where every state has
equal representation,

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.969
where you have two senators per state.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.396
And to appreciate that this is,

00:02:17.396 --> 00:02:20.193
even today, a controversial thing,

00:02:20.193 --> 00:02:24.360
here is an article from the
New York Times, from 2013.

00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:28.262
This is an article that's
talking about perceived

00:02:28.262 --> 00:02:31.807
inequalities of per
person federal funding,

00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:33.790
and it says, and the
article is literally named,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.836
'Big State, Small State,'
"Vermont's 625,000 residents

00:02:37.836 --> 00:02:39.996
"have two United States senators,

00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:42.437
"and so do New York's 19 million.

00:02:42.437 --> 00:02:45.371
"that means that a Vermonter
has 30 times the voting power

00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:48.187
"in the Senate of a New Yorker
just over the state line,

00:02:48.187 --> 00:02:51.799
"the biggest inequality
between two adjacent states.

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.440
"The nation's largest gap,
between Wyoming and California,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.187
"is more than double that."

00:02:57.187 --> 00:02:59.476
So they're making the argument
that, at least in the Senate,

00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:03.023
a person in Vermont has 30
times the representation

00:03:03.023 --> 00:03:04.961
as a person in New York,

00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:06.672
and if you compare Wyoming and California,

00:03:06.672 --> 00:03:08.866
it's a factor of 60.

00:03:08.866 --> 00:03:11.539
And they say, "The difference
reflects the growing disparity

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.994
"in their citizens' voting
power, and it is not an anomaly.

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:17.650
"The Constitution has
always given residents

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.159
"of states with small populations a lift."

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.607
So this is coming straight
out of the Great Compromise,

00:03:22.607 --> 00:03:24.565
"but the size and importance of the gap

00:03:24.565 --> 00:03:27.489
"has grown markedly in recent decades,

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.938
"in ways the framers
probably never anticipated."

00:03:30.938 --> 00:03:33.043
So you can imagine, this
is the New York Times,

00:03:33.043 --> 00:03:34.978
so they probably might favor a little bit

00:03:34.978 --> 00:03:37.445
more representation for New Yorkers,

00:03:37.445 --> 00:03:39.942
but it's an interesting
thing to think about.

00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:42.421
The Constitution was
written over 200 years ago.

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.680
Could they have predicted
how much the United States

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.222
would grow, or get a
movement to the cities,

00:03:47.222 --> 00:03:48.947
even in that census of 1790,

00:03:48.947 --> 00:03:51.221
we saw a factor of a little more than 10

00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:54.715
between a Virginia and,
say, a Rhode Island,

00:03:54.715 --> 00:03:56.789
but now we're talking about a factor of 60

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:59.148
between California and Wyoming.

00:03:59.148 --> 00:04:00.326
There's no right answer, here,

00:04:00.326 --> 00:04:02.307
but it is something very
interesting to think about

00:04:02.307 --> 00:04:03.796
and as you can see, it's
something that people

00:04:03.796 --> 00:04:06.397
are even talking about today.

00:04:06.397 --> 00:04:08.166
Now, the other significant compromise

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:10.663
that is also talked a
lot about, these days,

00:04:10.663 --> 00:04:13.913
is the notion of the electoral college.

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.756
So, people who are more in
the anti-Federalist camp,

00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:20.545
they were more in favor of
a participatory democracy,

00:04:20.545 --> 00:04:23.177
a direct democracy, where
you have one person one vote,

00:04:23.177 --> 00:04:25.446
and whoever gets the majority
of the vote in the country,

00:04:25.446 --> 00:04:27.933
well, maybe they should be president.

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:30.468
But Federalists, especially
folks like James Madison,

00:04:30.468 --> 00:04:32.750
they were a little suspicious
of just the crowd voting

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.053
whoever they wanted.

00:04:34.053 --> 00:04:36.155
They wanted it to go through a filter

00:04:36.155 --> 00:04:37.938
with the idea that maybe that filter

00:04:37.938 --> 00:04:41.463
could temper the passions
of the crowd, so to speak,

00:04:41.463 --> 00:04:43.220
and so they devised this system

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.453
where it isn't one person one vote,

00:04:45.453 --> 00:04:49.068
but every state has a
certain number of electors.

00:04:49.068 --> 00:04:52.257
So you vote for electors,
and then the states send them

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:55.352
and then they can place
their vote for President.

00:04:55.352 --> 00:04:56.707
It turns out that most states have decided

00:04:56.707 --> 00:04:58.621
to have a winner take all policy,

00:04:58.621 --> 00:05:00.368
so that maybe they could matter more

00:05:00.368 --> 00:05:02.195
for the Presidential election.

00:05:02.195 --> 00:05:04.489
But what that's resulted in,
is if you take a big state,

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:09.038
like Texas, and just draw
a quick drawing of Texas,

00:05:09.038 --> 00:05:12.282
or a big state like
California, right over here,

00:05:12.282 --> 00:05:15.086
in a winner take all, as
soon as you cross 50%,

00:05:15.086 --> 00:05:17.831
you get 50.1% in either
one of these states,

00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:20.596
and in other big states,
it's true in most states,

00:05:20.596 --> 00:05:22.945
well then you'll get all of
the electors for that state.

00:05:22.945 --> 00:05:25.404
So even if you get 70%
of the vote in Texas,

00:05:25.404 --> 00:05:27.260
or 70% of the vote of California,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.723
it's equivalent to getting 50.1%.

00:05:29.723 --> 00:05:33.466
The reason why this has resulted
in some significant debate,

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:36.086
in the recent past, you
had two major elections

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.360
where the electoral college majority

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.304
was different than the popular majority.

00:05:40.304 --> 00:05:42.393
You had Bush vs. Gore in 2000

00:05:42.393 --> 00:05:45.643
and you have Trump vs. Clinton in 2016.

00:05:46.603 --> 00:05:48.683
Now, two of the other major compromises

00:05:48.683 --> 00:05:50.893
that came out of the
Constitutional Convention

00:05:50.893 --> 00:05:53.275
are less debated today,
and that's a good thing,

00:05:53.275 --> 00:05:54.900
because they were resolved, finally,

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.298
in 1865 by the 13th amendment,

00:05:57.298 --> 00:05:59.326
that came out of the Civil War.

00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:01.399
And these were around slavery.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:04.649
You have the 3/5 Compromise,

00:06:06.676 --> 00:06:09.025
and this is, actually, still

00:06:09.025 --> 00:06:11.788
more of a notion around representation.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.495
Even in the House, how do you determine

00:06:13.495 --> 00:06:15.161
the population that's gonna dictate

00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:17.045
how many representatives you get?

00:06:17.045 --> 00:06:18.273
What about slaves?

00:06:18.273 --> 00:06:20.793
If you look back to this
chart right over here,

00:06:20.793 --> 00:06:22.508
notice some of the southern states

00:06:22.508 --> 00:06:24.669
had a significant fraction
of their population

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:25.742
that were slaves.

00:06:25.742 --> 00:06:27.213
And so you can imagine
that their delegates

00:06:27.213 --> 00:06:29.911
were saying, hey, we wanna
count them in the population.

00:06:29.911 --> 00:06:31.984
They didn't want them to vote,

00:06:31.984 --> 00:06:33.307
but they said, hey, when we decide

00:06:33.307 --> 00:06:34.739
how many representatives we get,

00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:38.233
we wanna count these
293,000 people in Virginia

00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:40.978
when we decide how many
representatives they get.

00:06:40.978 --> 00:06:42.367
And you can imagine, other states,

00:06:42.367 --> 00:06:43.878
either just because they didn't wanna

00:06:43.878 --> 00:06:45.434
dilute their own representation,

00:06:45.434 --> 00:06:47.195
or maybe even some of them might have felt

00:06:47.195 --> 00:06:49.266
morally against something like slavery,

00:06:49.266 --> 00:06:51.781
said, wait, no, you
shouldn't get a benefit

00:06:51.781 --> 00:06:54.029
because you're doing this
thing called slavery,

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:55.527
and so they were against it.

00:06:55.527 --> 00:06:57.848
And so the compromise, and
once again, James Madison

00:06:57.848 --> 00:06:59.629
was significantly involved here,

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:03.110
was the 3/5 Compromise, that
for determining representation,

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.605
a slave would count as 3/5 of a person,

00:07:06.605 --> 00:07:08.913
which is offensive to our sensibilities,

00:07:08.913 --> 00:07:11.041
but that's the compromise
they came up with,

00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:12.935
but it didn't become, it
wasn't an issue anymore

00:07:12.935 --> 00:07:16.193
once slavery was abolished
by the 13th amendment.

00:07:16.193 --> 00:07:18.567
The last major compromise
that people will talk about,

00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:20.681
and this one also revolves around slavery,

00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:24.181
is the importation, importation of slaves.

00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:28.530
During the Revolution,
because Great Britain

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.307
had such a significant
role in the slave trade,

00:07:31.307 --> 00:07:34.813
the colonies, or the
states, the nascent states,

00:07:34.813 --> 00:07:37.029
were pretty unified
around not participating,

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:39.192
at least with Great Britain,

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:41.230
but once the Revolution was over,

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.597
this became an issue again.

00:07:42.597 --> 00:07:44.866
Some states did not want
more importation of slaves,

00:07:44.866 --> 00:07:47.424
some did, and so the
compromise that was reached is

00:07:47.424 --> 00:07:49.157
that at least for 20 years,

00:07:49.157 --> 00:07:51.310
the Congress would not pass a law

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.333
that is prohibiting the
importation of slaves.

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:56.976
And it turns out, almost
exactly 20 years later,

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.235
once that expired from the Constitution,

00:07:59.235 --> 00:08:01.280
under Thomas Jefferson, they did

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.721
ban the importation of slaves officially,

00:08:03.721 --> 00:08:05.980
although it still
continued to some degree,

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.068
at a much smaller level.

00:08:07.068 --> 00:08:10.351
I'll leave you there, but
the big appreciation here

00:08:10.351 --> 00:08:13.497
is that those debates that we talk about,

00:08:13.497 --> 00:08:15.738
the Great Compromise,
the electoral college,

00:08:15.738 --> 00:08:17.674
these debates around representation,

00:08:17.674 --> 00:08:20.016
that we saw over 200 years ago,

00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:23.128
these are things that people
still feel passionate about,

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:25.461
and they still debate today.
