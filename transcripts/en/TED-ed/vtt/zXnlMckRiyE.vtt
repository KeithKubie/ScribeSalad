00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:09.173
Mysteries of vernacular:

00:00:09.173 --> 00:00:10.816
Robot,

00:00:10.816 --> 00:00:12.658
a machine capable of carrying out

00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:15.793
a programmable series of actions.

00:00:15.793 --> 00:00:18.045
The origin of the word robot

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:20.678
dates back more than a thousand years

00:00:20.678 --> 00:00:23.879
to the era of serfdom in central Europe

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.218
when servitude was the currency for rent.

00:00:27.218 --> 00:00:28.234
In those days,

00:00:28.234 --> 00:00:31.165
the Old Church Slavonic word rabota

00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:34.180
described the forced labor of the people.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.928
A slight adjustment of spelling,

00:00:35.928 --> 00:00:40.845
and rabota became the Czech robota,

00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:44.370
which, in addition to defining the toil of the serfs,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.330
was also used figuratively

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.310
to describe any kind of hard work or drudgery.

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:55.118
In 1920, Czech writer Karel Capek published

00:00:55.118 --> 00:00:59.131
a science fiction play called "R.U.R.",

00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:03.250
short for "Rossum's Universal Robots."

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.844
The story featured automated machines

00:01:05.844 --> 00:01:08.081
with distinctly human features

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:09.746
that, until they revolt,

00:01:09.746 --> 00:01:13.089
catered to the whims of the people of Earth.

00:01:13.089 --> 00:01:14.852
Capek originally considered

00:01:14.852 --> 00:01:18.764
calling these hard-working machines labori

00:01:18.764 --> 00:01:21.700
from the Latin word for labor,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.615
but he worried it sounded a bit too scholarly.

00:01:24.615 --> 00:01:28.149
He opted, instead, to emphasize their enslaved state

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.580
by naming them roboti,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.954
or robot in English.

00:01:34.107 --> 00:01:36.924
"R.U.R." was wildly successful,

00:01:36.924 --> 00:01:40.910
and when it was translated into English in 1923,

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.841
the word robot was enthusiastically embraced.

00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:46.936
Though most of today's robots look

00:01:46.936 --> 00:01:49.628
quite different than Capek imagined,

00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:53.155
they've become just as popular as he predicted.

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:55.426
Unlike in "R.U.R.", though,

00:01:55.426 --> 00:01:58.811
our robots haven't risen up against us,

00:01:58.811 --> 00:02:01.768
and here's hoping it stays that way!
