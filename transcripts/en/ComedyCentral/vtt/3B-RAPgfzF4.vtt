(patriotic music)

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.705
- Hello I'm Grant
Grunderschmidt,

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:08.575
producer of Review
with Forrest MacNeil.

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:11.044
As you know our season one
finale ended with Forrest

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.847
punching me and then
storming off in a huff.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.982
What you may not know is
that we've haven't seen

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:19.119 align:start size:88% position:13%
nor heard from him since
then, he's vanished.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.821
Bygones are bygones and
we just want him back.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.623
So we're appealing
to you, the public,

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:26.359
to help spread awareness
of this missing TV host

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.062 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
by using the hashtag
#FINDFORREST.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.765 line:0%
That's Forrest with two Rs.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.100 line:0%
This is not a joke
or a publicity stunt,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.769 line:0%
it's an honest appeal.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.739 align:start size:97% position:3%
Won't you help bring Forrest
MacNeil back to Review

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.176 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then back to you
where he belongs.

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:44.010
Thank you.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.480
Cut and you can put the hashtag
at the bottom of the screen?

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.448
- [Camerawoman] Yeah.

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:49.282
- Okay.

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:51.885
(solemn music)
