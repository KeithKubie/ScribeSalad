LAURIE: Welcome to
Photographers at Google.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.460
And it is my supreme pleasure
to introduce Karen Hutton.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.040
She's one of the
most energetic, full

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.090
of life people on the planet.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.200
Besides being an
amazing photographer,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.010
here are a few things you
might not know about Karen.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.060
She was an actor-- film,
stage, and television,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.810
voiceover artist who's done
hundreds of commercials,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.610
and she's the voice
of Stuck on Earth,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.490
created by Trey Ratcliff.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.210
Professional ice-skater and
dancer, a horse trainer,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.980
creator of Lil Galleries.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.650
She teaches workshops,
photo workshops,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.920
does virtual photo walks.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.300
And her work has been featured
on the "NBC Nightly News",

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.210
and she has a video
chat series called

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.070
The Chat with Karen
Hutton, Sound Byte Insights

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.730
from Some of the Coolest
People on the Planet.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.540
She also has a list
of firsts on Google+.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.180
She attended the very
first Google+ Photo Walk.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.990
She was one of the first people
to join Google+ a couple years

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.400
ago, and she has now over
1.5 million followers.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.372
She was my first Hangout on
Air for Nik Software at Google.

00:01:04.372 --> 00:01:06.330
And she was also the
first person I interviewed

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.930
for our Google+ Women
in Photography series.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.690
Now today, Karen
is also a first.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.260
She's the first woman for our
Photographers at Google Talk

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.570
series.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.380
Her topic today, she'll be
discussing Signature-- Finding

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.340
Your Soul's Genius and
Voice in your Photography.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.540
Please give a warm welcome
to the amazing, one and only,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.680
my friend, Karen Hutton.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.440
KAREN HUTTON: Thank you.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.760
Thank you, thank you.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.750
I feel exhausted
hearing about my life.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.900
I'm like, I need a rest.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.650
So today, I'm going
to tell you a story.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.320
Because that's what
I do, I tell stories.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.565
And we're going to build
the story together,

00:01:44.565 --> 00:01:45.940
and I'm going to
try and remember

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.560
that for you, it goes this way.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.260
For me, it goes this way, but
for you, it goes this way.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.730
So I'm going to go this way.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.330
So we're going to
build this story.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.380
How many of you like
to be recognized

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.540
for the things you do
and for your photography?

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.140
I know I do.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.190
Yes, thank you!

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.350
Some of you didn't raise your
hand, and I find you suspect.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.090
But that's OK.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.919
We'll work this out later.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:16.700
So recognition and being
noticed, some of us

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.762
feel ashamed about that.

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:19.220
Oh, I shouldn't
want to be noticed.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.510
Well guess what?

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.460
Wanting to be seen, and
heard, and felt, and smelled,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.180
and experienced is one of the
most primal needs of humans,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.730
of human kind.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.830
I mean, we're here to be amongst
each other, be in community.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.910
And not being seen
and recognized

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.380
just goes against
everything we know and love.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.461
So when it comes to photography,
I, you know, I've coached.

00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:49.960
All these things
that she mentioned,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.030
I've coached them all, too.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.613
And we also didn't
talk about the fact

00:02:52.613 --> 00:02:56.430
that I've coached television
news broadcasters for 25 years,

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.230
and done photography
all my life.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.140
And so everything I've
ever done, oddly enough,

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.230
has been all centered
around, all right,

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.190
what does it really mean?

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.200
What thing can we
bring to everything

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.000
we do that makes
it really special?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.580
That makes it mean something?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.270
That can be kind of
a souls connection?

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.030
I don't know what it is
about me that just is always

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.350
on this course, but that's the
way it is, so get used to it.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.500
So my opinion-- that's all
we ever really have, is it,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.570
our opinion-- is,
you need a signature.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.600
So what is your signature?

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.505
Now obviously, we kind of know
what a signature is, and you're

00:03:38.505 --> 00:03:40.755
probably all going to laugh
at me because you're like,

00:03:40.755 --> 00:03:41.755
oh, she's such an idiot.

00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:43.230
I know what a signature is.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.630
And of course, here's
the definition.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.340
Any unique, distinguishing,
aspect, pattern, feature,

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.425
or mark.

00:03:50.425 --> 00:03:52.870
But keep thinking, we're
going to apply this

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.300
to photography in our story
that we're going to build.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.950
So the thing about signature
that I have learned

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.790
is that it bears the
stamp of who you are.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.120
It bears the stamp of
your point of view.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.800
It bears the stamp of your
soul, what you have to say,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.670
what you want, you know,
what I want you to feel,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.339
what I want to feel,
it bears all that.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.450
That's what a
signature is all about.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.780
And inasmuch as all we
have, really, to offer

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.211
is us-- is who we are--
that signature really

00:04:29.211 --> 00:04:30.710
needs to be in
everything that we're

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.500
doing if we want
to be recognized.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.440
Because nobody can do
you as well as you.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.423
Nobody can do you.

00:04:35.423 --> 00:04:38.270
Nobody can do me as
well as I can so.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.740
That's why I'm here,
and not someone else.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.120
I would have hired
someone, otherwise.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.810
Kidding!

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.130
So we're going to start here.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.720
So signature is
what enables someone

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.970
to know that it's you talking.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.150
You recognize your mother's
voice on the phone,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.160
you recognize your dog's
footsteps coming down

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.889
the hall way.

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.430
There's a lot of
things about someone

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.888
you recognize--
the way they dress,

00:04:59.888 --> 00:05:02.430
the way they talk, the way they
smell, just the way they are,

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.130
their stamp.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.520
They're like, I know you.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.730
Well how do you know you?

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.700
It's all those things, right?

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.310
And it's the glance,
it's the look,

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.410
it's this thing right
here that I'm looking at.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.107
This worldview that
I see here, that I

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:18.190
am going to see here in a
minute, that I see here.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.770
My world view.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.140
My point of view.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.380
I learned this from
an amazing voice coach

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.160
that I worked with for a
number of years in Los Angeles.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.520
She works with
celebrities, she works

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.550
with-- they call her
the voice whisperer.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.970
Her name is Marice Tobias,
and she uses this term

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.662
when teaching us.

00:05:37.662 --> 00:05:39.370
Her point of view
about it, which I think

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.030
is very true if we
take it from voice

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.340
and put it into
photography, it is

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.390
what it is like to be in
the presence of your voice.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.757
So when we talk
about a voice, when

00:05:51.757 --> 00:05:53.340
she's talking to us
about voice, we're

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.020
talking about speaking voice.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.180
But I'm talking to you about
the voice in your photography.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.290
Your voice.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.540
So what is it like to be in
the presence of your voice?

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.610
Now, this signature idea
is also what enables you

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.200
to, as the feed comes through
your Google+ stream, you know,

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.510
here comes a Trey Ratcliff,
here comes a Thomas Hawk,

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.540
here comes whoever
you follow and admire.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.710
Oh, I know that work.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.020
Guess how you know that work?

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.625
Because the signature's in it.

00:06:20.625 --> 00:06:21.830
It's all over it.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.480
You see it.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.210
You know it.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.250
That's what we want
in our photography.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.246
Would you agree
that's a good thing?

00:06:29.246 --> 00:06:30.238
Yeah.

00:06:30.238 --> 00:06:31.230
Good.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.646
Glad we're on the same page,
because we have a whole story

00:06:33.646 --> 00:06:34.460
here to create.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.580
So when you talk about
this idea of, what

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.350
is it like to be in the
presence of your voice,

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.710
most great artists
I know of, they're

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.700
always in this state of
like, humble amazement.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.000
Because they know-- the really
good ones know-- that it's not

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.970
them that's putting the
art-- the photograph

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.740
or the art on the canvas
or making the sculpture--

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.880
they know it is this
spark of divine fire

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.310
that is coming through them.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.150
And that their job is
to stay clear enough

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.877
to allow this thing to happen,
so that when they're done,

00:07:08.877 --> 00:07:10.460
they look at that,
and they're amazed.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.693
They're like, damn!

00:07:11.693 --> 00:07:14.260
That came through me?

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.760
Right?

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.470
That's art.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.830
So right here, at the
beginning of our story,

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.310
were taking
photography and we're

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.940
going to talk about it as art.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.590
Because yes, there's
journalistic, yes,

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.960
there's snapshot at a party.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.730
But even that can
have a signature.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.730
And because of what I
want to talk to you about,

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.271
because the amazing thing I've
noticed over the years is that

00:07:34.271 --> 00:07:37.820
people who engage in this
whole signature process end up

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.564
in a different place in
their life people who don't.

00:07:40.564 --> 00:07:41.980
And I have found
that fascinating.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.600
And it doesn't matter if it's
in photography, in voice,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.010
in acting, in all these things
that I've done, it all the.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.910
Same it's amazing.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.800
So a signature cannot be bought.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.080
It cannot be borrowed.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.930
O course, when I
first heard about it,

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.830
Marice was telling us
all about signature

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.580
and I got so nervous,
because I was like,

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.980
oh my God, now I
need a signature.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.020
Where do I get it?

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:06.570
Do I buy one?

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:07.457
Is there a sale?

00:08:07.457 --> 00:08:08.540
Is there something online?

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.880
Can I, uh-- but no.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.590
It's actually kind
of this inner process

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.060
that you have to go
through to bring it out.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.535
And in photography, if we break
it down to make it simple,

00:08:20.535 --> 00:08:22.660
because what I'm saying is
all very good in theory,

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.190
but what does it really mean?

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.530
There are elements
to a signature.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.590
There are things you
already know about yourself

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.790
that, if you focus on
them in your photography,

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.500
it already creates an
interesting, different, unique

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.380
point of view.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.419
So I'm going to show
some photos of my own.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.239
Not because like, I'm
the best photographer

00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:42.280
on the face of the earth.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.054
I'm OK.

00:08:43.054 --> 00:08:45.220
But I have a signature,
I've thought a lot about it.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.040
And I chose some photos that
show it in a really simple way

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.130
so that we can have a
discussion about it.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.500
So this is one.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.360
Now, I mentioned before,
I am always on a journey.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.230
I didn't use that word,
but I'm a journey person.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.200
I'm always going
from here to there.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.110
I can't stand still.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.700
I don't think that's our
nature to stand still.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.400
I think evolution is
just part of who we are.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.500
So one of the elements
that tends to show itself

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.650
over and over are,
we're going somewhere.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.110
So I love leading lines.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.480
So we have leading lines.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.800
We';re going on a journey.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.470
We have the mystical mist.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.800
I love the mystical mist.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.410
I require a certain amount
of mystical mist in my life.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.080
In this case, we
had a mystical mist,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.470
because there was some fog.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.980
But there wasn't enough,
so I added a little bit.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.030
And I don't mind doing
that, because this

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.500
is my expression of my reality
and I'm going to put it out

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.160
there and that's what
I'm going to roll with.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.650
I love the light from above.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:46.935
I love the pop of color.

00:09:46.935 --> 00:09:49.410
I love that it's
warm and then cool.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.750
And I love that it just
makes you want to go and see

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.540
what's around the
corner, because I

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.050
think that is the
nature of life.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.680
And that is how I live
my life and that's

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.310
how I think about it.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.160
So, boom.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.340
I would say of many of
the photos that I have,

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.630
this has probably been one
of the more shared photos,

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.720
probably, on the internet.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.170
So it must strike a
chord with people.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.714
I know it's got
more of the elements

00:10:17.714 --> 00:10:20.380
with-- between light, and magic,
and mystery, and leading lines,

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.860
and the journey,
and the colors, I

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.240
would say it has
probably the most

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.400
elements of my own signature
in it of most photos that I do.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.850
I don't really know why
it got shared so much,

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.314
but anyway, it did.

00:10:33.314 --> 00:10:33.980
So there you go.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.850
And it's in the +1
collection book.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.160
I believe it's on Page 10.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.350
I'm not sure.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.030
I could be wrong about that.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.140
I knew it at one point.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.320
Anyway, so then, perspective.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.825
And leading lines.

00:10:49.825 --> 00:10:51.450
If you know your
signature and you know

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.540
you're the kind of person that
looks at things differently,

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.060
than that's going to inform
where you hold your camera.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.450
You can hold it here.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.060
You know, if the
normal shot is like,

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.890
I'm going to shoot
all of you, but now I

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.430
want to get a
different perspective,

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.270
maybe I'll hold it up.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.269
Maybe I'll hold it down.

00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:08.810
Maybe I'll hold it sideways.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.620
How you see the world
will inform you.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.290
So this is in Florence.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.940
And it was a lovely
shot, holding

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.530
the camera-- did
I have a tripod?

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.010
I don't think I had a tripod.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.093
Had I had a tripod, it
would have been a nice shot

00:11:21.093 --> 00:11:23.100
just here.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.450
But I put the
camera on the ground

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:29.020
and tipped it up and put it a
little bit crooked because I

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.480
thought, if I were a little
critter crossing the road

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.970
and I looked up and look down,
is it safe, shall I keep going?

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.540
That's what it would look like.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.600
And then because it's
a little critter,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.060
I might as well go with the
movie moment, which I'm always

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.100
playing movies in my
mind, and process it

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.450
in kind of a movie kind of
animated sort of fun way.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.820
So that's how I
decided to take that

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:56.720
and that's how I decided to
process it was, my perspective.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.220
So just examples.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:00.810
Light.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.730
I'm all about light.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:03.600
Life is light.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.990
My photography business
tag is, Karen Hutton, Life

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.450
is Light Photography.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.540
Because I think we chase
light as photographers.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.020
We wait for light, we curse
the light, we judge the light,

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.580
we wait, we live for the
light, we get up for the light,

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.980
we stay up for the light,
and I think life is light.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.450
So light features in
a lot of my photos.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.370
I love to shoot
into the sun, which

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:30.020
is one of the reasons why I do
a lot of HDR, which this is,

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.980
because it's just easier to
get all the levels of light

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.670
when you're shooting into
the sun like an idiot.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.200
Leading lines, the
nugget in the front,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.330
you kind of stop and see
things along the way,

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.940
but you're on a journey,
the reflections, all

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.160
that is just part of who I am.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.150
Journey-- now it's
not going that way.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.400
Now we have a bike getting
ready to go out and take

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.040
the journey that way.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.960
So journey.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:01.400
And again, kind of a surreal
processing purposely.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.335
Jouney, hi.

00:13:02.335 --> 00:13:03.570
How are you doing?

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:04.140
Two-tone.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.180
This just feels like a slice.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.890
You know how when
you have a dream,

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.456
and all you remember
is this-- I remember--

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:11.830
and then you have
this one frame.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.538
And you're like, what
did that attach to?

00:13:13.538 --> 00:13:14.650
What was going on?

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.670
I just remember this
one frame from my dream.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:17.665
Do you ever have that?

00:13:17.665 --> 00:13:18.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:19.081
KAREN HUTTON: Yeah.

00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:20.630
That's was what this
was like for me.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.130
Journey.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:22.340
We're going somewhere .

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.300
We're going somewhere.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.680
And in between is
this dream state,

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.860
which is why I used the sort of
surreal blue two-tone approach.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.600
I'll show you the before later.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.320
I decided the boardwalk didn't
have enough curve in it,

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.870
so I gave a little
more curve, as well.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.190
Because I personally, this
is a thing in my life.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.780
My husband's here,
and he'll tell you.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:46.000
If reality doesn't suit me,
I will fix it to suit me.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.490
Because I like, yeah,
that doesn't work for me.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.810
Could you-- yeah.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:50.330
I do that.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.290
So that's going to show up
in my photography, as well.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:55.520
Lines.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.970
Here we have a nice combo.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.540
We have a little
journey going on here.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.510
We have a little
leading line action.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.132
We have the enormity and
beauty of these big trees.

00:14:05.132 --> 00:14:07.090
I threw this in here,
too, because people often

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.610
wonder how to shoot forests,
because sometimes they

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.460
can look really
messy and chaotic.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.550
And if you can find
some really strong lines

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:18.400
and make that the story--
because this is a story--

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.390
then it helps a photo a lot.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:23.870
This was interesting.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.230
Brian and Nichole
will recognize this.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:32.300
In the Columbia Gorge, Columbia
River Gorge, Horsetail Falls,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:32.800
right?

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.900
I think.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.550
Was there with Brian Bonham.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.170
Anyway, these
trees are like, oh,

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.340
they're so amazing
when you're in them,

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.423
but how do you shoot them?

00:14:39.423 --> 00:14:42.460
So I decided that the
character of these trees

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.610
was, they had these arms.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.460
These like, woo,
and you'd better not

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.890
get caught by one of those arms.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.560
Or, it could be
prehensile fingers.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.620
Either way, they're alive
and they have intelligence.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.030
And so I decided that
this would be their body,

00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:00.660
and those would be their
arms, and the waterfall behind

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.040
gives them a little
break in the green

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.310
and makes it all stand out.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.260
And to me, that
made a character.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.070
Like, that could
be on a story board

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:12.560
in my movie of a character
that looks like that.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.990
So welcome to my mind.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.340
It's A scary place.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:21.320
So just, again, light
features in the leading lines.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.410
Another thing that's really
helpful, if you think about it,

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.560
is, these trees were huge.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.900
They were probably-- well, I'm
terrible at distance, but well

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:31.990
over 200 feet tall.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.630
They're very, very big trees.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.710
And I decided that the better
shot was not to show it,

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:40.150
because then I'm explaining
the whole thing to you-- Oh,

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.760
they're this big, which
never really shows up anyway.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.590
You can never show that kind
of perspective in a photo.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.990
So imply it.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.650
Create some nice leading
lines, a nice little sunburst.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.330
I love sunbursts.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:56.470
And imply the height and let
the viewer fill in the rest.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.917
It's a lot more fun for them,
and it's entertaining for you,

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:01.000
and the kids will love it.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:04.970
Perspective.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.840
So I'm all about perspective.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:13.440
I am opinionated, I will admit.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.690
But I try not to
be too judgmental,

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.770
and I'm really, really
about perspective.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.830
Because if you have the right
perspective about things,

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.029
you don't have to be in
an adversarial position

00:16:23.029 --> 00:16:23.570
in your life.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.970
You can actually understand
things and go, "Ah."

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.550
Because as an actor,
that's what we had to do.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:33.525
If you got a character in a
show, you couldn't just say,

00:16:33.525 --> 00:16:34.490
I hate her.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:35.975
She's stupid.

00:16:35.975 --> 00:16:36.850
How do you play that?

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:37.349
You can't .

00:16:37.349 --> 00:16:40.970
You can't be in judgment of
what you're participating in.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.520
So perspective is really
important in life, I think,

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.880
and in photographs.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.100
So here in Siena, my
first trip to Siena,

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.030
which was hugely
impactful for me because I

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.350
had read about it as a kid.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.190
There a book called,
"Gaudenzia, Pride of the Palio."

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:59.460
Ooh, about a horse
and the Palio race.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.880
And I never forgot that book.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.869
It was, God, I probably read
that-- OK, a lot of years ago.

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:07.280
We won't go into that.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:11.630
So this was the
history in this place.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:16.400
And the mystery in this place
at night just blew me away.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.310
But it wasn't-- if I
held the camera straight,

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.380
everything was straight.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.099
And I used a 14
millimeter on this.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:24.470
But if I held it
straight, it was

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.415
like, it was too post card-y.

00:17:26.415 --> 00:17:29.010
It was too travel brochure.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.660
So I said, and besides
which, these buildings all

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.170
felt like-- felt to me--
like they were looking down

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.120
at us, going, pfft--
another batch.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.060
They're just like the
ones 400 years ago.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.090
And I'm like, whoa, they're
like, they're so old.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.380
So anyway, I took it and
turned it, and deliberately

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.250
pulled this corner of
this building down,

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.040
because that's what
those big lenses do,

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.500
is they distort-- I
love that distortion--

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.550
and offset the center so that
they would feel like people.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.950
So they would feel like beings.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.790
Maybe not people, but their
own being kind of looming down.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.450
And left that light
in there because life

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.970
is light, so might as well.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.580
And that became my
impression of that place.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.950
So again, my
signature in for me.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.110
So I'm just going to roll
through a few more of these.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:21.320
Same thing, looking up.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.210
I have a tendency to look up.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.550
Kind of a looker upper.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:29.370
Kind of like to see
the glass half full.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.760
Don't make a face, Brian.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.670
And this is one,
this is comparing,

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.810
this is like a
contrast in the old

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.373
and the new, two kinds
of wood, you know?

00:18:39.373 --> 00:18:42.560
The growing up and
the disintegrating.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.600
The contrast, the
juxtapositions.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.400
I love all those
things, so I tend

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.850
to look for those
in my photographs.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:51.720
Same thing here.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.330
Everybody and their
brother-- we all--

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.780
has anybody shot this
car down in Bodie?

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.360
Nobody's copping to it.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.410
It's an amazing car.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.610
You should go shoot it.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.230
And everybody shoots
it who goes to Bodie.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.570
And I almost didn't,
because I'm like, hell,

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.830
everybody shoots that car.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.220
Then I thought, well
what's that car's story?

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.270
So I decided that the
car's story was-- well,

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.930
and it didn't occur to me
until I brought my camera down,

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.130
and all of a sudden,
it had a face.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.420
So all of a sudden, it became
this like, poignant story

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.530
of this family car that
was once loved and beloved,

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:32.220
now sitting out here in this
field with the grass growing up

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.490
and time is like,
reabsorbing it.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.250
And as I got down
there, mind you,

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.450
I'm someone who hears
music and like full scores

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.260
of movies and dialogue
and the whole thing,

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.961
it's kind of frightening.

00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:44.710
Laurie has occasionally
said, "I just want

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:45.910
five minutes in your mind."

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.130
She said one day, I think she's
got it down to like, a minute.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:50.600
30 seconds.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.480
I don't want to be
in there too long.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.490
Anyway, so down,
it became the story

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.952
this car that is like,
waiting. it's outside, right

00:19:57.952 --> 00:19:59.910
and its owners are getting
ready to go to town,

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.020
and the car's like, oh,
we're going on a ride!

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.770
And then she hears the
owners in the house

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.060
going, "Fire up Bessie,
we're going to town!"

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:11.100
And she's Bessie, so, OK.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.880
You're probably
learning more about me

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.410
than probably should be sharing.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:19.890
But anyway, I make movies
in my mind everywhere.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.360
So again, a frame
out of my movie.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.320
You're welcome.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.120
This was the photo that
was on NBC Nightly News.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.640
It was the final shot of
a virtual photo walks,

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.974
a story on virtual photo walks.

00:20:33.974 --> 00:20:35.390
Because I had done
a virtual photo

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:38.330
walk from Hovenweep, which
is where this was taken.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:42.770
And time, this is like
the time machine shot.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.315
This is like the
old and the new,

00:20:44.315 --> 00:20:48.420
the sun and the light being
of the moment, right now,

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:53.320
and this 1,200-year-old
ruins is, so not right now,

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.410
and yet it is.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.190
And the sun, the light,
is what connects them.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:02.920
So it was kind of a, again,
strange link, as I see life.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.264
So I have lots of photos here.

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:06.930
You probably don't
need to see them all,

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:08.630
but I'm just going to kind
of thumb through them.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.838
You can sort of see-- "Harold
and Maude" was a movie.

00:21:10.838 --> 00:21:13.780
Did anybody of you ever see
that movie? "Harold and Maude"?

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.790
So somebody had carved Harold
and Maude on the side of this.

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:20.420
And the sun was there, and
it was like, oh my God.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.440
I have to take this picture.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.290
Because this is a movie
moment, a light moment,

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:27.820
kind of a crazy moment.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.970
Harold and Maude
and their story.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:31.790
Textures.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:37.877
I love texture, I love
dreams, and altered realities.

00:21:37.877 --> 00:21:39.960
I'll show you befores and
afters of some of these.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.376
These are mostly
for the textures.

00:21:41.376 --> 00:21:45.030
Perspective, again,
small and large.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:49.450
And then we have small and
large with the large implied.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.970
That's in New Zealand.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:53.340
Sunsets.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.120
I love my sunsets.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.080
I didn't put the 2,000 sunset
photos that I've got in here.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.460
Just a few that
just tell a story.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.230
And again, I love color.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.090
I grew up with black and white.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:11.229
That was my professional
training, went to school

00:22:11.229 --> 00:22:12.520
and we studied black and white.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.570
But somehow, I've
evolved into this--

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.750
I don't know-- time or
this age, or who I am now,

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.310
and I just love color.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.110
I'm just like, oh, I love color.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:22.550
So I tend to, you
know, although I

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.090
didn't have to do
too much to this.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.640
This was pretty much
crazy that night.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.080
That was pretty much
crazy that night.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.940
I love my animals, because
I grew up in the country.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:39.380
And I love the connection that
animals have with the world

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.860
around them.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.600
So those are just some things.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.509
So I'm just trying
to show elements

00:22:44.509 --> 00:22:46.050
through my photos
of what I'm talking

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.960
about when we talk
about signature.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.420
So when we're talking
this way, we're

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.840
talking about
photography as art.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.760
So I have-- I never
remember this,

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.780
I always have to read
it-- the definition of art

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.960
is the expression or application
of human creative skill

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:10.210
and imagination, producing works
to be appreciated primarily

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.760
for their beauty
or emotional power.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.620
So art values beauty
and emotional power.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.460
Now, I think we all know
what's beautiful to us.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.434
I think it's undervalued
in our society,

00:23:24.434 --> 00:23:27.100
and I think there was a point in
history where that decision was

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:32.730
made to split off
between science and art.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:35.390
That's a history lesson, we
won't go into that today.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:36.180
That's tomorrow.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:36.680
Kidding!

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.250
Don't come back here
tomorrow looking for that.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:42.620
So the thing about
art, though, art--

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:49.100
I'm gonna actually put this on
the screen-- art lets us dream.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:54.250
So art is a place we go when
we want something better.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.710
Like I mentioned before,
our spark of divine fire.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.560
The place where we go
for something better,

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:04.220
for our higher view, for ah,
more, what more could there be?

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.270
We go to art.

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.750
And by art, it
could be your life,

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:11.190
it could be your photography,
it could be something you do.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:15.820
But artful living, that is a
living your life as an art,

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.320
right?

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.620
And that's kind of
what I'm talking about.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:25.161
And the thing of it
is, this is not new.

00:24:25.161 --> 00:24:27.160
I was curious to see--
oh, this does look good.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.810
So Rumi-- how many of you know
Rumi, the mystic and poet,

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.000
right, from the 1,200s,
the 13th century.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.250
He said, "Let yourself
be silently drawn

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:39.740
by the strange pull of
what you really love.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.757
It will not lead you astray."

00:24:42.757 --> 00:24:44.090
I think that's really important.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.470
That was how many years ago?

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.711
And he was telling people this.

00:24:48.711 --> 00:24:49.210
Why?

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:51.311
Because I think people
make choices about,

00:24:51.311 --> 00:24:52.685
well, I'm going
to feel this way,

00:24:52.685 --> 00:24:55.330
or I'm going to do this,
because it will get me that.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:56.750
Something on the outside.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.320
When in fact, the thing
that gets you recognized,

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.600
the thing that leads
you to something better,

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.730
or to a better
photograph, is what

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.200
you love about the photograph,
about your perspective,

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.330
about your processing,
about how you're

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:14.110
going to make your voice, which
is what signature is leading us

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.660
to-- how you're going to
make that heard, and seen,

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.870
and smelled, and felt, and
every other sense that you

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:21.390
can possibly pack in.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:24.550
The late 1800s, James
Allen, who was a writer,

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.200
he wrote about-- he wrote
kind of, not a spiritual list,

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.130
but he wrote about--
I guess you'd call him

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:32.050
a self-help author of the 1800s.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.590
"The vision that you
glorify in your mind.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:39.350
the ideal that you enthrone
in your heart, this

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.940
you will build your life by."

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.720
No matter what.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.240
Even if you don't choose to.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.240
Whatever you think about
and feel about the most,

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.290
that is what you will
build your life by.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:51.100
That is what you will become.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:55.130
So if art, carried all the
way back to your photographs,

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:58.760
allows you to dream, to
dream of something better,

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.620
to dream of wow, I didn't
think of doing it like this.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.310
What if I do?

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.470
That process starts to find
its way into your life.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.400
And this is one of the
real big powers, to me,

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.450
of photography and art.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.180
More recently,
Gloria Steinem said,

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.970
"Without leaps of
imagination or dreaming,

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.910
we lose the excitement
of possibilities."

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.910
And that's what we're
really talking about here,

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.990
is having possibilities.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.605
"Dreaming, after all,
is a form of planning."

00:26:26.605 --> 00:26:28.900
Which I love.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:29.430
I love that.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:37.130
So what would you attempt to do
if you knew you could not fail?

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.515
Whether it's photography,
whether it's life.

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:46.300
What dream would you have
about this photograph,

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.610
about this vision, about
what you want to do,

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:53.520
and who you want to become,
if you knew you couldn't fail?

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.680
So yeah, you thought
we were going

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.490
to talk about
photography, didn't you?

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.360
Ha!

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.450
So this brings us to story.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.490
We use our photographs
to tell a story.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:06.590
We dream of a story.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:08.340
Like, I mean, I just
took you through some

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.940
of my crazy photographs, right?

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.315
Oh, I think I'll
do this with it.

00:27:11.315 --> 00:27:12.880
Because it's a story.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.400
How many of you heard Alan
Shapiro's talk last month

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.590
about words?

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:17.140
Yeah.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.690
If you haven't seen it, you
should go back and watch it.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:23.120
It's fantastic, where he talks
about words and the importance

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.630
of words with your photographs.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.970
I think there are, in fact,
three kinds of stories.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.890
I think words are huge,
and I think beyond that,

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:33.650
we have stories.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.760
And I think there
are three kinds.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.450
And I think we have stories
that give, stories that take,

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:43.980
and stories just for
the facts, ma'am.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.320
Examples of stories that give--
stories that give are like,

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.850
throughout history we have
our ancestors and families

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:54.460
and civilizations who have
passed on, either through

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.710
pictographs or whether it's
written or through song

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:59.960
or whatever, whatever they
did, they told us how to --

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.012
what they encountered, what
to watch out for, how to have

00:28:04.012 --> 00:28:06.220
families, how to have fun,
how to laugh, what to eat,

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.000
what not to eat.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.415
All those things, those
are stories that give.

00:28:09.415 --> 00:28:11.550
They help us live.

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:13.960
Other stories that give
from more modern times

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.660
are stories of inspiration.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.710
Stories that like, wow,
I had this thing happen.

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.800
I lost my leg, but this
is how I overcame it.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.320
Or had this bad thing happen,
but this is what I did.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.980
This is how I made it work.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.980
Stories that lift you up.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.640
Stories that inspire.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.120
Stories that empower.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.580
Those are stories that give.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.880
Same with photographs.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.130
Stories that take--
good example-- this

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:40.445
is a really good example.

00:28:40.445 --> 00:28:41.870
You can all relate to this one.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:46.090
Is, you have a voice in
your head that says, God,

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.160
you're stupid.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.800
Oh, my God, why
did you say that?

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.240
You are so fat.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.400
Why aren't you exercising?

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.660
You are so lazy.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.480
Oh my God, that was a
stupid thing to say.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.660
Have any of you ever
heard any of these?

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:03.910
You're all kind of going,
no, yes, yes, no, yes.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.060
We all have.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.540
That's our critical
voice inside,

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.630
and it tells you a
story about yourself.

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.670
It tells you a story about
yourself that in many cases,

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:15.420
people assume is right--
or maybe they don't even

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.217
question it.

00:29:16.217 --> 00:29:17.300
They just start living it.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.390
Oh my God, that's true, OK.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.100
So pretty soon, that
becomes the filter--

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.940
the lens-- through which
you live your life,

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.590
process your photos,
take a photograph.

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:29.690
I'm never successful
because-- I could never

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.260
win because-- I just
wanted it to be this way,

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:36.200
but it can't because, whatever,
oh my God, I'm tired now.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.690
So stories that take.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:40.190
On the outside,
pretty much any story

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.070
that you hear from someone else
that makes you feel like crap?

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:44.850
That's a story that takes.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:45.810
It's taking away.

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:47.540
It disempowers.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:48.810
It makes you less than.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:49.780
It makes you doubt.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.700
It makes you feel lousy.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.220
Those are stories that take.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:30:00.650
I had a very incredible mentor
in my life who was my voice

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:03.840
coach, and I did personal
development with her

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.710
for many, many years.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:07.645
So I think it might
have been-- it

00:30:07.645 --> 00:30:09.640
might have been 30 years
ago-- she said to me,

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.570
we were talking about
the inner voice, right,

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:13.410
the one that was stories.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:17.690
She said to me, she said,
if it tells you a story

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:21.670
and it makes you
feel bad, it's a lie.

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:23.340
Pure and simple.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.460
No ifs, ands, or buts.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.500
If it makes you feel
bad, it is a lie.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.680
And 30 years ago, I
said, that's a lie.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.267
I just can't believe it's that
simple because blah, blah,

00:30:35.267 --> 00:30:35.975
blah, blah, blah.

00:30:35.975 --> 00:30:37.460
Because I had so many stories.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:41.760
Well, I've field tested
this sucker for a long time,

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.400
and I'm now on the page
where I realize she's right.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.820
If it makes you feel
bad, it is a lie

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.970
and is a story that takes--
and give it the boot.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:52.950
Whatever you've got to do.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:56.470
So art allows us to
find those, allows

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.080
us to discover
those for yourself.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.490
Because if you're in your
artistic state, and let's

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:03.610
say you're processing-- how
many of you process photos?

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:05.170
Yeah, OK, so we're
on the page here.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:06.310
I wondered about that.

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.170
So you're processing
the photo and you

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:11.414
let yourself go in this
zone where, OK, this

00:31:11.414 --> 00:31:12.580
would be beautiful, or this.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.830
I feel like trying this.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:14.700
Or let's try this.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.570
And it starts to feel
amazing, and all of a sudden,

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.919
you find yourself, like
it's been a hard day,

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:21.210
but now you're having some fun.

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:23.550
And oh, my God, you're
in your happy place,

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:25.910
and wow, I never
thought of doing that.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:29.300
And you're in this
sort of uplifted place,

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.870
you start to realize,
wow, the rest of the time,

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.290
I feel really crappy.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:35.360
Why is that?

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.112
You almost need the
contrast to even find out

00:31:38.112 --> 00:31:39.570
how much you're
beating yourself up

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.950
or how much you believe
bad stories, or whatever,

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:48.120
to know that there's another
choice that you could make.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.970
Stories just for the
facts have their place.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:51.428
They're not
particularly emotional.

00:31:51.428 --> 00:31:53.940
The first two are very
emotionally loaded.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:57.210
The third one is like, what's
the story of this photograph?

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:57.900
What did you do?

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:03.990
Well, I used my Canon 5D Mark
III, I used my 24-70 2.8.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.870
These settings, I shot
it HDR, and then I

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:07.328
processed it and
used the software.

00:32:07.328 --> 00:32:10.150
And that was how I did this
photo-- which is valuable.

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:11.240
Some people need that.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.890
The DMV needs to know what
happened in the intersection

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:15.470
when your car got crunched.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.920
Those are important stories,
but they're not emotional.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.650
They're not going to inform
you the way these other two do.

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.430
And since we're talking art--
so we started with signature,

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:27.770
right, and we talked about art
and it allows you to dream,

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:29.439
so now we're in this
part of the story.

00:32:29.439 --> 00:32:30.980
And now we're coming
over here, we're

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:38.910
coming into another place of
the story, which is, what if?

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:40.820
What if is one of
my favorite-- I

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.350
always call it a game
because I like to have fun--

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:47.060
but it's one of the most
powerful games, tools,

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.390
out there.

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:57.800
What if allows you to
play a different game.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.650
What if allows you to say, well,
this is how it seems to be.

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:04.820
But what if it were like this?

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.680
What if I tried that?

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.470
It starts to lift the lid off
of-- it's always like this

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.430
and I'm always in pain, right?

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:16.240
And it allows you to start to
crack open some perspective.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.310
Where's that microphone?

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:19.020
I'm going to show
you a video, but I

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.870
have to do it a certain way.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:21.550
It's here?

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:22.050
Oh.

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.480
Is it on?

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:33.235
So I'm going to play you
a story about possibility,

00:33:33.235 --> 00:33:33.985
about perspective.

00:33:36.754 --> 00:33:37.420
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:41.530
-Constructs-- complex
ideas, images,

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:46.860
or theories formed from a
number of simpler elements.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.610
In our minds, we
built constructs

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:55.110
to give ourselves order,
structure, safety.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:58.420
And sometimes, they do.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:04.118
Sometimes, they lead us down
roads we never intended to go.

00:34:04.118 --> 00:34:06.150
Patterns repeat.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:09.889
Sameness mounts.

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:13.329
Until it seems our
world of construct

00:34:13.329 --> 00:34:20.070
spins out of control, until
our heart speaks of freedom.

00:34:31.399 --> 00:34:33.315
Our soul reflecting
passion we never imagined.

00:34:42.045 --> 00:34:44.470
Our world becomes enormous.

00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:50.469
And suddenly, we
seem quite small.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:53.540
Even insignificant.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.430
But we are not.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.730
We are all part of
something greater.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:05.605
Something fluid, and deep.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:12.393
And a connection to an
incredible strength.

00:35:17.028 --> 00:35:18.501
Beauty lives here.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:30.170
And a visionary inside that sees
things differently, uniquely.

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:39.183
Greeting that one is like
a new dawn-- soaring.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:53.685
Inside every construct lies
the chance to see a new light.

00:35:57.597 --> 00:36:03.000
A chance to travel new roads.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.350
The chance to marvel at
the world around you.

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:15.900
And when that happens,
the light prevails.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.430
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.680
KAREN HUTTON: What if?

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:34.490
What if you take the
things in your signature

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.155
and create something new?

00:36:36.155 --> 00:36:40.180
That was what I was trying to
do with these Lil Galleries.

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.680
Is online now, at
Lil Galleries.com,

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:46.420
but it's these
combinations of voice.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.150
Photographs contain your voice.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:50.040
In my case, I just
happened to have a voice

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.670
that I use as a voice.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.780
And I wondered what would
happen if I put them

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:57.640
together and created a
third way of speaking

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.910
through these videos.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:01.760
So what if?

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.200
What if you did that?

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.360
What if you took-- I
don't know, a photograph.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.840
What if you took
this photograph?

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.260
This is a cool photograph of a
house, of a broken down house.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.020
It's got a story.

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.820
It's out in the middle of
this big old, humongous,

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.220
I don't know how many-- I
guess you measure it in miles.

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.135
It's just a huge, huge valley.

00:37:22.135 --> 00:37:24.330
It has some cattle.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.359
And you look at that
and you go, wow.

00:37:26.359 --> 00:37:27.400
That is really something.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.620
That house has a story to tell.

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:33.740
Nice telephone lines, by the
way, it's really awesome.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:37.100
And it's got some cool colors.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.530
Now, I see it in
black and white,

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:39.680
because that's my
background, and this

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.804
looks very black and white.

00:37:40.804 --> 00:37:42.020
But I had to play with color.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:47.620
And I said, what if this is in
a transit place, this house?

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:52.490
What if we made it in a
transit place in its own world?

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:55.520
And what if the light
were shining on it

00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.630
and giving it its due
and telling its story?

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:06.660
And what if it were
black and white?

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.870
It's off the screen.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:13.326
That becomes another story--
another way to tell the story.

00:38:13.326 --> 00:38:15.700
And black and white is so
interesting, because there's so

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.920
many shades of black,
and white, and gray,

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.830
and what if we did that?

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.107
And what if we made that
feel like it's another era?

00:38:23.107 --> 00:38:25.440
That looks like photos that
my grandmother used to have,

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.970
that I still have, that
I inherited from her.

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:31.030
Now suddenly, I
feel like I'm there.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:34.990
And then what if we
made it even more stark?

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:37.670
What if we made it so
dramatic and so contrasted

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:41.480
that it tells a whole
different story?

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.730
That's just me playing
my what if game one day.

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:48.180
But that what if, and
then taking the action.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.610
So now we're signature,
we're art and dreaming,

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:54.200
now we're what if'ing, and
now we're putting into action.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.310
Because inspiration is great.

00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:58.580
Dreams are important.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.340
All those things, you've
got to get to those.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.280
But if you don't put it into
action, if you don't actually

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:09.085
put it into something, this
whole creative universe

00:39:09.085 --> 00:39:11.630
that we live in is meant
to be manifested in.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:13.320
It's meant to create things.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:17.070
If you don't create things,
if you don't follow through,

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.880
it kind of just falls flat.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:25.080
So here, by going-- I'm going
to show you some befores

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.970
and afters, only because
we're playing what if, right?

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:31.280
We're going to play
this what if game.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.720
Shot of Siena, it's nice.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.610
It's fine.

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:35.130
It's a good Facebook shot.

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:36.860
Whatever.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.980
So but what if I made
it feel like something

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:46.810
I would find in a curio shop,
or after I dug through an art

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:50.010
store that had some stuff
thrown at the bottom of a box?

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:51.880
What would that look like?

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.670
I love textures.

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:55.400
Of course I love my colors.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.670
This was New Zealand.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:57.680
It had the bones.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.690
It had the right bones.

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:03.760
It had the mountain and the
trees, and the sky just sucked.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.399
It just did.

00:40:04.399 --> 00:40:06.690
It should have been prettier,
but I couldn't come back,

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:07.850
and I was here,
and I'm like, well,

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:09.980
what if I made it look
the way I want it to look?

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:14.550
That's my life right there!

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.640
That's what I want!

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.140
Right?

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.670
So, I mean, again, my husband
can attest to the fact

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:21.290
that I do this to
pretty much everything.

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:25.730
So I'm like, that's how
it should look, by golly.

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:26.702
And then this!

00:40:26.702 --> 00:40:28.660
Oh, my God, how often--
well, maybe some of you

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.060
get to Paris more than I did.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.050
I got there once.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:31.930
And it was snowing.

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:32.610
It was December.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.090
It was a crappy day.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:36.625
I got all this schmoo
all over my lens.

00:40:36.625 --> 00:40:38.000
And I'm looking
at this, I wanted

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.130
to take a really cool-- I call
it Notre Dame-- Notre Dame

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:43.090
shot.

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:45.360
And wow, that's what I got.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.320
That's the raw.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.550
Isn't that pretty?

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.270
And I was like, damn it!

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:50.370
Like, where's sky?

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:51.130
Where's the drama?

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:54.600
Where's the-- But I took it a
little skew-y because again,

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.860
I had that looming thing.

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:59.000
So to me, she's
the school mistress

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.540
and these are her minions.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:03.250
And they run around
and harass the students

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:06.700
and the minions are
like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.880
So that was-- those
are the bones.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.340
I got the bones.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:14.450
It just wasn't all
there, so I put it there.

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:16.380
Because that's what I saw.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.290
That sky-- of course, I've had
this conversation with Brian

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:20.390
in the past.

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:22.840
There was a time when
I didn't do skies,

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:26.490
and he scoffed at
that years ago.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:28.320
And I do skies now.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.990
Because without it,
I wouldn't have that.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.310
And gosh darn it, I only
go through this life once.

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:38.369
I'm going to have
my, that, by golly.

00:41:38.369 --> 00:41:40.410
Because you're not going
to give it to me, right?

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:42.010
Oh, here, I'll give you that.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:42.750
Yeah, right.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:43.500
OK.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.420
I'll make my own.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:45.680
Thank you, very much.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:50.546
So this attitude, you cannot
help but have it travel

00:41:50.546 --> 00:41:51.670
into the rest of your life.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:53.720
You are not a
compartmentalized being.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.040
You're just not.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.180
So you do stuff like
this in your photography

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:59.724
and you start playing, and
playing what if, and actually

00:41:59.724 --> 00:42:01.515
creating something and
putting it out there

00:42:01.515 --> 00:42:03.030
and getting feedback,
and oh, my God!

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:04.390
Pretty soon, you go,
well that was really fun,

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:05.500
where else can I do that?

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.000
Right?

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.070
And that's when your
life starts to change.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:10.060
It's a transformational process.

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.000
So here's that shot I
was telling you about.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.210
I didn't like the boardwalk,
it was too straight.

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:19.160
So I bent it and did that to it.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.690
And this was, God, it should
have been such a good shot.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:23.700
And now it is.

00:42:26.484 --> 00:42:27.150
Same thing here.

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:29.890
I felt like this is
kind of very ent-like.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:31.597
You know, the ents.

00:42:31.597 --> 00:42:33.430
Of like, it's going to
crawl into the water,

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:36.140
and it had its little boulders
already leading the way.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:39.710
So I'm like, it's there, and
yet, it's not really there,

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:40.650
is it?

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:41.760
Oh, yes it is.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.730
Now it is.

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:44.660
And it's got some dream.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.460
You know my mystical mist?

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:47.549
My magic, my dream?

00:42:47.549 --> 00:42:48.340
I got to have that.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.050
Nice shot, it's OK.

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:54.300
Whatever.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.500
Oh, I like it better now.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.810
Yeah, a little texture,
a little extra color.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:42:59.600
It was all there.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.724
I didn't have to add a lot.

00:43:00.724 --> 00:43:03.510
It isn't like I sat there
and made something up.

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:06.130
There's plenty of nights
I've shot on this pond, which

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:12.192
is near my home, that those
colors were in the sky.

00:43:12.192 --> 00:43:17.068
It just didn't happen to me
that night, so I put it there.

00:43:17.068 --> 00:43:18.400
Meh!

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:18.940
So sue me!

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.780
This was OK.

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:29.660
See, I know-- I could see it in
certain lights-- this water was

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:31.796
so incredibly green-blue.

00:43:31.796 --> 00:43:33.170
But in this shot,
it didn't show.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.430
And I was like, oh, yes it does.

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:36.310
Yeah!

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:38.040
That's what I saw.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.030
So this is what I do.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:43.220
I go around playing, what if I
do this, and what if I do that.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:51.150
This, you know, I went and did
the Trey Ratcliff's New Zealand

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.650
Adventure.

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:53.940
I was one of the coaches
for his first one,

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:55.690
and this was one of
the places we went.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.920
And it was an unfortunate sky.

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:03.690
It just was really
boring until I did that.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.247
Because not it's got some drama.

00:44:05.247 --> 00:44:06.205
Like it or not like it.

00:44:06.205 --> 00:44:07.288
You don't have to like it.

00:44:07.288 --> 00:44:08.230
I really don't care.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:12.877
My point is, in
showing you this,

00:44:12.877 --> 00:44:13.960
is, this is how I felt it.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.840
I mean, this is the drama, this
is the color, this is the yum,

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.850
this is what I loved
about this moment,

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:20.440
because this is how I felt.

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.726
The same thing here.

00:44:21.726 --> 00:44:23.350
What was funny about
this this, though,

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:24.810
was I was shooting
this in Hawaii,

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:26.900
this gorgeous, you know,
the sky and everything.

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.690
And I did shoot it HDR,
this is one exposure.

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:31.800
But there was a photographer
out there shooting

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.449
his bride-- he was doing a bride
shoot-- an engagement shoot.

00:44:35.449 --> 00:44:36.990
And they were out
on this rock, and I

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:42.180
was like, you're ruining my
shot-- which is hilarious,

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:42.880
right?

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.450
But I said, oh well, I'm
going to clone stamp you.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:46.180
So I did.

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:46.680
Oops.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.304
I went too far.

00:44:47.304 --> 00:44:48.975
Sorry, hitting this
thing too hard.

00:44:48.975 --> 00:44:50.750
So I clone stamped them.

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:54.290
Gave them a little
Hawaii 5-0 twist,

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:56.550
and we have that, which I like.

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:59.550
And then this was one--
we were going somewhere,

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:02.477
and of course, Trey gets in
his car and, "We're going!

00:45:02.477 --> 00:45:03.310
We're not stopping!"

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:05.851
Well, we do stop sometimes, but
at this point, we were going,

00:45:05.851 --> 00:45:06.910
I'm like, "Wait!"

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:09.094
So I took that as
we went racing by,

00:45:09.094 --> 00:45:11.260
because I was like-- it's
the bones, it's the bones.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:11.900
I see bones.

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.760
I see that.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.880
Because I saw it like
an old canvas painting,

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.990
you know, like stored in Italy.

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:25.910
So this is the point where
you get to take your world

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:29.590
and make it something different.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:31.825
And this is what we did here.

00:45:31.825 --> 00:45:32.653

00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:58.880
Anyone?

00:47:15.698 --> 00:47:16.830
Get me out.

00:47:20.191 --> 00:47:21.185
It's time.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:40.600
KAREN HUTTON: So we did that.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.310
Because I figure,
I have a voice.

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:44.060
I have two voices.

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.050
I'm very fortunate.

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:49.550
I have photography
and I have my voice.

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:50.945
And I'm going to use it.

00:48:50.945 --> 00:48:52.070
I'm going to use them both.

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:53.861
I m going to use them
any way I can come up

00:48:53.861 --> 00:48:55.210
with when I say, what if.

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:56.530
What if I tried this?

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:57.729
Will galleries?

00:48:57.729 --> 00:48:58.270
I don't know.

00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:01.370
I didn't really have a super,
like huge vision for it.

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:04.870
It was just, what if I
take other people's work

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:08.270
and we make a story
about something amazing?

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:12.360
What if we take grunge,
like the pain of death,

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.639
practically, and
reinvigorate with life?

00:49:14.639 --> 00:49:15.680
What does that look like?

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.970
What if we did that?

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:20.720
So that's what that
story was about.

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:24.300
So here's the thing.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:26.910
Is it by living
your life artfully,

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:30.370
by chasing after your
photography an artful way--

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:32.470
think about when you
hold your camera, what's

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:33.740
going to tell the story?

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.650
Is it told better from here?

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:37.410
Is it told better like this?

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:39.420
Is this a straight
documentation,

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.500
or do I want to skew it?

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.440
Think about, well how do I feel?

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.710
What do I stand for?

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:47.680
This is the part in
the story, right,

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.960
we started with legacy,
now it's our dream,

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:51.860
and how it's what if.

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.730
Now we're creating something and
we're moving it into the world.

00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:57.550
Now all of a sudden, it's
a motor, it's a machine,

00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:58.940
it's moving through the world.

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:02.250
And it is leaving your
mark wherever you go.

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:05.130
If you feel invisible,
you are not invisible.

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:08.040
And you'll be less
invisible, feeling invisible,

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.870
if you are thinking
about what you

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:12.560
have to say, what your
stand is going to be,

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.977
what mark you're going to
leave, what people are going

00:50:14.977 --> 00:50:17.060
to say about you and think
about when you're gone.

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.040
Not just from the room,
but from this life.

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.770
Is it going to be different?

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:23.260
Or is it just going to be
the same old, same old?

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.390
I get caught in the same
thing everybody else does.

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:29.190
I work off a list,
which is stupid.

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:31.820
But at the same time, I go,
all right, I've got a list.

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.860
But what does it mean?

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.161
What are the things
that I want to do

00:50:36.161 --> 00:50:37.660
that are going to
make a difference?

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:39.170
What are the things
I want to say?

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:40.170
Who do I want to be?

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:41.980
I can bitch and moan
and whine and complain

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:43.934
better than probably
any of you in here.

00:50:43.934 --> 00:50:44.975
Because I got some drama.

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:48.870
I got some juice behind it.

00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:49.890
But why?

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:51.290
What's the point?

00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:53.980
And when it comes photography,
I can shoot realistic.

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.247
That's my background.

00:50:55.247 --> 00:50:56.330
I can see black and white.

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:59.830
I can be all art and I can
be all traditional, but why?

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:02.220
I know, I have something to
say, and I'm going to say it,

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:03.230
dammit.

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:05.820
So quit arguing with me.

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:10.019
So this is-- I have been
doing a show called, "The Chat

00:51:10.019 --> 00:51:12.310
with Karen Hutton", Sound
byte-sized insights from some

00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:14.320
of the coolest
people on the planet.

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.440
Nichole Young has been on there.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.410
Lauren Rubin has been on there.

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:23.380
And the reason I'm doing it
is because I look around.

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:26.550
I look around at
photographers and their issues

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:28.190
and what they're
trying to accomplish.

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.110
And they want to be more,
they want to be bigger.

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:31.901
They want to be this,
they want to be that.

00:51:31.901 --> 00:51:33.240
We've got to cross train.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:37.070
I've been fortunate to do so
many things-- so many things--

00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:40.330
that I've discovered the thread
that pulls them all together.

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:42.730
And it's the stuff we're
talking about right now.

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:45.490
So on "The Chat", my
goal is to develop,

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:47.580
for however long
I do this show, is

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.240
to develop a library
of people who

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:53.170
are living their life
artfully, thoughtfully,

00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:55.400
in a way that perhaps
isn't traditional.

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:59.169
But who are finding a way
to take that part of them

00:51:59.169 --> 00:52:01.710
that they're passionate about--
these could be photographers,

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:05.450
they could be musicians,
singers, businesspeople,

00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:07.900
they can be anyone who is
living their life a little bit

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:08.400
differently.

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.820
We're going to have a short
chat, it's a 15-minute show.

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.510
And share, OK, so what
have you discovered?

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:15.460
What did you find out?

00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:16.260
You know how when
you get together?

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.760
What did you find
out along the way?

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.530
I want to steal from that.

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:20.900
That's the intent behind there.

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:22.080
And that's why.

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.130
Because these are
people who have taken

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:26.770
those dreams and have put
them out into the world.

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:28.270
How did they do that?

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:28.950
We want to know.

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:34.850
So in moving toward
wrapping this thing up,

00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:39.210
our story signature, we dream,
we what if, we actually do it.

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:40.350
Now we're doing it.

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:42.280
This is when it
informs your life.

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.000
Because it's never enough just
to process a photo this way.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.470
You feel so fricking
good, you want

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:48.320
to do it in your whole life.

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:52.954
So this then becomes,
what is your legacy?

00:52:52.954 --> 00:52:53.870
You're all very young.

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:57.070
Most of you here
are younger than me.

00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:59.050
I'm older than you think.

00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:00.470
And I'm at a point
now in my life

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:02.829
where-- in the
beginning of my life,

00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:05.120
I said, oh my God, there's
so many things I want to do,

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:05.940
I've got to do them all.

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:08.060
That's why Laurie read
such a long list of things.

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.870
Because when I was
really young, I said,

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:10.780
I'm going to do
all these things.

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:12.350
Now have to do these
when I'm young,

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:13.480
because when I get
to be this age,

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:14.730
I'm not going to have
good knees, so I'm

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:16.688
going to be able-- you
know, so I kind of like,

00:53:16.688 --> 00:53:18.610
have worked my way
through my list.

00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:20.896
Now I'm at a point
where I'm like, OK,

00:53:20.896 --> 00:53:22.660
what difference did it all make?

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:26.430
What can I do to help people
who are behind me coming through

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:28.090
to get here faster?

00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:30.010
Why do they have to
suffer the way I did?

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:33.090
I had some amazing mentors--
some amazing people

00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:34.760
in my life who
showed me the way.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:38.220
In elders who lived
by vision and who

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.830
created their life
in a certain way

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:42.360
and informed my art and my life.

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.940
That's kind of who I want to be.

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:46.190
If I'm talking about light,
and journey, and lines,

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:49.760
and so on and so forth, what
is my legacy going to be?

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.570
And it shows up in my art work.

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:54.000
It absolutely shows
up in my photography.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.760
I'll pass up shots because
I'm like, that's a nice shot,

00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:58.820
but what's the point?

00:53:58.820 --> 00:53:59.617
What's the story?

00:53:59.617 --> 00:54:00.700
I'm always walking around.

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:02.770
If I see something that
attracts me, and I go,

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:03.790
OK, OK, this is cool.

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:05.070
This is cool, but
what's the story?

00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:05.778
What's the story?

00:54:05.778 --> 00:54:06.700
What's the story?

00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:09.040
And that tells me
where to put my camera.

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:13.342
And then I most often see it
processed, but sometimes not.

00:54:13.342 --> 00:54:15.925
Sometimes I just know the vibe,
and I know if I shoot it right

00:54:15.925 --> 00:54:18.740
and compose it right,
it's going to talk to me.

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.330
You all know now,
that actually happens.

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:24.990
It's going to talk to me
when I go to process it.

00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:31.970
So you and your
photography-- I challenge you

00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:33.760
to this-- what
will be your story?

00:54:36.115 --> 00:54:37.240
What are you going to tell?

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.580
What words are you going to use?

00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:40.990
How is it going to
inform your life?

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:43.590
How are you going to
start seeing the world?

00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:44.960
This is the gift that we have.

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.046
Artists have to take weeks, and
months, and years, sometimes

00:54:48.046 --> 00:54:48.920
to create their work.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:51.310
All we got to do is
hold up a camera.

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:53.807
What's the story?

00:54:53.807 --> 00:54:55.890
What difference you're
going to make to the people

00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:57.014
who come along behind you?

00:54:57.014 --> 00:54:58.680
And how are you going
to tell that story

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.179
through your
photographs, which will

00:55:00.179 --> 00:55:01.470
evolve as you go through life?

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:02.352
It'll change.

00:55:02.352 --> 00:55:03.560
Like, I'm all into color now.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:04.740
I may go back to
black and white.

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.156
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

00:55:06.156 --> 00:55:09.330
I just know that every
moment I go into a photograph

00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:11.770
and process, there's
this creative muse

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:14.794
who says, "I'd like some
more texture, please."

00:55:14.794 --> 00:55:15.960
And I give her more texture.

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:17.260
I don't argue with her anymore.

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:19.260
And like, I used to say, "Oh,
that's not going to work."

00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:21.020
Because she'll go,
"Fine, whatever."

00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:23.420
And then I don't hear
from her again for a year.

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:24.550
That's sucks.

00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:30.110
So now, I listen to her.

00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:33.660
So I really believe,
I feel, I experience,

00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:36.510
and I see, that in our
photography and in our art,

00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:40.944
there is the possibility-- maybe
the only possibility you have

00:55:40.944 --> 00:55:42.610
in your life at this
time, I don't know,

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:46.350
I don't know your lives, but to
allow that spark of divine fire

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:49.960
to come through you,
inform your art,

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:51.540
and it will inform your life.

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:52.760
You'll have no choice.

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:57.610
So I see that my signature
is my point of view.

00:55:57.610 --> 00:56:05.620
I see that my legacy is actually
my soul's voice enlivened

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:08.070
by the breath of the divine.

00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:09.790
Oddly enough, I see it that way.

00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:13.820
And that my art and my
photography is my gateway.

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.310
And I'm not going to tell
anybody what to make of it.

00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:17.360
I'm just going to do it.

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.500
I'm just going to show
up with guns blazing

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:23.550
and do the best I can put
that across and let it go.

00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:26.030
Because I'm not going to
tell you what to think.

00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:31.440
But I'm going to do
my best to share it.

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:35.120
It was George Bernard Shaw who
said, "I have my own soul--

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.805
my own spark of divine fire."

00:56:36.805 --> 00:56:39.110
And he said it in
"Pygmalion," the book

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:42.380
that became "My Fair Lady."

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:44.701
Henry Higgins was all
mad when he said this

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:46.200
because Eliza had
walked out on him.

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.230
he's like, "You can't
do that to be, me!

00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:49.390
I have my own soul!

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:52.320
My own spark of divine fire!"

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.010
But it is so true, so applies
to what we're all doing here,

00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:57.950
and to what you're all are doing
at Google, which is incredible.

00:56:57.950 --> 00:57:01.970
And Google+ has changed
so many live-- mine!

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:04.350
The opportunities and the
things that I think about

00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:08.400
because of Google+ and because
of the spark of divine fire

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:12.880
that you all have brought
has changed everything.

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.780
So I hope you keep doing it.

00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:18.510
I hope you keep letting
all of us do it.

00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:20.790
And that you just let it
come through and let it

00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:22.860
be whatever it's
going to be next.

00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:25.890
Because it will be amazing.

00:57:25.890 --> 00:57:31.160
And so, the light prevails.

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.450
And thank you.

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:35.890
I hope you take
that into your life.

00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:36.390
Thanks.

00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:39.516
[APPLAUSE]
