The answer is, you can't assign an object of a class to a variable of an

00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:06.683
interface type the object's class does not implement. We've seen that it's

00:00:06.683 --> 00:00:10.579
possible to assign an object of a class to a variable of an interface type. And

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:13.159
this declaration isn't trying to assign a value of an interface type to a

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:17.790
variable of a class type. We can create a rectangle without too much trouble,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.510
but rectangle doesn't implement drawable. So we can't store the rectangle that

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.607
we created in a variable of type drawable. This is a little bit weird, since

00:00:26.607 --> 00:00:29.883
the rectangle actually does have a draw method, and the drawable interface

00:00:29.883 --> 00:00:34.823
promises that it will have a draw method and nothing else. The problem is that

00:00:34.823 --> 00:00:39.097
rectangle doesn't say that it implements drawable. For all Java knows, these

00:00:39.097 --> 00:00:43.850
two drawable methods could be completely different. If we wanted to save a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.750
rectangle in a drawable variable, we would need to change the rectangle class

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.017
to say that it implements drawable.
