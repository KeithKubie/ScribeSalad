1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:06,140
And we're live Tony Hinchcliffe.
Hello Jake. The fucking snake.

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,620
I can't believe it, man. I've got
to do this. What do you know, Joe?

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,520
Have you ever heard of that before? I've
heard it a couple of times. I've heard,

4
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:17,690
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your old lady
down a few times as well. There you go.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,930
I gotta tell you, man, I watched a
documentary last night and it's fantastic.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,800
I appreciate it. It is. If that
thing doesn't bring tears to you, I,

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,680
you need to go to a doctor.
You're not human man. No doubt.

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,330
That is Dallas is a fucking
Saint. He really is hard headed,

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,780
you know? Uh, without it, I'd never
made it. Yeah. Cause um, you know,

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,090
was junkies and way like a lie a
lot. You know, and alcoholics do too.

11
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:44,870
But it was a tough, tough road
man. And he guided me through it.

12
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,610
He's never gazing, never gave
up. And I can never think of,

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:48,990
I mean,

14
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,700
not for what he's done for me and given
me all my life back and not only my life

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,600
and my family. I got my kids back
her, they're all digging me now.

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,080
I'm a great grandfather. Would
probably be the best grand. Yeah.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,540
Father ever as you know. I'm just
saying because it's true. Anybody,

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,370
I'll pick anybody up man.

19
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:10,371
I mean the detailing of your recovery
though and him taking you into the,

20
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,790
what does he call his house? That
house? The, the accountability house.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,900
Accountability crib. Yeah. Yeah. I
mean he's a special guy. It really is.

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,830
You got to, can understand. I mean,

23
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,310
no man in his right mind would bring one
much less two drunks into their home.

24
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:30,841
You know,

25
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:34,350
you got to expect tragedy and there's
going to be something come bad out of

26
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:37,890
this. And uh, he was able to
hold us together, man. I mean,

27
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:38,880
there were a couple of brief,

28
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,230
brief moments that though that kinda
escalated and got kind of stupid, but um,

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,450
you wouldn't give up man.

30
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,540
Well, I got to know Dallas when
he came on the podcast and one,

31
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:53,130
one thing that you get about him is this
guy, he, he's not just about himself.

32
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,010
Like he is really about
helping people out.

33
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,140
He gets a buzz off helping people and,
which is to me is just so amazing.

34
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:03,600
And I've picked that up off of him.

35
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,710
I searched people out now in the crowd
that are having a hard time walking or

36
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:11,070
you see something going on or they're
overweight and you go like, man, you know,

37
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:14,100
I'm so and so and it gets me in
using the name Jake the snake.

38
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,800
I can talk to him. Hey,
you ever thought about um,

39
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,990
trying some DDP yoga man because it
works and if you've never done it,

40
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,090
DDP yoga is without a doubt.

41
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:27,650
The number one thing out there
for getting healthy man, it

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,670
makes your body healthy, makes your
mind healthy, you know? And uh,

43
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,480
for him to be out there,
he's just a soldier. Yeah.

44
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:41,250
He really pushes all day long
man. And uh, here's a guy that,

45
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,950
that they could be handling
in a totally different way,

46
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,910
but he still picks up the phone and call
somebody and thinks them for buying the

47
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:50,500
program. Yeah, the hell does that. Right.

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,450
What does that he does cause he wants
to know. And the next thing you know,

49
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:58,410
he's been on a 25 minute phone call
and they're sending him photos over the

50
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:02,080
before and then he wants to look at it
and after picturing and six months from

51
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:06,250
now, the stories, he's got a million
of them. We put success stories.

52
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,100
We played a video when he was in of a
gentleman who was a paratrooper. Yeah,

53
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,540
guy could barely walk. I mean he had
done a bunch of paratroop missions,

54
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,780
you know, parachuting out of
planes and landing on his knees.

55
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,240
His knees are destroyed, legs
are destroyed, backs destroyed.

56
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,890
Everything's fucked up. But he
starts out barely can stand,

57
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:30,480
barely can walk. Two canes. Yeah,
two canes. By the end of the video,

58
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:32,730
this guy's running, he's wanting,

59
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,770
he's doing full yoga poses and it's
these animal incremental steps,

60
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,710
incremental steps, but he kept
getting better, kept getting better,

61
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:45,690
kept getting better. And that is, it's
so symbolic of like your journey in life.

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,460
If you just decided to give up
and decide to just fuck the world.

63
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:54,420
I'm just going to just eat and drink
myself into olivion. You have been there.

64
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:55,254
You can talk.

65
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,510
I stayed there a long time man. But then
you turn it around. But that's, that's,

66
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:02,600
I fucking love that and
love stories like that.

67
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,610
But it's a one in a million shot man.

68
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,120
Unless you have a diamond
Dallas page in your corner.

69
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,070
Because it wasn't only about Dallas
helping me, it was the whole crew. Right.

70
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,550
See Dallas, you know he came up
with the idea, him and Steve,

71
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:20,840
you as a business manager,
whatever. And they said, look,

72
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:22,100
you know we're going to
bring you back through this.

73
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:23,390
We want to film the whole thing.

74
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,210
I'm like [inaudible] I don't know about
that cause I got burnt bad in the film

75
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,410
here. Walk back, you know, and they just
cut me a new one, man. They lied to me.

76
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:35,150
And anyway, it happens.
Film, this whole thing.

77
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:37,660
And at the end of it, if we put
it together and you don't like it,

78
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,560
we'll never go out. Really?
You're going to give me that ride.

79
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,610
You're going to invest this
money and this time, because we,

80
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,270
I stayed there for three and a half
years cause he took me that long to get

81
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:53,750
clean. That's amazing. You know,
I couldn't go in for six months.

82
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,160
I've done that. I can get him going
for four months. I've done that. Hell,

83
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,930
the time I went in for four months,
man, I'd go across the stage.

84
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:02,270
You get my diploma so to speak,

85
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,500
from finishing this course and
being in rehab for four months,

86
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,860
I go out the other side, pick up
a pay phone and call my dealer.

87
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:14,780
He meets me outside the damn door, man
with big rock, you know, in a stim.

88
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,860
Thank you. I made it, but that's
the insanity. The disease.

89
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,420
The disease will let you sit in a place
for three or four months and not touch.

90
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,080
You won't even come knocking on your
door because it knows right now you're

91
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,400
locked into your going to do this,

92
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,880
but it's over there doing pushups in
the corner, man, waiting on your ass.

93
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,510
Soon as you get away from
these idiots over here,

94
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,600
they're teaching you bad habits. Jake. A,

95
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:42,770
I'm going to get you where you need to
be and that was the thing of being there

96
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:46,700
for that long period of time. What was
the feeling like when you did slip up?

97
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,740
Because you [inaudible] a couple of
times. Four or five times. I did. Yeah.

98
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,950
It was horrible.

99
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:57,010
I wanted to die because not only
did I feel like I let myself down,

100
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,100
I'll blow him down and that really sucked
because here's a guy is opened up his

101
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:07,850
wallet and said, you can live with
me. Don't worry about your damn bills.

102
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,050
I'll take care of them. Excuse me.
Oh damn damn sure in now. You know,

103
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,390
you don't have to talk twice
to me about this scramble.

104
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,910
Y'all moving in with your brother.
If you go pay all my bills, man,

105
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,720
when I get healthy. But I never even
thought it was going to take three years.

106
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,910
Wow. Let's see. He would take, you know,

107
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:25,940
like if he had to go do a con
or go do some music, you know,

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,860
go to go do a movie or something. He
had people that work for DVP yoga,

109
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,650
specifically Garrett and in a
young kid named Dylan, who I,

110
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,960
I really got the kid messed up, you know,

111
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:43,710
because he had to share a room with
me. I don't wear clothes. Okay.

112
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,850
And I guess he looked kind
of freaky. You know, here's,

113
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,660
here's this old wrestler that I idolized
for years and I've seen his junk,

114
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,430
all gray hair and everything,

115
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,320
but his joke is seeing the snake and the
bags gently bent over picking something

116
00:06:58,321 --> 00:07:03,060
up right there by his bed. I had no idea
my asshole was in his mouth. But uh,

117
00:07:03,061 --> 00:07:06,150
yeah, Dylan, he lived through some
horrible things and Karen did too.

118
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:11,070
But Dallas always made sure I've
taken care of, you know, he,

119
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,760
whatever he had to do, the first thing
you had to do was take care of Jake.

120
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,960
And he put me first. I
didn't expect that we would.

121
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,710
The solidarity in the, the
comradery that you guys all have,

122
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,100
you razor Ramon as well, when you
guys are all in that house together,

123
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:32,101
like the experiences that you guys
shared working together and then still in

124
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:35,930
life, you know, you guys have
a bond that's very, very, it's,

125
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,070
it's very hard for most people. Yeah.

126
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,490
You know, it's like, it's
like guys that are, you know,

127
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,980
in the service together and there's
just something that becomes,

128
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:47,760
they become brothers and one man.
No. And that with Dallas, you know,

129
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:50,910
the thing about him was he's
never went down that addiction,

130
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,140
that addiction road.

131
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,630
I used to run nightclubs but he never
became an alcoholic. He's a freak.

132
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Piss on him. Screw him. You've
got a better car than I did. Okay.

133
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:06,150
I get that then I like my
cars. My cards now are awesome.

134
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,410
My life is so good too.

135
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,960
To go from hell cause
that's where I was at man.

136
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:17,961
You have no idea what it's like to wake
up and be angry that you woke up cause

137
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:20,790
you didn't want you want,
you want it to be over.

138
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,370
And there's been so many years that were
like that for me that I wouldn't go out

139
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:29,880
shopping and this was 3:00 AM I
didn't want anybody to see me.

140
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,310
Cause I had gotten to the point that I
hated myself so much and I'm begging God

141
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:38,370
to die. Uh, when I would
hear another wrestler died,

142
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,850
I'd get angry at God and curse him for
not taking me. Instead, when Piper died,

143
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:46,650
we were just talking about Rodney
before the show started. Man,

144
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:51,330
I was so pissed off that he got to go
before I did. And that's just wrong,

145
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:55,050
man. I mean, even when I tried to
Odie a couple of times, you know,

146
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,650
really tried, I took a
hundred value. Jesus Christ,

147
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,750
10 milligram value woke up and all
I've done is PUCO myself and I said,

148
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,010
what a fucking loser you are. You can't
even die, right? You're a piece of shit.

149
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,840
What kind of mind says that
it's, mine is given up.

150
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,010
The torture that people put themselves
through an addict, people will get,

151
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,890
he had the wrong idea about this
shit, man. They think, yeah,

152
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:24,060
they're out there getting fucked up,
man. They're happy. No, we're not. No,

153
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:27,390
we're not happy. We're
not enjoying getting high.

154
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,840
I quit enjoying getting high 30 years ago,

155
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,180
but the problem was I couldn't
live without it. I mean,

156
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:40,140
I would feel like my heart was
going to burst. I couldn't breathe.

157
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,680
I was scared to go anywhere.
Shit. It was horrible.

158
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,330
Was it everything or anything?
Like what, what, what was drawn?

159
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:51,810
What was pulling you, what drug
or what out? What was it? Booze.

160
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,030
For me it was more, I was
at more everything. I,

161
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,230
I'm lucky I didn't get to
in the heroin, you know,

162
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:01,920
I probably wouldn't have beat that one,
but uh, yeah I would because that's,

163
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,750
this is what I'm meant to
be doing right now, but to,

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,870
to go through 25, 30
years of doing cocaine,

165
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,720
it's amazing. You know,

166
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,760
I think Vince McMahon for affording me
my addiction because without it I'd be in

167
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:23,490
prison somewhere cause I would have
killed somebody from my drug. No,

168
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:25,860
I without a doubt I would've,
you know, knifed him, whatever,

169
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:30,861
man you got that guys got an eight ball
watch this done life meant nothing to

170
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,560
me, man. And it gets to a point where

171
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,910
you put yourself in such a dark hole.

172
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,570
There is no light, none at all.
And it takes somebody that special.

173
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:48,970
You couldn't have sent me to
rehab right then and worked. God,

174
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,340
I'd have been out in the in minutes
even when Dallas offered me to,

175
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,110
to pay the whole trip. And uh,

176
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,320
you'll move in with him with feed
you the best damn food on the planet.

177
00:10:57,321 --> 00:11:00,230
We're going to get you healthy real to
get the bullshit out of your system.

178
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:01,880
I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

179
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm going to last about a week now
because I knew me and I'm like, dude,

180
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:08,090
if I'm making a week, I'm
going to be doing good.

181
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,870
Cause it's a time I couldn't
do 24 hours not doing cocaine.

182
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,720
Wow. If you wanted me to get up out
of bed, pray me some go. Okay. Wow.

183
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,380
That's where I was at
because life was too ugly

184
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,160
to want to go out there.
When did it start?

185
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,120
Did it start when you pro wrestling
career started or was it going on before

186
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,900
then? No, uh, the cocaine and alcohol,

187
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:37,820
alcohol was always there. I mean I
started drinking when I was 11 or 12.

188
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,880
Whoa. My, uh, grandfather was an alcoholic

189
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,520
drug addict slash drug addict cause
it started with an oil field accident.

190
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,740
He got his legs crushed and he
refused to have his legs cut off.

191
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,680
So he stayed in the for 18
months. Well, back in the 1920s,

192
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:02,050
the way that they fixed you was let
it heal then rebreak it, you know,

193
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,251
that's what they did.

194
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:06,520
They didn't put Mars and metal
in there to straighten it out.

195
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,380
They'd let it heal. Then they'd
rebreak break in a different way. Oh.

196
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,630
And they kept him a deck,

197
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,370
kept him on morphine for year and
a half was the end of the year.

198
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:17,230
And had they patted him
on the back. See ya,

199
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,540
he had a little itch going
out there, didn't he? Yeah,

200
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,520
he could walk. So it worked.

201
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,090
But it took your mind until
you're hooked up on morphine,

202
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,110
which back then it wasn't like today
you can get on any corner. Right.

203
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,910
He went to alcohol. I remember in
the 60s, which is 40 years later,

204
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,750
they not trusted him to come
to the doctor's office. Well,

205
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,970
they didn't trust him to take the
pill, the pill, the pill being,

206
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,810
Oh my God, what's it called?
Keep me from drinking, um,

207
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,290
and abuse, you know,
he'd taken an abuse bill,

208
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,420
you're not going to drink
about, he said he did. I mean,

209
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:06,421
I've drank on an abuse when it's been
like two days since I'd had the pill and I

210
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:12,691
have a drink or you have no idea how
scary that shit is because immediately you

211
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,930
start throwing up and you start
pissing and shitting your pants.

212
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,520
It happens that quick.

213
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,640
And then you have to start with the
sweats and all this and you'll wind up on

214
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:25,570
the floor doing the heebie jeebies man,
that sounds strong and abuse as well.

215
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,080
They didn't even trust him to
take the pill. They said, no, no.

216
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,310
You take a taxi to the doctor's office
and we'll give you a shot cause we know

217
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:35,980
you're not gonna take that bill.

218
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,900
So he'd do that every morning and he'd
go outside and get in the same taxi.

219
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,960
And because we lived in a dry County,

220
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,120
he would take that same taxi over to the
next County and get a fifth of whiskey

221
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,760
trained yet before he got home.

222
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,450
Now the rest of his day spent
shitty in Buchanan. Wow.

223
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,820
But yet tomorrow he don't do the same
thing. Oh my God, that's the hell.

224
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,350
You know, I was doing the, you
know, doing the Coke and stuff. Man,

225
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,510
I'm hating myself the whole time I do it.

226
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,740
I'm not getting high anymore
and I can't put it down.

227
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:16,560
I can't turn away from it.
Cause there's hope in that.

228
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,160
What's the hope for no more pain?

229
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,110
So just that it numbed no more shame.
That's what it numbed me is a shame.

230
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,780
You know? Shame is something
you put on yourself. You know,

231
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,530
you can't shame me, man.
I have to do it myself.

232
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,930
The man who was their man in, because
I'd went through some ugly shit as a kid,

233
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:45,500
being sexually molested, my
sister being molested too.

234
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:49,880
And then my sister kidnapped and murdered
and we got all these things thrown in

235
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:52,670
there and I was hating myself. I
didn't protect my sister better,

236
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,060
you know, and just, you know, life
happens. What do you do with it?

237
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,970
That's one of the things that
Dallas preaches, you know, is about,

238
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,360
he got all this stuff out there,
man, he's going to come at you.

239
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,790
I just want you to do with his accounts.
You know, you don't deflect it. No,

240
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,930
you bring it to you, you chew it
up, you spit it out, he slept,

241
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:19,100
sift through the bullshit and you go
on, there's something I couldn't do

242
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,870
cause then you got personal
with me and I would lock down.

243
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,110
I'd shut up cause that's
how I handle things.

244
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,550
I just didn't talk about it. When
you've been sexually molested,

245
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,090
I'm very is no good moment
and that screwed my head
up and it still messes with

246
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:42,790
my head. I desperately,
desperately want that.

247
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,480
A relationship with a
woman. No true relationship.

248
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,650
Finally it's 63 what goes.

249
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:56,651
I did have relationships before that I
was constantly sabotaging them because I

250
00:15:57,561 --> 00:16:00,080
didn't trust women.
That goes, the last one,

251
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,260
she raped me and beat me and threatened
me and told her she had my dad killed me

252
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:06,440
because you know,

253
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,400
my dad was seven foot and weighed 425
pounds so he could get the job done.

254
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,220
But I just wanted my
dad to be proud of me.

255
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:14,990
So all these things are factoring in,

256
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,770
keeping them quiet while the wife beats
me and has me do her and then beats me

257
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:22,550
afterwards. Dude, sex ain't sex.
If you're doing it like that,

258
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,960
they're called rape and then shit
screws your head up for life.

259
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,300
Now what do you do with it? Well,
is it cute? I hid that shit man.

260
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,350
I stuffed it away. I didn't talk
about that. Are you kidding me?

261
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,340
When do you remember the first time
talking about it to a high school buddy of

262
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:42,530
mine? He said you're so fucking lucky man.

263
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:45,520
You're your stepmother's
still fucking hot. She was on,

264
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,090
she's 22 years old cause my father's
a child molester for Christ's sake.

265
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,460
Of course she was hot but it wasn't
hot to me because that's my mom.

266
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,200
No. And then the BDS afterwards
was, that fucking confuses you.

267
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,190
You got all this shit going man.
So you start looking for a way out.

268
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,880
And for me as a kid,

269
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:13,010
my grandfather would get drunk and forget
where he hit his liquor cause he had

270
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:15,260
to hide it from her grandmother
cause she knew what he was,

271
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,390
she had dealt with it for 50 years.

272
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,890
So every time she found a bottle on
the farm, she break it and that's it.

273
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,400
So you'd hide it, the chicken
house, different places.

274
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,770
Well me and my buddies
from across the street,

275
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,660
we'd go out and find it getting
12 years old, 11 years old.

276
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,110
Then we got smart and started selling
into the other neighborhood. Kids,

277
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:40,970
you know, make a buck. That was my
beginning of drinking man. And uh,

278
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,880
you know, as time goes on man,
you start smoking weed, uh,

279
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:53,100
in the pills. What else is next?
Cause I'm still not forgetting,

280
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,200
I'm still remembering this shit.

281
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,720
And you go out and you'd try to have
a good time with people and then you

282
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,130
realize something's different than
you because drugs it put you to sleep.

283
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,300
Wake me up, downers.

284
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,570
Wake me up. The counsel. I wired

285
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,130
you gave me five Percocet, brother.

286
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,460
I'll break a case of beer
and dance all night for you.

287
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,540
Really go out and have three or four
wrestling matches. Let's go to the ed.

288
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,950
If I take it this way,

289
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,870
whenever miss my neck up in 89
[inaudible] here's a guitar.

290
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,050
When I wanted to go to the gym, my
regimen was to wake up, go downstairs,

291
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:41,220
starts coffee maker, take two
men, 10 milligram Percocet,

292
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:46,200
don't them my mouth. Chew him up
and wash him down with the coffee,

293
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:50,700
then hit the gym. Jesus. I loved
it because I was on fire man.

294
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,260
Plus the purchase that made me a little
gnarly made me want to punch it in.

295
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:58,810
Really? So you get a good
workout and from Percocet,

296
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,620
that's how screwed up my wiring is.

297
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,190
That is so you don't get any drug and
they'll tell you their wirings fluff.

298
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,200
Yeah. Things that make you go to sleep.
Wake me up. Things that wake you up,

299
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,710
put me to sleep. So the,
the pain of pro-wrestling,

300
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,860
which is probably one of the most brutal
professions that a person can embark

301
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,740
and write. And think about all the days
that you were on the road. All the many,

302
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:23,580
many matches,

303
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:28,790
all that physical pain probably
justified the drugs even more.

304
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,690
I didn't even care. He didn't care
about the pattern. I, I don't, I,

305
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,660
I felt no pain. I wrestled

306
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,800
none afterwards. No,

307
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:46,110
I was wrestling in guy in
Louisiana. Ernie the cat lad.

308
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,100
You remember him playing for
the AFL San Diego chargers.

309
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,330
He's in the hall of fame, put ball
in wrestling. He was six, nine,

310
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:57,170
three 50 bad-ass on the
pitch, man, you know,

311
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,870
but back then they had chatbox and he had
like 15 knee surgeries and that was in

312
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:01,704
his career.

313
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,160
But we were wrestling and my bone came
out of my arm compound fracture and he

314
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:12,060
goes, kid your arm. I'm like, yeah, I
see it. Just come on. And he's like,

315
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:14,120
why get away from me and I,

316
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:19,050
I'm trying to get to him and he starts
puking on me like, mother fucker,

317
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:23,550
you puking on me. You're our man.
You're on his fucking bone, dude.

318
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,190
I'm like, your daughter. Come
on us, finished the match.

319
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:32,520
Fuck you. I'm getting out already, man.

320
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,350
He could pick up a bunch
of shit, man. Yeah.

321
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,050
You finish off your opponent by
having him hernia. Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

322
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,110
Is nasty smelling shit to me. But I was
fine. They got back in the locker room.

323
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,770
No, I was sitting there
and I was, I was saying,

324
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,930
this is a strange thing
that I blow on the bone.

325
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,330
It feels cold not blowing
that boom. Oh wow. Whoa.

326
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,140
15 minutes later I'm in
the shower. Holy fuck.

327
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,380
Oh the fuck bone. You felt
it. The adrenaline's gone.

328
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,680
You've been in the ring and you know what
that's like. The adrenaline is going,

329
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,200
nothing hurts. It feels good. Invite.

330
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,470
You know what I would've thought that
you would look at the bone and go, Ooh,

331
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,120
I've got to handle this now. Why
did you wrestle fucked up? No, no.

332
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:20,110
Wrestled straight, no straight part
much. You know, and I been going through,

333
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,530
uh, withdrawals at the time, but uh, no,

334
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:25,450
I didn't drink or either shit before,

335
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,870
before match and I didn't like it,

336
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,290
but I did it that way because it's my,

337
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,433
and, uh,

338
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,730
my thing is another wrestler
to take care of my opponent.

339
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:46,160
I noticed that after if I have like
a fun set or something like that.

340
00:21:46,161 --> 00:21:49,430
Doing standup comedy that I
like to have. Like if it went,

341
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,670
if I tried something new
and it w it went extra good,

342
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,160
I like to have an extra
drink or two that night.

343
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:58,580
Would it be like that for you in
wrestling? Would you get more messed up?

344
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,590
It was like Madison square garden or

345
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,300
no, I'm just kidding.

346
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:07,130
Until I went to sleep because sleep
was such a premium back then. You know,

347
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,570
back in, back in my day, we were wrestling
seven days a week, seven days a week.

348
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,810
Well except for Saturday and Sunday.
Then we wrestled twice on Saturday,

349
00:22:14,811 --> 00:22:16,340
twice on Sunday. Jesus,

350
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,440
like you might do the LA Coliseum at two
o'clock in the rental car and drive to

351
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:24,170
San Diego scene the seven o'clock wow.

352
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:27,500
The next day you might be an Omaha at two
o'clock then you'd be in Des Moines at

353
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:30,920
seven o'clock and you're driving all
this in between. You know, you fly,

354
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:32,980
you drive, boom. Well with me,

355
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,990
it made it even worse cause I got to
drag that fucking snake everywhere.

356
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,130
80 pound box of shit, right?

357
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,620
Be like having to carry this
around with a bad back over there.

358
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:45,680
Hey folks out there. Pray for
him, man, he's over there.

359
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,210
Who and moving back here.

360
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,090
He's making fun of young Jamie
and Jamie is a minor in frack.

361
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,150
It's very difficult to talk about
injuries when you were on changes.

362
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,510
Totally threw me under the bus. So
let me, before when I first got here,

363
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,370
he's like, I pulled my back the other day,

364
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,560
but I don't want to mention
it in front of Jake the snake,

365
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,630
cause it's embarrassing. He should be
embarrassed towards man. He tore his man,

366
00:23:08,631 --> 00:23:11,280
giant sneezed in toward his band jars.
