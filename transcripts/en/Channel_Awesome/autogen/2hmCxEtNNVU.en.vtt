and yeah it was a bumpy ride I think
second<00:29:43.560><c> season</c><00:29:43.890><c> was</c><00:29:43.980><c> definitely</c><00:29:44.130><c> weakest</c><00:29:44.820><c> as</c>

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
second season was definitely weakest as
 

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.550 align:start position:0%
second season was definitely weakest as
they<00:29:45.150><c> were</c><00:29:45.210><c> trying</c><00:29:45.420><c> to</c><00:29:45.630><c> rewrite</c><00:29:46.080><c> this</c><00:29:46.320><c> from</c>

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
they were trying to rewrite this from
 

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.540 align:start position:0%
they were trying to rewrite this from

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:47.550 align:start position:0%
the ground up
 

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.070 align:start position:0%
the ground up
seems<00:29:47.970><c> like</c><00:29:48.120><c> second</c><00:29:48.480><c> season</c><00:29:48.720><c> to</c><00:29:48.780><c> me</c><00:29:48.870><c> probably</c>

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
seems like second season to me probably
 

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.630 align:start position:0%
seems like second season to me probably
should<00:29:49.380><c> have</c><00:29:49.410><c> been</c><00:29:49.560><c> the</c><00:29:49.710><c> first</c><00:29:49.890><c> police</c><00:29:50.430><c> and</c>

we're gonna do the gravity falls shorts
 

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.970 align:start position:0%
we're gonna do the gravity falls shorts
okay<00:32:42.120><c> sure</c><00:32:42.360><c> yeah</c><00:32:42.540><c> sasai</c><00:32:43.200><c> enough</c><00:32:43.470><c> people</c><00:32:43.800><c> keep</c>

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:46.890 align:start position:0%
asking us I say we do that and they're
 

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:48.980 align:start position:0%
asking us I say we do that and they're
short<00:32:47.220><c> obviously</c><00:32:47.790><c> so</c><00:32:48.030><c> one</c><00:32:48.240><c> yeah</c><00:32:48.420><c> well</c><00:32:48.780><c> we'll</c>

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:48.990 align:start position:0%
short obviously so one yeah well we'll
 

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:50.570 align:start position:0%
short obviously so one yeah well we'll
fill<00:32:49.230><c> in</c><00:32:49.380><c> some</c><00:32:49.620><c> of</c><00:32:49.650><c> the</c><00:32:49.740><c> gaps</c><00:32:49.890><c> so</c><00:32:50.010><c> then</c><00:32:50.220><c> I</c><00:32:50.370><c> think</c>

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
fill in some of the gaps so then I think
 

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.770 align:start position:0%
fill in some of the gaps so then I think
we<00:32:50.700><c> should</c><00:32:50.850><c> do</c><00:32:50.940><c> over</c><00:32:51.120><c> the</c><00:32:51.210><c> garden</c><00:32:51.480><c> wall</c><00:32:51.540><c> at</c>

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:51.780 align:start position:0%
we should do over the garden wall at
 

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.870 align:start position:0%
we should do over the garden wall at
some<00:32:51.930><c> point</c><00:32:52.170><c> yeah</c><00:32:52.650><c> I</c><00:32:52.680><c> haven't</c><00:32:53.400><c> seen</c><00:32:53.640><c> that</c><00:32:53.790><c> yet</c>
