00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.620
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.190
In this video what
I'd like us to do

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.350
is practice Taylor series.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.360
So I want us to write
the Taylor series

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.960
for the following
function, f of x

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.126
equals 3 x cubed plus 4 x
squared minus 2x plus 1.

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:23.500
So why don't you
pause the video,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.680
take some time to work on
that, and then I'll come back

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.680
and show you what I get.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.400
All right, welcome back.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.590
Well, we want to find the Taylor
series for this polynomial

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.860
f of x equals 3 x cubed plus
4 x squared minus 2x plus 1.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.120
So what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to write down

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.120
Taylor's-- or the expression
we have for the sum,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.820
for the Taylor series in general
and then I'm going to start

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.220
computing what I need and
I'm going to see what I get.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.650
So what do I need to remember?

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.270
Well let's remind ourselves
what the formula is.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.780
We should get f of x is
equal to the sum from n

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.770
equals 0 to infinity of the
nth derivative of f at 0 over n

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.550
factorial times x to the n.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.770
So that's what we want.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.840
So what I obviously
need to start doing

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.156
is figuring out
derivatives of f at 0.

00:01:26.156 --> 00:01:28.030
And so what I'm going
to do is I'm just going

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.230
to make myself a little table.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:40.150
So let's see, we're going
to say f 0 at 0, f 1 at 0,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.516
f 2 at 0, f 3 at 0, f 4 at 0.

00:01:46.516 --> 00:01:47.890
And I'm getting
tired of writing,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.750
so I'm going to stop there.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.060
OK, so let's take the function--
the zeroth derivative of f

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.770
is just the function itself,
so let's come back here.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.280
What is the function if I
evaluate it at x equals 0?

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.250
0, 0, 0, 1.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.750
I get 1.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.460
All right.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.120
What is the first derivative?

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.280
So I'm going to write
out the first derivative

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.220
and then I'm going to say I'm
evaluating it at x equals 0.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.750
So the first derivative looks
like it's 9 x squared plus 8

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.020
x minus 2.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.610
So I'm gonna write this down.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.340
9 x squared plus 8 x minus 2.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.760
Evaluate it at x equals 0.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.800
0, 0.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.800
I get negative 2.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.080
All right, well, let me
take the second derivative.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.020
OK let's see what I get here.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.790
I get 18x plus 8.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.180
And I'm going to evaluate
that at x equals 0.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.950
This is just a way
to write, I'm going

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.760
to evaluate what's here
at x equal this number,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.810
so if you haven't
seen that before.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.040
So I get 8.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.500
OK and then the third
derivative is 18, oh just 18.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.710
Evaluate it at x equals 0.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.180
I get 18.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.640
And then the fourth derivative.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.514
What's the derivative
of a constant function?

00:03:16.514 --> 00:03:18.710
It's 0.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.460
What do you think the fifth
derivative is evaluated at 0?

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.580
Looks like it'll be 0.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.190
You take the sixth derivative.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.940
Looks like everything
bigger than 3--

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:37.770
so the nth derivative at 0 is
equal to 0 for n bigger than 3.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.270
So it looks like we should
only have 4 terms in this.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.875
So that maybe seems a little
weird, but let's keep going

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:45.750
and see what happens.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.041
Let's start plugging things in.

00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:48.944
So again, let's
remember the formula.

00:03:48.944 --> 00:03:50.610
I'm going to walk
over here to the right

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.318
and I'm going to start
using that formula

00:03:52.318 --> 00:03:56.300
and using these numbers that
I have and writing it out.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:03.080
So the first term is going to
be the function evaluated at 0

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.930
divided by 0 factorial times 1.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.150
0 factorial is 1,
so it's just going

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.170
to be the function
evaluated at 0 times 1.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.150
The function evaluated
at 0, we said was 1,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.850
so that's the first term
in the Taylor series.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.881
OK what's the next term?

00:04:17.881 --> 00:04:19.880
The next term, remember,
is the first derivative

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.685
evaluated at 0 divided
by 1 factorial, which

00:04:22.685 --> 00:04:24.995
is still 1, times x.

00:04:24.995 --> 00:04:26.620
So the first derivative,
if I come back

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.750
over here, evaluated
at 0, I get negative 2.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.390
So I'm going to get minus 2x.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.370
The next term, so I had zeroth
derivative, first derivative,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.900
now I'm at the
second derivative.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.840
Now it's getting confusing.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.673
I'm going to start
writing the things above.

00:04:43.673 --> 00:04:45.630
The second derivative
evaluated at 0

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.280
divided by 2 factorial
times x squared.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.725
That's what I should have here.

00:04:49.725 --> 00:04:50.820
Let's come over here.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.180
Second derivative
evaluated at 0 was 8.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.460
So it's going to be 8 over
2, 'cause 2 factorial is 2,

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.330
x squared.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.050
So it's going to be
plus 4 x squared.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.130
And then I have to have the
third derivative evaluated

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.339
at 0 divided by 3
factorial times x cubed.

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:12.130
What's 3 factorial?

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.700
3 factorial is 6.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.760
What was the third
derivative evaluated at 0?

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.180
It was 18.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.680
18 divided by 6 is 3.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.940
So I get plus 3 x cubed.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.830
And all the other terms were 0,
so I'll just stop writing them.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.890
OK now if you watched the
video all the way through here,

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.160
at some point maybe you said
"Christine, this is madness."

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.440
Well why is it madness?

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.690
Because what is this?

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.434
Well this is the
function again, right?

00:05:40.434 --> 00:05:41.850
It's exactly what
we started with.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.770
The order is opposite of
what it was before 'cause now

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.910
the powers go up
instead of down,

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.500
but it's the same polynomial.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.710
OK we talked about
this briefly, I think,

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.370
when we were doing some
quadratic approximations.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.970
And I mentioned way back
that quadratic approximations

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.620
of polynomials at x equals 0
are just the polynomials again.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.270
This is the exact same
kind of thing happening.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.090
Because what is
the Taylor series?

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.450
It's just better and
better approximations

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.300
as n gets larger and larger.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.740
So if I wanted to
have a fourth order

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.390
approximation of this
function f of x at x equals 0,

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.660
I would get the
same function back.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.050
That's really the idea
of what's happening here.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.280
So maybe you saw the sort
of trick in this question,

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.500
and when you saw this
problem you laughed at me

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.125
and you said, "Well
I'm just going

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:34.499
to write down the function
again and I'll be done."

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:36.040
Maybe you didn't
see that right away,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.690
and if you didn't see
that right away that's OK.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.150
I bet you're in good company.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.720
And it's totally fine
because now you've seen this.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.050
You've seen how it works out.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.590
And you know, hey, now any
time I see a polynomial

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.550
and I want to do the Taylor
series for this polynomial,

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.130
I just have to write down
the polynomial again.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.800
So that was the main
goal of this video.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.760
It took us a long time to get
there, but I think we got it.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.620
So the answer to the ultimate
answer to the question of

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.340
write the Taylor series
of this function,

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.950
it's just this function again.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.661
All right, that's
where I'll stop.
