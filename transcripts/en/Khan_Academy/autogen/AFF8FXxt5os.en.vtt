00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.390
 Let's apply what we learned in the last video in the concrete 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.810
 And an example of what the field of power directed by the occupation of something is: 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.560
 It is a passage through a path through the field 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.400
 If we have room for force 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.800
 ID on r2 for xy level 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.160
 So it is a function of xy 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.330
 It connects the directed forces of all points at the level
