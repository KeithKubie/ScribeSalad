00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
(sound of firework going off)

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.759
Ho Ho! Boom hey, what's up guys, welcome back to another random liquid nitrogen experiment

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.148
It's getting close to that time where we celebrate our independence and to help us do that

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.299
I pulled a comment from Thomas Dopkowski who asks "what will happen if you dip fireworks in liquid nitrogen?"

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.849
Now, I've actually seen this request pop up from a number of different people,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.469
but I went with Thomas' comment because he gave me the peace sign and the crown emoji.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.560
You know by now, we do random Liquid nitrogen experiments on a very regular basis

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.219
So, why not throw a batch of fireworks in the liquid nitrogen and see how they react.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.900
Now, this is actually very close to an experiment

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.279
I wanted to try myself for quite a while, and that is putting black powder or gunpowder in liquid nitrogen...

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.599
...how will it react?  Will the gunpowder go off at all and if it does how will that affect the

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.799
performance of the fireworks themselves. So, here's the basic idea of our experiment today,

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.179
I went and found this little styrofoam cooler that we can use to fill up with liquid nitrogen

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.209
and it is the perfect size for dipping down a batch of

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.058
fireworks and let them cool down to cryogenic temperatures. Once they're sufficiently cooled down to liquid nitrogen temperatures,

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.529
we're gonna use a pair of tongs to reach in and grab them, where we'll pull them out and get that fuse lit as quickly as we can.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.729
Will the fuse ignite, will the fireworks light, will the whole thing explode?

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.000
That's we're here to find out because you asked! Now to get started let me show you some of the equipment we're gonna be working with today.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.349
We're gonna start off with some of these Mammoth smoke grenades,

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.700
I'm going to light them by themselves

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.769
so you can see how they react under normal conditions, then, we're going to freeze them and light them off under liquid nitrogen conditions and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.560
observe the difference.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.940
Next we're going to test out some of these artillery shells. These are basically mortar action where we light them, drop them in a tube,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.619
and they shoot themselves off, and we're going to finish our experiment today with this pack of aerials!

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.460
So, if anything goes wrong, well, that's your problem!

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.400
So, here we are, I got all of my smoke flares lined up on these bricks.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.949
We're going to light them all off at the same time, watch them burn and repeat that experiment again,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.170
but this time with them frozen completely solid.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.720
Alright here. We go

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.260
Beautiful!

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.780
That was cool.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.710
I used a blowtorch so I could light them off quicker

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.419
but shooting straight down into them one actually exploded into my face and apparently we didn't judge the wind direction

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.419
correctly because all the smoke blew toward the cameras.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.900
But you can see they have a slow steady burn, they all went for about the same period of time

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.340
and put off very beautiful colors. That was four smoke bombs, four successes. Now, let's dip 'em in the nitrogen and see if that makes a difference.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.900
Here we go, red, yellow, green, blue, taking a bath, making a splash!

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.200
3...

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.900
2...

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.400
1...

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
This is where it all happens.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.629
Let's go ahead and take this container closer to the brick so we can take them out, set them up and light them off

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.720
before they have any kind of a chance to warm up.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.320
There's blue...

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.940
green...

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.060
yellow...

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.680
red...

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.740
In 3 - 2 - 1...

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.700
The blue one's going off, kind of...

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.700
Huh...

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.340
So, look at that guys. They all kind of stopped. I mean as soon as the fuse got inside there,

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.539
it went out completely. You see these things are still very very cold because you're vaping, but nothing

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.959
Nothing's happening...

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.460
I wonder if I just lay on them with the blowtorch, if I can get them going

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:44.640
Oh, there goes the red one! Look how thick that smoke is! Come on yellow! Ok, now they're warming up...

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.140
spewing hot ash down my gloves!

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.820
Ooh ouch! (starts laughing)

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.800
That was interesting. I'm not sure if you saw that but once I got my blow torch right down in there

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.889
I actually did get the red one and eventually the green one to go off and

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.880
initially the smoke that was coming out was actually very thick, it was very condensed.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.850
It wasn't that energetic fluffy smoke like we saw in the first round,

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.510
this was a lot more condensed. Now the blue and the yellow, I haven't been able to get them to go off yet

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.890
I'm going to try one more time and see if we can actually light them, but at this point, they've already warmed up a little bit

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.440
So, not sure how it's gonna effect things.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.100
Here we go...

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.220
Oh there goes the blue,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.020
Look how slowly that's coming out. I mean, it's not burning very vigorously at all.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.640
But it seems like as the mixture starts to heat up, then the energy, grows quickly.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.920
All right, so we got the blue one to go off, the yellow ones like still a bit frosty

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.420
Still a bit hard, but we haven't been able to get it to go off yet,

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.820
I think that's because there's no fuse left to burn down in there. I'm going to get one more shot

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.820
If that doesn't work, we're just going to break it in half and see if we can light it off that way?

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.199
Actually, you know what, that sounds like more fun so let's just go ahead and break in half anyway

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.720
Yeah, look at that!

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.940
Let's go ahead and freeze this one more time, just for kicks!

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.770
Oh wow, look at that...

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.120
It's actually turned our liquid nitrogen yellow. Maybe that wasn't the best idea (starts laughing)

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.559
Just like, all my smoke powder came out, and it turned the whole batch orange. That's crazy!

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.220
Here we go...

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.580
Yep, just a really slow reaction. It actually took quite a bit of heat to get that thing going...

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.320
...and it's definitely got a thicker more condensed smoke, even with that wind, you can see how thick that is.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.400
Okay guys, so lighting smoke flares that have been submerged in liquid nitrogen. Not extremely cool!

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.940
You can see it definitely slows the reaction, but can we just talk about how putting the powder in the liquid nitrogen colored it yellow,

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.790
and look at this the whole batch right now kind of looks like a batch of orange tang, that was an unexpected result!

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.480
And I guess goes back to answering that question, can you color liquid nitrogen?

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.780
Well,
if you suspend colored particles in it,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.020
apparently you can. Now I wonder if we poured some of this out, would the liquid still be orange?

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.979
So, just poured out some nitrogen and looking at the cup there,

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.370
I don't really see any coloring.

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.288
So apparently, that's just the coloring that went down to the bottom

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.130
and made it appear like it was orange. The actual nitrogen itself is not colored!

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.480
Woah, there goes the glass!

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.840
Look at that...

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:12.220
So smoke flares complete, next up, artillery shells. Here we go, lighting off one single artillery shell.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.380
Man!

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.110
That's cool. All right, so it shot up

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.560
I'd say maybe 80 to 100 feet and then exploded. Did nice, nice little puffs of smoke.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.340
Let's see how it reacts in liquid nitrogen.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.920
I'm gonna toss the casing in there as well, just let it cool down.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.180
Looks like this might work.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.280
Oh, whoa... (laughing)

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.250
That is so funny. Do you see what happened?

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:04.589
It just did this little pop and the thing just went flicking around, flipping around, busted, and it was like half the height

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.769
they would normally go, just like "pew" a lot less traumatic than I was expecting.

00:08:07.769 --> 00:08:12.400
I thinkin' maybe the whole thing would explode and shatter out here on the road, but nope just "dooop - puhhhh".

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.480
Mini fireworks.

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:16.919
Alright, green's next.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.390
Light it up.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.820
Boop, there it goes, look at that! Boom!

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.790
Man, that only went about 50 feet high,

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:39.030
like 40-50 feet high. I think the trend we're seeing here is that liquid nitrogen makes everything go slower including fireworks?

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.650
I'm impressed they even lit off at all

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.989
I was expecting the fuse to go out, but it did light off,

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.670
and it just didn't pack as much of a punch.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.200
I wonder if you did the opposite and had really hot fireworks if they'd go off even faster.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.260
It might be an experiment for a future video.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.760
Last experiment guys, we are down to this bad boy!

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.849
This is a 10 shot aerial that we're going to submerge and light up at once.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.070
What do you think is going to happen ? Post your predictions down in the comments below!

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.460
I personally,

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.739
am thinking it's going to go off with a little bit of gut still, but what's going to happen to the firework itself is it still?

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.680
Going to explode in the air, or is it going to fall down to the ground before it goes off?

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.969
We're taking a bit of a risk, but we're doing it all for fun and for your entertainment.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.320
All right, here we go guys, last dip of the day.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.740
Oh wow, the paper is expanding on the tub. That's odd.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.540
I would expect the opposite effect.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.540
And it's floating. I think there's some kind of gas in there.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.080
I wonder if that's just all the air being pushed to the top, like if you pop that, if the air could get out,

00:09:37.089 --> 00:09:39.089
it would sink.

00:09:39.619 --> 00:09:42.309
Soakin' fireworks in our orange nitrogen, no big deal.

00:09:44.299 --> 00:09:45.489
Alright guys, moment of truth.

00:09:45.489 --> 00:09:48.639
We've got big Kahuna here, and what I love about this is when I look down inside the container

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:54.639
You can actually see liquid nitrogen boiling inside of the mortar tubes, which is really cool. Gonna add a little flair

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:59.409
I think when they take off. Here we go. Moment of truth. Look at all that nitrogen spilling off the bottom, that's awesome. Whoa!

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.290
No, I should leave that in, that's just cool.

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:05.559
Like froze my gloves though. Gonna warm that back up.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.580
There we go, all that nitrogen spilling out. We're going to set that, light it off and run away...

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.860
It's burnin'

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.960
I don't hear anything happening.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.820
So check this out, the fuse actually stopped just short of the container. It burned out right here

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.760
and didn't make it in so we're going to light that and hope that it goes in and lights off some of these aerials.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.440
Woooohhh!

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.640
Boom!

00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:46.779
It's going to explode! (laughs)

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.649
Oh no, it didn't.

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:53.379
That was a little sketchy. Come check it out, let's check it out. So, what just happened?

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.320
So the fuse made it in there, and it actually did shoot off the first aerial

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.820
and it just only went about 20 feet in the air and then it came down, landed on the ground, and spun out over here

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:01.880
I'm actually really really glad

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.909
that that didn't explode because if it did, it would have been on the ground and that's a lot more dangerous than up in the air!

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.940
It's kind of interesting, is it looks like the gunpowder fell out here.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.099
It actually looked like it tried to light off, but it didn't actually explode, too cold?

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.890
Let's see what's inside.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.930
Oh yeah, see everything's still in there. That's ready to go all that gunpowder all those

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.959
stars, it just didn't actually let off.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.219
But I think this is a pretty good place to stop. We know these things aren't going to shoot up high enough to actually go

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:30.610
off in the air

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.709
and I certainly don't want them going off on the ground.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.160
So now the question really becomes how to dispose of these. I think what we're going to do is save this for a future video

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:42.500
where we crack all these things open and pour them into a ball of tinfoil and light them off like we did the crackle ball

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.320
experiment, from last year.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.900
So, if you want to see that let me know in the comments below so we combine all these into one giant Crackle Ball experiment.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:55.080
And, of course, a super big thanks to our friend, Thomas Dopkowski for suggesting this experiment in the comments.

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:59.109
Go ahead and check your youTube inbox Thomas, were sending you $25 bucks. So there you have it guys now

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:03.820
You know what happens when you put fireworks in the liquid nitrogen, they go off a lot less dramatically.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:08.320
But it was still a great experiment and good times hanging out with you, and I'll be looking for you the next video. Talk to you then...

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:18.249
You know what, that sounds a lot louder when you're standing next to it. I can't hear out of my right ear
