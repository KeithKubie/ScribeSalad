00:00:00.361 --> 00:00:03.492
- [Voiceover] Lets get some
practice estimating lengths.

00:00:03.492 --> 00:00:06.143
So they tell us this line is one inch.

00:00:06.143 --> 00:00:08.639
So that distance right
over there is one inch.

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.280
About how long is a toy car?

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.840
Well, this is one of those
lines that they just did

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.956
so that's one inch, but let's just see

00:00:15.956 --> 00:00:17.205
how many of those we need

00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:19.529
to go the whole length of the car.

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.304
So if I were to draw another one

00:00:23.304 --> 00:00:24.407
that's about to that,

00:00:24.407 --> 00:00:26.172
and I'm estimating, it's not exact,

00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:27.403
that would be two inches.

00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:29.849
That's one inch, that's two inches.

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.068
Then that would be three inches.

00:00:33.068 --> 00:00:37.001
And then that would be four inches.

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:41.776
So it looks like the car
is about four inches.

00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:43.174
Let's do another one of these

00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:45.855
estimating length problems.

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:48.107
So I have a picture of two sunflowers

00:00:48.107 --> 00:00:49.703
right over here, and they tell us that

00:00:49.703 --> 00:00:53.799
this first sunflower
is 40 centimeters tall.

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.727
About how long is this
second sunflower going to be?

00:00:57.264 --> 00:00:58.069
Lets think about it.

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:59.725
If this entire distance,

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:04.725
if this entire height is 40 centimeters.

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:09.344
And this sunflower, if
you look at its height,

00:01:09.344 --> 00:01:10.881
I'll draw a dotted line here.

00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:12.664
It looks like it's about half of

00:01:12.664 --> 00:01:16.155
the height of the taller sunflower.

00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:18.887
So what is half of 40 going to be?

00:01:18.887 --> 00:01:20.250
Well, 40 is four tens.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.333
Half of four tens is going to be two tens.

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:26.867
So this looks like it's
about 20 centimeters,

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:28.157
let me write it this way,

00:01:28.157 --> 00:01:32.693
this looks like it's about 20 centimeters.

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:33.909
Another way to think about it is

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.909
if this whole thing is 40
centimeters then half would be 20,

00:01:39.147 --> 00:01:40.740
then this would be 10 centimeters.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.693
Let me write this, this
would be 10 centimeters.

00:01:43.693 --> 00:01:45.814
This would be 20 centimeters.

00:01:46.152 --> 00:01:48.846
Then this would be 30 centimeters.

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:51.918
Then this would be 40 centimeters.

00:01:52.287 --> 00:01:56.908
So we already saw that the
sunflower is 40 centimeters tall.

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:58.764
And then this one would be half of that.

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:01.790
It would be 20 centimeters tall.
