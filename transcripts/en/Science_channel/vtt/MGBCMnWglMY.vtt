00:00:02.567 --> 00:00:05.334
Narrator: IN 1903,
GEOLOGIST DANIEL BARRINGER

00:00:05.334 --> 00:00:10.434
PAYS $250,000
FOR A 640-ACRE METEOR CRATER

00:00:10.434 --> 00:00:13.934
IN THE DESERT WEST OF
WINSLOW, ARIZONA.

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:16.501
THIS CRATER IS OF GREAT INTEREST
TO DANIEL BARRINGER

00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:20.868
BECAUSE HE THINKS IT MIGHT BE A
SOURCE OF A LARGE IRON DEPOSIT.

00:00:20.868 --> 00:00:24.067
THIS COULD BE THE JACKPOT
FOR DANIEL BARRINGER.

00:00:24.067 --> 00:00:26.968
AS FAR AS HE'S CONCERNED,
HE MIGHT MAKE MILLIONS

00:00:26.968 --> 00:00:29.767
OR EVEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
FROM THIS MATERIAL.

00:00:29.767 --> 00:00:32.934
Narrator: BARRINGER ESTIMATES
THAT THE METEORITE

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:37.767
THAT MADE THE CRATER
HAD A MASS OF 100 MILLION TONS.

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:39.968
HE HOPES LARGE QUANTITIES OF IT

00:00:39.968 --> 00:00:42.467
ARE STILL BURIED
UNDER ITS FLOOR.

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:44.167
BARRINGER SPENDS
A NUMBER OF YEARS

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:45.901
EXCAVATING AROUND THE CRATER,

00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:47.801
DRILLING DOWN TO GREAT DEPTHS.

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:51.634
AND YET FINDS
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:55.834
Narrator: TODAY, GEOLOGISTS
CALCULATE THE METEORITE

00:00:55.834 --> 00:01:00.367
WAS IN FACT 300 TIMES SMALLER
THAN BARRINGER BELIEVED.

00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:02.000
AND NONE OF IT
WOULD HAVE SURVIVED

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.501
ITS CATACLYSMIC COLLISION
WITH EARTH.

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:06.133
THE OBJECT THAT MADE
METEOR CRATER

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.000
HITS THE GROUND AT TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF MILES AN HOUR.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.467
AND AS IT HITS THE GROUND,

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:14.801
THERE'S SO MUCH PRESSURE
ON THAT INCOMING ASTEROID

00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:18.000
THAT THAT PRESSURE WAVE SHOOTS
THROUGH THE ASTEROID.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.767
THE TEMPERATURE RISES,
AND THE WHOLE THING VAPORIZES.

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:23.367
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
A SHOCK WAVE PROPELS ITSELF

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:24.934
INTO THE GROUND

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:27.467
AND EXCAVATES THE CRATER.
