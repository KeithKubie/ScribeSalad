00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.200
welcome to this lecture
on chemical curiosities

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.976
I'm gonna start with the liquid in this container
and I just pour some into this cylinder

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.333
since it's a nice
bright red color

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.067
let's see what happens
if I keep pouring

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.533
I think you can see every time I pour out the
liquid I seem to get a different color

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.667
so, in the dictionary
the word curious

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.976
is defined to mean something which is
puzzling or surprising or unexpected

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.976
and this demonstration might
seem rather puzzling at first

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.976
until we realize that the cylinders
were not empty at the start

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.933
each of them had a little speck of
chemical which reacted with the liquid

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.976
in this container

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.976
and it produced a color change and we'll look at
the chemistry of that in just a moment

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.867
let's have a look at the liquid in
these two beakers they are both colorless

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.976
let's see what happens when I
pour the liquid from this beaker

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.067
into this one

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.867
so again we see a color change it's turning
blue, the blue is getting darker

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.267
as i keep pouring
goes away again

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.333
thats also rather odd
it seems as if

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.976
a chemical reaction began
and produced the color change

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.976
and then it sort of changed its mind and went
backwards so did it go backwards did that chemical

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.976
reaction go backwards

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.976
so the chemistry of these demonstrations
is based on a simple idea which is that

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.976
every substance can be thought of is either an acid

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.976
or an alkali and if it's neither if
it's sort of in the middle

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.976
we say that it's neutral now we can use
certain substances to tell us whether a

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.733
material is acid or alkali

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.976
and probably one of the most famous
of these is called litmus

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.976
so litmus is a material which
is red in acid conditions

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.976
and its blue in alkali
conditions and there are lots of other

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.976
indicators. I normally used in this
experiment was called universal

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.976
indicator this has a range of different
colors it's red when things are strongly

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.976
acidic

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.976
in the middle where things are neutral its green
and in strongly alkaline conditions its

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.976
purple

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.976
and this experiment is based on an
indicator called thymolphthalein.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.667
which is colorless
in acid and its blue

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.067
in alkaline conditions so these

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.976
cylinders had different amounts of acid
and alkaline in them producing the various

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.976
different colors

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
in this experiment the first beaker
had a mixture of thymolphthalein

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.467
and some acid and the second
Beaker had some alkali

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.533
and the key to this
is that when acid

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.976
mixes with alkali they
react to produce a salt

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.976
plus water so they are sort of opposites
they kind of cancel each other out

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.400
so as I started to
pour the liquid the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.600
acid and final fehling from
here went into the alkali

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.976
the alkali quickly cancelled out the
acid so the final fehling is now

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.976
an alkaline solution that turns blue

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.976
but as I keep on pouring I'm
adding more and more acid

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.976
its neutralizing the alkali and
eventually this beaker becomes acid

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.976
as well

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.976
and the final fehling goes back to being
colorless so this reaction was not going

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.976
backwards it was just
the same reaction

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.800
all along we could ask is there a
chemical reaction that goes backwards

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.976
can chemical reactions go backwards at
all well it turns out to be a really

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.976
interesting question
and it's a question

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.976
that we gonna come back to several times
during the course of this lecture

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.733
but let me just show you
now an other example

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.976
of a reaction involving universal
indicator and it's this column of water

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.976
which has universal indicator and also a
little bit of sodium hydroxide which is

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.976
alkaline

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.976
and so it's turned it this sort of bluey
purple color I'm gonna add some acid

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.976
we should see it go through a
sequence of colors rather like these

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.533
now the particular acid that i'm gonna use
is acid that's going to be made

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.400
in the water from
carbon dioxide

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.976
so, in this beaker I have carbon
dioxide but it's frozen its at

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.976
-79 degrees centigrade it's become
a solid we call this dry ice

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.976
because when it warms up it doesn't melt to a 
liquid it goes straight to the gas its

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.976
always dry

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.267
so when  I add the dry
ice to the water

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.976
it will react with the water to
form an acid called carbonic acid

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.976
thats the same stuff that's in fizzy drinks thats
what gives the the fizzy drinks that fizz

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.467
so let's see what happens
when I add this now

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.800
watch for the color changes

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.976
you should see that sequence
of different colors

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
okay

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.976
so in all the reactions we've seen
so far we mix two things together

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.976
it produced a chemical reaction
which gave rise to a color change

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.976
so let's have a look at
this flask. This flask has

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.976
a a colorless liquid in,
but if I shake the flask

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.200
it turns blue

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.976
that's a bit surprising because i didn't  seem
to be mixing two things together I was

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.067
i was just shaking up a single liquid

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.976
here is another flask it's a similar
idea this is a yellow liquid

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.733
if I shake it it turns red

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.200
if we gave it a really
good shake it turns green

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.976
there is something else rather surprising
about this as well. If we keep watching

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.133
the green is turning back to red

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.976
and if we look here the blue is
turning back to being colorless

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.976
infact the red will go back to being
yellow so it's going back through that

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.600
sequence of colors again

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.976
what's more I can even repeat it so If I
shake it again goes back to being blue

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.976
shake this again goes back
to being red and so on

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.976
if I wait it will go back so again it
looks as if we have a chemical reaction

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.733
that's going backwards but 
the first mystery

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.976
is why do we have a color change at all
I didn't seem to be mixing two things

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.976
together

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.976
what we have to remember of course is
that this flask not only contains

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.733
water but it contains a gas
in fact the gas is just air

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.976
and air of course is a
chemical and when I shake

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.600
the flask I'm mixing
oxygen from the air

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.933
with the liquid and that's
producing the chemical reaction

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.976
so the next question is did this
chemical reaction then go backwards

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.976
as it fades from blue to colorless is it
a chemical reaction that"s going backwards

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.976
well unfortunately it is'nt because
what's happening is there's a second

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.976
chemical reaction taking place

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.400
this flask contains a dye
called methylene blue

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.976
when it reacts with oxygen it
goes from colorless to blue

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.976
but also in the flask there is some glucose
and that glucose slowly turns methylene

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.500
blue

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.933
from blue-color back to being
colorless this is the same idea

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.733
but with the different material
called indigo carmine

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.976
so again we didn't have a
chemical reaction going backwards

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.976
but we're gonna keep on looking for such
a reaction as we go through the lecture

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.600
so in the reactions we've seen so
far then we mix to things together

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.976
and we got a color change so let's
have a look at what happens when i mix

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.976
these two colorless liquid together so
first all this machine is just called a

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.976
magnetic stirrer

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.900
it just spins these little magnets and keeps
the liquid stirring it's just because i'm too

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.467
lazy to stand here
stir them by hand

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.976
so if a colorless liquid being stirred
i'm gonna add a second colorless liquid

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.800
and watch closely and see if you
can detect a color change

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.067
so keep watching

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.000
(Audience surprised)

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.660
okay  (Laughing)

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.400
very strange, very strange indeed, we mixed
these two chemicals and it seemed as if no

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.976
reaction took place

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.933
we just sat there for 10 seconds
and then suddenly it reacted

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.976
now that seems very odd very surprising but
what was really going on

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.976
what's really going on is that there
are actually two different chemical

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.976
reactions taking place
inside this beaker

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.976
the first reaction was
quite a slow reaction

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.667
it was a reaction between two
chemicals that produced Iodine

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.976
so imagine this reaction taking place
and slowly releasing iodine into the

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.976
solution

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.976
now the iodine would
appear as a sort of brown color

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.976
you can't see the iodine
because there's a second

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.976
chemical reaction taking place
there's a material in the solution

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.976
which is reacting very quickly with the iodine and
it's absorbing the iodine as soon as it's produced

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.867
and the secret to this is to
arrange that second material

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
is in short supply so the iodine is being produced slowly

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.976
is being mugged up by the second
material as soon as it's produced

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.976
when that second material runs out
after about 10 seconds or so

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.976
the next little piece of iodine to
be produced remains in solution

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.976
because the iodine is a bit hard to see
from the back of the room we've added

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.976
some starch

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.976
the iodine reacts with the starch and produces a
very dark blue color that appears to be

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
almost black okay so thats
called a clock reaction

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.976
so now you understand how that one
works. Have a look at this one

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.400
this involves three color
solutions so I poured out one

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.133
into there and I pour this
into here again watch closely

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
okay

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.976
so thats a sort of  two-stage clock
so i leave you to think about how

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.800
that one might be working so in
the reactions we've seen so far then

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.976
we mix chemicals together and we know that a
reaction has taken place because we had

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.976
a change of color

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.933
but there are lots of other ways that a
chemical reaction can show up

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.976
and one way is called a change of state so the state of something

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.976
just means whether it's a solid or
liquid or gas so something turns to a solid

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.267
to liquid or from a

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.976
gas to the solid then it's changed state
so we show you an example

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.933
of a chemical reaction that involves a change of state so

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.976
we will use these two liquids i have a  red
liquid and a colorless liquid

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.400
what I'm going to
do is to pour the

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.976
colorless liquid onto the
red liquid very carefully

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.733
and try to make two layers

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.200
so what I want to happen is for the
colorless liquid to be floating

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.933
on top of the red liquid in

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.467
in separate layers that they don't
mix so that's worked quite well

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.600
so what i've got now is one liquid
floating on top of another

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.067
and where they meets they undergo
a chemical reaction

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.976
and they're actually making a solid
a solid material is  formed

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.976
where the two liquids
meets what I can do is to

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.933
fetch out some of this solid material

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.400
and as I pull it
out of the beaker

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.976
of course it allows the two
liquids to meet each other again

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.533
and so they react again to form more
of this solid so if I'm careful

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
so as I wind

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.976
I'm pulling up this material and it
allows the two liquids to meet again and it

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.600
forms more this material

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.976
and this substance that's being formed is
actually nylon so we're making nylon

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.733
as I speak and if I'mcareful

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.976
I'd be able to just keep on turning this
and making this long thread of nylon

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.133
atleast until we run out of solutions. Okay so that's an example of a chemical

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.500
reaction

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.800
that involves a change of state. So let's
have a look at another reaction

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.976
that involve a change of state and
for this i'd like a volunteer please ...

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.976
who would like to volunteer

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.867
you are very keen, common, lets have
a big hand for our

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.976
volunteer, you would like to stand
there, put those on

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.867
what's your name ? Dylan. Dylan, alright
you stand just there

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.976
we gonna do some chemistry we  gonna
make a solid alright I'm gonna start of with a

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.976
flask

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.600
that contains a solution
of silver nitrates

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.333
and I'm going to
add a little bit of

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
ammonia now when i add the ammonia

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.333
you see that it's forming
a sort of brown color

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.600
now keep on adding the
ammonia and then in a minute

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.667
brown color should disappear
that's disappeared isn't it

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.800
now what I'm going to do is to add
some sodium hydroxide

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.976
that's now formed a sort of very
dark brown almost black material

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.133
so now I'm going to add more ammonia

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.200
and again I'm going to add ammonia untill
the liquid goes back to being colorless

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.333
It takes a moment or two

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.933
there we go and then finally
I'm going to add some glucose

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.200
so there's the glucose
I'm gonna put the lid on

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
with a clip-on I'm gonna give it to you Dylan and I want you to hold that

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.733
and I want you to give it a really good shake that's
it really hard shake that's good

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.800
that's it keep shaking that's it

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.976
so what's happening inside this flask now is
there's a chemical reaction taking place

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.800
and it's forming a
solid and the actual material

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.867
that it's forming is silver
we're making pure silver metal

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
keep shaking

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.467
it takes about three quarters of an hour is
that okay (Audience laughing) ... it does actually take a minute

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.976
but the harder you shake the better it
works so keep shaking don't drop it.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.933
okay so metal silver metal is
being formed an atom by atom

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.976
and you can see it's all going quite black
that's because very finely divided

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.976
silver is actually
black in color

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.976
what we're hoping is gonna happen
over the next minute or so

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.976
is that those particles of silver will start to stick to the walls

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.800
of the flask
and as they build up

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.976
we should see a silver metal in the form of a mirror

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.867
building up on the
inside of the flask and

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.976
you've all seen those sort of decorations
you get it in Christmas those spheres that are

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:41.976
shiny

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.976
and they are made using this chemical
reaction little balls of glass

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.976
and the inside is coated with
silver using this kind of chemistry

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.733
doing really well okay
so I have quick look

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.933
almost there keep going a little bit
longer so it looks a little bit dark

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
excellent

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.467
alright give it back to me
then right let me take the

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.133
clip off you take out the stopper

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.467
just wash that off and

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.400
I pour out the
remaining chemicals

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.800
and then I'm going to
rinse this out with

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.067
distilled water

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and I'm going to add a second time

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.067
third time there we go

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.533
and just look at that one

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.267
let's dry this off and
then clip back on

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.976
and if you like to just
give that a little polish

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
if you'd like to hold it up by the neck that's
it and if we bring a camera in

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.333
and have a look at this and we've got a
lovely silver mirror there we go

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.267
ok what I'm gonna do is give that to you. Take  that to home

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.933
and you can go back to your seat,
lets have a hand for our volunteer

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.976
ok so that's an example
of a chemical reaction

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.976
the produces a change of state and I
want to show you another example of

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:22.976
a chemical reaction

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.976
again this is going to go from
being a liquid to being a solid

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.067
so in  this flask I have a solution

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.467
of sodium acetate and

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.976
this sodium acetate is a liquid as you can see, but it would very much like to be a solid

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.976
it would like to turn
into a crystal

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.976
but it needs a sort of an excuse
to get going and the excuse

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.933
is gonna be some little crystals
of solid sodium acetate

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.976
in this dish so watch what
happens if I pour the liquid

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.600
onto the crystals I think
you can see that the liquid

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.933
as soon as it touches the
crystals is turning into a solid

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.976
and with a bit of luck we can
make a sort of chemical sculpture

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.267
seems to be working

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.533
okay so that's a sort of
sodium acetate sculpture

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
now what we've learned is that this actually has a
practical application in this is the

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.976
practical application this is something called a hand warmer

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.976
and it's a plastic patch and it contains
exactly the same liquid as in this flask

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.976
this is a solution of sodium acetate

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.976
and it would like to turn into a
solid it would like to turn into a crystal

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.600
but it needs some excuse to
get going and the excuse

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.667
is this little metal
disc and if I just

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.976
flip this disc backwards and forwards
that should be enough just to start the

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.333
crystallization and
there it is and we can see the

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.800
liquid turning into a
solid as it does so

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.200
its actually getting warm
so it's actually giving off heat

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.667
and there it is it has turned entirely into

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.976
crystals it's become quite
warm in the process

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.976
and I can put that inside my glove
and keep my hands warm for

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.976
half an hour or so and then I can take
this and put it into boiling water for a

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:19.976
couple of minutes

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.800
the crystals will turn
back into a liquid

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.976
I can allow it to cool and that'll stay as
a liquid that will stay like that for weeks

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.976
or months

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.976
until I'm ready to use it again
we can use it thousands of times

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.800
okay so that's sodium acetate
it's a sort of chemical sculpture

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.467
I'm gonna show you now another way
to make a chemical sculpture and

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.976
chris has been preparing
this this beaker contains

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.976
a mixture of para nitro acetanilide

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.400
and sulfuric acid and chris
has been warming it up

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.067
and when it's hot enough

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.733
it will undergo a reaction in which
this liquid will turn into a solid

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.976
this makes quite a bit of smoke so we've got
this special hood that will suck away

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.976
the smoke from the reaction

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
here it goes

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
&lt;Audience applauding&gt;

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.976
okay so that's a chemical reactions
that involves a change of state

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.976
so we've seen lots of chemical reactions now
in this lecture we've seen reactions

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.500
that

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.976
produced color changes we've
seen reactions that produce

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.267
changes of States and we're asking
ourselves the question

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.976
could a chemical reaction go backwards
you may have seen several reactions that appear

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.976
to be going backwards

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.976
but when we understood them a
bit more carefully we realize no they

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.976
weren't going backwards

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.976
so we'd still like to understand whether
a chemical reaction could ever go

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.976
backwards

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.976
now to do that we first of all have
to ask why does a chemical reaction

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.976
happen at all

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.976
why the chemical reactions happen in the first place

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.976
but to understand that we're gonna
look at some very simple chemistry

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
and it's the combustion
of hydrogen so Chris

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.600
has filled a balloon
with hydrogen gas

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.976
and we're gonna set fire to the baloon
and what will happen is the hydrogen

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.133
will react with the oxygen in the air
and that will produce a small quantity

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.933
of water vapor and it will also
release some energy

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.867
okay so this is the reaction

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.067
of hydrogen with

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.333
the oxygen from the
air here we go

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.976
okay so can we just have a show of  hands
can you put your hand up if you enjoyed that

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.976
demonstration

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.976
its quite a few can you put your hand up
if you'd like to see a slightly bigger one

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.800
okay that's everybody
alright come on Chris

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.067
okay now the last
balloon may have quite a pop

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.976
this one is going to make an even
louder pop quite a loud bang in fact

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.976
I'm standing quite close to this so
I'm gonna wear my ear defenders

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.976
what you might like to do is to cover
your ears for this one because it could

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:41.976
be fairly loud

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.133
okay we'll bring down the lights

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.133
this is the reaction of hydrogen

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
with oxygen

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.200
so i think you would have
noticed in that reaction

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.867
that energy was released

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.933
clearly so we've got a lot of noise

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.976
we saw the flame we saw the lights I could feel the heat and

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.976
probably in the front row could as well

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.976
so energy was released in that
reaction so what's happening

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.600
is that the starting material
the hydrogen and oxygen

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.733
were in a state
of high energy and

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.976
as a result of the reaction they've
moved to a state of low energy now

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.976
the total energy in the world is always
conserved you can't create or destroy

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.976
energy

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.976
so that difference in energy was given
out is given out in the form of that bang

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.500
that's a

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.933
the heat and the light and the sound and
so on so maybe that's why chemical

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:51.976
reactions happen

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.976
may be chemical reactions happen because the
chemicals move from a state of high-energy

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.976
to a state of low energy and they
give out that difference of energy

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.976
so it's a bit like taking a ball and
putting it on a slope if you put a ball on a

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.976
slope

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.976
it rolls down hill from a state of high energy to a state of low

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.976
energy

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.933
so maybe that's how
chemical reactions work

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.976
if it is how chemical reactions work
then it's pretty obvious that a chemical

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:15.976
reaction

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.976
could never go backwards
because going backwards

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.976
would be like putting a ball on a
hill and having it decide to roll up hill

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.200
that's not gonna happen okay so
we'll keep that thought in mind

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.976
and we'll look at some other examples of
chemical reactions that give out energy

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.976
now we've seen energy being given out in 
the form a bang we saw a little bit

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.976
light being given off there
in the form of that flame

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.976
and I want to show you reaction that
gives off a great deal of lights

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.976
it's the reaction of a rather special
element it's called phosphorous

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.976
and the word phosphorus comes from the Greek
it means that the giver or the bearer

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.267
of light so this is a reaction that will
give out a great deal of light so

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.976
we could just burn a little
bit of phosphorus on the

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.976
on the bench but we thought we'd do is to
scale this up and do this on the larger

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:04.976
scale we could

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.976
and so this is actually the largest
flask that you can buy in the UK

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.533
and so this is about as big
as as we can make it and

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.976
we're gonna burn quite a big
chunk of white phosphorus

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.976
inside this flask, and to make it burn really
well, we're gonna fill the flask with pure

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.976
oxygen

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.867
now in order to fill the flask
with pure oxygen we're going to use

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.976
liquid oxygen; and we're gonna
make the liquid oxygen

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.667
by starting from another
liquefied gas - liquid nitrogen

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.400
so in this vacuum
flask I have some

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.933
liquid nitrogen it's a, a colorless
liquid - it looks pretty much like water

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.976
but it's at a very low temperature.  It's at - 196 degrees centigrade

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.067
so just for a little bit of fun I thought
we'd see what happens if we take some

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.976
liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees centigrade

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.533
and pour it into some pretty
much boiling water okay

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.867
and and this is what happens

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.173
there's no real point in that it
was just for fun you understand

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.333
okay so this liquid nitrogen is extremely cold
and we can use it to cool down

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.220
oxygen gas so that it too
becomes a liquid

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.976
that's what Chris has been doing over here. So this cylinder contains oxygen gas

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.400
and Chris has been passing the
oxygen gas through a coil of copper

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.976
that sat inside some liquid nitrogen
and the oxygen has been turning

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.467
into liquid itself and so this
vacuum flask contains liquid oxygen

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.976
i just want to show you one interesting
thing about to about liquid oxygen

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.933
I'm going to pour it into this test tube

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
and

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.600
you may be able to see
that although the

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.976
the air the air contains one-fifth
oxygen; and the air of course is completely

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.976
transparent

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.976
and yet oxygen when it becomes a
liquid turns this lovely blue color

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.400
okay so we're going to use this
liquid oxygen then

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.020
to fill this flask with
oxygen.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.000
So I'm going to pour this in

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.260
and we'll add a bit more for good
measure

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.000
should be enough

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.600
ok and so the oxygen the liquid oxygen

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.976
is warming up as it touches the flask
and it's evaporating it's turning into

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:37.976
oxygen gas

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.976
and as as it as it turns into a gas it's pushing the air

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.976
you can see the the fumes coming out
the top here is pushing the air

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.976
out of the flask and filling
the flask with oxygen

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.720
just to help that along a
bit just gonna swirl this around

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.940
okay you can see a little bit of

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.976
liquid oxygen there that lovely blue
color sloshing around in the bottom of

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.976
this

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.976
flask so that gradually evaporating and
that's filling the flask with pure

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.976
oxygen

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.976
of course we could have just
taken a hose from this cylinder

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.976
into the flask and fill it with oxygen
that way but I think this was more fun

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
okay while that last little bit

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.976
is evaporating the next thing we're going to do is to get some phosphorous

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.976
there are two kinds of phosphorus red
phosphorus and white phosphorous

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.976
this is white phosphorous; it's the more
reactive kind.  It's so reactive

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.976
that it actually reacts with the air if
you just leave it sitting on a

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.976
a bench it will actually catch fire after a few
minutes and so we store it under water

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.667
So I'm gonna fetch out this piece of

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.976
white phosphorous and we're going to put
it in a little spoon

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.733
that's suspended from
the lid of the flask

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.976
You can see the phosphorous is smoking already
as it comes into contact with the air

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:57.840
and

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.976
that will probably catch fire sometime in
the next few minutes but just to help it

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.976
along

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.000
I'm going to take a glass rod
and heat up the end of the rod

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.933
and then just touch that against the
phosphorous just to get things going

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.976
and as a as soon as the phosphorous
ignites we'll bring down the

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.976
lights what you'll see is
the reaction of phosphorus

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.467
burning in pure oxygen

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.460
you can see this lovely white light that's being given out

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.720
it's a very vigorous reaction

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.000
the flask is filling with
oxides of phosphorous

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.980
so thats white phosphorus 
the bearer of light

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.720
okay so that's a chemical
reaction then which gives out

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:15.840
energy in the form of light, I'm going to
show you another reaction now which

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.720
gives out energy again in form of light but
also in the form of sound

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.747
this is a reaction between
a colorless gas

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.976
which is in this glass tube called
nitric oxide and a liquid

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.600
called carbon disulfide

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:33.980
so this is the carbon disulfide. I'm gonna
add some of this to the tube

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.400
and then we're gonna mix them together.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.976
So Chris is going to mix the carbon disulfide with the 
nitric oxide the carbon disulfide evaporates and

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.976
turns into a gas

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.200
we've got a little bit of water in the
tube just to help them mix and

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.133
when they're thoroughly mixed

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.660
we'll set fire to it

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.867
now this happens this reaction
happens reasonably quickly

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.940
so we'll just bring the
lights down first

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.976
So you've seen a couple reactions there that
involve effectively combustion

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.267
and combustion can give rise to
some very interesting chemistry

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.400
and for this I'm going to set fire
to a brand-new fifty-pound note

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.333
as an example of
combustion so let me

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.467
soak the fifty pound notes
in some flammable liquid

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.976
and then we'll set it on fire this
is a this is my fifty pound notes

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
its brand new, and there
it is on fire

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.600
the flames have gone out but the fifty
pound notes I'm pleased to say is

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.773
entirely intact.

00:31:09.773 --> 00:31:11.673
I'm very pleased about that

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.660
Now the reason that the fifty-pound note
survived has to do with the choice of liquid

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:27.000
so this liquid was 50 percent
alcohol which is inflammable

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.800
and 50 percent water
and it was the water

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.340
that protected the fifty pound note - it
absorbs heat, and it stopped the note from burning

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.976
so really that's not too surprising
because we know that we use water

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.667
to put out fires the fire brigade
carry water with them, they have hoses

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.733
they use water for
fire extinguishing

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.976
So let's have a look at some different ways
of putting out fires I've got here

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.500
three

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:55.600
fire extinguishers based on different
kinds of Chemistry

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Now it would be very surprising wouldn't it

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.976
if we could use a fire
extinguisher not to put out a fire

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.976
it to make a fire worse.  It would be really
surprising if we could use a fire

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.976
extinguisher to start a fire

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.533
okay let's look at the first
kinda fire extinguisher

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.976
so this is called a water fire
extinguisher it contains water

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.976
under pressure when you let extinguisher
off the water comes out at the hose

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.976
you soak the fire and you put the fire
out.  Now if I let that off in here it would just

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.976
flood the lecture theatre so we do
something else that's that's equivalent

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.733
from the point of view of Chemistry

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.867
and and that's to use a water
pistol so this water pistol

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.867
contains just ordinary tap
water I can pressurize it

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
and we can

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.067
you're careful or you're wishful

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.976
so this is just like that
water fire extinguisher

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.933
it squirts a jet of water so could we use this to start a fire

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.976
well for this I'd like
a volunteer please who would like to volunteer

00:32:59.000 --> 00:32:59.976
you are very quick

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.133
lets give a hand for our volunteer please

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.267
and what's your name yeah
Ciara, right Ciara ifyou like to put on

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.976
these safety goggles these are special
safety goggles because they are tinted

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.267
nice trendy shades
all right and

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.333
what you are going to do is
to squirt the water pistol at the

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.976
little metal dish. Can you see
that on the little stand there

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.400
and that dish contains a
mixture of silver nitrate

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.976
and finally padded magnesium and if you
get a little bit of water to land on it

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:34.976
we'll see if that can

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.976
start a fire now because
this contains magnesium

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.800
is going to produce a very
bright light so my suggestion

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.976
my recommendation is that you
don't look directly at the dish

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.976
but instead you look to one side now you
do need to look at the dish because

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.800
you can hit it in the water

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.976
so that's we've given you these special
goggles all right so of you go see if you could

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.976
get a little bit water into that dish

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.267
well done but thank
you very much

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.976
okay so that was the first time a
fire extinguisher that's that's the

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.976
water-based

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.976
fire extinguisher so if you see a little
fire involving magnesium and silver

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.976
nitrate don't try to put it out

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.467
with that, this is the

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.976
next kinda fire extinguisher it has 
got a carbon dioxide

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.533
fire extinguisher and it contains
liquid carbon dioxide

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.976
under very high pressure
so just I pull out the pin

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.133
and point the nozzle up
we'll just set this off

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
and okay

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.976
so you can see the liquid carbon
dioxide and a very high pressure

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.133
comes out through the nozzle it turns
into a gas now carbon dioxide is often

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.976
one of the main results of combustion
it's something light wood or paper is

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:52.976
burning

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.976
the carbon reacts with the oxygen in
the air to produce carbon dioxide

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.976
to the carbon dioxide is the
end product of combustion

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.976
that's why it is good for putting out fires
so we use the carbon dioxide fire

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:04.976
extinguisher

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.267
to smother a fire
exclude the air

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.933
and therefore exclude the oxygen
and then the fire goes at

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.600
to be a bit odd if using

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.976
a fire extinguisher like this would
actually make the fireworse rather than

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:18.976
better

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.467
well let's see what that
might look like

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
so

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.976
again we're going to use carbon
dioxide in a very concentrated form

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.976
in the form of solid
carbon dioxide or dry ice

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.976
which is something that we saw little
bit earlier in the lecture this is a

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:37.976
block

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.067
of dry ice and again
we are going to use magnesium

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.400
so I have some
magnesium metal here

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
and its gonna make a
little pile in a little

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.467
trough that we've cut inside
the block I'm going to

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.067
set fire to the magnesium
and once its on fire

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.976
chris is going to put the the
other half of the block on top

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.600
and then the magnesium will
be sort of trapped inside

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.333
and if we bring the light stand and you
can see the combustion is becoming more

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:30.976
vigorous

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.667
this is magnesium burning

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.733
in carbon dioxide it's not putting
the fire out it's actually supporting

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.500
combustion

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.733
giving out this beautiful light the white
smoke you see is magnesium oxide

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.976
this is the sort of stuff that's used
in the indigestion tablets that kind of thing

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.976
I would'nt recommend that for
dealing with indigestion

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
so the

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.667
magnesium combines with 
the carbon dioxide

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
to make magnesium oxide
and carbon thank you

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.976
okay we have a third
kinda fire extinguisher

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.200
and that's this one this
is called a dry powder

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.976
fire extinguisher it contains
a powder this pressurized

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.976
when we set this off the
powder comes out of the hose

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.976
and we can squirt at the fire and put
the fire out now these are actually

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:26.976
extremely good

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.976
fire extinguishers you have an
extinguisher in your kitchen one in your

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:31.500
car

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.800
is probably a dry
powder extinguisher and

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.976
these extinguishes usually contain
something like sodium or potassium

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.976
carbonate

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.867
or sodium or potassium bicarbonate
they're very effective

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.976
extinguishers they are good for
dealing with all kinds of fire

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.933
and it would be very surprising if using the
powder out of one of those that actually

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
make combustion faster
on make it worse well

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.800
i have to say can

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.667
in this spoon we have a gram of
commercial gun powder

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.733
it's made from a mixture of three

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.976
ingredients saltpeter ( chemical name is potassium nitrate )

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.976
and that act's as a source of concentrated
oxygen we call that an oxidizer

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.933
it contains charcoal
which acts as the fuel

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.867
that burns in the oxygen released
by the potassium nitrate

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.976
and it contains sulfur and
the sulfur is there to

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.976
aid combustions make the gun powder burn more easily

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.667
what would happen if
we took gun powder

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.533
and instead of using charcoal
which is the main fuel

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.800
we use some of the powder from a
fire extinguisher so this seems

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.976
pretty odd we gonna take away the
main fuel from the Gunpowder

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.976
and we are gonna replace it with something
that's used in a fire extinguisher

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:47.976
we are gonna use potassium carbonate for this

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.976
so if we mix those three
things together that is

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.267
potassium nitrate potassium
carbonate and sulfur

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.976
we get something called yellow powder
and so in this spoon we have a gram

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.976
black powder and in this spoon
we have a gram of yellow powder

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.933
now what I'm gonna do is to heat up

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.333
these two spoons and

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.067
we'll see if there's a difference between
these two powders, so there's the

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.976
Gun powder

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.067
and this is the a yellow powder

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
now gunpowder when it burns in
the open doesn't make a bang

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.976
it just burns with the Puff in a little cloud
of smoke so we are not expecting the gun powder

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.400
to make a bang
yellow powder however

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.600
very probably will make  a
bang and it could be fairly loud

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.467
so sometime in the
next minute or so

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.976
there could be quite a loud bang you
might wish to cover your ears for this

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
now as the spoons heat up at some point
the gun powder will get hot enough

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.976
but it will ignite we'll see a puff of
smoke the other part is a little bit

00:39:59.000 --> 00:39:59.976
different

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.533
inside that spoon the materials
are starting to melt

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.976
they're flowing together and
some chemistry is taking place

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.976
the chemical composition is actually
changing as a result of being warmed

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.976
up

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.976
and at some point that
new mixture of chemicals

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.533
should give rise to a little
explosion

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:22.976
and the gun powder

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.600
gives a beautiful smoke ring

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.976
okay so that's some of the science of 
combustion and that's how the powde

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:41.500
the powder from a

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:44.976
dry powder fire extinguisher could
actually make combustion a little bit

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.500
worse

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:48.400
so if you remember one of
the questions that we're

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.733
asking in this lecture is whether a
chemical reaction can go backwards

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.976
I said this is a very interesting
question let me show you

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.667
a fascinating reaction so

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.133
in this beaker is

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.400
a colorless liquid
I'm going to add

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.933
a second colorless
liquid it remains colorless

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.400
I'm gonna add some
yellow liquid and

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.867
it turned orange and add a little bit of red liquid

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.733
and it goes sort of green color

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.867
kind of muddy color now in a minute
or so that muddy mess will fade away

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.976
we'd be able to see the color of the
solution what I want you to do with to

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:35.976
watch the color

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.800
of this solution as it changes now the rather interesting story behind this

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:41.976
reaction

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.976
was first discovered in
about 1951

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.976
by a russian chemist called Boris Belousov and
he was trying to study the way

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
citric acid

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.933
behaves in the human body and

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.976
so he was mixing various materials
together in a beaker

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.976
and he discovered some very interesting
color changes any particular

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.976
he discovered an oscillating chemical
reaction that is a chemical reaction

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.976
that went through a sequence of color
changes and then came back to the

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:10.976
starting point

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.600
you can see that muddy
color is fading

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.133
and we've now got

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.976
got a green solution the solution
is not gradually turning blue

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.667
remember that it started at
Green and it's turned blue

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.667
I Borissov tried to sum it
all by the late in chemical

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:34.976
reaction

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.976
sort of like a reaction
that goes backwards and

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.976
people thought that reaction's
didn't do that sort of thing

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.976
so you wrote this up and
he sent it off to the top

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.976
chemistry journal in Russia and the
editors looked at this and they rejected

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.976
the paper because they
said that couldn't happen

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.067
okay it's not turn from
blue to red and green

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
to do Reds so

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.976
missile had his paper rejected
3 send it to another journal

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.976
and they did the same thing they
rejected as well because they thought

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.976
democrats it just shouldn't
behave like this

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.976
must be something wrong so you got
pretty depressed about this if I got so

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.976
depressed that he gave
up being a scientist

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.133
a discovery was so difficult and

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.400
and about ten years later
a Stevens have chemistry

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.976
zabinski that since the
Russian student discovered

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.667
status of notes not stand up
to blues has turned grade

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.976
all rights so remember that sequence
a green for a little while then blew

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.867
that it went Reds them but
simply briefly now it screened

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.976
so that the tin CE discovered the
littles notes and he recreated

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.867
this experiment and he was able to is
published the conference in Vienna

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.976
and then the whole world near back
sittin' again quite a sensation

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.976
they've got very excited about
these kinds of reactions cases

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.976
gone back to play it is now turning back
to read we'll keep going through that

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:57.976
sequence of colors

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.867
so it seems as if we have a
reaction sorta goes back with

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.800
released it goes round in a cycle so
most people started to study these

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.976
reactions and they came
up with other kinds all

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.933
oscillating reactions 2012 show you
one that has quite a nice story to it

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:14.976
because

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.976
this is discovered not by
professional chemists the by

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.600
a couple earth schoolteachers and
their names were Briggs and Russia

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.467
and then working a high
school in San Francisco and

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.976
they were using the school
chemistry labs after hours

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.976
and they discovered a different
kind all oscillating reaction

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
so again I have a clear liquids
I had a second clear liquid

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.400
and a third clear
liquid that turns

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.467
amber to keep watching

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.667
turns blue radar late so there's a
little bit like the clock reaction

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.733
the same thing erection
something starts and I attained

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.667
at this time it doesn't stay
play is going clear again

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.333
so it's become clear

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.467
that's going back to amber to keep watching
actively work and turns to blue again

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.533
okay so those are two
oscillating chemical reactions

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.976
just seems as if we found a chemical
reaction the does actually go backwards

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.976
but really that isn't what's happening
it's not like a ball rolling downhill

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:26.976
and then change its mind

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.400
a rolling back up hill again
it's more like a ball

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.976
going down a so to the helix
it gets back to the same color

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.976
as when it started but it's not
really in the same condition

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.976
because some of the chemicals have
been used up we could watch these

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:41.976
oscillations happening

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.467
but after 10 or 20 minutes
they will come to a stop

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.976
and that's because the chemicals have
been used up so we haven't really found

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.976
reaction yet that can go backwards
so does that mean that of theory

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.976
of chemical reactions is
correct member of theory

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.667
is the chemical reactions
like a ball rolling downhill

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.976
the chemicals go from high-energy to
low-energy and they give that back

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.267
energy difference in the fall
people light or sound or whatever

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.667
well let's look at this reaction
this interaction between two powders

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.976
so in the beaker's some barium
hydroxide it's a white powder

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.467
I've got a block of wood I
was gonna put some water

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.976
on the surface the what makes a
puddle I'm gonna stand the beaker

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.400
in the puddle and then in
this peak and this flask

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.267
I have some ammonium
chloride I'm

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.533
at the ammonium chloride to
the the barium hydroxide

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.867
and I'm gonna stare
using this probe which

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.976
is attached to this the moment
that this digital thermometer

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.976
things in the temperature
there is about 20 degrees

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.976
let me start to mix the prior to us
together and we'll see what happens to

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000
the temperature

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.976
so the temperatures falling
very quickly well below

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
10 degrees now

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.976
and they took it has just gone negative
this is now the low note the grace

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.133
so it's a -7 degrees so the
temperatures falling very rapidly

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.976
the other thing that's happened
is that it's turned from a solid

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.733
into a liquid does not come
with a slushie white liquid

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.267
the temperatures down to -15 degrees so
well below the freezing point of water

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.976
i remember i stupid in
little puddle of water

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.933
so what should have happened
is that water should a frozen

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.800
never got frozen it
to the block it would

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.976
so that's pretty strange
because that's the reaction

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.976
that didn't give an insanity
it's a reaction took in energy

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.976
it actually took in heat from the
surroundings and that's why the

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:56.976
surrounding such
as the thermometer

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.933
dropped in temperature
so that's a bit like

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.976
putting the ball on a slope and
seeing the ball roll up hill

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.667
but it shouldn't happen to
this array strange reaction

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.976
it means that all theory
of wine chemical reactions

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.976
happen isn't quite right or
at least it isn't complete

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.333
there's something else that's
missing so what's missing you know

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.867
theory all had chemistry happens went
to illustrate this with the little

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.800
computer game we got
here a hundred discs

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.976
and each disc is yellow
on one side it's red

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.200
on the other and the ball
down the right answer

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.976
side show see the proportion of this
coochie yellow now starts at the mall of

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.733
as Yellow and let's see what
happens when we run little

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.933
simulation so that a
hundred times a second

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.976
the computer is choosing
a desk and its deciding

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.976
either to keep it the same color or to
flip it over and you can see on the

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:54.976
right hand side

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.267
the proportion upgrade and yellow now we
started off with all the disks yellow

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.976
very quickly we've got to state
where about half of them Red

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.733
in about half the
yellow let's try again

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.933
at this time we can set them all to
read we can run the little simulation

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.976
they start of all rate
very quickly they come to

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.976
a state where about half as the
reading about half of the magellan

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.600
so me to say this is
the think that we

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.976
started the discs off in a very ordered
state they were all the same color

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.667
and as the simulation run

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.067
the level is disorder increased

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.733
it went from a and ordered
state two more random States

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.976
and this is such an important idea given
a special name we call the degree of

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:40.976
disorder

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.667
entropy we say the entropy
tends to increase with time

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.976
we start of the things recorded
and they became very disordered

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.976
and the reason this happens very simple
is because there's only one way for the

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:53.976
disturb your yellow

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.976
there are lots and lots and lots of ways
for the DS the beast the roughly half

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:58.976
yellow and of bread

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.976
and so it's just simply can sing
the number of different ways have

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.800
arranging these discs that causes the
dais to go from an ordered States

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.976
the disordered state now
you might think well

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.976
well hang on a moment
if we wait long enough

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.976
sooner or later by chance although
this will become yellow again

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.976
so the system would then have gone from
the disordered stay tuned ordered States

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.976
now you're absolutely right
you have to wait a long time

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.976
this is doing about a hundred flip to
second if we did a trillion flips the

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:31.500
second

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:34.800
you still have to wait longer
in the age of the universe

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.667
on average before you see
them or yellow again so it's

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.976
almost certain that the world will move
from an altered states to disordered

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:43.976
state

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.733
I've got a couple other
teenage boys and

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.800
their bedrooms provide a perfect
illustration of this at

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.976
if i tidy their bedrooms everything is
very or didn't come back the next day

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.976
is almost certain to be a highly
disordered state without input from me

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.976
it will never gain from being disordered
to being ordered so that's the idea

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:05.976
entropy

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.976
entry fee increases and that
can drive a chemical reaction

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.867
so let's think about a solid

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.800
in a solid the atoms or molecules
are arranged in nicely

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.133
rose they're very order in so
the crystal lattice in a liquid

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.976
the molecules can move around
not in fixed positions anymore

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.976
so this is a more
disordered state in a solid

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.067
and a gas is even more
disordered because the

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.976
atoms or molecules are free to move
around they can fill the container

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.467
so as we go from solid to
liquid to gas the entropy

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.976
all the disorder increases up sarra to
things that can drive chemical reactions

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.976
is the ball rolling downhill
effects the decrease in energy

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.467
all there is the
increase in entropy

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.800
the teenager bedroom
effect this reaction

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.976
is being driven by that increase
in entropy is gone from a solid

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.400
to a liquid and that increase
in entropy is so big

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.976
the overcomes the fact he actually
has two increase the energy

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.976
that reaction to happen that
reaction happens spontaneously

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.976
let's draws energy in from the
environment and cools its environment

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:14.976
and

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.133
that's why that reaction happens

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.976
so that means that we have two things
that can drive chemical reactions it's

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.976
not just the ball
rolling downhill

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.976
it's also the the the bedroom
effects and so perhaps

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.976
now that we have that deeper
understanding of Chemistry perhaps we

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000
can I find

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.667
a chemical reaction
that goes backwards

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.733
well to help this find
this I'm going to

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.976
use the word curious in a different
sense we've used curious to the strange

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:45.976
or surprising or

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.733
unexpected the curious
can also refer to

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.600
desire2learn to curiosity I'm gonna
tell you a story about curiosity

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.267
in a a young chemist so
easily with ira rents in

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.976
and as an adult he became
very famous he founded the

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.976
chemistry department at John Hopkins
University and he discovered the first

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:05.976
official sweetener

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.133
let's call saccharine but
as a teenager he was

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.976
curious about chemistry and used
to do some little experiments

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.976
I'm good telly a story in his words
about an experiment which he performed

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.976
when he was a youngster now the
experiment involves the reaction between

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:22.976
copper

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.867
and nitric acid and so when we get to
the appropriate point in the story

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.976
I'm actually gonna show you their action
the reactions gonna happen in this flask

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.976
in this cylinder at the top
we have some nitric acid

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.933
and the flask we have
copper now the copper

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.976
as you for reasons you'll see in
a moment in the former a coil

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.976
account is the Morton a penny or tea
party piece because they're actually

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:47.976
made of steel

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.976
just a thin coating of copper
so gonna an old-fashioned penny

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.133
here this was made in there 1945

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.976
this actually made of solid copper
so we put one of these pennies

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.933
into the flask and we gonna do this
reaction in a sealed environment in a

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:04.976
sealed flask

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.976
any fumes that a pretty to be led away
through this cheap and absorbed in this

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:09.976
sodium hydroxide

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.976
for reasons that will
become apparent in a moment

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.933
okay so this is the
story although I Ramson

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.976
while reading a textbook of Chemistry
I came across the statement

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.867
nitric acid acts upon copper

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.976
I was getting tired reading such
absurd stuff and I determined

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.976
to see what this meant copper
was more or less familiar to me

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.733
for copper sense with that in use I'd
seen a bottle marked nitric acid

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.976
on a table in the doctor's office
well I was then doing time

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.976
I did not know its
peculiarities was getting on

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.467
likely to learn the spirit
of adventure was upon me

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.333
having nitric acid and
copper I had only to learn

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.867
what the word act upon meant

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.200
then the statement nitric
acid acts upon copper

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.600
would be something
more the mere words

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.333
all was still
interested knowledge

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.976
I was even willing to sacrifice one
of the few copper sense that in my

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:12.976
possession

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.533
I put one of them on the table
opened the bottle marked nitric acid

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.400
poured some of the liquid
on the copper a prepared

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.067
to make an observation so let's

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.133
at the nitric acid to the copper

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.333
and see what happens

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.467
I think you can say that quite a
vigorous reaction is taking place

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.267
to the green liquid
bubbling away

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.533
fumes are coming off I let's
continue with the story

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.976
but what was this wonderful
thing which I beheld

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.976
the saint was already changed
there was no small change either

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.600
a greenish blue liquid phoned
in fumed over the scent

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.976
and over the table the area in the
neighborhood of the performance became

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.067
colored dark red

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.800
a great cloud arose
this was disagreeable

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.600
and suffocating how
should I stop this

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.976
I tried to get rid of the
objectionable mess by picking it up

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.200
and throwing it out of the window
which I had meanwhile opened

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.333
I learned another
fact nitric acid

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.533
not only acts upon
copper but attacks

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000
upon fingers

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.333
the pain led to another
unpremeditated experiment

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.976
I drew my fingers across my trousers
another fact was discovered

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000
nitric acid acts upon tries as

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.467
taking everything
into consideration

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.976
that was probably the most
impressive experiment

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.400
and relatively probably the
most costly experiment

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.400
I never performed I tell
it even now with interest

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.067
it was a revelation to me it
resulted in a desire on my part

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.400
to learn more about that
remarkable kind a faction

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.600
plainly the only way
to learn about it

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.976
was to see its results
to experiment to work

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.400
in the laboratory so that the
reaction of nitric acid with copper

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.976
which produce these dark
brown fumes that you can see

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.933
and those fumes are
called nitrogen dioxide

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.976
and they are actually pretty unpleasant
which is why we're doing this in a SEO

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:31.976
apparatus

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.976
but nice and I oxide is a material that
can help us understand this question

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.976
about whether a chemical
reaction can go backwards

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.133
so in these cubes

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.400
we have equal amounts

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.600
all nitrogen dioxide
what I'm gonna do

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.867
is to take one of the tubes
and to place it in iced water

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.867
that it will cool down and the
other cheap a little place

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.467
in hot water to heat it up
so come back in a moment

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.976
and see if they're changed in any
way let's have a little look

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.467
at the chemistry that's
going on inside those tubes

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.400
and nitrogen dioxide
has a molecule

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.976
which consists of one at
Earth nitrogen and two atoms

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.067
oxygen if we have two molecules

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.133
nitrogen dioxide they can react
together to form one molecule

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.976
all another oxides of nitrogen
called dummy nitrogen

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.600
tetroxide that process
releases energy

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.976
when that extra nitrogen 19 bond
is formed it gives out energy

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.976
so that's like the ball rolling
downhill the ball rolling downhill

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.976
want the notion dioxide come together
performed I nitrogen tetroxide

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.867
but the domination tetroxide

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.933
can split up the molecule can

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.400
split in half if two molecules
of nitrogen dioxide

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.733
because for every molecule

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.533
diana ichton tetroxide we
get two molecules Nigerian

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.976
dioxide we have twice as many molecules
they can be arranged in many more ways

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.976
and that means the entropy
has increased so the

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.976
entropy tends to drive this
reaction from the right to the left

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.976
so these two effects the
ball rolling downhill effect

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.976
and the teenager bedroom effect a
driving this reaction is to love

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:20.976
opposite directions

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.467
what happens is that the reaction
actually goes in both directions

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.976
at the same time it
reaches a sort of balance

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.976
we call it an equilibrium where there
is some much in by upside present

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.267
and some dynamited and
tetroxide present and the

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.976
relative proportions that these
depends upon the temperature so if we

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.976
increase the temperature we put energy
into the system that's like pushing the

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:45.976
ball up hill

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.976
we go from right to left
if we cool system banned

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.976
then conversely we go from left
to right so that's the prediction

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000
and we can test the prediction

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.976
because nineties and dioxide is this
dark brown gas that you see in the flask

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:01.500
here

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:02.667
but die nice in tetroxide

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.533
is colorless so we
go back to a cubes

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
this is the cheap that
was in the cold water

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
and you can see that
it's become a pale kala

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.976
this is the cheap that was in the hot
water I just put the side by side

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.976
you can see that heating up this
gas has made it dark brown and

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.467
contains more nitrogen
dioxide rest cooling it done

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.800
has made it at less
dark it contains more

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.467
die nitrogen tetroxide and
just two check of theory

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.933
what we can do is we can take
the hockey if the doc to you

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.976
and place it into the cold
war stop and then the

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.976
the coach you which is the pale
kala we can place that in hot water

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.976
will come back and have a look at those
in a moment we'll see if they swapped

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:50.500
places

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:54.133
the case that really brings us
towards the end of the lecture

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.667
want to do is just
to show you one more

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.933
curiosity and it concerns a
rather interesting and unusual

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.067
element and this

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.267
elements was
discovered in a mine

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.933
in a outside a little time court Turkey
which is near Stockholm in Sweden

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.976
and they have been extracting minerals
from the mine and they found a mineral

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.976
it seemed rather peculiar
they couldn't understand

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.976
what it contained insulate realize
that it contained a new element

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.976
this is so the beginning of the
eighteenth century and those that is if

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.976
you discovered a new element
you got to choose its name

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.976
and they decided to name the element
after the town to the turkey

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.667
this element is called yttrium
what rather interesting

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.976
is that this mineral contain
not just one new element

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.200
but they found out to
contain four developments

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.976
and so they decided to name all four
elements after the time to the turbine

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.533
so these four elements
accord yttrium

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.067
ytterbium erbium

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.467
and terbium which is a

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.976
a little bit confusing I think
we can look at the thirsty these

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.267
yttrium now yttrium

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.976
can be used to make a compound and I
have some at the compound here it's

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.976
called yttrium
barium copper oxide

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.976
that just a hard black
love ceramic material

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.333
when you to do is
to put into some

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
liquid nitrogen

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.976
and so that the tree in barium copper
oxide is now being cool down to minus a

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.733
hundred ninety-six degrees

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.976
but takes a moment or two to
cool down so while we're waiting

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.976
I also have in this cup another
piece of identical material

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.667
exactly the same as the first
and I'm gonna cover this

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.200
in liquid nitrogen

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.067
so that too can be cooling down

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.976
now at room temperature this
material isn't very remarkable

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.976
but when he gets officially cold has a
very interesting a very strange property

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.533
becomes what we call
a superconductor

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.976
now superconductor is a material that
is lost all its electrical resistance

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.133
and material which has 0
electrical resistance

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.467
has the property that it
can repel a magnetic field

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.976
so this rig the ring made of
steel and it's covered in little

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.976
magnets very strong magnets I alternates
North Pole South Pole North Pole and so

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:26.976
on

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.733
and in a minute when this is
cool down on we get to see

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.467
if thats yttrium
barium copper oxide

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.667
can repel the magnetic field
produced by these magnets

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.133
this just takes a a moment
or two to cool down

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.976
so we're looking here I can see
their boiling away very vigorously

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.976
that means the the ceramic materials
giving up its heats to the

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.200
liquid nitrogen is boiling
liquid nitrogen away

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.976
and and cooling down in the process
essentially I'm just waiting for the

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:00.976
boiling to stop

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.976
when it stops boiling that
means the ceramic material

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.976
has reached the same temperatures the
liquid nitrogen so limit minus a hundred

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.200
ninety-six degrees

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.667
okay so let's touch the Sun
then let's see if this can

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.333
repel magnetic field

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.976
okay so this is actually
quite a special kind of

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.976
superconductors what we call the type to
see picking up to and that means that as

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.400
well as repelling magnetic field you can
also track magnetic field remember I've

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:49.500
got

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.733
another wanna be sitting
inside this policy link-up and

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.976
underneath is a still at that
and on the top of the cylinder

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.067
is a very strong magnet now the

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.976
field from that night that
was already passing through

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.733
the ceramic material before
I added the liquid nitrogen

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.867
site now cool it down should
have become a superconductor

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.976
and hopefully it will have traps that
magnetic field so should still be

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:15.976
gripping onto that field

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.976
that means I should be able to take
away the support from this cylinder

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.976
by the way on the outside the cylinder
we've put the logo for the International

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:25.976
Year of Chemistry

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.667
2011 has been a year-long
celebration around the world

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.976
off with the likes of Chemistry and
the importance of Chemistry for

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.976
our everyday lives I thought it would
be a nice way to just mark the occasion

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.667
I think this is cool
down as sunday tea

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.600
see if I can lower
this very carefully

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
the

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.976
okay well thank you very much that that
pretty much brings us to the end of the

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:11.976
lecture

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.976
just before we wrap up I'm I thought
we would we finish with the

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.467
with a rather nice demo but
just before we do as 12

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.976
ask you to join me in thanking somebody
please put a lot of effort into helping

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.976
me prepare and
deliver this lecture

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
and thats crisp black stallion

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.976
okay just before we finish I thought we
take a look at this block of dry ice

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.976
if you remember we burn some magnesium
inside this block is dry ice

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.976
so the chemistry here was that the
magnesium reacted with carbon dioxide

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.976
to produce magnesium oxide and carbon
and if you look at the surface if this

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.976
we can see that it's coated in
a white powder and that's the

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.800
the magnesium oxide
if we dig down inside

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.133
the black had a is the
carbon and then finally

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.533
we swaps those two teams
that we put the dark to you

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.976
inside the iced water we put the
light-colored cheap in the hot water

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.733
we can say they have indeed
swapped places so the cheap

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.976
was dark has been cool
down has become lights

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.133
and the like quality has been heated up
it's become dark so we have the role

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:24.500
other

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:27.867
curious conclusion the chemical
reactions can go forwards

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.933
and backwards at the same time alright
well that really is the end of the

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:34.976
lecture

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.976
but I thought would have just one
more demonstration to finish

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.667
and I thought what
we do is two repeats

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.800
one of the earlier demonstrations
it's the demonstration

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.976
all the reaction between nitric
oxide and carbon by sulfide

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.533
I thought we did on a slightly
bigger scale so chris is bringing on

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.467
a cube of nitric oxide

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.067
some good add the carbon dice 05 began
chris is going to mix these together

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.733
once they thoroughly mixed

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.533
will set fire to the
end of the queue

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:40.976
all rights and

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.933
will put the light stand for
this might say thank you will

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.333
for coming we go old

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
its
