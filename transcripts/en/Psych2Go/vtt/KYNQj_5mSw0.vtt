00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.180
Some people underestimate their own abilities and tend to not know their own strengths and weaknesses, even when asked.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.760
Phrases like 'I am not smart' or 'I am not good enough' are thrown around too carelessly

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.360
and when repeated enough, can become internalized subconsciously and impede performance.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.000
Let's look at an example.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.540
Meet Juan.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.220
He owns a business that creates, sells, and markets backpacks.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.320
Unfortunately, business hasn't been the best for his company, and it is barely turning a profit.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.300
This has made Juan say to himself, 'I am not successful.'

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.320
Though he doesn't realize it, Juan is internalizing these thoughts subconsciously, and he is unknowingly sabotaging himself.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.740
When breaking it down, what separates functional people from exceptional people are their attitudes about themselves.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.960
This is where positive resonance and emotional intelligence come into play.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.680
Affirmations help with this.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.860
Affirmations are repeated phrases that provide emotional support and encouragement.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.460
They can be verbal or nonverbal and are used to encourage oneself.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.600
Affirmations help to increase self-actualization and realization.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.060
Affirmations are very similar to futuristic thought in that they both create a mental image that you can focus on.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.600
The most common affirmation is 'I am', as in 'I am successful', 'I am bliss', etc.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.800
Words are powerful, and what you say in regards to 'I am' can have a profound effect oneself.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.780
Here's something you can try after this video.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.980
How long can you go without saying 'I am sorry'?

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.700
Acknowledging thoughts and words for what they are allows you to gain control over your mind, quiet the monkey mind, and develop insight.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.400
Remember Juan? He stopped saying things that disparaged himself and focused on 'I am' affirmations.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.860
He started saying to himself, 'I am successful', which led to a more positive outlook of himself.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.820
Two years after adopting that mindset, his small backpack company grew into a multifaceted company

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.880
that also dealt in laptop cases, suitcases, and duffle bags. This is no fluke.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.660
Affirmations are commonly used in mediation, which has spread across the planet and has become a staple of western culture as of late.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.180
The practice of meditation is primarily linked with Buddhism, where it is used in the development of the inner self.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.960
Meditation is linked throughout different religions, from Hinduism, to Sufi, to Christianity.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.600
In our stressful and, perhaps, swift moving society, professionals have found a need to adopt meditation.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.700
Meditiation is way to bring the mind to stillness, giving the user an internal balance, mental correctedness, and acute awareness.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.060
All of which may help the increase of individual performance.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:54.340
Practitioners have shown meditation helps to reduce anxiety levels, making the mediator calmer, less worried, and, possibly, more confident.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.780
Relaxation and the easing of mind may be helpful in almost any undertaking.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.400
It's effortless. Even novices, who learn for the first time, often find themselves less anxious and more focused.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.120
Meditation has been proven to ease the mind, clear moods, invigorate, and inspire.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.060
The prolific use of meditation has reached all professions.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.460
Athletes like Tiger Woods, LeBron James, Pete Sampras, and Kobe Bryant use meditation to enhance performance.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:30.200
Hall of Fame basketball star, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, incorporated meditation into pre-game routines, which was described in an article.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.380
Abdul-Jabbar augmented his practice of yoga and martial arts with meditation to relieve pre-game stress and improve performace.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:47.060
On April 5th, 1984, he scored his 31,420th point, to become the NBA's all-star scoring champion. A record he still holds.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.920
Simply put, mindfulness meditation may improve empathy and cognition.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.680
It's time for you to take your skills to the next level.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.120
You don't need to be a master at doing this.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.780
Anyone who gives a time and a chance has the opportunity to increase productivity, skill, and flow.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.040
So hum, chant, sing, sit in silence, send out compassion, and enjoy the ride.
