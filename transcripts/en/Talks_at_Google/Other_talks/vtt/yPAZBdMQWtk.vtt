FEMALE SPEAKER: Dr. David Solit.

00:00:04.396 --> 00:00:06.210
I have to start with
a personal note.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.510
He's part of my family.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.150
And so I've always been
excited about David

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.820
and who he is as a person,
and I'm excited about his work

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.690
as well.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.500
He's my nephew.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.760
But more importantly
than that, he's

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.870
the director at the Kravis
Center for Molecular Oncology

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.060
at the Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center in New York City.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.000
He's both a researcher
and clinician,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.160
and works on all
areas of cancer.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.240
And today he's going to talk
about an aspect of his research

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.430
that I find fascinating
when I understand it.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.820
And so thank you so much David,
for coming and talking to us.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.690
DAVID B. SOLIT: Thanks for
the invitation to present.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.107
I am out here this weekend
riding in a cancer fundraiser

00:00:56.107 --> 00:00:57.190
called Cycle for Survival.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.060
So since I was in town, I
guess I had the opportunity

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.887
to create this
Google YouTube stream

00:01:04.887 --> 00:01:06.720
and speak to you guys
today about what we've

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.930
been doing at Sloan Kettering.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.370
So really what I want to
talk to you about today

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.200
is how we're trying to use
a big data computational

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.830
approach to identify
new drug targets,

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.670
and how we're actually
studying what we

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.150
call extraordinary responders.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.610
These are patients who
really beat the odds.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.910
These are people who have a
cancer that most patients die

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.240
of, and oftentimes very quickly.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.860
But these are those
rare individuals

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.270
who overcame those odds and
are alive many years later.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.140
And what we try to do is analyze
tumors from those patients

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.950
so that we can learn
lessons from that

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.030
and hopefully identify
new drug targets

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.770
that we can apply in the
broader population of patients.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.060
So I've been at Sloan
Kettering now it's 18 years.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.820
And I run both the research lab.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.630
I also see patients as
a medical oncologist.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.960
And really what the focus
of my lab's efforts is

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.540
is to really try to
identify these drug targets.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.340
And so we try to accelerate
this target discovery.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.080
And it's a pretty simple
paradigm that we follow.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.490
It's really up here on
this first slide here.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.532
We try to define targets.

00:02:10.532 --> 00:02:12.364
And I'm going to spend
a few minutes talking

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:14.840
about what these targets
are and how we find them.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.155
We then, in the
laboratory, try to identify

00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:19.120
a drug that selectively
will inhibit

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.530
that altered target that's
making the cancer cell grow

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.930
or something downstream
from that drug target

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.600
that'll kill the cancer cell.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.100
And then what is a
major challenge--

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.340
and I'll talk to you about
that for the second part

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.640
of the talk-- is
how do we identify

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.050
the individual patients who
have an alteration in their drug

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.840
target so that we can give
them a particular drug?

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.820
And that's really
what we try to do.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.330
So what are these targets?

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.210
There's really two main ways
to identify these targets.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.710
One's called a genotype
to phenotype approach.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.605
And then I'll mention to you the
opposite, which is a phenotype

00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:51.480
to genotype approach.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.320
So the genotype to phenotype
approach-- or G to P--

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.680
is where we take a large
group of tumor samples

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.040
and then we retrospectively do
molecular profiling on them.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.660
And this is usually what's
called next-gen sequencing

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.940
at this point.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.660
There are three
billion base pairs

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.630
of DNA within the human genome.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.240
And what we try
to do is sequence

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.960
that genome in these
individual tumors

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.670
and then use a
statistical approach

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.310
to find things that are commonly
altered in multiple patients

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.330
with the same cancer.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.920
So if you see the same
mutation again and again

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.740
in a particular
cancer type, that

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.750
gives you a statistical clue
that that mutation maybe

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.180
is important for the
growth of that cancer.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.030
And so this was really the paper
that really changed my career.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.834
I was what was called a
postdoctoral fellow working

00:03:35.834 --> 00:03:37.250
in the laboratory
of someone else.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.490
I hadn't gotten
my own laboratory

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.620
when this paper came
out in a journal called

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.240
"Nature," which is
one of the big biology

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.600
journals in the field.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.900
And it was a very simple
experiment that they did.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.320
What they did is they took
1,000 cancer samples--

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.530
some tumors, some cell
lines that were tumors

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.070
that they now had
growing on plastic--

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.530
and they sequenced a
common pathway that's

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.052
activated in cancer called
the MAP kinase pathway.

00:04:03.052 --> 00:04:04.510
And then what they
were looking for

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.140
was genes that hadn't been known
to be mutated that were mutated

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.480
in these tumors commonly.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.570
And so when they
sequenced that pathway,

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.390
they found this
gene called BRAF.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.209
And this was interesting
because at the time,

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.579
nobody had studied BRAF.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.089
There's actually three
different types of RAF proteins.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.340
There's ARAF, there's
BRAF, there's CRAF.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.410
CRAF is also called
RAF1, and it's the one

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.702
that everyone had been
biologically focusing on.

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:31.160
And it turned out that people
were really missing the boat.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.930
And this non-biased approach,
by just sequencing 1,000 tumors,

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.710
identified that BRAF mutations
were found in about 80

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.000
of those, so in about
8% of all those tumors.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.950
And that was about
50% of melanomas,

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.060
but also scattered
throughout other tumor types.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.280
What was notable about
these BRAF mutations

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.180
is that about 95% of them
were the exact same change

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.810
in the DNA.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.200
So it was a substitution
of one amino nucleotide

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.050
for another nucleotide,
which causes

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.730
a single base pair amino
acid change in this protein.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.580
And when you do that, you
actually activate that protein

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.280
constitutively.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.550
So that's why these
people get cancer.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.890
They have an abnormal protein
that's always turned on.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.340
And when you have a
situation like that,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.260
if you can develop an inhibitor
of that activated enzyme,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.180
you oftentimes have
a new cancer drug.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.230
And that's what we tested
in the lab after that.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.310
So what we did is we took a
panel of cancer cell lines.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.150
We looked to see which ones had
BRAF mutations, which ones had

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.690
a mutation upstream called
RAS that had already

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.160
been discovered a
few years prior,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.610
and then which
ones had activation

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.750
of this, what's called
MAP kinase pathway,

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.660
but due to upstream activation.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.450
And what we found
in the laboratory

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.180
was that these tumors
that had BRAF mutations

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.210
were selectively
dependant upon BRAF.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.260
Because if you have a mutation,
and the cancer cell is not

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.980
dependant upon that mutation,
then developing a drug

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.960
that targets that
mutation's probably not

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.197
going to have too much
of a dramatic effect.

00:06:01.197 --> 00:06:03.030
If you actually look
at the chronology here,

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.830
this experiment
was done in 2002.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.750
We did this biologic
experiment in 2006.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.560
And then it took
about til 2010 til

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.420
we had a good drug that we
could actually test in patients.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.010
And this is just some early
data from the phase one trial.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.570
That's the first in human study
of a drug that selectively

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.477
inhibits RAF.

00:06:21.477 --> 00:06:23.560
And this is a patient with
very advanced melanoma.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.350
All of these dark dots here
on this PET scan are cancer.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.280
And you can see 15
days later, after being

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.610
on this selective
inhibitor of BRAF,

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.800
this patient's had a complete
response on our PET scan.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.060
And this is a CAT scan
showing regression

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.740
of those tumors in
this patient's lung.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.700
And ultimately in
a randomized study,

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.407
we were able to
show that this drug,

00:06:43.407 --> 00:06:45.240
if you give it to
patients with melanoma who

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.040
have this BRAF mutation, that
those patients live longer.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.190
And actually we were able
to show in the laboratory

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.070
that if you give this
same drug to cells

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.960
that lack the BRAF mutation,
those cells actually

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.730
grow faster.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.720
So it really becomes
critical that

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.640
for each individual patient,
before we treat them,

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.730
we know whether they
have the BRAF mutation

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.700
or whether they don't
have the BRAF mutation.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.750
Because if we give them
the BRAF inhibitor,

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.704
they're likely to benefit if
they have a BRAF mutation.

00:07:10.704 --> 00:07:12.120
If we give them
the BRAF inhibitor

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.150
and they're BRAF
wild type tumor,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.710
their tumor may
actually grow faster

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.300
and they may die quicker.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.240
So really what the challenge has
become somewhat in our cancer

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.480
population is how
do we figure out

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.054
who's got what mutations
within their tumor?

00:07:26.054 --> 00:07:27.470
Because again,
these mutations can

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.190
be scattered over this
entire human genome, which

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.810
makes up about three billion
different base pairs.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.520
So that's one way to
approach this problem.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.110
That way is really a
statistical approach.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.110
It takes large numbers.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.300
It takes a large consortium.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.940
And there's an effort called
the Tumor Cancer Genome

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.920
Atlas that's trying to do
that across the country.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.860
And that's one way to do it.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.050
And we actually came up
with the opposite idea.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.350
Can we actually take patients
who were on cancer drugs

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.850
and they responded incredibly
well to those cancer drugs--

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.840
most patients didn't, or maybe
nobody else didn't-- and can we

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.530
find out what was the mutation
that made them respond?

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.046
Because if we could
figure that out,

00:08:09.046 --> 00:08:10.920
we already have a good
drug because it worked

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.390
in that individual already.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.980
And if we could just find
other patients just like them,

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.160
we have a drug ready
for those individuals.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.970
So could we expand
out the number

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.540
of patients who would benefit?

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.090
And the real inspiration
for this work

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.920
was this clinical trial that
we ran in Sloan Kettering

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.690
a few years ago.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.820
So this was a trial
we ran back in 2008.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.400
We did this trial in
patients with bladder cancer.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.470
And like every other
bladder cancer trial

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.090
we've done over the
past 20 to 30 years,

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:39.330
this was a negative study.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.490
So we enrolled 45 patients
on to this clinical trial.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.380
Only two of those
patients responded.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.240
And based upon that result,
statistically one would say OK,

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.200
this drug which we
were testing here

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.900
called Everolimus-- it's made
by a company called Novartis--

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.620
that this drug doesn't work in
patients with bladder cancer.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.620
So let's maybe move
on to the next idea.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.330
But despite the fact that
in the entire population

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.370
it wasn't impressive,
this patient

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.540
here-- and I'm showing
her CAT scans-- really

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.440
jumped out at us.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.090
And so just to give you
her history briefly,

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.890
her history actually
begins off the slide here.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.820
In the summer of
2009, she presented

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.500
with a bladder cancer
that had already

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.840
spread to her lymph nodes.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.339
So it was already what
we call metastatic.

00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:25.630
And what we try to do in
these patients is we give them

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.580
chemotherapy, we try to
shrink the tumor down,

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.360
we try to cut
everything out, and then

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.820
in a percentage of those
patients we cure the cancer.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.950
But unfortunately,
by the fall of 2009,

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.990
her cancer had come back, it had
spread back to the lymph nodes.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.140
And you can see here in January
2010, she had this CAT scan.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.740
And really this area here that
the red arrows are pointing at,

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.990
that's her tumor.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.940
And that spread out
through her abdomen.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.380
And actually in this situation,
a patient with bladder cancer

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.150
who's had a prior
line of chemotherapy,

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.331
we have no standard of care.

00:09:58.331 --> 00:10:00.080
And the average survival
of these patients

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.260
is only nine months.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.190
And so we really
encourage these patients

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.670
to go on clinical trials.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.500
And for no particular
reason other than it

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.340
was an open clinical trial at
Sloan Kettering at the time,

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.020
this woman enrolled on
the Everolimus study.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.950
And despite the fact that this
drug really didn't work well

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:18.035
in anybody else,
by April 2010 she

00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:21.040
had achieved a near
complete response.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.950
By July 2010, a
complete response.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.590
What I mean by that is that
all the tumors had completely

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.650
resolved.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.480
If you look at July 2011,
still in a complete response.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.140
'12, '13, '14.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.450
She was actually just back in
our clinic a few weeks ago.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.420
And she's now at her
five year anniversary

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.800
being on this compound without
any evidence of disease,

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.440
despite the fact
that this again,

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.270
in the overall population,
was a negative study.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.330
In fact, every other
patient on this study

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.420
has died of their disease.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.060
She's the only one who's alive.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.120
And not only is she alive, her
cancer's completely gone away.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.470
So again, what makes her unique?

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.610
So at the time, back in
2008, 2009, the technology

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.640
that we had available really
allowed us to look at one gene

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.682
at a time for mutations.

00:11:06.682 --> 00:11:07.890
And that was pretty limiting.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.740
We could have a hypothesis
based upon the biology

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.640
around Everolimus that
maybe this gene or that gene

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.590
was important for this response.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.540
So we did that type of approach.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.470
We looked at a few genes
and a candidate approach.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.230
Couldn't find what really was
unique about this patient.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.100
But what happened along the way
is that technology improved.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.410
And this was both what we
call sequencing technology

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.560
and then also just the
computational power,

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.580
our ability to analyze this
data expanded to the point

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.280
where we could now
do whole genomes.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.160
And so actually, the first
whole genome sequence

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.820
of a normal cell
was not completed

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.740
until about the year 2000.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.470
The first cancer genomes were
only about five years ago.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.540
And those first
cancer genomes were

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.050
costing on an average hundreds
of millions of dollars

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.380
to complete in their entirety.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.450
The technology eventually
progressed to the point where,

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.090
for just a small amount
of money at the time,

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.100
for this paired
genome for sequencing

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.460
both their tumor and their
normal cost about $20,000.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.840
That's already down
to about $2,000

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.880
today, just a few years later.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.710
But again, by being able to
sequence her whole genome

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.010
and being able to
analyze all that data,

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.670
we're able to figure out every
single place in her tumor

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.716
genome where there's
a mutation and it's

00:12:24.716 --> 00:12:26.090
different than
her normal genome.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.640
And if you do that
analysis, you come up

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.420
with 17,000 mutations
that are in her tumor that

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.410
are not in her normal.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.201
And you say well, how
are you going to sort

00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:37.610
through 17,000 data points?

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.730
But it's a real
testament to how much

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.020
we've learned about the
biology of these genes

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.690
over the past several
decades that we're

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.690
able to very quickly
bioinformatically map

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.420
every single one of
these 17,000 mutations

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.250
to what we call the
reference genome.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.930
We can ask, which
of these mutations

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.010
are present in a coding
region of a gene?

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.950
Which of these
mutations would be

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:03.160
predicted, based
upon an algorithm,

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.020
to change the protein function?

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.480
And which of these genes that
change a protein function when

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.380
they have a mutation would
be predicted to be associated

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.520
with Everolimus response?

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.230
And when you do
that, you can take

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.610
all 17,000 of these mutations
and actually boil it down

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:22.220
to just two-- one called TSE1
and the other called NF2.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.200
And the reason these
were so interesting

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.220
is that when you mutated
both TSE1 and TSE2,

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.160
you activated a
protein TORC-1, which

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.770
is the direct target
of Everolimus.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.030
So if you look at this
patient in retrospect,

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.150
she was the perfect
patient to get this drug.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.766
We simply didn't know it
going into the clinical trial,

00:13:40.766 --> 00:13:42.140
because we didn't
know what genes

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.410
were mutated in her tumor.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.000
Actually, at about the
time-- I'll just go back--

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.242
that we were getting
these results back,

00:13:49.242 --> 00:13:50.700
there was actually
a clinical trial

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.620
published that this same
drug Everolimus works

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.550
in patients who have a condition
called tuberous sclerosis.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.490
This is an inherited disease
where patients get cancer

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.120
at a very young age due
to germ line mutations

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.860
in the same gene, TSE1.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.300
And so these are people who
are born with already one

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.120
defective copy of this gene.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.000
If they lose the other
copy in a normal cell,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:11.930
they then get tumors.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.500
And because normally you have
to lose both copies of a gene,

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.826
if it's a tumor
suppressor, to get a tumor,

00:14:16.826 --> 00:14:18.950
these people are very
susceptible to getting cancer

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.970
and they get cancer
at a very young age.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.440
So we've now taken this
extraordinary responder

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.690
paradigm and we've
applied it to other cases.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:30.100
And I just want to mention
one other quickly here today.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:34.840
This is a second patient who
was a young woman in her 40s.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.300
She presented with a
mass in her abdomen.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.270
It was a localized tumor, so
the surgeons opened her up.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.915
They went ahead and
cut out this tumor.

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:45.040
And if you look at this
tumor under the microscope,

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.080
this patient has what's
called a small cell

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.850
cancer of the urothelial tract.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:52.640
And this type of tumor has a
particularly grim prognosis.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.370
So if you look at our series
of this type of cancer

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.350
at Sloan Kettering
over the past 10 years,

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.840
essentially all patients
with this disease

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.840
die of their disease.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.052
And so given that really grim
prognosis, the doctors who

00:15:04.052 --> 00:15:05.760
were treating her went
ahead and gave her

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.020
some chemotherapy,
the [INAUDIBLE],

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.164
even though she didn't
have any cancer.

00:15:10.164 --> 00:15:11.580
And we call this
adjuvant therapy.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:12.954
It's the type of
chemotherapy you

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.150
give try to prevent the
cancer from coming back.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.370
We do this very commonly in
breast cancer and in colon

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:19.020
cancer.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.640
But unfortunately, despite
getting this chemotherapy,

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.220
just a few months later,
her cancer came back.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.530
It had now metastasized
to the kidney.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:30.710
She now had metastases,
and so spread to the lymph

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:31.774
nodes in the abdomen.

00:15:31.774 --> 00:15:34.190
And so what they went ahead
and did is they actually went,

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:35.650
took her back to surgery.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.115
They cut all this
cancer out again.

00:15:37.115 --> 00:15:39.490
Usually that doesn't work,
but they were really desperate

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:40.971
and had really no other options.

00:15:40.971 --> 00:15:43.220
And unfortunately, just a
few months later, the cancer

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.780
had come back again
in the abdomen

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.330
and had now spread to the bone.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.790
And so this was really
not a good story.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:51.840
This is one that probably
was not going to end well.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.370
And so what we recommended
is that we just

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.740
don't have good standard
treatments for you.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.590
We referred her for
a clinical trial,

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.673
and they referred her to
what's called a phase one

00:16:00.673 --> 00:16:01.600
clinical trial.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.270
This is really the first
[? in-man ?] human study where

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.650
we're not even sure what's
the side effect of the drugs,

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.220
what's the right dose to give.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.370
And so she ultimately again,
for no particular reason

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.430
other than it was an
open study at the time,

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:17.800
was enrolled on the study of a
chemotherapy called Irinotecan,

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.890
and a second drug
called AZD7762,

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.500
which is an inhibitor of
a kinase-- or an enzyme,

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.150
you could say--
within the cell that's

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.630
important for DNA
repair and checkpoint

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.200
to allow for DNA repair.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.670
And the hypothesis
with this trial

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:36.430
was that the cancer cells would
be more susceptible to DNA

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.180
damage from the chemotherapy.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.940
This kinase inhibitor would
prevent this DNA repair

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.980
from happening in the
cancer cells selectively,

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.640
and that would thus enhance the
effects of the chemotherapy.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.810
And it was a good idea.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.518
There was some evidence
in the laboratory

00:16:50.518 --> 00:16:51.660
that this could work.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.940
But unfortunately, they
saw a lot of side effects

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.290
with this combination.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.570
And they really weren't
seeing a lot of activities.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.790
So midway through treatment
on this clinical trial,

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.690
the company AstraZeneca
actually discontinued

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.670
the entire program.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.829
So they stopped the
development of this AZD7762.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:12.210
And that was despite the fact
that this patient had actually

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.480
achieved a complete response.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.220
So all her cancer had gone away.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.930
But she was really
the only one where

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.760
we saw that type of response.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.400
And so given the fact that they
had discontinued the program,

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.079
she had to stop taking the drug.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:28.060
They continued the chemotherapy
for a few more months,

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.187
eventually had to stop
that to give her a break.

00:17:30.187 --> 00:17:32.770
They were expecting the cancer
would come right back once they

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:33.890
stopped the treatment.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.800
And that was about
four years ago.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.800
Her cancer's never
come back and she's now

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.890
probably cured of her cancer.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.700
So again, this is a woman
who was cured of a cancer

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.150
that everybody dies
of on a drug that

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.470
was so disappointing
in the clinic

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.710
that the company discontinued it
during the first clinical trial

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:51.620
that was being done.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.770
So we went ahead and we
sequenced this woman's

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:55.360
entire tumor genome.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.910
And this is called
a Circos plot.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.460
It's a way for us just
to represent graphically

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.130
the complexity of
her tumor genome.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.030
We just take the chromosomes,
we line them up in a circle.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.610
These line show translocations,
so a breakage of one chromosome

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.710
where it's recombined
into another.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.620
This inner circle shows copy
number alterations, so gains

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.200
or losses of particular genes.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.370
And then this woman actually
had 19,000 somatic mutations.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.160
These are alterations
that are in the tumor that

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.860
are not present in the normal.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.210
So again, how do we sort
through all this information?

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:30.040
Just to give you some
hints of how we do that.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.870
One thing we do is we can
actually align these genes

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:39.090
to the homologues of these
genes in other species.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:43.590
So we can take particular genes
that are mutated informatically

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:47.120
and align them to the
same gene in a mouse,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.800
or the same gene in
a Drosophila fly,

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.040
or the same gene in a yeast,
or the same gene in a bacteria.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.490
And when you have areas
where the gene is identical

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.100
in a human, in a mouse,
in a dog, in a Drosophila,

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.320
in a yeast, in a bacteria,
that's a part of the gene

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.030
that you simply can't mutate
without altering its function.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.710
So we can prioritize
that mutations

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.790
in that part of
the genome are more

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.230
likely to be functional or
disruptive of the protein's

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.730
function.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.190
And so when you go ahead and
do that, again we go back

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.620
and we take the 19,000
genes, we match them

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.890
up to the coding regions.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.300
We actually narrow it down
to just a couple hundred

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.090
doing that.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.330
And then we take those
couple hundred candidates,

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.800
we align them evolutionarily.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.240
And when we do that, there was
a particular gene called RAD50

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.680
where there was a
single base pair

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.850
substitution in that gene where
it was in a part of the protein

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:37.820
called the D loop.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.785
And that part is essentially
the same in humans, in mice,

00:19:41.785 --> 00:19:44.660
in Drosophila, in
yeast, in bacteria.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:48.630
And so that really allowed us to
prioritize this particular gene

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.340
mutation for further functional
validation versus for example,

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.490
this ATR mutation,
which was also

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.690
mutated in this
patient's tumor but was

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.320
not in a known functional
area of the protein

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.600
and was not in an area of
evolutionary conservation.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.190
We can also take these
different genes that

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:09.750
are mutated and based upon
crystal structures of proteins

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.200
that have been made, we can
actually model off the crystal

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.470
structure where the
mutation is in the protein

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.690
and what this specific
amino acid substitution is

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:21.020
potentially going to do to the
interaction of that protein

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:21.942
with other proteins.

00:20:21.942 --> 00:20:23.900
And so this is just
showing in this patient who

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.330
had this unbelievable
curative response, that this

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.830
is a protein complex of actually
three different proteins called

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.810
the MRE complex.

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.970
And this mutation in
RAD50 would actually

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.960
be predicted to be on the
interface between RAD50

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.620
and another protein called
MRE11, would actually

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.674
disrupt binding of
these two proteins,

00:20:41.674 --> 00:20:43.340
and would actually
disrupt the function.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.070
So based upon again, this
evolutionary conservation

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.580
and this crystal
structure modeling,

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.340
we're able to take
these 19,000 mutations

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.270
and really focus on
this one mutation that

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.640
seems most interesting.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.260
But even there, it's really
a computer prediction.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.670
It's a guess.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.350
And we still need to
go back to the lab

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.220
to do functional
studies to prove

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.590
that that hypothesis
makes a lot of sense.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:09.700
So what we did in this patient,
to make a long story short,

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.400
is we took advantage of this
evolutionary conservation

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.280
within this protein
to actually do

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.050
a cross species validation of
this mutation in a yeast model.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:21.260
So because the yeast
protein for this pathway

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.260
is identical in
humans and in yeast,

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.070
we can knock this
mutation into yeast

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:27.200
and see if it disrupts
the protein function

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.900
and whether it
would maybe explain

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.920
this woman's
incredible sensitivity

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.760
to the chemotherapy.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.897
And so that's really
this experiment here.

00:21:34.897 --> 00:21:36.730
And what we're showing
in this experiment is

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.560
if you knock in this
RAD50 mutation into yeast-

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.900
and actually yeast just
have one copy of the genome,

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:45.050
these are haploid yeast--
you get some sensitization

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.440
to the chemotherapy here.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.510
But if you actually knock in
this RAD50 mutation and also

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.040
knock out the
check one pathway--

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.030
and so MEC1 is the
homologue of ATR,

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.587
which activates
upstream check one--

00:21:57.587 --> 00:21:59.420
you get what's called
a synthetically lethal

00:21:59.420 --> 00:21:59.920
interaction.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.200
So you see a killing
of these cells

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.990
when you have both the RAD50
mutation and knockout check

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:08.380
one when you give the
chemotherapy that you don't see

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.070
when you give the
chemotherapy to cells

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.070
that don't have this
particular mutation profile.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.860
So again, like the first
patient I talked to you about,

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.250
this patient was
the perfect patient

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.010
for this combination of drugs.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.320
We simply didn't know it
going into the clinical trial.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.440
But one could now hypothesize
that if we knew the mutation

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.770
status of all of
these patients going

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.380
into these clinical trials, we
could do these clinical trials

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.060
more effectively, hopefully
get them done quicker,

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.680
and hopefully see better
results going forward.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.290
So this is really the paradigm
of this extraordinary responder

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.230
initiative that's now gone
nationwide through the National

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.390
Cancer Institute.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.589
We take a clinical trial
which was disappointing,

00:22:45.589 --> 00:22:47.630
but for which there were
some patients who seemed

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.450
to benefit from the treatment.

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.450
We take tumors from
those patients.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:53.230
We do some sort of
genetic analysis

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.267
to figure out potentially what
made those patients unique.

00:22:56.267 --> 00:22:57.850
It's not showing up
on the slide here,

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.610
but we always go back
to the laboratory

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:04.000
to do functional
validation of that biology.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.020
And then what we need
is we need an assay,

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.940
we need a test that will
allow us to perspectively

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.470
now look for those particular
mutations in everybody.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.552
So we know who has
which mutations

00:23:14.552 --> 00:23:17.010
so that we can do an iterative
clinical trial where we just

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:19.070
enroll patients
with that mutation

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.780
onto this drug to ask how
many of them are going to have

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.810
similar type of responses.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.210
So how are we going
to find the patients?

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.610
What is the assay
that we're going to do

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.550
to actually do this analysis?

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.730
And so this is what we're
doing at Sloan Kettering.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:36.160
We run an assay called
MSK-IMPACT-- IMPACT standing

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.780
for Integrated Mutation
Profiling of Actionable Cancer

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:39.500
Targets.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.570
And so this is an
assay of 341 genes.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.240
And I took out the slide.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.020
And so what we know
about cancer is

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.810
that genes are not
necessarily distributed

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.531
in terms of the
important mutations all

00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:52.780
the way throughout the genome.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.120
That there's certain parts
of the genome, certain cancer

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.830
genes, that are more likely
to be important than others.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.440
And so what we can do
to try to save costs,

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.490
to save money so that we
can sequence more patients

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:08.410
and get more from our sequencing
resource, what we can do

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:12.810
is we can take DNA from multiple
patients, we can chop it up,

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:17.220
we can then attach a DNA barcode
to each of those individual DNA

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.790
molecules, and then mix all
those DNA molecules together

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.810
in the same reaction.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:25.240
And then we can use
those barcode DNAs

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.610
in a very powerful
computer at the end

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.320
to actually figure out
which DNA molecule came

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.280
from which patient.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.280
And so by mixing all these
in the same reaction,

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.190
that allows us to save money.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.216
And I hope you've
got a plug. [LAUGHS]

00:24:38.216 --> 00:24:39.340
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's there.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.240
I don't know why it's not.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:40.810
Keep talking.

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.090
DAVID B. SOLIT: OK.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:44.760
The other way we
save money is we

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.190
can actually pull down
the parts of the genome

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.830
that we're most interested in.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.650
So we develop dates.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:53.630
We develop DNA dates that
will go and hybridize

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.740
with the parts of the genome
where the cancer mutations are

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.520
most likely to be found.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.150
And that again allows us to
save money on the sequencing

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.070
resource in the future.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:05.640
And so we've
developed this assay.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.863
It's a custom assay.

00:25:06.863 --> 00:25:07.550
Yeah?

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:08.050
Yeah?

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:09.180
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:09.680
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.870
DAVID B. SOLIT: So this is
called next-gen sequencing,

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.950
and it's really a
digital platform.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.340
So we sequence each individual
DNA molecule separately.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.720
And what we try to do is try
to sequence each of these DNA

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.140
molecules 500 or 1,000 times.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.740
And the reason that
we need to do that

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.450
is because the normal DNA is
mixed in with the tumor DNA.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.770
We can't usually get
a pure population

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:36.240
of just cancer cells.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.080
And so if the tumor that we cut
out from the patient and then

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.230
smushed up and
extract the DNA out

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:46.880
of it, if that's 70% normal
cells and 30% tumor cells,

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.770
we need to get
better sensitivity

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:50.330
for finding the mutations.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:51.870
We want to have
very deep coverage.

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:54.800
And that means sequencing
that same part of the genome

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.540
again and again and
again to make sure we

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.680
don't miss the mutation.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.135
Yeah.

00:26:00.135 --> 00:26:01.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:04.039
DAVID B. SOLIT: So we've
created this initiative

00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:04.830
at Sloan Kettering.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:07.260
And really the initiative
is pretty simple.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.400
What we're trying
to do here is we're

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.870
trying to sequence
every single patient

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:15.060
with advanced metastatic
cancer at Sloan Kettering using

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:15.670
this assay.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:20.190
And so we see about
45,000 unique patients

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:23.050
with cancer at Sloan
Kettering every single year.

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.880
About 75% of these
patients are cured.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.980
About a quarter of them
develop recurrent disease

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.470
and are thus at highest risk
of dying of their cancer

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.971
and thus the most in
need for novel therapies.

00:26:33.971 --> 00:26:35.970
And so we've got about
10,000 to 12,000 patients

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:38.160
like that at Sloan
Kettering every year.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.860
And so we are going
to attempt, and we've

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.300
begun this effort just
over the past year,

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.690
use this assay to sequence every
single one of those patients.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.150
We actually sequence
both the tumor

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.110
and we also sequence
the normal DNA.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.830
And by sequencing the normal
DNA in all these genes,

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:56.330
there's actually the potential
to identify a mutation that's

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.450
in the normal cells
that was actually

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:01.320
the reason that the patient got
the cancer in the first place.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.470
So genes like BRCA1
or BRCA2, these

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.220
are risk factor genes that
make it more likely that you're

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.490
going to get cancer.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:10.620
What's the major
hurdle to doing this?

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.250
Previously up to this
year, it was technology.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.310
But now it's really
money, like many things.

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:19.130
So it's very expensive
to do the sequencing.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.010
And that's why I was
focusing on how can we

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.855
bring the cost of the
sequencing down by mixing DNA

00:27:23.855 --> 00:27:25.980
from multiple patients
together and just sequencing

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.050
parts of the genome?

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:32.650
And it's both
expensive and it's not

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:36.000
standard to do this type
of testing in most patients

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.620
with cancer.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.890
So we can only bill
insurance companies

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.770
to do this type of testing
in six adult tumors.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:43.990
So patients with lung
cancer, colorectal, melanoma,

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:46.340
GIST tumors,
thyroid, and patients

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.600
with diffuse gliomas,
which are brain cancers.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.020
So people with breast cancer,
folks with prostate cancer,

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.920
endometrial cancer, ovarian
cancer, bladder cancer, these

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.240
are not tumors that we can
get any sort of insurance

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.560
or Medicare reimbursement
for doing the sequencing.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.355
So to be able to do this
sequencing, we need to go out

00:28:03.355 --> 00:28:04.480
and we need to raise funds.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.130
And I'm actually
here this weekend

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:09.190
riding with Cycle for
Survival to raise funds

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:11.540
to do this type of sequencing.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.251
And so our plan is to
try to do this as a

00:28:13.251 --> 00:28:15.000
what we call a research
non billable test,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.910
try to sequence everyone,
and then use this information

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:22.166
to try to drive patients to
the most appropriate treatment.

00:28:22.166 --> 00:28:24.040
We've also made a decision
at Sloan Kettering

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.550
that we're going to make
the data that we generate

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:30.160
using this assay available
to everyone at the Center

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:30.980
in real time.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.590
So what we've done is we've
created this web-based portal

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:37.090
and database called the
cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.060
And there's both
a private version

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.920
of this portal and a public
version that you can access.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.990
But this is really almost cancer
bioinformatics for dummies.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.790
It really is a
way for biologists

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:52.660
who don't have a
computational degree, maybe

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:55.510
knowledge of how to do
a Unix command prompt

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:58.270
or other training, to be
able to browse this data.

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.970
So if you're a clinician and
you're not an informatician,

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:02.810
or you're a biologist
and just don't

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:05.660
have a bioinformatics
degree, this type of portal

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.740
lets you figure out
very quickly where

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.100
mutation's found in particular
cancer types, what's

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.880
the co-mutation
pattern, how often

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.540
are those mutations found.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.490
And this data's now available
to everyone at Sloan Kettering.

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:20.067
And this is the summary
page of that portal.

00:29:20.067 --> 00:29:22.150
And I just blew it up here
so that you can see it.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:25.500
It lists how many of each
cancer that we've done.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.550
441 patients with breast
cancer, 393 with lung cancer,

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:32.240
222 with colorectal,
all down the line.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.550
And we're not just
doing common cancers.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:36.210
We're also doing
very rare cancers.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.480
We've done one patient for
example with a Wilms' tumor.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.510
This is a very rare
pediatric cancer.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.820
We've done a couple patients
who have Fallopian tube cancers,

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.230
another very rare cancer.

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:49.820
And so we're doing both common
cancers and rare tumor types.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.720
There's a patient centered
view for these tumors.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.330
And you can see this
is a patient who

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:59.210
had a colorectal cancer which
had one of these BRAF mutations

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.344
that we now have a drug
against that I mentioned

00:30:01.344 --> 00:30:02.510
to you a little bit earlier.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.790
But the patient also has a
number of other mutations

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:06.290
that are picked up by the assay.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.720
And so this type
of sequencing may

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.360
allow us to understand
maybe why some patients

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.520
with BRAF reputations who
get the BRAF inhibitor

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.450
do better than others.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.940
So some patients may
have a co-mutation

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.030
that makes their tumor
less dependent upon BRAF

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:24.240
and thus less sensitive
to that inhibitor.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.780
We've also created
a database which

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.690
is out there to actually educate
the clinicians as to what

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:31.760
this information means.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.110
So many of the oncologists who
treat these patients really

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:39.630
just never got the
education in cancer genetics

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:43.520
to even understand what we're
talking about when we talk

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.030
about all these gene mutations.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:49.742
And so there's 20,000 plus
genes in the human genome.

00:30:49.742 --> 00:30:51.200
I don't know off
the top of my head

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.750
the four digit code for
every single one of those

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.770
and what that gene does.

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.560
And so we almost
need a computer tool

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.590
to be able to, when
this data comes back,

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.550
be able to give us data.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.320
This gene has this
function and when

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.070
you have this particular
mutation in the gene, that's

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:11.650
a functional mutation
and causes sensitivity

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:12.670
to a particular drug.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:16.850
So this database is something
that's a work in progress.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.544
But something that actually
doesn't exist publicly

00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:20.960
is something we're
actually hoping

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.720
maybe we can get together with
other major cancer centers

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.770
and do a Wikipedia type of
model where everybody puts

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.770
in their specific
knowledge expertise

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:34.550
and eventually you
then crowd source

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:38.160
this sort of important
data for all 20,000

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.610
plus genes in the genome.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:42.130
But currently, we
have this data just

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.010
for the genes that
we have in our assay.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.840
And even there,
it's only partial.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.200
So it's a real work in
progress, and a real problem.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.080
Because when this data comes
back, most oncologists again,

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.710
they don't know what these
particular mutations mean

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.690
and what they do.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.330
So again, this is--
yeah, go ahead.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:01.420
So if we actually go back
one slide here before this

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:01.975
comes up.

00:32:01.975 --> 00:32:02.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:03.190
DAVID B. SOLIT: Yeah.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.689
Yeah.

00:32:03.689 --> 00:32:06.010
OK, so can we
compare our database

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:09.560
to 1000 Genomes or the
Sanger database and others?

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:13.240
And cBioPortal has become a
public database in some ways.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.590
So all the Tumor Cancer Genome
Atlas that's publicly available

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:20.250
is now searchable
in the cBioPortal.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:21.700
Other published
databases are now

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.060
brought into the cBioPortal.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.890
And so this has
actually become, I

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:28.300
think, the primary
tool for most people

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.690
who are not cancer
bioinformaticians to really

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.650
sort through the data.

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:37.800
But you know, the problem
is is that not everyone even

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.840
makes their data publicly
available in a way

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.110
that we can bring it
in to these databases.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:45.390
So just to give you
one example, there's

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:49.660
a company that does germ line
testing for BRCA called Myriad.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:55.440
And they've probably tested
close to 200,000 plus patients

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.170
with breast and ovarian
cancer for these germ line

00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:58.800
alterations.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.390
But they consider that
data to be proprietary.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:04.850
They don't release it, and
so we don't have that data.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.940
So it really is
going to be important

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.860
that anything public gets
into these type of databases.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.800
And it's not something that
a cancer center necessarily

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.430
was in the best position to do.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.300
I mean, that's
not our expertise.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.352
And so we've created this
initiative at Sloan Kettering.

00:33:22.352 --> 00:33:24.060
But I'll tell you,
we'd love to reach out

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:28.170
to people who have better
experience putting together

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:33.110
these type of databases to
make these tools even better.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:35.580
So I think that
remains a problem.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.470
There's a lot of
proprietary data out there,

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.900
but I think there's enough
in the public domain

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.480
that if you really consolidated
it into one source,

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.560
it would be incredibly valuable.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.380
So again, that's how we're
going to find the mutations.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.952
And now I just want to
talk for a few minutes

00:33:52.952 --> 00:33:55.160
about how are we going to
do the clinical trials that

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.740
are actually going to take this
genetic information to really

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.430
test these new drugs?

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:01.380
And so there's
really two main ways

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.210
we can do these clinical trials.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.080
One is called an umbrella
protocol or a master protocol.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.040
And these protocols
are usually centered

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.960
around a particular cancer type.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.340
So this would be a master
protocol for patients with lung

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.850
cancer, as an example.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:17.260
And so what we do here is
we sequence all the patients

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:20.139
with lung cancer, maybe
at multiple institutions.

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:22.659
And then depending upon
what mutation they have,

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:25.090
we put them on different
drugs based upon that.

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:27.300
And many of the doctors
like this approach,

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.010
because as I mentioned
earlier, it's

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.460
very hard to find the funds
to sequence the patients.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.630
And so if you have a
clinical trial like this,

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:36.830
you can ask the drug companies
maybe that make these drugs--

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.800
the EGFR inhibitor, the BRAF
inhibitor, the MAC inhibitor--

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.949
to maybe pay for the sequencing.

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:44.234
So this is one way
that we try to do this.

00:34:44.234 --> 00:34:45.900
And there are some
master protocols open

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:50.489
for patients with lung cancer
and some other tumor types.

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:52.639
There's a few problems
with this approach though.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:55.850
One is that oftentimes
it's not the same drug

00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:57.890
company that makes each drug.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:01.020
And so drug company one might
make the EGFR inhibitor,

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:03.100
drug company two may
make the BRAF inhibitor,

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.530
and so on and so forth.

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:07.190
So sometimes you can spend
a year or two negotiating

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:08.690
with different drug
companies to get

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:12.660
the different drugs into this
one giganto clinical trial.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.870
And by the time you've
actually secured the drugs

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:17.282
and opened the trial, maybe
one or two of these drugs

00:35:17.282 --> 00:35:18.865
have already failed
in another context

00:35:18.865 --> 00:35:21.950
and they're not really the best
in class drug that's available.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.180
So that's one downside.

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:26.190
The other downside
I'm going to focus on

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.690
is that oftentimes these
are small clinical trials.

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:32.390
And maybe you're sequencing
in this clinical trial

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.040
200 patients.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.120
And if you've got a
mutation in the population

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.910
that you're studying
that's only 1% or 2% or 3%

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.500
of the population,
you're not going

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.300
to get enough patients
on to this clinical trial

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.470
with that particular
mutation to really answer

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:48.730
the primary question, which
is if you have this mutation,

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:52.260
do you respond to this specific
inhibitor of that drug?

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.350
So that's one approach.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.082
But if you could find
the right patient ,

00:35:56.082 --> 00:35:58.040
you can sometimes see
these incredible effects.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.230
This is a patient
with lung cancer.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:04.440
And actually in lung
cancer, these BRAF mutations

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:09.070
I mentioned to you earlier only
make up about 1% to maybe 2%

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.250
of the population.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:14.420
But if you can find that rare
patient who has a BRAF mutation

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.260
and give them the
same drug that works

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.460
in melanoma-- in this
case, [INAUDIBLE],

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.206
which is a selective
inhibitor of RAF--

00:36:21.206 --> 00:36:23.080
you can see these type
of incredible effects.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.500
This is a patient who's been
on this drug for over two years

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.740
with a disease that most
patients progress very quickly

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.430
and die within a year or two.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.710
So again, if you can
match the right patient

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:39.240
on to the right drug by some
mechanism, this can work.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.550
But for these rare mutations,
this type of master protocol

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:45.514
design is really inefficient.

00:36:45.514 --> 00:36:47.680
So what we've tried to do
is create a different type

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:51.990
of trial design that works for
mutations where the mutation is

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:53.840
found in a lot of
different cancers,

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.750
but is not common
in any of them.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:57.680
And so an example
of that is a gene

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:01.440
called ERBB2, which is mutated
in pretty much every different

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.600
cancer.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.970
But usually about
1% or 2% or 3%.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.610
So there's a lot
of these mutations.

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:08.400
If you add them up,
there's probably

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.370
10,000 patients in
this country a year

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:13.290
who have a ERBB2 mutant tumor.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:16.480
But in most cancers, like
breast cancer, it's only 2%

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.350
of the population.

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:19.560
So if you wanted
to just test for it

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.630
and then enroll a
breast cancer trial,

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.790
you'd have to test
100 patients to find

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.130
two who have the mutation.

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:27.740
And that's a very
inefficient way to do that.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.950
So what we've decided
to do is we've

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:33.250
created this new type of trial
that we call a basket trial.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:35.280
And what a basket
trial is it's a trial

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.230
that's focused around a specific
gene or mutation and not

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:39.360
around a particular tumor.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.940
So we can take any patient.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.240
It doesn't matter what
kind of cancer you have,

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.465
as long as you have the
mutation we're interested in.

00:37:46.465 --> 00:37:50.210
And for this study of a
drug called Neratinib,

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:52.450
we're looking for patients
with a ERBB2 mutation.

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:54.908
And it doesn't matter if you
have a bladder cancer or colon

00:37:54.908 --> 00:37:57.360
cancer, an endometrial,
gastric, ovarian, breast.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:58.170
It doesn't matter.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:01.000
If you have a ERBB2 mutation,
you can go on to the study.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.030
We always have another
arm for these studies

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:05.420
as well, because maybe
there's some other rare cancer

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:08.500
type that we didn't even
know had ERBB2 mutations.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.540
But we find one, we want
to give the opportunity

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:13.450
to test whether that patient's
going to respond to the drug.

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:16.010
And we've seen some incredible
responses with this approach.

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:20.370
So this is a patient who has
one of these ERBB2 mutations.

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.590
And we generally don't test
for these mutations in breast

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:25.170
cancer, which is what she has.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:27.300
And this is a woman who'd
been through many lines

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.130
of chemotherapy,
none of which were

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:33.214
working because they weren't
targeting the right mutation.

00:38:33.214 --> 00:38:34.630
And you can see
from her PET scan,

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:37.220
she had this incredibly
high burden of disease.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:40.510
All of these are actually
metastasis from her cancer.

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:43.367
This is her brain,
this is her bladder.

00:38:43.367 --> 00:38:45.200
Some of this is her
heart, but most of these

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:45.950
are all mutations.

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:48.260
And actually see less
uptake in the heart

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.530
because so much of the PET
tracer here-- the glucose

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.350
that we inject, the
radioactive glucose tracer--

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:54.880
is going up in the tumor.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.260
And so she was started on
this drug on this basket study

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.930
in July of 2004.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.810
Within two months, she's
had a complete response.

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:05.780
But the key issue here is
not that it's surprising

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:08.960
that this ERBB2 inhibitor,
which is what Neratinib is,

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.970
would work in this
ERBB2 mutant patient.

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:13.040
The real problem is that
almost all patients who

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:18.320
have this mutation-- this V77L
missense mutation in ERBB2--

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.760
are unaware that they
have this mutation

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.720
because we don't test
for this mutation.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.719
So since nobody's testing for
it, we can't find the patients.

00:39:25.719 --> 00:39:27.510
We can't put them on
the trial and we can't

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:28.593
prove that the drug works.

00:39:28.593 --> 00:39:30.760
So it's really a chicken
and the egg problem.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.440
How do you prove the drug
works without knowing

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.840
who has the mutation?

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:38.060
How can you actually justify
doing the testing unless you

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.274
know that the drug works?

00:39:39.274 --> 00:39:40.940
Because otherwise,
the insurance company

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.300
won't pay for the testing.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.430
And so to try to break this
chicken and the egg cycle,

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:47.740
we've just made this
commitment that we

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.600
are going to test everyone using
institutional funds until we

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.880
can essentially enroll enough
patients onto these trials

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.320
to prove that these
drugs work or don't work.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.390
It's a little more complicated
than I'm making it out to be.

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:04.030
There are multiple different
ERBB2 mutations in cancer.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.760
They may all respond a little
bit differently to the drug.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.070
And so what we do with the
basket study, for example,

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:10.900
is we can take this
breast cancer arm.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.860
We can initially enroll all the
patients with ERBB2 mutations.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.960
Since we've already
seen a positive result

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.420
on the overall arm, we
can then do sub-baskets

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.900
where we enroll a
cohort of patients

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.250
that have this S310 mutation,
a cohort of patients

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:29.719
with an L755 mutation, a cohort
with V77L on down the line.

00:40:29.719 --> 00:40:31.260
And again, we always
have another arm

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.110
for these rare
mutations to give access

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:34.910
to the drug to these patients.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:37.520
And the question is, can we
eventually get to a point

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.400
where we've got a rare
enough mutation disease

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.870
combination where almost
everybody's responding

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:48.020
that the FDA would simply allow
us to change standard of care

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:48.790
at that point?

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:51.980
So typically, the FDA has
required us, for cancer drugs,

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.060
to do randomized studies.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:56.720
Where one half of the
patients or so get the drug,

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.730
the other half get a placebo
or an older standard drug

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.480
that doesn't work very well.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.010
And the question
is, can we avoid

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:06.450
those type of randomized studies
by very carefully selecting

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:10.850
the patients so that the benefit
is so high on a small study

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:14.920
that it compels the community
to just change standard of care?

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:18.100
Because you could imagine if we
were seeing this type of result

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.920
in 80% or 90% percent
of the patients

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.430
with this mutation
in breast cancer,

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:25.240
a patient with that exact
mutation in breast cancer

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.980
doesn't want to go on a placebo.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:30.240
And it might sound ridiculous to
even consider that possibility.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.260
But the [INAUDIBLE] study that
I told you about earlier was

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.356
that exact situation.

00:41:34.356 --> 00:41:35.730
And despite that,
we actually had

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:38.630
to do a placebo controlled
study by the FDA.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:41.485
In that case, there were enough
patients to do that trial.

00:41:41.485 --> 00:41:43.860
I don't even think there's
enough patients in the country

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:48.360
to do a placebo controlled study
of just V77L ERBB2 mutations

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.060
with Neratinib.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:52.840
So hopefully, the regulators
will accept this and change

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:53.820
the way we do things.

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.310
Question?

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:57.360
So I guess the
question was are we

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.820
potentially missing important
mutations or other alterations

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:05.980
by just sequencing the 410
genes that our current assay is

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:06.710
looking at?

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:09.090
And the answer is
absolutely correct.

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:13.910
But my initial answer that
question would be this

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:15.970
is an example of not
letting the perfect be

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:16.930
the enemy of the good.

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:20.110
So since we can't do
whole genome sequencing

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:23.500
on every single
patient, that shouldn't

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:27.200
prevent us to do 410 genes
on every single patient.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.880
So we're doing what we're
feasibly able to do right now.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.790
But the expectation is
that this sequencing

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:37.300
is going to become
cheaper over time,

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.520
and the computational
power to do the analysis

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.650
gets cheaper and
quicker over time.

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:43.940
And everybody I'm
sure in this room

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.280
knows of Moore's Law,
which is the rate

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.840
at which computational power
becomes more powerful and less

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.020
expensive.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:54.790
The rate at which sequencing
is becoming more powerful

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:56.790
is actually much
dramatically faster

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:59.780
than what you see with Moore's
Law with semiconductors.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.200
So we're seeing this
incredibly fast drop

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.290
in the cost of sequencing.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:05.790
And there's companies
like Illumina

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:08.110
and others that are
making these machines that

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:09.370
are driving this improvement.

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:11.610
And it's probably
a few years away

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:14.070
from a point where we will
be getting that whole genome

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:15.820
sequence on every patient.

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.070
We just feasibly
can't do it now.

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:19.594
But there are
probably some patients

00:43:19.594 --> 00:43:22.010
who are going out and having
their whole genome sequenced.

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:25.020
There might be a few
patients of means that can

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:27.650
convince somebody to do that.

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:31.180
My lab does it in this
retrospective approach

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.660
for these rare,
extraordinary responders.

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:38.910
But each one of those not only
costs the lab tens of thousands

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.430
of dollars to do,
but it takes actually

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:45.429
a team of informaticians
weeks to do the analysis.

00:43:45.429 --> 00:43:46.970
So we need the cost
of the sequencing

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:48.660
to come down and
then what we need

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.590
is better algorithmic
approaches for the analysis

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:54.490
so that you can take these
billions of data points

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:56.830
and be able to analyze
them much more quickly.

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:58.430
And one way to do
that is to have

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:01.350
this central database
of all known variant

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:03.980
changes that you're
able to reference.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:05.580
And so the fact
that we've only done

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.620
a small number of
whole genomes so far

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:10.370
make it difficult for us
to know whether something

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:12.620
found in a particular
genome is important.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.630
Because the more you
do, the more often you

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:17.330
see these patterns
that allow you to know

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:19.165
that something is real or not.

00:44:19.165 --> 00:44:22.090
But it's a great question.

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:24.690
So what are the advantages
of this basket approach?

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:29.250
I'm a clinician, but I'm also a
cancer biologist, a geneticist.

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:30.850
What this allows
us to do is really

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:32.830
test that defined
biologic hypothesis.

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:37.810
Does a ERBB2 inhibitor work in
patients with a ERBB2 mutation?

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:39.500
How often does it work?

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.050
If it works in some
patients and not others,

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:44.130
we can collect tumors
from all those patients,

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:45.780
we can maybe do whole
genome sequencing

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.310
in that whole cohort,
and figure out

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:51.680
what are the co-mutations that
determine that heterogeneity

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.619
within even that small class.

00:44:54.619 --> 00:44:56.160
We're also doing on
this trial what's

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.670
called a co-clinical trial,
where we enroll patients not

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:01.240
just with known
activating mutations

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.260
but also patients who have novel
mutations that have never been

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.731
biologically characterized.

00:45:05.731 --> 00:45:07.480
And what we do is while
those patients are

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.400
on the clinical
trial, we biologically

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.540
characterize those
mutations in the laboratory.

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:13.990
And we may find that
for some of them,

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:15.590
they're not
functional mutations.

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:18.060
So if I go back to this
slide of ERBB2 mutations,

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:20.940
these hot spots have now all
been biologically validated

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:21.940
and are real.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.750
As we get more and
more sequencing data,

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:27.529
some of these rare mutations
will become hot spots.

00:45:27.529 --> 00:45:30.070
But some of these are just what
we call passenger mutations--

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:32.950
the random changes in the
DNA due to the toxin that

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:35.580
induced the DNA damage.

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.599
And they're not
driving the cancer.

00:45:37.599 --> 00:45:39.390
And so we don't have
that knowledge for all

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:40.990
of these mutations so far.

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.019
We just have it for
the most common.

00:45:43.019 --> 00:45:44.560
But as patients come
on to the study,

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.040
we study individual mutations
that have not already

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.570
been validated.

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:50.330
What are the challenges
with the approach?

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:54.020
The primary criticism we
get from drug companies,

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.980
clinicians,
regulators, is that we

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:59.200
fail to identify patients
who could respond

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.450
but they don't have the
bio-marker we're testing.

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:03.367
So in the case of ERBB2,
you don't necessarily

00:46:03.367 --> 00:46:05.700
have to have a ERBB2 mutation
to benefit from Neratinib.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:06.950
We actually know that's true.

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:10.736
Maybe you can have an activated
receptor from a ligand

00:46:10.736 --> 00:46:11.360
that's binding.

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.700
So while that's true, it's
not the point of the study,

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:16.910
and we can always study those
things in later studies.

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:20.547
I call it the sad fact,
and that's in academia,

00:46:20.547 --> 00:46:22.880
it's sometimes difficult to
get the lung doctors to work

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.338
with the colon doctors to get
them to work with the bladder

00:46:25.338 --> 00:46:25.950
doctors.

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:28.450
They're actually not used to
doing clinical trials that way.

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:31.310
So the way they train, the
way they practice over decades

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:33.190
is you just do
breast cancer trials,

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:35.480
and they're separate than
doing lung cancer trials,

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.355
and they're separate
than doing colon trials.

00:46:37.355 --> 00:46:40.720
And the concept of doing a
trial where any type of cancer

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.750
can be in that trial
is something that's

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:45.070
foreign to the community.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:47.240
But I think that's starting
to change with some

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.350
of the success we've seen.

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:49.850
And again, I'm just
going to mention

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:53.100
that the primary hurdle really
remains that identifying

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.050
the patients is a challenge.

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:57.490
The vast majority of patients
with cancer in this country

00:46:57.490 --> 00:46:59.240
don't get any testing.

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.530
There's only a few institutions
doing this right now.

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:05.330
The scale, that number is going
to keep going up over time.

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:07.830
But most patients in the
community don't get this.

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:11.560
There are some companies that
are now specifically opening up

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:12.830
to do this type of testing.

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:14.860
One's called
Foundation Medicine.

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:18.320
They charge $5,800 for the
test, and generally insurance

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:18.960
doesn't cover.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:22.350
So for most patients,
it's not really

00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:25.860
feasible to get
this test performed.

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.304
I just have two more slides.

00:47:27.304 --> 00:47:29.470
I just want to point out
that the testing's not just

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:32.640
for selection of what we call
targeted therapies, which

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.870
are drugs that inhibit a
specific mutant protein.

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:38.480
This was one of the
first patients of mine

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.850
that I see in the clinic
which I did this testing for.

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:44.000
And this was a patient
with prostate cancer

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.580
who did very poorly with
all the standard treatments.

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.710
And so we went ahead and
we biopsied his cancer

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.610
after it had become metastatic
and had spread to other sites.

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:55.460
And then we did the
testing, and what

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.570
was notable about his
tumor is that he actually

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:01.700
had 29 mutations
identified by the assay.

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:03.540
And that's surprising
in prostate cancer,

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.660
because most prostate cancers
only have a few mutations.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.820
So prostate cancer's known
for a very low mutation rate.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.710
But this guy had a very
high mutation rate tumor.

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:16.261
And he actually had two
genes that were mutated.

00:48:16.261 --> 00:48:17.510
The red bars are a little off.

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:20.130
One's called MLH1, the
other's called MSH2.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:21.960
And these were both
truncating mutations.

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.876
And what's interesting
about these genes

00:48:23.876 --> 00:48:25.750
is that when you get
mutations in these genes

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:28.090
in the normal cells, you
have a condition called

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:30.830
Lynch syndrome, which
leads to colorectal

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:32.120
cancers, endometrial cancers.

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:35.130
Not typically prostate
cancers, but you

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:37.640
get these hypermutated tumors.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.660
And what we've learned is that
if you test immunotherapies--

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:44.440
these are a new class of drugs
that harness the immune system

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:48.260
to attack the cancer-- these
type of hypermutated tumors

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:50.840
are more likely to
respond than tumors

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:51.990
that have fewer mutations.

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:53.740
And that's probably
due to the fact

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:57.110
that these hypermutated
tumors are expressing

00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:00.260
proteins that are seen by the
immune system as being foreign.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.770
They're not self, they're
not the normal proteins

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:03.910
for that individual.

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:06.480
They've got a slight change
and so they're seen as foreign

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:09.530
and it's easier to stimulate the
immune system to attack them.

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:11.570
So we actually
have a basket study

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:13.400
where you can have
any type of cancer.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.560
If you have one of these
type of hypermutated tumors,

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.330
this basket study
design provides access

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:20.850
to this type of immunotherapy.

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:23.600
In particular for this trial,
a drug called MEDI4736.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:28.520
This is a drug that binds to
a protein called PD1, which

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.390
leads to a checkpoint
effect and a stimulation

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:33.400
of the immune system
to fight the cancer.

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.730
And I can say that this
patient here is actually

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:38.770
seeing early benefit
with this anti PD1

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:43.350
therapy with this
hypermutated prostate cancer.

00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:44.850
These type of
hypermutated tumors

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:47.440
were not something we saw
when we did a retrospective

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.330
analysis of early tumors.

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:51.520
But notably, we've found
already about five or six

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.560
of these patients out
of the first 150 or so

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.500
of the prostate cancers that
we've done perspectively

00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:58.440
at Sloan Kettering.

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.520
And it's possible that
these hypermutated tumors

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:04.120
are overrepresented in those
advanced metastatic patients

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.845
because these
hypermutated tumors are

00:50:05.845 --> 00:50:07.720
less likely to respond
the standard treatment

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.630
and more likely to recur and
progress to metastatic disease.

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:13.690
So again, figuring
out in the end what

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.380
is driving an individual
patient's tumor,

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:19.770
we're hoping to use that
information to really guide

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:21.330
the treatment of patients.

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:25.080
Just one more point and
then I'll finish up.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.396
This is this company
that I mentioned

00:50:27.396 --> 00:50:29.020
that's been doing
this type of testing.

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:32.670
This was a report that was sent
to me from a patient at Johns

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:36.870
Hopkins asking if they could
be on this ERBB2 basket study.

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:38.700
And they had a
ERBB2 mutation, they

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.010
had an S310F ERBB2 mutation.

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:44.420
But there was this
note on the report that

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.600
was what's called subclonal.

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.230
And so what that means
is that it's likely

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:51.600
at least you can
infer informatically

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:54.850
that this mutation is not likely
present in every single cancer

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:55.350
cell.

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:58.910
And so to just show you from
our data what that means,

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:00.510
here's a patient
with breast cancer

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:02.960
who has an L755S mutation.

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.640
The allele frequency
here is the number

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.710
of reads in the tumor
that have the mutation

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:08.735
versus the normal reads.

00:51:08.735 --> 00:51:11.550
And we never see this as 100%,
because typically you only

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:13.390
mutate one copy of the gene.

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:15.360
And also there's this
stromal contamination

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.520
of the normal cells,
which are obviously

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.080
normal for the mutation.

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.890
But what's notable, it's 58%
here, 20 something percent

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:23.270
for the other two mutations.

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:25.350
This is probably a
mutant where there's

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:27.380
two copies of the
mutation for ERBB2

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.535
and one copy for
these other two genes.

00:51:29.535 --> 00:51:31.076
If I look at this
other patient, this

00:51:31.076 --> 00:51:32.860
is a patient with
bladder cancer where

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:37.150
can see this P53 mutation's
in 57% of the reads,

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:40.490
the TSE1 is in 61% of the
reads, but the ERBB2 mutation's

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:41.670
only in 3% of the reads.

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.850
And the way you can
statistically get that

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:47.180
is if the ERBB2 mutation is
just in some of the cancer cells

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.660
and not in all the cancer cells.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:52.090
And one could imagine that
if the mutation that we're

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:54.600
targeting is not in
every single cancer cell,

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.470
when we give the drug, the cells
that don't have the mutation

00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:00.630
are probably going to quickly
grow out and become resistant.

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:03.740
And this type of what we
call clonality analysis

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.810
is very difficult to do when you
have limited amounts of data.

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:10.070
So if we only have a
small list of mutations

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:12.300
because we're only
sequencing a few genes,

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:13.660
it's very difficult to do this.

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:16.530
But if we do whole exome
or whole genome sequencing,

00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:19.560
we can actually define
this clonality much better.

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:22.030
It still takes a huge amount
of computational resource

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:23.690
to do this type of analysis.

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:25.730
But as this technology
gets better,

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:27.480
this is the type of
data we're going to be

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:28.830
getting for every patient.

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:30.800
And it's not going
to simply be do

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.520
you have the mutation as a
binary variable, yes or no,

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.930
but is that mutation what we
call an early truncal mutation?

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:41.630
Is it present in all cells
or is present in just some?

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:44.510
This is an interesting
patient where we have

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:46.440
four tumors that we sequenced.

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:48.910
And this is how the
cBioPortal shows that.

00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:51.390
And you can see for
these four genes,

00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:54.430
these four mutations were
found in all four tumors.

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:57.380
But you could see the ERBB2
mutation was just in tumor one.

00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.845
This PIK3CA mutation was
just in two and four.

00:52:59.845 --> 00:53:02.320
We actually have drugs
against both of these targets.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.800
The EGFR mutation was
only in tumor three.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.870
The P10 only in tumor two.

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:08.980
So these are all
druggable mutations,

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:11.930
but they're not in
every single tumor cell.

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:14.570
And so this is an additional
level of complexity

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:16.570
that is going to
make this difficult.

00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:18.570
And is really going to
require to eventually use

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:22.710
combinations of these inhibitors
to really see maximal effect.

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:24.350
So I'm just going
to leave it there

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:26.860
and just acknowledge
a number of people.

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:29.360
I really want to acknowledge
Gopa Iyer, a very talented-- he

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:32.194
was initially a postdoc fellow,
now junior faculty member who

00:53:32.194 --> 00:53:33.860
was in my lab and
really started with me

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:36.224
this extraordinary
responder initiative.

00:53:36.224 --> 00:53:38.640
The center I run, which is the
Kravis Center for Molecular

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.640
Oncology at Sloan
Kettering, I've

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.380
got three associate directors.

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:45.890
One, Mike Berger, who developed
this impact assay and really

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:47.560
deserves a lot of
credit for that.

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:50.180
Another, Agnes Viale, who runs
our operational sequencing

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:50.890
core.

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:52.473
And then Barry Taylor,
who we actually

00:53:52.473 --> 00:53:54.770
recruited back from
UCSF just recently

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:57.850
to head what we call
computational oncology.

00:53:57.850 --> 00:54:00.270
And this is really a new
field that didn't exist

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:02.180
before the last couple years.

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:04.310
And so what's
computational oncology?

00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:08.390
These are people who use
computational tools to answer

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:10.030
clinical and biologic questions.

00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:12.590
So we now have a whole
group of scientists

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:16.740
that that's what they're
going to be identified as,

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:19.134
as computational biologists
or computational oncologists.

00:54:19.134 --> 00:54:20.800
And then just note
several other people.

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.375
Marc Ladanyi, who runs our
clinical sequencing lab

00:54:23.375 --> 00:54:24.840
with Maria Arcila.

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.590
Dave Hyman, who runs a lot of
these basket studies with me,

00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:29.799
and Jose Baselga, who's
our physician in chief,

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:31.590
and has really provided
a lot of leadership

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:34.120
to get this sequencing
effort up and running.

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.370
So thanks again
for the invitation.

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:39.500
Happy to answer any questions,
either now or formally later.

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:40.604
So thank you.

00:54:40.604 --> 00:54:43.089
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:45.077 --> 00:54:47.780
AUDIENCE: You showed a slide
where one person had you

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:50.617
said, 20 some mutations
in the prostate.

00:54:50.617 --> 00:54:51.450
DAVID B. SOLIT: Yes.

00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:52.080
This is--

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:55.400
AUDIENCE: And then you had a
previous slide further back

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:59.700
where you did a single tumor.

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:02.705
And you had 19,000
somatic mutations.

00:55:04.845 --> 00:55:05.720
DAVID B. SOLIT: Yeah.

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.386
AUDIENCE: And from
what I read actually,

00:55:07.386 --> 00:55:15.980
that's more the common
case versus the cancer

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.200
that you have very
few mutations.

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:21.190
The common case is that
you have tens of thousands

00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:22.559
of mutations in a single tumor.

00:55:22.559 --> 00:55:24.350
DAVID B. SOLIT: So let
me just clarify this

00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:26.280
as an issue maybe
I wasn't clear on,

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:29.010
which is really differences
in the denominator.

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:31.360
So this assay that
I'm showing you here,

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.510
this was an assay of
just 341 cancer genes.

00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:36.690
So this was our capture
based approach where we just

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:38.680
pull down parts of the genome.

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.226
And when we do that, the
scale's obviously different

00:55:41.226 --> 00:55:43.600
because we're only sequencing
a small part of the genome.

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.390
We're sequencing the
part of the genome

00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:47.800
with all the known
cancer genes in it,

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:51.930
but it's a very small
fraction of the total genome.

00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:54.870
And so this is a lot of
mutations for sequencing

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:56.019
just that small part.

00:55:56.019 --> 00:55:56.560
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:57.860
DAVID B. SOLIT:
The 19,000 referred

00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.269
to sequencing the entire genome.

00:55:59.269 --> 00:55:59.935
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:55:59.935 --> 00:56:01.640
DAVID B. SOLIT: And
within that 19,000,

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:05.000
that patient probably had
about 140 coding mutations.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.441
And if you actually
just ran IMPACT,

00:56:07.441 --> 00:56:09.690
you probably only would have
found about eight or nine

00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:10.330
mutations.

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:13.920
So it's really a difference
of what fraction of the genome

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.020
are we sequencing?

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:17.145
Those numbers are going to
be very different, yeah.

00:56:17.145 --> 00:56:20.240
AUDIENCE: So maybe the premise
of my question is wrong.

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:25.002
But my question was if
you've got so many--

00:56:25.002 --> 00:56:27.210
you kind of boiled it down
to a much smaller number--

00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:31.300
but if you've got 19,000 somatic
mutations, how many, if you

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:35.340
were to look at so-called
normal cells in a normal person,

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:38.330
a typical assay, how
many mutations would you

00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:39.325
find in normal cells?

00:56:39.325 --> 00:56:40.970
DAVID B. SOLIT: So
the normal cells

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:43.280
have no mutations by
definition, because we're

00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:46.880
using that as the reference
for each individual patient.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.870
So there is the normal
coding sequence,

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:56.940
which is really created by an
amalgamation of many people.

00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:59.930
And then there are variations
from individual to individual.

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:03.060
So because there's these
polymorphisms, or differences

00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:05.810
in the genome
between individuals,

00:57:05.810 --> 00:57:09.390
we actually don't want to
use this reference sequence

00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:12.320
for the actual calling of
a mutation that's somatic.

00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:16.320
We want to actually compare
this individual patient's

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:20.050
normal to this tumor
and actually then

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:21.040
digitally subtract it.

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.900
If you don't do
that, you'll end up

00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:26.000
with thousands of
additional polymorphisms

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.890
between any individual
and actually

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:29.050
the reference sequence.

00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:32.050
Now when we sequence the normal,
we don't sequence one cell.

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:35.810
We sequence what is DNA
extracted out of thousands

00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:38.210
or tens of thousands of cells.

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:42.242
And so if you actually sequenced
just one individual cell,

00:57:42.242 --> 00:57:43.950
you took hundreds of
them, you might even

00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:45.580
see some mutations
that are slightly

00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:47.821
different from this
cell to that cell.

00:57:47.821 --> 00:57:49.570
But we don't pick it
up with this approach

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:52.226
because we're averaging that
out and then that detail's lost.

00:57:52.226 --> 00:57:54.600
AUDIENCE: But it's radically
different in a cancer tumor,

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:54.810
right?

00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:55.300
DAVID B. SOLIT:
But you know, yeah.

00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:56.930
AUDIENCE: So a cancer
tumor, radically more.

00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:57.420
DAVID B. SOLIT:
Dramatically higher, yeah.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:58.930
AUDIENCE: So how
do you explain that

00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:04.240
on a fundamental biological when
you're looking at first causes?

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.722
You would think,
for example, or I

00:58:05.722 --> 00:58:07.430
would think-- just
kind of a lay person--

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:12.300
that if you imagine
that cancer is caused

00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:14.850
by some initial
somatic mutation,

00:58:14.850 --> 00:58:18.854
why does that single mutation
not dominate and survive

00:58:18.854 --> 00:58:19.770
throughout the cancer?

00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:21.900
So why do you have
tens of thousands?

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:24.740
This is a real mystery.

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.880
And it seems like a real
problem to this approach.

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.520
Because if you've got
tens of thousands--

00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:32.250
and some places I've read
they say hundreds of thousands

00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:33.866
of mutations in a single tumor--

00:58:33.866 --> 00:58:34.740
DAVID B. SOLIT: Yeah.

00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:35.040
So--

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:35.892
AUDIENCE: Then how?

00:58:35.892 --> 00:58:38.350
DAVID B. SOLIT: So we actually
have a lot of sense for this

00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:42.350
now with the Tumor Cancer
Genome Atlas that's been done.

00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:45.120
There's very well
characterized whole exome data.

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.580
So not a lot of
whole genome data,

00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:50.440
but whole exome data, showing
that, for example in melanomas,

00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:54.050
it's not uncommon to have
3,000 or so exomic mutations.

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:57.920
And that's the tumor that has
the highest mutation rate.

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:01.540
There are many pediatric
cancers-- lymphomas

00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:04.920
and leukemias-- that have an
exceedingly low mutation rate.

00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:07.550
And some of it has to do with
the pathogenesis of the cancer.

00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:09.180
So what was the
toxin that caused it?

00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:13.810
So ultraviolet light is what's
causing these melanomas.

00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:15.980
And actually many
of the mutations

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:19.640
are ones that are caused by
ultraviolet light induced

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:20.210
changes.

00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:22.310
Whereas in lung
cancers, which is also

00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:25.180
another hypermutated tumor,
the mutation spectrum

00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:27.840
is a different type
of amino base pair

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:34.740
change than what you see in a
ultraviolet induced melanoma.

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:37.520
So many of these are passengers.

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.130
How many are actually
drivers, which

00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:41.296
make the difference between
a driver and a passenger

00:59:41.296 --> 00:59:43.320
is a driver really is
having a functional

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:46.870
effect in driving the
cancer pathogenesis,

00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:48.930
we really don't
know in large part.

00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:51.470
The presumption is the
vast majority of them

00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:53.560
are passengers, they're
not doing anything.

00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:55.834
But why are they there?

00:59:55.834 --> 00:59:57.250
They're there
because there's just

00:59:57.250 --> 01:00:00.840
a stochastic randomness to
where these mutations occur

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:01.880
in some ways.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.760
And unless you hit on
something that actually

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.959
is presenting a
survival advantage,

01:00:08.959 --> 01:00:10.000
it doesn't really matter.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.810
So these mutations are
accumulating in a stem cell,

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:15.750
and what happens is you
get an early hit which

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:18.540
maybe makes a cell
proliferate a little bit more

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.760
quickly than normal.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.410
So that cell starts to
replace the average population

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:23.520
of the normal cells.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.370
But then in that, you get
a lot of random mutations

01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:27.611
that are not doing anything.

01:00:27.611 --> 01:00:29.610
But then eventually in
one of those cells that's

01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:32.270
now built up more of
those random changes

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:33.201
you get a second hit.

01:00:33.201 --> 01:00:34.200
And then it accumulates.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.370
And then eventually
you can get a mutation

01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:41.190
in a gene like MLH1 and MSH2,
and these genes actually

01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:43.080
are important for
the DNA replication.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:48.570
So once you get one of these
DNA repair deficient mutations,

01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:50.690
there's just going to
be a huge number of now

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:54.200
additional mutations
that are caused

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.630
because these the
fidelity of DNA repair

01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:59.530
or DNA reproduction is very low.

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:01.904
And so that's part of it.

01:01:01.904 --> 01:01:03.570
I can't answer your
question completely.

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:04.761
Yeah.

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:06.430
AUDIENCE: It sounds
like eventually this

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:08.450
is going to go towards
if you have cancer,

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:10.436
you'll get a screening
upfront and figure out

01:01:10.436 --> 01:01:11.810
what genomic
alterations you have

01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:14.740
and you can match
them with a drug.

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:17.005
Do you think the
rate limiting factor

01:01:17.005 --> 01:01:21.250
on that will be technology
or insurance or physician

01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:21.852
adoption?

01:01:21.852 --> 01:01:23.560
Which one of those is
the biggest hurdle?

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:27.220
DAVID B. SOLIT: So until this
past year, it was technology.

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:30.200
So even if you had
unlimited amounts of money,

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.610
you simply couldn't do this.

01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:36.840
It would take a team of
dozens months or years

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.670
to do an individual genome.

01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:40.120
And that's just not feasible.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.300
But now my lab can do
a whole genome sequence

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:46.180
on any individual
for less than $10,000

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:50.840
if we spend X amount of
time to do the analysis.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:55.130
So it's getting quicker and
it'll be turnkey more and more.

01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:58.060
So as the informatic tools,
the algorithms get better,

01:01:58.060 --> 01:01:59.980
they're more automated.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:02.810
We actually are limited
by computational power

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:04.910
at Sloan Kettering.

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:06.010
You guys could laugh.

01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:09.510
We have 1.5 petabytes of
memory and that's all we got.

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:12.600
And we've got a cluster
with this many processors.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:17.020
And our thing is
some of the analysis

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:18.660
is waiting to get
on to the cluster.

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:21.050
We just don't have enough
computational power

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:23.350
to be doing more than we can.

01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:25.940
And we spent $2.5
million last year

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:28.060
alone on computational
resources,

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:30.180
and that's a lot of money
for a nonprofit hospital

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:30.721
to be paying.

01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:33.840
So right now, technology
is still limiting.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.080
But that clearly is
going to go away.

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.870
The other problem
is doctor adoption.

01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:44.650
I think even if the
technology becomes completely

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:49.234
turnkey and inexpensive, and
even if the insurance companies

01:02:49.234 --> 01:02:51.150
start paying for some
degree-- and they're not

01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:52.410
going to pay for whole
genome right away.

01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:54.743
What they're going to do is
pay for some number of genes

01:02:54.743 --> 01:02:56.460
and then as the cost
goes down, they'll

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.737
pay for more and more genes.

01:02:57.737 --> 01:02:59.320
And then maybe
eventually it's cheaper

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.250
to just do the whole
genome in everyone.

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:03.300
But the other
downside of this is

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.020
doing this type of
sequencing somewhat

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:07.510
opens up a Pandora's box.

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:12.390
And that's because we all have
probably 10 to 20, if not more,

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:15.380
polymorphisms in our
normal cells that

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:17.320
put us at risk for something.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.920
And it's not
something that we all

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.060
want to worry about
for our entire life.

01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:24.220
So just to give you a
quick scenario here,

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:27.980
we run our genetic test here
for a patient with cancer

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:30.080
and the patient's cured.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.622
One of the genes in our
assay is called PARK2.

01:03:32.622 --> 01:03:34.580
And this is a gene that's
important for cancer.

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:35.670
It's a tumor suppressor.

01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:38.490
It's a gene that was shown to be
a tumor suppressor in a paper I

01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:40.850
published with a colleague
of mine, Tim Chan,

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.170
just a few years ago.

01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:44.860
But the reason that the
gene is called PARK2

01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:47.370
is because it's found
in the germ line,

01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:50.160
so in the normal cells,
of patients who have early

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.350
onset Parkinson's disease.

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:55.150
And so imagine the scenario
of a patient coming in,

01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:58.460
they get sequenced, we use the
sequencing data to tell them

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.660
how best to treat their cancer.

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:04.420
And then the oncologist
says, oh by the way,

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:07.310
you have a germ line
mutation of PARK2

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:10.600
and you have an 80% chance of
getting Parkinson's disease

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.680
by the age of 50, and we have
nothing we can do about that.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:17.520
So did you want to
know that information?

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:21.170
And as we find more and more
of those susceptibility genes,

01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:23.350
ones that maybe are less
penetrant, meaning they're

01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:28.127
less of a phenotype
or less dominant,

01:04:28.127 --> 01:04:29.710
we're all going to
have some of these.

01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:34.120
And is this going to create
so much anxiety in all of us

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.980
that some people
are going to have

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:37.690
a hard time dealing with that?

01:04:37.690 --> 01:04:41.110
So there is really a huge
amount of worry and concern

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:43.800
in the community as
we're doing this testing

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.100
to make sure that when
we look at the germ line

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:49.790
data in particular, that we're
very careful in how we counsel

01:04:49.790 --> 01:04:51.670
the patients as to
what this means,

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:54.790
and that we don't return a lot
of information that is this

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:57.660
is a change in your germ line in
a gene that could be important

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:58.630
but we don't know what it means.

01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:00.296
And then patients are
worrying about it.

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:02.780
So that's going to slow
physician adoption of this

01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:04.210
a little bit.

01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:06.560
But eventually, I think
all of us in the field

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.766
think eventually 10 years
down the line, 15 years down

01:05:09.766 --> 01:05:12.810
the line, you're just going
to come in and in a day,

01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:14.380
here's your tumor sequence.

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:16.310
And then we're going to match
you up to certain therapies

01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:17.050
based upon that.

01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:18.790
But getting there
is going to require

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:21.260
some significant
technologic improvements.

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.290
Definitely better
computational algorithms

01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:25.350
for the analysis,
better databases

01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:28.540
of what all these mutations
mean, not just somatically

01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:32.389
but also in the germ line
alterations, and then also

01:05:32.389 --> 01:05:33.930
better biologic
understanding of what

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.630
they mean so we
can counsel people

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:38.220
that they don't worry about
things that are not important.

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:42.432
And then probably even
new laws, because if you

01:05:42.432 --> 01:05:44.890
tell that patient that they
have that PARK2 mutation, maybe

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:46.348
they can't get life
insurance, they

01:05:46.348 --> 01:05:47.950
can't get health insurance.

01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:49.750
Their family may have
the same mutation

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:52.470
and maybe can't get health
insurance or life insurance.

01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:54.822
So this test is maybe
not just affecting you,

01:05:54.822 --> 01:05:56.280
it's affecting your
family members.

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:59.100
So there's a little ways
to go until we sort out

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.370
all those issues.

01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:02.900
AUDIENCE: When you
identified the mutations

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:06.780
and the responders,
do you also sequence

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:08.426
the genomes of the
people that don't

01:06:08.426 --> 01:06:10.675
respond to confirm that they
don't have that mutation?

01:06:10.675 --> 01:06:13.091
DAVID B. SOLIT: So for the
paper we published in "Science"

01:06:13.091 --> 01:06:15.670
on that Everolimus trial--
I didn't show it here--

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:17.176
we unfortunately
didn't have tumor

01:06:17.176 --> 01:06:18.550
for every patient
from the study.

01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:20.980
But we did go back and
sequence a host of patients

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.160
from the study.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.060
And what we found that
even the patients who

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.440
had minor responses
to Everolimus,

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.250
they also had a TSE1 mutation.

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.605
But what we found is that
the co-mutation pattern

01:06:30.605 --> 01:06:31.980
for those patients
was different.

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:34.420
So this patient who had
the extraordinary response

01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:36.930
had an NF2 mutation
with the TSE1.

01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:39.010
And both of those,
we think, cooperate

01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:40.870
to make that patient
exquisitely dependant

01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:42.670
upon the target of that drug.

01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:45.370
Other patients had a TSE1
mutation with other mutations

01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:48.200
that we think diminish
addiction to that target,

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.440
but maybe a combination
would be helpful.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.972
I think the learning experience
from that was going back,

01:06:52.972 --> 01:06:54.930
we realized we didn't
have tumor from everyone.

01:06:54.930 --> 01:07:00.060
So I think now we're trying to
do a much better job of making

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:01.560
sure that when we
run these studies,

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.444
we collect these tumors and
have the material available

01:07:04.444 --> 01:07:06.110
for these type of
retrospective studies.

01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:08.457
But actually some of the
extraordinary responders

01:07:08.457 --> 01:07:10.290
initiatives are not
going to even be needed.

01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:13.160
Because if we have the
mutation data perspectively,

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.400
it just becomes very
obvious sometimes why

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.350
somebody responded.

01:07:16.350 --> 01:07:17.766
Well, they had the
right mutation.

01:07:17.766 --> 01:07:21.400
And so the key is again getting
the tissue for study later on.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.500
And it's a challenge.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.710
I'm actually minimizing how
big of a challenge it is.

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:28.790
It's not necessarily just good
enough to have a piece of tumor

01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:30.700
from five years ago
from the patient.

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:33.080
If they've had 10
therapies along the way,

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:35.970
the tumor may have changed
significantly during that time

01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:39.840
and it's beyond what we're able
to do for every clinical trial,

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.300
to get a new piece of tumor
from every patient right

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:44.180
before they go on the therapy.

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.680
Because that's
invasive, it's costly.

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:50.770
And so we work with what
we have the best we can,

01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:52.160
and it's not always perfect.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.980
Well, thank you.

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:57.030
[APPLAUSE]
