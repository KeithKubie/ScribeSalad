00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.050
So we'll now think about
the extreme value theorem.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.350
Which we'll see is a
bit of common sense.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.080
But in all of
these theorems it's

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.840
always fun to think
about the edge cases.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.500
Why is it laid
out the way it is?

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.700
And that might give us a little
bit more intuition about it.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.540
So the extreme
value theorem says

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.640
if we have some function that
is continuous over a closed

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.124
interval, let's say the
closed interval from a to b.

00:00:27.124 --> 00:00:28.540
And when we say a
closed interval,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.570
that means we include
the end points a and b.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.460
That is we have these brackets
here instead of parentheses.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.630
Then there will be an
absolute maximum value

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.470
for f and an absolute
minimum value for f.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.920
So then that means
there exists--

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.340
this is the logical symbol for
there exists-- there exists

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:07.430
an absolute maximum
value of f over interval

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:17.826
and absolute minimum value
of f over the interval.

00:01:17.826 --> 00:01:19.450
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.994
And this probably is
pretty intuitive for you.

00:01:21.994 --> 00:01:23.910
You're probably saying,
well why did they even

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.640
have to write a theorem here?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.292
And why do we even have to
have this continuity there?

00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:30.500
And we'll see in a second
why the continuity actually

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.630
matters.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.560
So this is my x-axis,
that's my y-axis.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.270
And let's draw the interval.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.890
So the interval is from a to b.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.140
So let's say this is a and
this is b right over here.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.680
Let's say that this right
over here is f of a.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.570
So that is f of a.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.260
And let's say this right
over here is f of b.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.850
So this value right
over here is f of b.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.309
And let's say the function
does something like this.

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:02.850
Let's say the function
does something

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.070
like this over the interval.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.300
And I'm just drawing
something somewhat arbitrary

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.020
right over here.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.539
So I've drawn a
continuous function.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.130
I really didn't have
to pick up my pen

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.562
as I drew this right over here.

00:02:15.562 --> 00:02:17.020
And so you can see
at least the way

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.650
this continuous function
that I've drawn,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.840
it's clear that there's
an absolute maximum

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.760
and absolute minimum
point over this interval.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.460
The absolute minimum
point, well it

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.400
seems like we hit it right
over here, when x is,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.520
let's say this is x is c.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.090
And this is f of c
right over there.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.880
And it looks like we had
our absolute maximum point

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.790
over the interval
right over there

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.190
when x is, let's say
this is x is equal to d.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.660
And this right over
here is f of d.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.540
So another way to say this
statement right over here if f

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.320
is continuous over
the interval, we

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:02.420
could say there exists a c and
d that are in the interval.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.610
So they're members
of the set that

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.230
are in the interval
such that-- and I'm just

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.800
using the logical notation here.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:21.860
Such that f c is less
than or equal to f

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.740
of x, which is less
than or equal to f

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.110
of d for all x in the interval.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.240
Just like that.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.740
So in this case
you're saying, look,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.744
we hit our minimum value
when x is equal to c.

00:03:39.744 --> 00:03:40.910
That's that right over here.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.144
Our maximum value
when x is equal to d.

00:03:43.144 --> 00:03:44.810
And for all the other
Xs in the interval

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.100
we are between those two values.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.525
Now one thing, we could draw
other continuous functions.

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:56.900
And once again I'm not doing
a proof of the extreme value

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.170
theorem.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.740
But just to make
you familiar with it

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.156
and why it's stated
the way it is.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.610
And you could draw a
bunch of functions here

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.930
that are continuous over
this closed interval.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.250
Here our maximum point
happens right when we hit b.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.320
And our minimum
point happens at a.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.450
For a flat function
we could put any point

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.360
as a maximum or
the minimum point.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.029
And we'll see that this
would actually be true.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.950
But let's dig a
little bit deeper

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.290
as to why f needs
to be continuous,

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.240
and why this needs to
be a closed interval.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.340
So first let's think about why
does f need to be continuous?

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.280
Well I can easily
construct a function

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.130
that is not continuous
over a closed interval

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.394
where it is hard to articulate
a minimum or a maximum point.

00:04:46.394 --> 00:04:48.310
And I encourage you,
actually pause this video

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.730
and try to construct that
function on your own.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.380
Try to construct a
non-continuous function

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.880
over a closed interval where
it would be very difficult

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.510
or you can't really pick
out an absolute minimum

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.640
or an absolute maximum
value over that interval.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.080
Well let's see, let
me draw a graph here.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.910
So let's say that this right
over here is my interval.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.750
Let's say that's a, that's b.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.091
Let's say our function
did something like this.

00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:20.840
Let's say our function
did something right

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.170
where you would have expected
to have a maximum value let's

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.010
say the function is not defined.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.910
And right where you
would have expected

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.410
to have a minimum value,
the function is not defined.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.170
And so right over here
you could say, well

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.250
look, the function is
clearly approaching,

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.370
as x approaches this
value right over here,

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.080
the function is clearly
approaching this limit.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.345
But that limit
can't be the maxima

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.240
because the function
never gets to that.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.323
So you could say, well
let's a little closer here.

00:05:49.323 --> 00:05:50.950
Maybe this number
right over here is 5.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.145
So you could say, maybe
the maximum is 4.9.

00:05:53.145 --> 00:05:55.270
Then you could get your x
even closer to this value

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.920
and make your y
be 4.99, or 4.999.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.410
You could keep adding another 9.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.490
So there is no maximum value.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.250
Similarly here, on the minimum.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.990
Let me draw it a little bit so
it looks more like a minimum.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.052
There is-- you can get
closer and closer to it,

00:06:10.052 --> 00:06:11.010
but there's no minimum.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.968
Let's say that this value
right over here is 1.

00:06:12.968 --> 00:06:18.350
So you could get to
1.1, or 1.01, or 1.0001.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.630
And so you could keep drawing
some 0s between the two 1s

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.890
but there's no absolute
minimum value there.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.520
Now let's think
about why it being

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.030
a closed interval matters.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.860
Why you have to include your
endpoints as kind of candidates

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:40.870
for your maximum and minimum
values over the interval.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.070
Well let's imagine that
it was an open interval.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.530
Let's imagine open interval.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.979
And sometimes, if we
want to be particular,

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:53.270
we could make this is the
closed interval right of here

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.900
in brackets.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.440
And if we wanted to do an
open interval right over here,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.570
that's a and that's b.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.080
And let's just pick
very simple function,

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.405
let's say a function like this.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.000
So right over here, if
a were in our interval,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
it looks like we hit our
minimum value at a. f of a

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.500
would have been
our minimum value.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.815
And f of b looks like it would
have been our maximum value.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.020
But we're not including
a and b in the interval.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.827
This is an open
interval so you can

00:07:24.827 --> 00:07:26.660
keep getting closer,
and closer, and closer,

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.118
to b and keep getting higher,
and higher, and higher values

00:07:29.118 --> 00:07:30.560
without ever quite
getting to be.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.900
Because once again we're
not including the point b.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.490
Similarly, you could
get closer, and closer,

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.698
and closer, to a and get
smaller, and smaller values.

00:07:36.698 --> 00:07:40.150
But a is not included in
your set under consideration.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.870
So f of a cannot be
your minimum value.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.750
So that on one level, it's kind
of a very intuitive, almost

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.510
obvious theorem.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.500
But on the other hand,
it is nice to know

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.320
why they had to say
continuous and why

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.510
they had to say a closed
interval like this.
