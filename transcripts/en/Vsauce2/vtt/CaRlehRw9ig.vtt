00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.540
Wake up and make yourself a hardcore breakfast
of skull-shaped eggs.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.930
To go along with your death wish coffee.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.440
Because LÃœT is back!

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.250
If you're unsure if you have eggs make sure
to grab one of these Eggminder Smartphone

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.520
connected trays that let you check your egg
level on the go and even sends alerts when

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.900
you're running low.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.240
Don't worry about overeating with this sugar
skull spoon that reminds you how evil sugar

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.630
can be while you're adding it to coffee and
tea.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.079
Or use it to add Caffeinall to your favorite
foods.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.219
Sprinkling it on your favorite foods is like
drinking a cup of coffee so you can finally

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.389
make energy pizza!

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:46.109
If you'd rather just smell food take a whiff
of Fried Chicken with this scents of the commonwealth

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:47.109
candle.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.829
Then set the mood with these Star Wars mood
lights.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.179
While you impress everyone and turn water
into wine with this handy kit that comes with

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.010
everything you need to make a bottle of wine
in less than three weeks.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.219
If you've had too much wine make sure your
kids have this wearable smart locator called

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.670
Filip that allows parents to keep in touch
with their kids on the go.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.659
With it kids aren't stuck having to carry
around a phone and parents are able to call

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.040
or text a watch to get in touch.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.890
But if you don't have any kids you can just
track your pets instead.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.109
Like my dog, Lucy.

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:19.109
Hi Lucy!

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:22.320
If you feel more comfortable taking care of
something not living and breathing the Spiri

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.690
is a programmable flying robot designed just
for you.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.649
It was recently funded on Kickstarter and
hope that Spiri can be a reporter, cartographer,

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.490
playmate, or inspector.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.290
Ignore electricity with this pop out outlet
from Adorne that allows you to hide your outlets

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.720
when not in use by simply popping them in
or out.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.939
If you prefer natural power try using the
Hydrobee that powers your USB devices using

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.109
the energy in rivers, streams, faucets, or
even while being towed behind a boat.

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.159
Then use it to light up your desk with this
Kinetic Light Newtons Cradle.

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.040
Or your tail...... lights.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.569
Circuit Stickers are small flexible circuit
boards with anisotropic conductive adhesive

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.140
on the back that are compatible with any conductive
material.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.750
The creators want to bring electronics and
crafts together giving people the ability

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.010
to easily make cool interactive projects.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.720
Or just use Circuit Scribe and draw your circuits
instead.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.490
Then relax in your ridiculously epic skull
chair for some light reading.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.890
Like this book of calculus for infants.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.920
For something a little more grown up flip
thorough this pop up book of phobias that

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.480
showcase your deepest fears like snakes, spiders,
dirty toilets, and heights.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.360
When you're done reading your books put them
on this balance book shelf that helps you

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.260
visualize what you've already read and what
you have left.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.659
And really tie the room together with this
monster skin rug.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.650
Along with your whimsical Wobbly furniture.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.590
Now check your watch and do some math to figure
out what time it is because we're almost done.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.180
And all that's left to do is scream into this
stress reduction shouting vase.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.330
And as always.... thanks for watching!
