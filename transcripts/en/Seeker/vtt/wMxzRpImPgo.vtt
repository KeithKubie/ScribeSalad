00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.089
Ow ow ow…

00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:02.089
DAng…

00:00:02.089 --> 00:00:08.930
I mean THANK YOU BODY.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.820
Hey guys julia here for DNews

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.730
Pain helps us navigate the world.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.000
Pain tells us when something is hot so we
don’t burn ourselves.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.570
Pain tells us when we’re hurt so we don’t
damage our bodies further.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.980
As annoying and uncomfortable as it is, it
actually saves us.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.520
Pain protects us from harm.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.300
But not everyone is so...lucky.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.170
Some people are born with a genetic mutation
that leaves them unable to feel pain.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.480
There’s actually a few mutations that lead
to the condition called congenital insensitivity

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.640
to pain.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.780
One mutation occurs in the PRDM12 gene.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.691
According to a study published in the journal
Nature Genetics, this mutation leads to a

00:00:43.691 --> 00:00:46.420
malformation of nerve cells or neurons.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.890
Without functioning nerves, there’s nothing
to detect a painful experience.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.239
Another mutation that causes people to not
feel pain occurs in the SCN9A gene.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.680
It causes disruptions not in the nerves, but
in the way nerves talk to each other.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.199
Nerve cells communicate by sodium ions, as
these ions get passed through channels from

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.680
one nerve cell to the next, the pain signal
travels from the injury site where it's felt,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.880
up the spinal cord and into the brain.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.600
But a mutation in the SCN9A gene stops these
channels, called Nav1.7 channels, from forming.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.310
Without these channels, pain messages can’t
be sent.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.299
So scientists being scientists, made mice
with this mutation in a study published in

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.649
the journal Nature Communications!

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.920
And not surprisingly, the mice couldn’t
feel pain.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.409
When their tails were exposed to extreme heat
or cold, they showed no response.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.359
But surprisingly, even though they felt no
pain, their body tried to soothe it.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.689
The mutated mice showed high levels of enkephalins,
a type of opioid, the brain’s natural painkiller

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.200
at the site of injury.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.220
So even though these mice couldn’t feel
pain, their bodies recognized that pain and

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.259
tried to make the mice feel better.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.479
So the researchers thought, hey, people who
have less opioids in them tend to feel more

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.429
pain, I wonder what would happen if people
who don’t feel pain had less of these soothing

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:00.429
opioids.

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.729
So they gave a woman who cannot feel pain
naloxone, a medication typically used to treat

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.590
opioid drug overdose, and shot her with a
heated laser.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.530
The drug stopped her opioid production.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.530
And voila!

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.049
She felt pain!

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.060
Scientists said that the woman “quite enjoyed”
the sensation.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.390
So cool right? but uh, what good is it making
people feel pain?

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.099
Whether we like it or not, pain evolved to
save us.

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.629
Just take a look at our nerves that transmit
pain.

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.340
Nociceptors sensory receptors are nerves whose
only job is to transmit pain from the point

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.849
of injury to the brain.

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.650
And they are fast, like pain can make it’s
way through these cells in 5–30 milliseconds

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.430
or about about one meter per second.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.489
It’s so quick and uncomfortable, because
it gets you away from whatever is causing

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.319
the pain super fast.

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.980
Some evolutionary biologists think that a
lesser warning, more of a “red flag” wouldn’t

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.129
be enough for us to react so suddenly and
strongly against a potential danger.

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.189
And we do know what happens when we don’t
have these kind of alarm bells in our body.

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.150
According to a study published in the Journal
of Clinical Investigation, those who are born

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.660
without the ability to feel pain often suffer
from infections they don’t realize they

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.120
have, self injury, and they have shorter lives!

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.209
So the next time you stub your toe, don’t
yell out an expletive, yell out “thank you!”

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.519
it’s saving your life.

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.280
Humans.. well we let each other know when
we feel pain.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.299
When other animals feel pain they yelp or
cry out in some way.

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.819
But since crabs and other invertebrates can’t…
we kind of just assumed they don’t feel

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:27.819
pain.

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.540
Well put down that order of crab legs, crabs
do feel pain.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.989
