America the principled six opportunities
 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.690
America the principled six opportunities
for becoming a can-do nation once again

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700
for becoming a can-do nation once again
 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.900
for becoming a can-do nation once again
and so those six opportunities seemed to

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910
and so those six opportunities seemed to
 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.450
and so those six opportunities seemed to
me to be the most important issues one

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460
me to be the most important issues one
 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.930
me to be the most important issues one
is how do we secure our future and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940
is how do we secure our future and
 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.340
is how do we secure our future and
security isn't simply a matter of

well actually there's a gap between

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650
well actually there's a gap between
 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.610
well actually there's a gap between
liking Americans as a people and liking

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620
liking Americans as a people and liking
 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.069
liking Americans as a people and liking
the American government many more people

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079
the American government many more people
 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.679
the American government many more people
like Americans than like the American

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689
like Americans than like the American
 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.410
like Americans than like the American
government we have and speaking of

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420
government we have and speaking of
 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.509
government we have and speaking of
government we have a problem with

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519
government we have a problem with
 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.420
government we have a problem with
respect for government in fact in recent

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430
respect for government in fact in recent
 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.270
respect for government in fact in recent
years people have discredited government

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280
years people have discredited government
 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.559
years people have discredited government
because so many government officials

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569
because so many government officials
 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.349

but a lot of Washington was under
indictment for a while so if we don't

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040
indictment for a while so if we don't
 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.369
indictment for a while so if we don't
restore respect for government I'm sick

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379
restore respect for government I'm sick
 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.440
restore respect for government I'm sick
of politicians running against

government I'm running for this office
 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.550
government I'm running for this office
because I believe that we shouldn't have

because I believe that we shouldn't have
 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.360
because I believe that we shouldn't have
these offices it's ridiculous so we need

these offices it's ridiculous so we need
 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.670
these offices it's ridiculous so we need
respect so that good people run for

respect so that good people run for
 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.759
respect so that good people run for
office in turn they appoint confident

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769
office in turn they appoint confident
 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.069
office in turn they appoint confident
people and they care about how well

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079
people and they care about how well

traditional American principle to say
 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:39.939
traditional American principle to say
that government is best which governs

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:39.949
that government is best which governs
 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:43.300
that government is best which governs
least but frankly it can't govern least

least but frankly it can't govern least
 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.149

unless it governs better because it's
 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.000
unless it governs better because it's
much more costly to have a disaster like

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010
much more costly to have a disaster like
 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.009
much more costly to have a disaster like
Hurricane Katrina than it would have

Orleans in the first place and finally I
 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.009
Orleans in the first place and finally I
think we need a spirit of service the

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019
think we need a spirit of service the
 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.780

ugliness in America has plagued us if we

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639
ugliness in America has plagued us if we
 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.879
