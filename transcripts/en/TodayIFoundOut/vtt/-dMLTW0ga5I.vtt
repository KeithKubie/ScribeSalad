00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:13.740
David Bowie was a man who reinvented himself
countless times throughout his roughly half-century

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.660
long career; one thing that remained constant
about Bowie’s appearance, though, were his

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.660
eyes.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.380
For anyone who doesn’t have Bowie’s likeness
burned into their consciousness, the musician

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.670
famously had one brown eye and one blue eye.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.820
Or at least, it looked like he did in pictures.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.350
You see, in actuality both of Bowie’s eyes
were the exact same colour- light blue, something

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.010
the singer himself was quick to point out
in interviews.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.350
So why did it often look like they were two
different colours?

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.970
Bowie suffered from a condition called anisocoria,
which basically means that his pupils were

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.670
unequally dilated.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.080
An estimated 20% of people have some form
of anisocoria.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.850
But in most cases, it’s largely harmless.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.380
However, in Bowie’s case, the dilation was
extremely pronounced and resulted in limited

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.950
vision in his left eye.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.210
Anisocoria can be caused by everything from
a condition known as Horner’s syndrome to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.530
a particularly bad migraine, though most people
will simply be born with it.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.649
In fact, statistically a lot of you reading
this will suffer from a minor form of anisocoria

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.600
that is barely noticeable without close examination.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.130
Finally, it’s also possible to have anisocoria
as a result of injury or trauma, which is

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.659
what happened to Bowie.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.979
In 1962, when Bowie was just 15 years old,
he got into a minor fistfight with a friend

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.350
called George Underwood who was a one-time
band-mate of Bowie eventually turned artist.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.070
The fight was over a girl that both boys had
a crush on.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.689
When Bowie, who didn’t know Underwood also
had a crush on her, was bragging to Underwood

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.729
about “what a Casanova I was” with the
girl, Underwood, in his own words “was so

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.380
aggrieved I walked over to him, basically,
turned him around and went ‘whack’ without

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.380
even thinking.”

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.280
Unbeknownst to Underwood, this act damaged
the muscle in Bowie’s left eye responsible

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.780
for contracting his iris, leaving it permanently
dilated.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.549
Now, people get punched in the face all the
time with no permanent damage, so why was

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.069
Bowie’s case different?

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.159
Well, as the singer himself would later state:
“It wasn’t a very hard punch but obviously

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.190
caught me at a rather odd angle” with Underwood’s
fingernail scratching the surface of Bowie’s

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.890
eye, damaging the aforementioned muscle within
it.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.330
Despite efforts to save the sight in his left
eye by physicians, he was left with permanently

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.989
impaired vision- with Bowie describing it
as “very hazy”- and his pupil remained

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.010
fully dilated for the rest of his life.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.170
Bowie would further explain in an interview
that the fact that his left pupil was constantly

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.599
dilated sometimes gave the impression that
it was a different colour to his right eye.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.489
Pictures of the singer only played into this
idea since high-contrast photos, especially

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.819
those taken with flash or in a well-lit studio,
tended to emphasize the difference in the

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.319
size of his pupils (functional pupils being
wont to contract in bright light and all that).

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.579
This gave the illusion that his right eye
was dark brown, or even jet black depending

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:49.849
on the photo and lighting.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.170
The left eye was also more prone to the red-eye
effect in cameras (see: What Causes Red-Eye

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.030
in Photos), further making pictures of his
eyes look markedly different.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.000
The fact that Bowie’s eyes were naturally
a shade of very light blue also helped highlight

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.459
the difference, leading to rumors that he
suffered from heterochromia or even wore different

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.770
coloured contact lenses as a part of his carefully
tailored look.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.510
Neither was true and Bowie was always quick
to point out that the way his eyes looked

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.719
was caused by childhood injury.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.329
Since Bowie grew up to be a legendary rock
star where his ability to see wasn’t as

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.349
important as how cool he looked, he claimed
the injury actually ended up being mildly

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:23.939
beneficial to his career.

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:28.159
Some of the most famous images of Bowie highlighted
his condition and the singer himself was only

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.840
too happy to take photos that emphasized his
eyes, all of which fueled, as Bowie called

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.659
it, the “mystique” around his name and
image.

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.180
In fact, Bowie was so aware of how much of
a boon his condition had been to his career

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.210
that he reportedly ultimately thanked Underwood
for hitting him.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.750
On top of quickly forgiving the man who cost
him much of the sight in one eye, the two

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.780
men remained lifelong friends, with Underwood
even providing artwork for some of Bowie’s

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.650
early albums.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.890
In 2004, while performing in Oslo in Norway,
Bowie was hit in the left eye by a lollipop

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.890
thrown by a fan.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.249
The candy missile was thrown with such force
that the stick became lodged in the singer’s

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:06.249
eye…

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:10.359
(Seriously) After having the lollipop removed
from his eye socket by a member of security,

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:16.440
Bowie told the gathered crowd “You’re
lucky you hit the bad one” before finishing

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:36.330
the concert.
