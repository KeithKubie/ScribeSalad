00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.980
Some vegetarians might claim that fish are
friends not food, I am not one of them.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.440
But what if our fishy friends are actually
poisoning us?

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.849
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.400
Thanks to recent trends like the mediterranean
diet, fishy meals are having their heyday.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.869
Fish seems to be the perfect healthy food,
since they’re packed with omega-3s, which

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.060
could be good for the heart and some claim
it’s great brain food too.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.769
Buuuut there’s always a problem in paradise.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.600
Eating too much fish, might cause a buildup
of mercury.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.949
Mercury builds up in the bodies of smaller
fish, which gets eaten by bigger fish, so

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.970
the mercury builds up there, and then THAT
fish is eaten by even bigger fish so they

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.920
get even more mercury… and so on up the
food chain, this process is called bioaccumulation.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.879
So mercury bioaccumulates in bigger fish like
shark or swordfish, which wind up with pretty

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.100
big doses of the toxin.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.940
But even more common fish like tuna and salmon
can accumulate decent doses too.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.010
For most people this isn’t a problem, the
benefits from fish far outweigh any negatives.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.149
But mercury exposure in pregnant women could
harm the brain and nervous system of a developing

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.420
fetus.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.190
Exposure might be linked to ADHD issues in
their children, according to one study published

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.350
in the journal Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent
Medicine. and the FDA recommends that pregnant

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.380
and breastfeeding women avoid eating shark,
tilefish, swordfish and king mackerel, fish

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.880
with the highest levels of mercury.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.170
They also recommended limiting consumption
of albacore tuna to six ounces per week.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.600
So where does all that mercury come from?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.299
It is a natural element found throughout the
environment.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.329
Some scientists think that it could be coming
from hydrothermal vents.

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.250
But it’s much more likely it’s thanks
to human activity.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.229
We produce a lot of heavy metal waste from
power plants and manufacturing industries.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.579
While some safeguards are in place, some facilities
have serious leaks or disposal issues.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.189
So heavy metals like mercury get released
into the air and then find their way into

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.280
water systems and head out to sea.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.200
There, the toxin builds up in fish, which
turn the mercury into a toxic form, methylmercury.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.170
According to the EPA “Nearly all fish and
shellfish contain traces of methylmercury”.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.670
Other animals are affected too, like coral.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.320
Corals are really good at filtering out these
heavy metals from the water, unfortunately,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.569
this can also harm them.

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.100
Just small amounts can kill them.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.219
But their deaths may not be in vain!

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.250
Corals have given inspiration to a group of
Chinese scientists.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.830
These researchers describe their new coral
inspired material in the Journal of Colloid

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.330
and Interface Science.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.379
They made aluminum oxide nanoplates, which
have proved themselves to be pretty good removals

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.299
of pollutants in past research, but not ideal.

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.740
So the researchers created their nanoplates
to mimic coral’s structure and the way that

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.740
they curl.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.400
By making a structure that’s porus like
coral it increases the surface area of the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.040
coral, making it absorb all that nastiness
so much better!

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.540
So that could be a cool biomimicry solution
in the future - well, that along with green

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.430
energy and manufacturing solutions that keep
the oceans from being polluted in the first

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.430
place.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.930
But for now, the FDA recommends eating at
least two meals a week which include fish,

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.519
just not any of the large species like swordfish.

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.260
But what about farmed fish - is that a good
alternative or not?

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.939
Trace explores that question in this video
