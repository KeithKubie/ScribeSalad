00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.170
We're on problem 71.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.680
And they ask us, which fraction
is equivalent to this

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.780
thing, 3x over 5 divided by
x plus 4 over x plus 2?

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.800
Now the best way to do this,
let's simplify the denominator

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.176
first. So that's equal
to 3x over 5.

00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:19.160
All of that over-- let's find
a common denominator.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.490
The common denominator is 4.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.430
So if we have a common
denominator of 4, x/4 is of

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.600
course x/4.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.730
x/2 is the same thing
as 2x over 4.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.970
So plus 2x over 4.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.560
2x over 4 is the same
thing as x/2.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.580
And now if you divide by a
certain fraction, that's the

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.840
same thing as multiplying
buy its inverse.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.640
So this is going to be equal to
3x over 5 times the inverse

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.500
of this, times 4
over x plus 2x.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.410
Let's see what we could do.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.875
Well we could factor
out an x here.

00:00:54.875 --> 00:01:03.700
So this becomes x
times 1 plus 2.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.390
Actually, 1 plus 2 is 3.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.910
I should have said x plus
2x is equal to 3x.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.540
I should have done.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.710
That's silly, I shouldn't
have done that.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.750
I should have said x plus
2x is equal to 3x.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.550
My bad.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.110
Anyway, 3x and 3x cancel out.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.610
Numerator and denominator.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.370
And you're left with 4/5.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.660
And that's choice C.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.080
It's getting late.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.330
Next question.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.090
72.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.170
Let me copy and paste this.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.090
Word problems, it's good to
parse these together.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.970
All right, OK, a pharmacist
mixed some 10% saline solution

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.780
with some 15% saline solution to
obtain 100 milliliters of a

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.550
12% saline solution.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.790
How much of the 10% saline
solution did the pharmacist

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.070
use in the mixture?

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.040
OK, so 10% and 15%.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:12.370
So let T equal the amount
of 10% percent.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.450
And let's say that F is equal to
the amount of 15% solution.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.390
I picked T for ten,
F for fifteen.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.170
OK, so the amount of 10%
solution plus the amount of

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.860
15% solution, that has to
equal 100 milliliters.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.170
I'll assume we're dealing
in milliliters.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.930
That equals 100.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.220
And then, how much saline are
we going to end up with?

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.010
So, if we have the 10% saline
solution, however much saline

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.330
we have, how much saline
is that going to

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.200
contribute to the whole?

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.570
Well it's 10% saline, so we're
going to contribute 10% of

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.910
that as saline.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.480
So 10% times the amount of 10%
solution tells me how much

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.850
saline I'm contributing.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.380
Plus 15% times the amount of
the 15% saline solution I'm

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.200
contributing.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.820
This is the amount of saline
from that solution.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.820
And that equals what?

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.680
Now this is interesting.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.260
You end up with a 12%
saline solution.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.540
100 milliliters of a 12%
saline solution.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.360
So how much saline total am I
going to have when I mix it

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.470
all together?

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.020
I had 100 milliliters.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.595
It's a 12% saline solution.

00:03:23.595 --> 00:03:27.230
So that means 12% of this 100
milliliters is saline.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.840
So that equals 12.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.960
There's 12 milliliters
of saline.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.920
With this much contributed from
the 10% solution and that

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.010
much contributed from
the 15% solution.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.480
Let's see what we can do.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.840
So now we have two linear
equations and two unknowns.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.250
We're ready to solve.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.890
What do they want to know?

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.690
They want to know how much of
the 10% saline solution.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.090
So the best thing, we want to
cancel out the F's somehow and

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.135
solve for T.

00:03:52.135 --> 00:03:55.480
So let's multiply this top
equation times minus 0.15,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.720
because I want to cancel
this out with this.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.420
So let's do that.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.220
If you multiply times minus
0.15, we end up with minus

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:14.832
0.15T minus 0.15F is
equal to minus 15.

00:04:14.832 --> 00:04:19.970
So we add these two equations,
0.1 plus minus 0.15 that's

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.330
minus 0.05T.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.916
These two cancel out.

00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:31.740
It's equal to 12 minus
15 is minus 3.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.490
OK, we can multiply both sides
by negative 1, you get plus

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.310
0.05 times T is equal to 3.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.280
Sorry, I'm getting messy here.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.010
So if you divide both sides by
0.05, you have T is equal to 3

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.220
divided by 0.05.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.770
0.05, that's the same
thing is 1/20.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.340
So this is equal to 3 times
20, which is equal to 60.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.330
So we contributed 60 milliliters
of the 10% percent

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.190
saline solution.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.480
So T is equal to 60 and
that's choice A.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.300
And this is a little bit
confusing, because you're like

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.680
what variable do I use for the
10% solution and how do I set

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.810
up a second equation?

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.070
And a good place to start is to
say, oh well they want to

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.710
know how much of the 10%
saline solution did the

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.135
pharmacist use, so let me
set that is a variable.

00:05:16.135 --> 00:05:17.550
Let me set another
variable for the

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.860
other type of solution.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.170
If I add them together I have
to get 100 milliliters.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.900
And the tricky part was just
probably figuring out how much

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.130
saline did each of the
solutions contribute?

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.890
And then when you add that
up, it equals 12

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.380
milliliters of saline.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.110
Anyway, next question.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:44.950
73.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.560
Andy's average driving speed
for a 4 hour trip was

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.590
45 miles per hour.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.800
During the first 3 hours he
drove 40 miles per hour.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.250
What was his average speed for
the last hour of his trip?

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.860
OK, so distance is equal
to rate times time.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:11.690
OK, so his total for a 4 hour
trip was 45 miles per hour.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.150
Or you could say rate is equal
to distance divided by time.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.560
Just divide both sides
of that by time.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.530
So they said, the average
driving speed for a 4 hour

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.550
trip was 45 miles per hour.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.560
So 45 miles per hour is equal
to the distance he traveled

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.590
divided by his time.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.870
Divided by 4 hours.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.360
So we can figure out the
distance right off the bat.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.570
So let's actually do that.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:41.850
The distance is equal
to 4 times 45.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.100
That's what?

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:54.270
It's equal to 180 miles.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.370
Fair enough.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.590
They say during the first
3 hours, he drove

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.800
40 miles per hour.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.040
What was his average speed for
the last hour of his trip?

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.540
So we just have to figure
out how much ground

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.430
did he have to cover?

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.200
So, during the first 3 hours,
he drove 40 per hour.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.740
So how far did he go?

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.540
So that's a different distance,
that's just the

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.250
first 3 hours.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.410
So the distance over the first
3 hours is equal to the rate

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.030
of the first 3 hours, it's equal
to 40, times the time,

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.010
times 3 hours.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:32.070
So his distance over the first 3
hours is equal to 120 miles.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.060
So how far did he have to travel
in that last hour?

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.750
Well, in the first 3 hours
he went 120 miles.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.840
He went a total of 180 miles.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.620
So his distance in that
last hour is going to

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.710
be 180 minus 120.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:49.190
He had to go 60 miles
in that last hour.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.400
So how fast did he go?

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.760
Well he went 60 miles in that
last hour, so he went

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.590
60 miles per hour.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.880
Choice B.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.000
So this might seem like a
complicated problem, and it is

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.620
a little tricky.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.250
But it's all about distance
equals rate times time.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:07.190
And then recognizing that you
could use this first statement

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.290
to figure out the total
distance he traveled.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.930
You could use the second
statement to figure out how

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.990
far he traveled in the
first 3 hours.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.510
And then you know how far he
had to travel in that last

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.010
hour, or essentially how
fast he had to travel.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.020
Next question.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:31.730
74.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.179
One pipe can fill a tank
in 20 minutes.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:39.210
So let's say pipe 1 its
rate is equal to

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:45.730
1 tank per 20 minutes.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:46.570
That's how I like to write it.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:47.010
That's what they told us.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:51.270
One pipe can fill a tank in 20
minutes, while another takes

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.960
30 minutes to fill
the same tank.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.090
So pipe 2, is equal to 1
tank per 30 minutes.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:59.720
That's its rate.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.455
Or 1/30 tank per minute.

00:09:01.455 --> 00:09:03.560
This is 1/20 tank per minute.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.860
Fair enough.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.180
How long would it take the two
pipes together to fill it?

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.390
So their combined rate is
just both of these.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.460
If you have both pipes going in,
you're going to have 1/20

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:21.630
tank per minute plus 1/60
tank per minute.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.660
Let's see.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.570
1/20 plus 1/60, common
denominator is 60.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:32.230
1/20 is 3/60 plus 1/60 is
1/60 tanks per minute.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.510
It's just adding fractions.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:41.390
So that equals 4/60
tanks per minute.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:46.850
4/60, that's 1/15 tanks
per minute.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.820
Or you view this as equal to
one tank per 15 minutes.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.650
So how long does it take
to fill one tank?

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.110
15 minutes.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.490
Choice is C.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:06.520
Oh I'm all out of time.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.560
I'll see in the next video.
