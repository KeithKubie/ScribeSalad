00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Thanks, all.. Sorry.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.760
Thank you very much.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.319
So actually I slightly changed my title from predict the future with maths to can you predict the future with maths?

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.469
Much much more scientific.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.110
So I guess the first way or the best way rather to explore this question is via a life experiment

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.450
So I've made a little prediction

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.260
Which I put in a sealed envelope which we'll come to later

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.420
But first I want us as a room to try and generate

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.628
a series of 10 random numbers if we can and see if my prediction holds true. Of course humans, famously

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.489
terrible at coming up with random numbers themselves, so what I've done is got six

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.210
newspapers that we can collect the numbers from basically all the national newspapers without pictures of naked women in them and

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.850
There, so if I could just hand these out

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.220
Instantly, I did have to buy a copy of the daily mail for this experiment, so I feel quite dirty,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.540
Hope you appreciate what I've done. I'll just hand these out. If you wouldn't mind those of you

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.688
that have a newspaper if you could please flick through to any page and pick a number that you find within the newspaper

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.389
so I want it to be like a counting number so something like

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.709
Something like money or numbers of people and because we want it to be totally random

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.099
Don't pick a number that could be restricted right so nothing like percentages or dates or phone numbers nothing like that

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.699
So you could pick those numbers for me and in the meantime?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.339
I'm going to try and get ten random numbers those six papers

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.049
So to add in just in case you think I've memorized all six national newspapers this morning, which I could easily do.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.380
I want to add in a bit of extra stuff in to the mix so anyone here on Twitter? Put your hands up if you're on Twitter, please.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.440
Someone...  you there, can you tell me your twitter name?

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.620
Penguin Galaxy good thing and do you know how many followers you have on Twitter?

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.100
About 3600.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.680
What?

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.160
Check you out, okay? Alright, let's have our first number

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.560
3,600 okay, I fear only the very popular people on Twitter are going to be putting their hands up for this.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.960
3,600 okay somebody else on Twitter. Let's try get four people on Twitter. Yes, please do how many photos you have?

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.800
241.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.800
241 thank you very much lovely sir 241. Let's get two more. Yes, please

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.980
About 6,500.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.520
You're showing off, six and a half thousand! Blooming hell.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.440
Okay, one last one. - Hannah we have Ada Lovelace.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.900
Ada Lovelace, for Ada Lovelace day. 4812.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.780
You are more popular than Ada Lovelace day. Yeah, that's quite something, okay?

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.900
Let's go back to our newspapers if we may do you have a number for me?

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.300
40,000

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.180
Okay, perfect and next.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.540
55.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.540
Okay, what I will say is the live experiment is going really badly wrong.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.280
What did you say? 55? -I can change it. - Yeah, can you?

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.010
And someone else, yes?

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.899
12,000 okay that is more like it, thank you. I had one more there.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.760
200 okay, we might be all right and over here? - One thousand one hundred and twelve.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.820
One thousand one hundred and twelve, and there was one more there

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.579
1072 okay, sorry and it's like squashing there giving them a fine, okay, all right

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.049
So those are our numbers pretty randomly generated. I think we can all agree

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.510
Okay, right

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.829
Now time for my prediction then which is contained in a sealed envelope over here. I believe you have the [envelope] for me

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.829
Thank you very much. Could you read what is inside the envelope?

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.849
As loud as you can as well

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.920
The numbers begin with one or [two] fingers. There's a [round] the floor

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.470
Okay

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:25.569
Okay, so I reckon you've guessed that I'm not actually psychic and why I was using here was something called Benford's law

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.320
And Benford's law is a pattern exist in real life data like the numbers that you see in newspapers which says

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.320
Actually numbers beginning with a 1 are much more prevalent

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.720
than any other numbers in fact you're six times more likely [to] find a number beginning with a 1

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.559
than you are a number of getting width and 9 [and] actually the same is true for

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.040
Twitter followers even though it's quite work out with our examples here and

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.339
empirically [that] the numbers slightly differ

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.489
But when you think of it in terms of Twitter followers this pattern begins to make sense

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.630
Right let's say it takes six months for you to double your number of Twitter followers

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.849
If you start off [with] a hundred it would take you six months to get to [two] [hundred] six months to get to four hundred

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.420
And six months to get to eight hundred

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.110
But you'll spend a lot more time at the numbers that begin with a one or two than you will with a higher digits

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.600
Now this was a distribution trick. So there was always a risk that I would have got it wrong

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.580
which is why I planted another envelope in the graphic very much instantly, but

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.080
In Katelyn I'm okay, but but the important point here, though

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.359
Is [that] there are patterns that sit behind?

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.989
Everything that exists in the world really in our natural world and in our human world and these are patterns which

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.269
mathematics is uniquely placed to

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:47.439
Describe and if you can understand these patterns [it] means that you can exploit them and okay perhaps not predict the future

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.950
But you can certainly start to make some educated guesses about what's likely to happen and these patterns are absolutely everywhere

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.830
So they're in you know data and newspapers. They're in the way we form friendships the way that traffic Jams or Trance

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.770
What happens even in the way that serial Killers behave?

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:09.370
But they're also in the way that we look at each other as men and women so there's a really amazing new book

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.830
That's [just] come out and by the founders of okcupid

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.680
Who are all Mathematicians?

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.120
and on

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.829
Okcupid you can rate how attractive you think people are between 1 and 5 right this is for heterosexual relationships in this example

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.610
There's lots of different examples in the book

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:31.590
So this is how men rate women on a scale of 1 to 5 and actually it's a pretty nice curve, right?

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.019
It's got a nice bell shape the middles in about the right place

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.639
it's got nice tails on either side which says I think something quite nice despite all the

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.449
unrealistic views of women that [we've] bombarded with

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.259
Actually men just fancy women. [I] think that's what

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:51.869
That's that's what this gets others and would you like to see the way that women rate guys?

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.060
[ok]

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.910
I'm sorry guys

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:09.720
[miscarry] thanks Jordan lee. [they're] basically women only think that one in every six guys is above average attractiveness, but

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:12.000
We will still go out with you

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.789
so it's fine [size] [of] [x] but okcupid are really good at finding this data looking for these patterns and

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.649
And in using it to try and predict which couples are most likely to [go] well together

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.989
But it doesn't just happen it mean this this story isn't just with things like dating. They're also much more serious

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.870
Examples which have a bigger impact on our lives, so I wanted to finish with an example. That's much closer to my own research

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:40.228
And this is looking at the patterns and exploiting the patterns in Burglaries um [ok] so I?

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.880
guess when it comes to burglaries

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:50.249
Everybody is aware that there are some areas of a city which are much more prone to be prone to crime than others, right?

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.150
And so here on the left is an image of Burglary Hotspots in

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.949
Long Beach, California

00:07:56.949 --> 00:08:02.549
But what you might not be aware of is that these hotspots don't just stay where they are they move around in space?

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:09.780
And time as you can see in this simulation on the left hand side and the reason for this is something called Repeat victimization

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:12.269
So anyone who's been burgled may know of this?

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:17.880
but essentially if you get burgled your chances of being burgled again within a short space of time

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.729
Increase massively right and the reason is that burglars get to know the layout of your house

00:08:23.729 --> 00:08:28.679
They get to know where you keep your valuables the locks on your doors the escape routes and so on and so on

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.050
But this effect isn't just for you

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.060
It's also for your neighbors

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:38.700
And your neighbors neighbors and so on and so on all the way down the street and this really picks out when you look at

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.809
Data so here's [M] some real data [from] [Burgers] in merseyside and by one of my colleagues

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:49.199
Shane Johnson and the different lines are in different weeks and as you go from left to right

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.450
It's the number of doors away from the original instant

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:57.090
And you can really see this effect of decay in space and in time going away now this effect

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:01.080
This is a repeat victimization will continue to happen until people

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.900
Increase their own security or

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:10.979
until police notice that there's a [hotspot] forming and increase their presence in the area and act as a deterrent effect

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.240
But what's really interesting is this this Pattern here repeat victimization?

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:21.749
Doesn't just only belong to burglaries because you also find it when you look at earthquakes

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:26.639
And this does begin to make sense right it you have an event that happens and it means that

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.430
Subsequent events are suddenly much more likely

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:37.080
But the mathematics behind both of these examples is actually incredibly simple and really really elegant [and] really

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.560
Describes well what's going on in in the real world?

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:46.829
so well in fact and it's so simple in fact that you could wrap [it] up into an iPad app and

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:53.940
Give that to police to use when they're going out kind of policing a city and in fact

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.940
That's what this group of Mathematicians who?

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.339
Who I know and hate because I made so much money from it

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.180
I've done in America

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:09.540
And this is [the] screenshot of their iPad app so essentially they sold this this piece of technology to so many different [place] Forces across

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.619
America and some in the uk as well in Kent and in Birmingham

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:18.210
I know they use this type of technology, so in a cop car effectively you have this iPad

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:23.249
And it will tell you based on squares on a map. Where is most likely in the city to be?

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:29.400
Susceptible to burglaries at any given moment or any given evening so all the cops have to do is

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:35.070
Increase their presence in that area, and it will dramatically reduce burglaries and these effects are profound, right?

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:40.679
So here is a graph the top blue line is before they [had] this technology and the red line is once they have this technology

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:47.479
And the group have managed to reduce burglaries in cities by up to [19%] in some areas

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:54.589
It's really genuinely profound effect, so I guess that kind of brings my point to [a] close, so maybe

00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:01.309
Mathematics can't quite predict the future, but it can help us understand the world enough to make a little bit of a difference

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.380
Thank you very much

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:12.469
