If you're familiar with the relational databases,

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.900
you may have come across the idea, of integrity constraints. And can, integrity

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.260
constraints are just another name for invariants. For example, in a database,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.260
you wouldn't want to have a record for a, a person saying that they work for

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.600
a company, and that company has gone bankrupt and

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.880
is no longer in the database. In programming terms that's a dangling pointer.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.900
You want to make sure that your database or your system, never gets in

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.550
situations where there's those. There are those kinds of integrity violations.
