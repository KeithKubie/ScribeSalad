00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:02.630
- [Voiceover] Find the
eighth term of the sequence

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.922
1440, 1716, 1848,

00:00:06.922 --> 00:00:08.294
and so on and so forth,

00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:10.732
whose terms are formed by multiplying

00:00:10.732 --> 00:00:15.195
the corresponding terms of
two arithmetic sequences.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:16.992
Arithmetic sequences,
always having trouble

00:00:16.992 --> 00:00:18.257
saying that properly.

00:00:18.257 --> 00:00:19.982
So, let's think about the two sequences

00:00:19.982 --> 00:00:22.229
and then we'll take the
products of corresponding terms

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:24.160
to get the terms of this sequence.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.014
So maybe one of the arithmetic
sequences starts with A,

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:32.084
starts with A, and then the next one,

00:00:32.084 --> 00:00:33.607
the next term in that sequence

00:00:33.607 --> 00:00:35.564
is going to be some constant plus A,

00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:37.498
that's what an arithmetic sequence is.

00:00:37.498 --> 00:00:39.996
It's just a constant added
to each successive term.

00:00:39.996 --> 00:00:43.656
So, it's going to be A, A plus M,

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:47.019
and then the next term
would be M plus A plus M,

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.759
or it'd be A plus two M.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:52.125
And if we just kept going, what we care

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:53.753
is all the way to the eighth term

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:55.265
because we're gonna take the eight term

00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:56.625
of this sequence, multiply
it by the eighth term

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:58.359
of the other sequence
to get the eighth term

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.026
of this sequence over here.

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.739
So, the second term, we only added one M,

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.831
the third term, we added two M's,

00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:05.994
so the eighth term, we're
gonna add seven M's,

00:01:05.994 --> 00:01:07.893
one less than the term.

00:01:07.893 --> 00:01:09.761
The first term, we added zero M's.

00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:12.356
So, the eighth term here is going to be,

00:01:12.356 --> 00:01:16.933
is going to be A plus, A plus 7m.

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:20.784
That's the eighth term of
this arithmetic sequence.

00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:22.823
Now, let's do another one for
another arithmetic sequence,

00:01:22.823 --> 00:01:25.825
maybe that starts at the number B.

00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:28.257
Now, the next term is going
to be some constant plus B,

00:01:28.257 --> 00:01:31.363
so let's just call that B plus N.

00:01:31.363 --> 00:01:34.146
Then the third term
will be N plus B plus N.

00:01:34.146 --> 00:01:37.029
So, it'll be B plus 2n.

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:38.948
And then we go all the
way to the eighth term

00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:43.754
by the same logic, it's going
to be B plus, B plus 7n.

00:01:43.754 --> 00:01:47.686
The difference between
each of these terms is N.

00:01:47.686 --> 00:01:49.601
Now, they tell us that the product

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:51.954
of the corresponding terms
of these two sequences

00:01:51.954 --> 00:01:53.891
are the terms of this sequence.

00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:55.954
so, A times B, so when
you take the product

00:01:55.954 --> 00:02:00.229
of A and B, we get A times B,

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.582
A times, I'll color code it for here,

00:02:02.582 --> 00:02:07.324
A times B is going to be equal to 1440.

00:02:07.324 --> 00:02:11.553
1400, 1440.

00:02:11.553 --> 00:02:16.179
We also know that A plus
M, we also know that

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:21.016
A plus M times B plus N,

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:26.016
times B plus N is going to be equal to,

00:02:26.052 --> 00:02:30.921
is going to be equal to 1716.

00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:33.629
1716.

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.148
We also know, we also know that A plus 2m,

00:02:38.148 --> 00:02:42.954
A plus 2m times B plus 2n,

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:47.129
times B plus 2n is going to be

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.472
equal to 1848.

00:02:50.472 --> 00:02:55.472
Is going to be equal to 1848.

00:02:56.226 --> 00:02:58.627
And if we want the eighth
term of this sequence,

00:02:58.627 --> 00:03:01.031
we just have to take this
product right over here.

00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:03.357
So, the eighth term is going to be,

00:03:03.357 --> 00:03:08.357
is going to be A plus 7m, A plus 7m

00:03:08.414 --> 00:03:11.356
times B plus 7n.

00:03:11.356 --> 00:03:15.985
Times B plus, B plus 7n.

00:03:15.985 --> 00:03:17.222
Now, before I even do this, it seems like

00:03:17.222 --> 00:03:18.993
we have some good information to at least

00:03:18.993 --> 00:03:22.539
put some constraints around
our A's, B's, M's, and N's.

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:23.817
Let's just think about the form

00:03:23.817 --> 00:03:25.143
that this is going to take, and then maybe

00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:26.890
we can kind of build up the numbers

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.417
as we solve for this stuff over here.

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:32.959
So, the eighth term in our
sequence is going to be,

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.224
I'll do this in a new
color, it's going to be,

00:03:35.224 --> 00:03:38.447
let's just multiply
these two binomials out,

00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:40.822
A times B, it's going to be AB,

00:03:40.822 --> 00:03:43.755
that's A times B, plus A times 7n,

00:03:43.755 --> 00:03:48.755
so that's plus 7an, plus 7m times B,

00:03:49.027 --> 00:03:54.027
so plus 7bm, plus 7m times 7n.

00:03:54.892 --> 00:03:59.122
7m times 7n, so that's plus 49,

00:03:59.122 --> 00:04:04.122
plus 49mn, 49, 49mn.

00:04:04.403 --> 00:04:07.151
So, this is what we need
to figure out the value of.

00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:09.952
We need to figure out the
value of this right here.

00:04:09.952 --> 00:04:12.185
Well, we already know
one of the terms here.

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:16.488
We already know that A
times b is equal to 1440.

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:19.562
So, we're already making some head way.

00:04:19.562 --> 00:04:24.232
This right here is going
to be equal to 1440.

00:04:24.232 --> 00:04:26.746
Now, let's see if we can figure
out anything for these terms

00:04:26.746 --> 00:04:29.328
over here using the other
information over here.

00:04:29.328 --> 00:04:31.721
So, let's multiply these out.

00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:34.287
So, let me do this once
again in a new color.

00:04:34.287 --> 00:04:36.364
So, if I multiply this
out, I got A times B,

00:04:36.364 --> 00:04:41.292
which is AB plus A times N, which is AN,

00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:45.022
plus M times B, or B times M, which is BM,

00:04:45.022 --> 00:04:48.483
plus M times N, plus M times N.

00:04:48.483 --> 00:04:52.695
Which is going to be equal to 1716.

00:04:52.695 --> 00:04:56.090
Now, we know that AB is 1440.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.358
We know that this is 1440.

00:04:59.358 --> 00:05:01.826
So let's see, let's subtract
1440 from both sides

00:05:01.826 --> 00:05:04.022
of this equation, I'll
switch colors again.

00:05:04.022 --> 00:05:07.049
So, let's subtract 1440.

00:05:07.049 --> 00:05:08.763
Well, I guess I didn't switch colors.

00:05:08.763 --> 00:05:10.904
&gt;From both sides of this equation,

00:05:10.904 --> 00:05:12.688
these guys obviously cancel out,

00:05:12.688 --> 00:05:17.274
the left hand side becomes AN plus BM

00:05:17.274 --> 00:05:21.828
plus MN is equal to, let's see,

00:05:21.828 --> 00:05:26.828
the thousands cancel out,
we have a 671 minus 40,

00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:30.228
let's see, we have a
six minus zero is six.

00:05:30.228 --> 00:05:32.592
Then we can borrow, this is a six,

00:05:32.592 --> 00:05:35.523
this is 11, 11 minus four is seven,

00:05:35.523 --> 00:05:37.958
six minus four is two,
one minus one is zero.

00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:42.874
So, AN plus BM plus MN is equal to 276.

00:05:42.874 --> 00:05:44.949
So, we got that information using this

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.163
and that, that, essentially, equation.

00:05:48.163 --> 00:05:50.960
Now let's use this equation over here.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.227
Do this in a new color,
I'm running out of colors.

00:05:54.227 --> 00:05:55.450
I'll do it in green.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.146
So, we have A times B, which is AB

00:05:59.146 --> 00:06:00.892
plus A times 2n.

00:06:00.892 --> 00:06:02.952
So, it's 2an.

00:06:02.952 --> 00:06:06.882
Plus 2mb times, 2m times B,

00:06:06.882 --> 00:06:09.831
so it's plus 2bm.

00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:13.153
Plus 2m times 2n, so plus four,

00:06:13.153 --> 00:06:16.731
plus 4mn is equal

00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:19.827
to 1848.

00:06:19.827 --> 00:06:24.207
Well, same idea, this AB, this is 1440.

00:06:24.207 --> 00:06:28.262
We can subtract 1440 from
both sides of this equation.

00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:30.558
I'm running out of space
here so I'm just gonna

00:06:30.558 --> 00:06:34.322
subtract 1440 from the
left and the right side.

00:06:34.322 --> 00:06:37.693
Now this equation becomes,
on the left hand side,

00:06:37.693 --> 00:06:39.606
we're just left with this stuff over here.

00:06:39.606 --> 00:06:41.620
So, we have 2an.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.670
I'm gonna write it over here
so it doesn't look confusing.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.731
We have 2an plus 2bm

00:06:47.731 --> 00:06:52.525
plus 4mn is equal to, these
obviously cancelled out.

00:06:52.525 --> 00:06:57.414
848 minus 440 is 408.

00:06:57.414 --> 00:07:00.458
Is equal to 408, did I do that right?

00:07:00.458 --> 00:07:04.494
848, yeah, 408, right.

00:07:04.494 --> 00:07:05.554
And now both sides of this equation

00:07:05.554 --> 00:07:08.190
are divisible by two, so let's
divide both sides by two.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.189
So, we have, if we
divide everything by two,

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:13.758
you get AN pus BM

00:07:13.758 --> 00:07:18.758
plus 2mn is equal to,

00:07:18.936 --> 00:07:22.405
is equal to 204.

00:07:23.128 --> 00:07:25.261
Now, these look pretty close.

00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:27.554
It's actually, if we view, if we view this

00:07:27.554 --> 00:07:30.359
as kind of one variable,
and this as another,

00:07:30.359 --> 00:07:31.861
seems like we can solve for MN,

00:07:31.861 --> 00:07:34.353
and then we can solve for AN BM.

00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:36.598
And the reason why that looks useful,

00:07:36.598 --> 00:07:38.137
the reason why that would be useful

00:07:38.137 --> 00:07:40.526
is our final answer, we
have some multiple times MN.

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:42.922
So, if we know what MN is, we
could put that number here,

00:07:42.922 --> 00:07:45.826
and if we know what AN plus BM is,

00:07:45.826 --> 00:07:47.755
we just multiply that
seven, and we're gonna get

00:07:47.755 --> 00:07:50.801
this term right over
here, so let's do that.

00:07:50.801 --> 00:07:53.957
Let's do that, let's solve for MN.

00:07:53.957 --> 00:07:56.429
And to solve for MN, let's
subtract this equation

00:07:56.429 --> 00:07:57.521
from this equation.

00:07:57.521 --> 00:08:00.292
So, let me do it in that same color.

00:08:00.292 --> 00:08:02.005
So, I'm gonna subtract
this from this equation.

00:08:02.005 --> 00:08:03.428
So, multiply it by negative one.

00:08:03.428 --> 00:08:08.159
We have negative AN minus BM

00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:12.285
minus MN is equal to

00:08:12.285 --> 00:08:16.523
negative 276, is equal to negative 276.

00:08:16.523 --> 00:08:20.001
And then when we subtract, we get,

00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:24.283
these cancel out, these cancel
out, and then 2mn minus MN

00:08:24.283 --> 00:08:25.720
is just gonna be MN.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.920
And then 204 minus 276, that's negative,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.694
negative 72.

00:08:31.694 --> 00:08:33.488
So, we're able to solve for MN.

00:08:33.488 --> 00:08:34.866
And that's useful for us because

00:08:34.866 --> 00:08:37.092
this expression here is 49mn.

00:08:37.092 --> 00:08:39.964
So, this number right here,
this number right here

00:08:39.964 --> 00:08:44.360
is negative, that number
right there is negative 72.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.825
Now, what's AN plus BM?

00:08:46.825 --> 00:08:49.558
Well, we know that this
right here is negative 72.

00:08:49.558 --> 00:08:53.289
This right here is negative 72.

00:08:53.289 --> 00:08:56.464
So, let's add 72 to both
sides of this equation.

00:08:56.464 --> 00:08:59.029
So, plus 72.

00:08:59.029 --> 00:09:03.429
We get on the left hand side, AN plus BM,

00:09:03.429 --> 00:09:06.564
these cancel out, is equal to,

00:09:06.564 --> 00:09:11.564
so six plus two is eight,
seven plus seven is 14,

00:09:12.017 --> 00:09:14.684
you have a one up there,
one plus two is three.

00:09:14.684 --> 00:09:16.989
So, it's 348.

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:18.963
So, the eighth term in our sequence,

00:09:18.963 --> 00:09:20.857
which we figured out, which we figured out

00:09:20.857 --> 00:09:25.090
was this business over
here, it is equal to AB.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.821
Which is the same thing as 1440.

00:09:28.821 --> 00:09:32.563
Plus, plus this thing over here.

00:09:32.563 --> 00:09:34.950
Plus this thing, which
is just the same thing

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.651
as seven times, let me write it up here.

00:09:38.658 --> 00:09:40.448
This thing over here in
blue is the same thing

00:09:40.448 --> 00:09:43.927
as seven times AN plus BM.

00:09:43.927 --> 00:09:46.324
Now, we know that AN plus BM is 348,

00:09:46.324 --> 00:09:50.354
so it's seven times 348.

00:09:50.354 --> 00:09:54.694
And then finally, finally, plus, plus

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:58.157
this thing over here, plus 49 times MN.

00:09:58.157 --> 00:10:01.533
49, or we could say minus 49 times 72.

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:03.022
So, let me just, so what this is,

00:10:03.022 --> 00:10:07.662
you could say 49 times negative 72.

00:10:07.662 --> 00:10:10.587
This is going to be the
eighth term in our sequence,

00:10:10.587 --> 00:10:14.689
so let's figure out, let's
figure out what this thing,

00:10:14.689 --> 00:10:16.764
what this thing even is.

00:10:16.764 --> 00:10:19.136
So, let's see how we can,
let's see how we can do it.

00:10:19.136 --> 00:10:20.632
Well, we could just multiply it out.

00:10:20.632 --> 00:10:22.925
So, seven times 348.

00:10:22.925 --> 00:10:24.719
I have no calculator at my disposal,

00:10:24.719 --> 00:10:26.796
seven times 348.

00:10:26.796 --> 00:10:31.225
Eight times seven is 56.

00:10:31.225 --> 00:10:34.627
Four times seven is 28 plus three is,

00:10:34.627 --> 00:10:37.394
or, plus five is 33.

00:10:37.394 --> 00:10:41.852
Three times seven is 21 plus three is 24.

00:10:41.852 --> 00:10:45.094
So this is 2436.

00:10:45.094 --> 00:10:48.493
If we add that to 1440,
so, if you add it to,

00:10:48.493 --> 00:10:49.294
did I do that right?

00:10:49.294 --> 00:10:51.654
Seven times eight is 56,
seven times four is 28,

00:10:51.654 --> 00:10:53.417
plus five is 33.

00:10:53.417 --> 00:10:54.742
Yup, that's right.

00:10:54.742 --> 00:10:57.222
So then we add the 1440 over here.

00:10:57.222 --> 00:11:02.004
We get six seven eight three, 3876.

00:11:02.004 --> 00:11:04.087
So, that's this whole part over here.

00:11:04.087 --> 00:11:05.828
That's all of this business.

00:11:05.828 --> 00:11:07.892
And then we have to take 49 times 72

00:11:07.892 --> 00:11:09.625
and then subtract it from this.

00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:14.192
So, let's take 49 times 72.

00:11:14.192 --> 00:11:17.564
Two times nine is 18,
two times four is eight,

00:11:17.564 --> 00:11:20.154
plus one is nine, stick a zero here.

00:11:20.154 --> 00:11:24.064
Nine times seven is 63.

00:11:24.064 --> 00:11:29.064
Seven times four is 28 plus six is 34.

00:11:29.952 --> 00:11:34.952
34, so this is eight, 12,
carry the one, five, and three.

00:11:35.471 --> 00:11:39.777
So, we're gonna subtract 3528.

00:11:39.777 --> 00:11:42.759
So, we get, what do we get here?

00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:46.028
So, this becomes a 16, this becomes a six,

00:11:46.028 --> 00:11:47.986
16 minus eight is eight.

00:11:47.986 --> 00:11:50.761
Six minus two is four.

00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:52.562
Eight minus five is three and then

00:11:52.562 --> 00:11:54.288
three minus three is zero.

00:11:54.288 --> 00:11:56.689
So, the eighth term in this sequence,

00:11:56.689 --> 00:11:58.562
the eighth term in this sequence

00:11:58.562 --> 00:12:02.647
is going to be, I just
wrote it down, it is 348.

00:12:03.467 --> 00:12:05.685
348.

00:12:05.685 --> 00:12:06.987
And we're done.
