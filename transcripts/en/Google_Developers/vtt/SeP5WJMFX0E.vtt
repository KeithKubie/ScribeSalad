Hi, I'm Mano Marks.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.171
I'm a developer advocate
on the Google Maps team.

00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:17.670
In this video, I'm
going to show you

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.910
how to use map
padding to control

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.460
the visible region of your map
in the Google Maps SDK for iOS.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.460
First, let's take a look
at what padding does.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.310
I've modified the
map padding demo

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.290
in the demos project
that comes with the SDK

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.390
that you can download from
the documentation page.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.570
First, I disable map
padding and run the demo.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.580
When I toggle the overlay, it
creates a view and moves it up.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.200
As you can see, it blocks
a portion of the map,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.680
including the controls and
the Google logo and copyright

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.930
notices.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.730
This reduces the
functionality of the map

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.070
and is not in compliance
with the Maps API terms,

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.950
which do require that
the logo and copyright

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.620
notices be visible.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.740
But if I enable map
padding, I can correctly

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.980
set the visible
region of the map

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.070
so that text and control
positioning, map gestures,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.560
and camera movements
all behave as if they

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.060
are placed in the padded map,
even though the map takes up

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.400
the entire container.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.750
The map will continue to
fill the entire container,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.310
but text and control
positions, map gesture,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.430
and camera movements
will behave as if they've

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.720
been placed on the padded space.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.560
However, as you can
see through this view,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.600
it retains its
original overall size.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.730
The code is really simple.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.170
All you need is a
UIEdgeInsets object.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.240
You set it using the GMS
map view padding property.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.100
For more information
on map padding,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.700
check out the
documentation at this link.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.290
And if you want more
information on getting started

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.450

iOS, check out this playlist.
