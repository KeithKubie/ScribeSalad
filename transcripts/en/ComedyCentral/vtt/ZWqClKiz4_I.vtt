00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:06.673
You know I've always
been suspicious of friends.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.443
What starts over a shared
interest in paintball

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:10.644
comes to a screeching halt

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:13.313
four years later when I have
to memorize your wife's name.

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:15.282
Nice try

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:18.185
Gary why don't you go home
to blonde hair and blue shoes.

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.088
Friends are dangerous
and no one knows

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.590
that more than America's number
one friend Donald Trump.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:26.426
He went to the G7
summit this weekend

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.395
which, in case you don't know,

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.731
is where the U.S. meets
with our top allies

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:34.134
to discuss the world economy
and diplomatic priorities.

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.569
So you know what Trump did.

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:41.742
Ask Info Wars: he body slammed
it and that's not hyperbole.

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:44.912
This is actual footage of Trump
walking into the summit.

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:48.649
Here he is, walking in... there
it is and SLAM.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.051
SLAM. Take that.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.921
That'll teach you to be
ideologically aligned with us

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:56.189
on almost every
geopolitical issue.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:01.461
Of course the leftist media
sees some sort of problem

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:04.631
with this. That Trump
is alienating all his allies

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.667
and acting like
a petulant child.

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:08.802
But does this look
like a petulant child?

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.574
This is obviously
a power stance.

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:15.475
Everyone knows the real way
to be in charge

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:18.545
is to make your body resemble
a pouty mini refrigerator.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.317
But get used to it world.

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:26.320
For everyone wondering
what the Trump foreign policy

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.587
doctrine is.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.690
History got an answer.
Three words.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.559
Senior White House
official quoted today

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:35.495
the Trump doctrine
is "We're America, bitch."

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:43.870
We're America...

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.606
Bitch. What a doctrine.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.475
Now I know there's
a word in there

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.277
that liberals
will find offensive.

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:55.115
America. Those bitches
need to chill.

00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:58.785
This is what "we're America
bitch"

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:02.389
looks like. You show up
whatever the hell you want to.

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:05.158
Trump left late
for the summit on Friday.

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:07.060
Landing an hour behind schedule.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.696
When asked why he was late,
one White House official

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:12.065
told NBC News quote
"He is the president."

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.267
He, again, showed up late
this time 20 minutes

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:16.737
late for a breakfast discussion
on gender equality.

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:20.574
They should be happy. The
meeting was on gender equality.

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:22.776
So Trump graciously
only participated

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:24.077
in 77 percent of it.

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:28.215
He didn't stop there.
Trump took his doctorine

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:30.517
to America's upstairs
neighbor Canada.

00:02:31.218 --> 00:02:33.620
Canada drives me crazy.

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:36.089
It's like somebody
took Bernie Sanders

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.524
and stretched him
into an entire country.

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.900
And, it's

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.537
led by Prime Minister "swimming
pool eyes" Justin Trudeau

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:53.607
who set himself and his country

00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:55.342
up as America's
enemy number one.

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:58.478
If you were Canada's Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:01.481
just heating up. -Canada
maybe the closest U.S. ally

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.518
and promised retaliatory
trade moves in response

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:08.255
to steep new tariffs announced
by the Trump administration.

00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:10.290
Trump firing back
calling Trudeau weak.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.926
His advisers are saying
Canada's Justin Trudeau

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:14.795
stabbed the president
in the back.

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:17.397
Oh you can't stab
Trump in the back.

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:21.568
He's got eyes back there.
He sees everything.

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:28.508
Listen to Trudeau's
vicious vulgar threats.

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:31.545
Canadians, we're polite
we're reasonable

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:33.747
but we also will
not be pushed around.

00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:37.517
Oh, filthy! Filthy.

00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:39.386
I am sorry that everyone at home

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.989
will have to wash
their DVR's out with soap.

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.425
Pretty big words from someone
who is taking advantage

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:46.660
of America

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.497
by taxing dairy
from us at 270%,

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:52.199
according to Trump's Twitter.

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.434
What is Canada
trying to do to us

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:57.204
with this 270% milk tax?

00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:59.005
Milk comes in 1%, 2%,

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:05.679
and whole. What kind of
a monster country demands

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:09.282
270% milk?

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:21.828
This shit is dense like
a black hole of lactose.

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:23.830
No.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:28.902
Bean counting economist
nerds are taking Canada's side

00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:30.437
saying that Trump is a bully

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.506
and pointing out
that Canada brings in twice

00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:34.007
as much dairy from the U.S.

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:35.909
as it exports
and that dairy

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.912
is only about point
two percent of the total value

00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:40.680
of goods exported to Canada.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.750
But last I checked one fifth
of 1% is still some.

00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:47.254
So Trump isn't being a bully.

00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:49.589
He's just pushing around
a smaller weaker kid

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:51.625
and literally stealing
his milk money.

00:04:58.198 --> 00:05:01.268
Stop picking on us, Canada!

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:05.338
We're America, bitch!

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:08.642
You know what, Trump doesn't
have time for any G7 nerds

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:11.478
because right now
the president is in Singapore

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:12.846
sitting down with Kim Jong Un

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:15.549
negotiating historic peace.

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:16.983
And if they're lucky, North
Korea

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.119
will one day become
the type of ally

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:21.054
that we can bodyslam
on the world

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:21.621
stage.
