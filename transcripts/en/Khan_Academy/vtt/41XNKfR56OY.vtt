00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:01.510
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.052
In this video, I'm gonna tell you about

00:00:03.052 --> 00:00:05.170
a piece of punctuation
called the semicolon,

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.157
which basically looks like a comma

00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:09.747
with a period on top of it.

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:12.045
The semicolon has a few uses, but,

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:14.362
the basic sort of standard use

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:17.394
is to link two closely related ideas,

00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:21.142
that can stand on their own
as individual sentences.

00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:22.876
So that might sound a little weird,

00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:24.835
you think there's two
individual sentences,

00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:27.364
so they just have a
period in between them,

00:00:27.364 --> 00:00:29.174
why do they need to be linked?

00:00:29.174 --> 00:00:30.597
Well, let's look at an example,

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:31.939
and I'll show you what I mean.

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.384
I'm a big fan of roller coasters,

00:00:33.384 --> 00:00:35.334
but if I weren't I could
say something like,

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:37.574
I don't wanna ride the Mega Sky Coaster;

00:00:37.574 --> 00:00:40.933
I'm afraid of heights, and
that ride sounds terrifying.

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.758
Now you notice, we have a semicolon here

00:00:42.758 --> 00:00:45.243
in between these parts,
but let's take a step back,

00:00:45.243 --> 00:00:47.565
and just put a period here for a second.

00:00:47.565 --> 00:00:50.218
So now we have, I don't wanna
ride the Mega Sky Coaster.

00:00:50.218 --> 00:00:51.266
Period.

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.700
I'm afraid of heights, and
that ride sounds terrifying.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.171
Exclamation point.

00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:57.298
These can work on their
own, as different sentences.

00:00:57.298 --> 00:01:00.339
But they're so closely tied together.

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.940
You know, I say I don't want
to ride the Mega Sky Coaster,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.820
it's sort of telling us the back story

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.494
as to why I don't wanna ride it.

00:01:06.494 --> 00:01:08.427
So we can use a semicolon in this instance

00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:11.350
to sort of tie the two
sentences together into one.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.407
Now we can't go around tying
every sentence to each other,

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.733
we can't have everything just connected

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.311
with a whole bunch of semicolons,

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.143
it works in this case
because these clauses

00:01:20.143 --> 00:01:22.429
are sharing such similar information.

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.310
In this sentence, the two clauses

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.534
that are directly connected
are both independent clauses.

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:29.935
This makes sense, because
the semicolons job

00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:31.648
is to connect things that can

00:01:31.648 --> 00:01:33.169
stand on their own as sentences,

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:35.309
but, a sentence isn't always

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:38.029
just an independent clause by itself.

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:41.137
One example of this would
be, I wanna get a pet turtle,

00:01:41.137 --> 00:01:45.482
semicolon, however, I think it
might scare my baby brother.

00:01:45.482 --> 00:01:48.638
This is an independent
clause, and so is this,

00:01:48.638 --> 00:01:50.684
but the however in between the two of them

00:01:50.684 --> 00:01:52.776
can make things a little bit confusing.

00:01:52.776 --> 00:01:54.743
That's why it's important
to note that you can

00:01:54.743 --> 00:01:57.509
have a semicolon, followed
by an introductory adverb,

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.238
or a transitional phrase.

00:01:59.238 --> 00:02:01.479
It doesn't just have to
be independent clause,

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.806
semicolon, independent clause, period.

00:02:03.806 --> 00:02:06.685
You can have other clauses and
phrases and words in there.

00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:08.817
As long as the things that
you're linking together

00:02:08.817 --> 00:02:11.209
can stand on their own
as individual sentences.

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.553
There's another place
we can use semicolons,

00:02:13.553 --> 00:02:15.789
which is in a complex list.

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:17.879
In this case, it's called a super comma,

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.241
but we're gonna get to
that in another video.

00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:22.356
So for now, this is
how you use a semicolon

00:02:22.356 --> 00:02:24.035
to link parts of a sentence.

00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:26.585
If the words to the left
and the words to the right

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:29.208
of the semicolon can stand
as individual sentences

00:02:29.208 --> 00:02:31.370
with a period in between them,

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.893
you can put a semicolon there instead.

00:02:33.893 --> 00:02:36.726
You can learn anything, Paige out.
