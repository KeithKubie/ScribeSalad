00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.856
"To do two things at once
is to do neither."

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.656
It's a great smackdown
of multitasking, isn't it,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.216
often attributed to
the Roman writer Publilius Syrus,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.920
although you know how these things are,
he probably never said it.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.936
What I'm interested in, though,
is -- is it true?

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.656
I mean, it's obviously true
for emailing at the dinner table

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.056
or texting while driving or possibly
for live tweeting at TED Talk, as well.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.776
But I'd like to argue
that for an important kind of activity,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.616
doing two things at once --
or three or even four --

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.776
is exactly what we should be aiming for.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.536
Look no further than Albert Einstein.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.736
In 1905, he published
four remarkable scientific papers.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.696
One of them was on Brownian motion,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.056
it provided empirical evidence
that atoms exist,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.296
and it laid out the basic mathematics
behind most of financial economics.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.176
Another one was on the theory
of special relativity.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.896
Another one was
on the photoelectric effect,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.280
that's why solar panels work,
it's a nice one.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.496
Gave him the Nobel prize for that one.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.656
And the fourth introduced an equation
you might have heard of:

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.976
E equals mc squared.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.576
So, tell me again how you
shouldn't do several things at once.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.976
Now, obviously, working simultaneously

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.896
on Brownian motion, special relativity
and the photoelectric effect --

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.456
it's not exactly the same
kind of multitasking

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.096
as Snapchatting while
you're watching "Westworld."

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.576
Very different.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.256
And Einstein, yeah, well,
Einstein's -- he's Einstein,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.840
he's one of a kind, he's unique.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.896
But the pattern of behavior
that Einstein was demonstrating,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.496
that's not unique at all.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.816
It's very common
among highly creative people,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.496
both artists and scientists,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.216
and I'd like to give it a name:

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.040
slow-motion multitasking.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.536
Slow-motion multitasking
feels like a counterintuitive idea.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.016
What I'm describing here

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.736
is having multiple projects
on the go at the same time,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.376
and you move backwards and forwards
between topics as the mood takes you,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.376
or as the situation demands.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.776
But the reason it seems counterintuitive

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.976
is because we're used to lapsing
into multitasking out of desperation.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.520
We're in a hurry,
we want to do everything at once.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.856
If we were willing
to slow multitasking down,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.400
we might find that it works
quite brilliantly.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.416
Sixty years ago, a young psychologist
by the name of Bernice Eiduson

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.416
began a long research project

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.536
into the personalities
and the working habits

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.256
of 40 leading scientists.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.936
Einstein was already dead,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.896
but four of her subjects won Nobel prizes,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.680
including Linus Pauling
and Richard Feynman.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.176
The research went on for decades,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.456
in fact, it continued even after
professor Eiduson herself had died.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.976
And one of the questions that it answered

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.536
was, "How is it that some scientists
are able to go on producing important work

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.656
right through their lives?"

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.336
What is it about these people?

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.256
Is it their personality,
is it their skill set,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.400
their daily routines, what?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.400
Well, a pattern that emerged was clear,
and I think to some people surprising.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.336
The top scientists
kept changing the subject.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.096
They would shift topics repeatedly

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.136
during their first 100
published research papers.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.336
Do you want to guess how often?

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.096
Three times?

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.320
Five times?

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.416
No. On average, the most
enduringly creative scientists

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.680
switched topics 43 times
in their first 100 research papers.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.616
Seems that the secret
to creativity is multitasking

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.840
in slow motion.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.176
Eiduson's research suggests
we need to reclaim multitasking

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.296
and remind ourselves
how powerful it can be.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.656
And she's not the only person
to have found this.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.896
Different researchers,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.496
using different methods
to study different highly creative people

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.136
have found that very often
they have multiple projects in progress

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.375
at the same time,

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:35.136
and they're also far more likely
than most of us to have serious hobbies.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.600
Slow-motion multitasking
among creative people is ubiquitous.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.680
So, why?

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.736
I think there are three reasons.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.296
And the first is the simplest.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.576
Creativity often comes when you take
an idea from its original context

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.096
and you move it somewhere else.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.856
It's easier to think outside the box

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.000
if you spend your time clambering
from one box into another.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.880
For an example of this,
consider the original eureka moment.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.176
Archimedes -- he's wrestling
with a difficult problem.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.696
And he realizes, in a flash,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.376
he can solve it, using
the displacement of water.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.096
And if you believe the story,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.616
this idea comes to him
as he's taking a bath,

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.816
lowering himself in, and he's watching
the water level rise and fall.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.456
And if solving a problem
while having a bath isn't multitasking,

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.880
I don't know what is.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.616
The second reason
that multitasking can work

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.016
is that learning to do one thing well

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.576
can often help you do something else.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.576
Any athlete can tell you
about the benefits of cross-training.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.160
It's possible to cross-train
your mind, too.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.496
A few years ago, researchers took
18 randomly chosen medical students

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.656
and they enrolled them in a course
at the Philadelphia Museum of Art,

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.456
where they learned to criticize
and analyze works of visual art.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.336
And at the end of the course,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.976
these students were compared
with a control group

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.576
of their fellow medical students.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.336
And the ones who had taken the art course

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.176
had become substantially better
at performing tasks

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.056
such as diagnosing diseases of the eye
by analyzing photographs.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.776
They'd become better eye doctors.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.816
So if we want to become
better at what we do,

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.376
maybe we should spend some time
doing something else,

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.136
even if the two fields
appear to be as completely distinct

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.320
as ophthalmology and the history of art.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.176
And if you'd like an example of this,

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.536
should we go for a less intimidating
example than Einstein? OK.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.896
Michael Crichton, creator
of "Jurassic Park" and "E.R."

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.296
So in the 1970s,
he originally trained as a doctor,

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.856
but then he wrote novels

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.136
and he directed
the original "Westworld" movie.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.296
But also, and this is less well-known,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.056
he also wrote nonfiction books,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.280
about art, about medicine,
about computer programming.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.536
So in 1995, he enjoyed
the fruits of all this variety

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.760
by penning the world's
most commercially successful book.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.760
And the world's most commercially
successful TV series.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.360
And the world's most commercially
successful movie.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.160
In 1996, he did it all over again.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.896
There's a third reason

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.216
why slow-motion multitasking
can help us solve problems.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.936
It can provide assistance
when we're stuck.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.176
This can't happen in an instant.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.576
So, imagine that feeling
of working on a crossword puzzle

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.376
and you can't figure out the answer,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.576
and the reason you can't is because
the wrong answer is stuck in your head.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.136
It's very easy --
just go and do something else.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.016
You know, switch topics, switch context,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.496
you'll forget the wrong answer

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.120
and that gives the right answer space
to pop into the front of your mind.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.856
But on the slower timescale
that interests me,

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.880
being stuck is a much more serious thing.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.040
You get turned down for funding.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.000
Your cell cultures won't grow,
your rockets keep crashing.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.880
Nobody wants to publish you fantasy novel
about a school for wizards.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.536
Or maybe you just can't find the solution
to the problem that you're working on.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.296
And being stuck like that
means stasis, stress,

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.000
possibly even depression.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.456
But if you have another exciting,
challenging project to work on,

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.616
being stuck on one is just an opportunity
to do something else.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.616
We could all get stuck sometimes,
even Albert Einstein.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.015
Ten years after the original,
miraculous year that I described,

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:55.976
Einstein was putting together the pieces
of his theory of general relativity,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.920
his greatest achievement.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.000
And he was exhausted.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.856
And so he turned to an easier problem.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.456
He proposed the stimulated
emission of radiation.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.296
Which, as you may know, is the S in laser.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.816
So he's laying down the theoretical
foundation for the laser beam,

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.696
and then, while he's doing that,

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.936
he moves back to general relativity,
and he's refreshed.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.296
He sees what the theory implies --

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.656
that the universe isn't static.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.296
It's expanding.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.416
It's an idea so staggering,

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.360
Einstein can't bring himself
to believe it for years.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.976
Look, if you get stuck

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.440
and you get the ball rolling
on laser beams,

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.976
you're in pretty good shape.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.976
(Laughter)

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.496
So, that's the case
for slow-motion multitasking.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.536
And I'm not promising
that it's going to turn you into Einstein.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.776
I'm not even promising it's going
to turn you into Michael Crichton.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.760
But it is a powerful way
to organize our creative lives.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.720
But there's a problem.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.440
How do we stop all of these projects
becoming completely overwhelming?

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.000
How do we keep all these ideas
straight in our minds?

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.896
Well, here's a simple solution,
a practical solution

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.416
from the great American
choreographer, Twyla Tharp.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.216
Over the last few decades,

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.736
she's blurred boundaries,
mixed genres, won prizes,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.536
danced to the music of everybody,
from Philip Glass to Billy Joel.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.136
She's written three books.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.440
I mean, she's a slow-motion
multitasker, of course she is.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.816
She says, "You have to be all things.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.456
Why exclude?

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.040
You have to be everything."

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.616
And Tharp's method

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.976
for preventing all of these different
projects from becoming overwhelming

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.296
is a simple one.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.856
She gives each project
a big cardboard box,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.576
writes the name of the project
on the side of the box.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:09.016
And into it, she tosses DVDs
and books, magazine cuttings,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.016
theater programs, physical objects,

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.016
really anything that's provided a source
of creative inspiration.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.776
And she writes,

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.040
"The box means I never
have to worry about forgetting.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.816
One of the biggest fears
for a creative person

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.296
is that some brilliant idea will get lost

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.800
because you didn't write it down
and put it in a safe place.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.696
I don't worry about that.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.080
Because I know where to find it.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.640
It's all in the box."

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.616
You can manage many ideas like this,

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.296
either in physical boxes
or in their digital equivalents.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.576
So, I would like to urge you

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.920
to embrace the art
of slow-motion multitasking.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.776
Not because you're in a hurry,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.840
but because you're in no hurry at all.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.056
And I want to give you one final example,

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.216
my favorite example.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.440
Charles Darwin.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.896
A man whose slow-burning
multitasking is so staggering,

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.096
I need a diagram to explain it all to you.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.456
We know what Darwin
was doing at different times,

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.176
because the creativity researchers
Howard Gruber and Sara Davis

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.096
have analyzed his diaries
and his notebooks.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.696
So, when he left school, age of 18,

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.336
he was initially interested in two fields,

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.616
zoology and geology.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.096
Pretty soon, he signed up to be
the onboard naturalist on the "Beagle."

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.936
This is the ship
that eventually took five years

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.456
to sail all the way around
the southern oceans of the Earth,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.296
stopping at the Galápagos,
passing through the Indian ocean.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.296
While he was on the "Beagle,"
he began researching coral reefs.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.576
This is a great synergy
between his two interests

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.096
in zoology and geology,

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.600
and it starts to get him thinking
about slow processes.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.496
But when he gets back from the voyage,

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.176
his interests start to expand
even further: psychology, botany;

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.536
for the rest of his life,

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.176
he's moving backwards and forwards
between these different fields.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.056
He never quite abandons any of them.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.976
In 1837, he begins work
on two very interesting projects.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.816
One of them: earthworms.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.416
The other, a little notebook
which he titles

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.336
"The transmutation of species."

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:35.296
Then, Darwin starts
studying my field, economics.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:40.176
He reads a book
by the economist Thomas Malthus.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.416
And he has his eureka moment.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:47.976
In a flash, he realizes how species
could emerge and evolve slowly,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.056
through this process
of the survival of the fittest.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.376
It all comes to him,
he writes it all down,

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.136
every single important element
of the theory of evolution,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.896
in that notebook.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.736
But then, a new project.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.360
His son William is born.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.896
Well, there's a natural
experiment right there,

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.496
you get to observe
the development of a human infant.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.216
So immediately,
Darwin starts making notes.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.136
Now, of course, he's still working
on the theory of evolution

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.016
and the development of the human infant.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.456
But during all of this,

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.656
he realizes he doesn't really know
enough about taxonomy.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.416
So he starts studying that.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:32.896
And in the end, he spends eight years
becoming the world's leading expert

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.360
on barnacles.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.416
Then, "Natural Selection."

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.576
A book that he's to continue working on
for his entire life, he never finishes it.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.456
"Origin of Species" is finally published

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.456
20 years after Darwin set out
all the basic elements.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.376
Then, the "Descent of Man,"
controversial book.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.256
And then, the book about
the development of the human infant.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.416
The one that was inspired
when he could see his son, William,

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.616
crawling on the sitting room
floor in front of him.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.640
When the book was published,
William was 37 years old.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.856
And all this time,

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.856
Darwin's working on earthworms.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:19.856
He fills his billiard room with earthworms
in pots, with glass covers.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.576
He shines lights on them,
to see if they'll respond.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.456
He holds a hot poker next to them,
to see if they move away.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.296
He chews tobacco and --

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.536
(Blows)

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.576
He blows on the earthworms
to see if they have a sense of smell.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.880
He even plays the bassoon
at the earthworms.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.896
I like to think of this great man

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.376
when he's tired, he's stressed,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.416
he's anxious about the reception
of his book "The Descent of Man."

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.520
You or I might log into Facebook
or turn on the television.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.256
Darwin would go
into the billiard room to relax

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.360
by studying the earthworms intensely.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.856
And that's why it's appropriate
that one of his last great works

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.896
is the "Formation of Vegetable Mould
Through The Action of Worms."

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.256
(Laughter)

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.400
He worked upon that book for 44 years.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.776
We don't live in the 19th century anymore.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.136
I don't think any of us could sit

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.280
on our creative or scientific
projects for 44 years.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.616
But we do have something to learn
from the great slow-motion multitaskers.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:36.000
From Einstein and Darwin
to Michael Crichton and Twyla Tharp.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.856
The modern world seems
to present us with a choice.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.896
If we're not going to fast-twitch
from browser window to browser window,

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.536
we have to live like a hermit,

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.880
focus on one thing
to the exclusion of everything else.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.056
I think that's a false dilemma.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.736
We can make multitasking work for us,

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.320
unleashing our natural creativity.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.920
We just need to slow it down.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.440
So ...

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.376
Make a list of your projects.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.800
Put down your phone.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.680
Pick up a couple of cardboard boxes.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.080
And get to work.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.616
Thank you very much.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.480
(Applause)
