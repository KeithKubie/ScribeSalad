00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.140
VO: This episode of Fun Science is brought to
you by Skillshare.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.300
CHARLIE: [YELP!]

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.540
You frightened the life out of me!

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.180
What on earth are you doing up so late?

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.060
Looks like you might need a lesson in the
importance of a good night's sleep,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.680
in this episode of...

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.660
[FUN SCIENCE THEME SONG]

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.600
If you're lucky enough to live until you're
90, chances are you would have spent about

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.320
30 years of your life asleep, which is crazy
when you consider that scientists are still

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.460
yet to agree on exactly why our bodies tempt
us into bed every night.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.940
What we do know about sleep however, is just
how important it really is.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.920
VO: Now it used to be thought that when you went
to sleep your body just sort of...

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.160
turned off.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.680
MIKE: Goodnight.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.720
VO: But of course, if our bodies did just turn
off like this, we'd all be quite dead.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.780
What we know now is that it's more like your
body gets dialed down.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.200
Our breathing slows, our heart rate lowers
and the muscles in our body relax.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.860
We even experience a decrease in body temperature.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.680
CHARLIE: This is when we enter the stage of sleep known as slow wave, or deep sleep,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.200
during which our bodies do some amazing things like repairing themselves and releasing growth hormones,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.420
all of which is essential for our health.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.540
MIKE: [SNORE]

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.300
In fact, some studies have shown that sleep 
is as essential to our health as food,

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.900
with sleep deprivation being as dangerous as starvation.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.460
VO: Obviously this is bad news for those of us
who suffer from sleeping difficulties, though

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.700
fortunately if you do have trouble getting
a good night's sleep, cognitive behavioral

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.730
therapy, or CBT, might help as it's been shown to reduce these issues by 50% on average.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.940
CHARLIE: So, we know how important sleep is for our
bodies, but how about our brains?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.280
VO: Well, when we sleep, it gives our brains time
to take stock of all the stimuli we've been

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.020
subjected to throughout the day.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.760
MIKE: The name of the cute barista that smiled at
you today...

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.080
GONE!

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.130
VO: With a healthy 7 to 8 hours each night, our
mind can sort through all this information

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.460
committing the useful stuff to memory and
chucking the bits we don't need.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.580
MIKE: The humiliating feeling you got when you accidentally misgendered one of your co-workers...

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.980
we're going to hold on to this one forever!

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.880
CHARLIE: After slow wave you enter the deepest part
of the sleep cycle known as Rapid Eye Movement

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.140
or REM sleep, during which our brains actually
show as much activity as when we're awake.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.750
VO: REM sleep is also when we have some of our
most vivid dreams.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.320
Why we dream is still a mystery to science
but what we do know is that this is also when

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.880
we enter sleep paralysis, which stops us from
moving our bodies, thus helping prevent us

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.280
from acting out our dreams in real life.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.820
CHARLIE: Man, all this talk about sleeping has made
me feel very...

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.440
[YAWN]

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.620
Did I make you yawn?

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.360
You it used to be thought that yawning was
a way of bringing more oxygen into the body

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.640
at times when our breathing had slowed.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.840
VO: But now research is suggesting that as we
get more tired the temperature regulations

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.320
of our brain don't function as efficiently,
and so to combat this our body forces us to

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.260
bring in a deep breath of nice, cool air.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.000
[YAWN]

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.720
One theory behind why yawns are contagious
is that, based on evolution, it would make

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.760
sense for groups to be able to coordinate
times of activity and rest.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.820
CHARLIE: [YAWN]

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.420
MIKE: [YAWN]

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.040
CHARLIE: So, next time you're up past your bedtime,
don't forget just how important a good night's

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.780
sleep is for your body and your brain.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.959
Sleep tight!

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.270
Though, if you do have trouble sleeping, did
you know that there's a Skillshare course

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.800
for that?

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.920
VO: In fact, as well as courses like this one
on how to get a better night's sleep, Skillshare,

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.430
which is an online learning community, has
loads of other courses to check out on topics

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.459
like lifestyle and creativity.

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.400
And if you're one of the first 500 people
who sign up using the link in the description

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.970
you'll get your first two months for free,
giving you access to all the courses on Skillshare.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.300
So, go and learn, or go and sleep, and thanks
for watching!

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.220
Bye bye.
