00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
Announcer: And your Miss Earth 3009 is...

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.800
Announcer: Victoria Young!

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.020
-You have four 
-Here. (take) this William

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.380
Yes -- sorry -- sorry

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.000
I won't lie. 
[dramatic music plays]

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.920
I'm afraid.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.080
We all are.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.700
We have every right to be.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.240
The fate of our planet, of our lives, our --

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.080
[notification rings]

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.540
Very few know that Arden Young has a twin sister

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.160
And today, marks an ironic moment in history

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.960
because Arden is going to be beamed up to compete in Galactic Cyclical depopulation pageant

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.220
while her older counterpart remains sadly on Earth, with a title from an arcane competition that really doesn't mean much at all.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.600
Kinda makes you wonder how one splinted splice of DNA cou--

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.320
[ringtone]

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.120
Well. Look who decided to grace me with a call.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.200
[disraught] Victoria --

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.720
I am so sorry, I didn't know what I was doing

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.620
I tried to take it back but the server isn't receiving calls --

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.160
Woah. Calm down Arden.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.140
You're gonna be fine.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.160
You've been training your whole life for this, remember?

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.280
you basically ditched me to go and try and save the world...

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.340
I...

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.860
f-cked up Victoria.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.000
I am so, sorry --

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.580
No.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.220
HEY!

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.200
Watch where you're going!

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.180
[alien language] truluvuding, ha!

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.300
Uh...Hello

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.000
I need to speak to someone who is in charge?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.860
There's been some kind of mistake

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.080
Alien: Ohhhh! I've seen you guys on holo but you are soooo much cuter in real life.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.800
Victoria: No, no I'm not supposed to be here

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.620
[exclaimation of pain]

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.800
Biological profile is a match for Arden Young. Earth representative.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.440
No, no. I'm not Arden.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.540
I'm Victoria, her twin sister? That's probably why it matches? But I'm, I'm not supposed to be here.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.700
Once aboard, there are no substitutional representatives!

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.180
It's not a substitute when there's been a mistake!

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.200
Hey, hey wait!

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.820
[whoosh]

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.360
[gasp]

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.180
Watch it, parasite.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.440
Hey Trai, where's Zarik?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.060
Did he not come to watch you die?

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.700
Awww, what a rude mate.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.120
Says the Endarion who drove him into hyperspace with her slinky glarcole.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.360
OHHH! Do you need some ectoplasmic ointment for that burn Endar?

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.280
[pink alien]: I'll enjoy killing you both in Hex or off Galactic Rein. Either. Way.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.740
[white alien] Well since we are under their protection...

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.400
[magicy sounds emanate]

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.460
[snarled] Stay out of my head.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.920
[gasp] Theres no light

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.140
d-d-d-DANG Trai.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.880
The crowd therapy chamber had a cancellation, in case you need to treat those burrns.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.460
You are supposed to be forming alliances!

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.900
Not aggravate a longstanding enemy right before the Hex!

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.280
You don't call somebody you hunt an enemy.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.020
And I did recruit an ally. This is Earth!

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.220
The parasitic planet?

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.220
None other. Isn't she adorable! Speak Earth.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.660
What? 
See!

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.020
Do you have any telekinetic, telepathic or molecular manipulation abilities?

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.520
Uh.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.420
No?

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.140
What's the highest level Hex you've completed in training?

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.900
No.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.560
What are your planets qualifications?

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.020
I am actually not Earth's select...My- my sister is?

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.380
I'm - I'm not supposed to be here and I was trying to tell the lady

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.960
But you were beamed.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.240
So...what did you do?

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.060
Well.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.700
I won Miss Earth today.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.160
And I absolutely killed at the bikini portion.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.480
How does one kill a bikini?

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.580
What? No, it's a swimsuit?

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.580
You know, that little piece of clothing that like covers --You know, what did you guys do!

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.700
Assemble for the Hex!

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.400
[robotic voice] Balex. Ninth star of Aden. Integrated black hole free interstellar travel.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.120
Distar. Second moon orbiting Urka. Endured three years of solitude and survival trials

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.540
Endar. Fourth Planet of the Exodus Galaxy. Familial Genocide.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.140
Arden Young. Third Planet around the Sun. Voted Most Likely To Succeed.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.660
Uh!

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.140
No! Hello? Hello, no I'm not Arden!

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.640
[peppy science music begins]

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.580
[three voices speak together]
The Cycle begins again.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.180
Endarra.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.280
Kisma.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.780
I choose Physique!

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.540
[assorted grunts]

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.320
[background voice] 
-oh snaaaap!-

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.900
They just. Blew up. That planet?

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.940
Like a freakin second after she loses they just...destory her entire people?

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.780
That is the whole point.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.240
The universe stops expanding but life does not.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.040
It is the optimal method of maintenence.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.360
Trai.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.320
Psychis.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.320
Earth.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.260
...Thats you Earth.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.640
I don't know how to fight.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.460
It is Psychic combat.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.220
Thank you, thats very reassuring.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.900
Does Earth forfeit?

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.100
What? No no no, I-I - We're not going to forfeit but um

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.400
We can appeal to beam your sister into the hex!

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.460
Pardon me, but theres been an error in submission! Earth's representative is --

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.800
Not Psychic. I am totally not Psychic.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.160
Earth forfeits.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.480
What! No, I didn't say I would - I wouldn't fight, just saying that you -- uh please --just.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.980
Give me a minute to prepare.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.500
What are you doing.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:41.820
[quietly] I can't win, I mean, even with all of her training, Arden and I are kind of on the same playing field with this one.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.400
Which is. Dead.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.480
I really want the blood of her entire planet on my hands.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.540
I'm more than happy to take Earth's place and kill Trai.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.760
[deep breath]

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.700
It will be my honor to rid the universe of you.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.940
Just imagine that moment not long after your death when Galactic destroys your planet

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:21.200
and screams of agony from every baby Tricorn, every single living form you've ever known or loved shatters that little Psychis network of yours.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.840
An entire species ending in an endless scream.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.600
Woah

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.420
[magic scifi whooshing starts]

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.660
[notification rings]

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.140
[gasping breaths]

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.020
It was a pleasure knowing you, Earth.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.160
What?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.940
When she dies, both of your planets will be destroyed.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.760
f-ck

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.240
[sizzling noise], [screams of agony]

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.300
Silence!

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.120
That interruption calls for direct planetary disqualification!

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.060
No!

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.600
[coughing]

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:28.140
Excuse me? Uh, technically, parasitic interference has no written regulations regarding combat disturbance.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.880
They were considered so inferior, new rules were actually bothered with.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.320
Therefore, Earth's actions are not cause for disqualification.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Yeeeaaah.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.560
We will take a moment.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.780
Would you like some ectoplasmic ointment for those burns?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.020
Earth. You will now be given the attention of the council

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.880
State your case.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.380
Why should your planet be spared?

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.280
uh. Well...

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Wait!

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.100
I am Arden Young. Rightful representative of Earth.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.440
Galactic Council, I implore you.
[dramatic music starts]

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.880
To please spare planet Earth.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.440
For even though we are the youngest contestants in this pageant,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.500
We have made tremendous contributions.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.720
In the fields of interstellar travel, communication, star-galac technology and not to men--

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.880
Denied.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.280
Earth shall be destroyed.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.880
Wait! Wait, wait. Uh...

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:47.820
Uh that girl. Or maybe one of those girls, uh said that once aboard there are no representative subsitutions.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.220
So by your rules, I am Earth's Select.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.400
I believe she's right

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.380
Fine. Make your plea.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.920
...Sorry Vic.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.440
Well, we.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.220
Okay so.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.660
Earth.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.760
huma -- Don't kill us, first of all. Please don't kill us, spare us, because --

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.340
On with it.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.940
You know what?

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.020
Who the hell are you three, to judge us anyway.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.300
I mean, do you really not see how -- how archaic this system is?

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:28.360
To judge an entire planet based on one unqualified person's speech?

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.100
I mean what the hell do you three do anyway -- why should you be spared every cycle?

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.760
You know, all you do is contribute death and destruction to the universe.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.620
s-sirs.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.360
Of the trillions of cycles that this depopulation pageant has existed,

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.860
no one has dared question our authority.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.840
Your insolence warrants death.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.540
However.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:09.500
Curiousity, in lieu of blind acceptance, is the true mark of wisdom

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.860
Earth shall be spared.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.540
For now.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.980
What about Endar?

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.700
I clearly won.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.080
It shall be voided.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.440
You have no idea what you've done.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.880
[magic psychic noise]

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.980
Not gonna lie, totally thought you were done for.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.660
I too came to the same conclusion.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.960
See you at the next round! What side on Earth rotations? One?

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.700
What?

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.520
You did it. I can't believe it but you did it!

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:00.300
Hey.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.020
About submitting your name...

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.760
Oh, I might have saved the world, but you're dead.
