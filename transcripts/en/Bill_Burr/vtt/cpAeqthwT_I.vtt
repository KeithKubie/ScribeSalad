1
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.700
All right.
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.560
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,
September.
Now February 12th.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.980
There's a fucking comedian.

4
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:12.720
I don't even know whether I didn't know where the fuck I am.

5
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:16.740
February 12 2018 what's going on?
How are you?

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.720
Um,
usually,
usually I do these by myself.

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.620
Usually I'm just sitting alone by us.
Like,
you know what?
Fuck this.

8
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.940
My buddy called me up,

9
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:31.941
he's got a podcast he wants to promote and he's a fucking eagles fan.

10
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:33.450
So I figured why not?

11
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:36.420
I got to go on because for some reason people think I actually fucking hate

12
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:39.150
Philly.
Just cause I got booed there because of that video.
Yeah.

13
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:42.990
And it's just like,
no,
I got booed in Philly if I,
if he got booed in Texas.

14
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.880
What are you,
do you make fun of fucking pickup trucks,

15
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:49.590
chicks with too much makeup?
All of it.
I just make fun of Texas in general.

16
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:53.950
I think everyone just goes to Texas.
My goal to stay as Kentucky,
I like tech.

17
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.480
Well it's Kevin Shay,
everybody from the,
uh,
the Kevin Shade podcast.

18
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.030
All I'm saying podcasts,
all I'm saying that's,
that's easy.
Right?

19
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.103
So I remember,

20
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.460
do you know every host and it also kind of gets you off the hook or whatever you

21
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:12.110
just said.
Exactly.
I all I'm say

22
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.880
it says too many people.

23
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.600
I didn't mean to specifically pick out that group like they needed to go,

24
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:23.530
but there's too many fucking people.
I mean hosts fucks it up though.
It's,

25
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.950
it's kind of funny cause they go,
they go with you in trouble.

26
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:30.000
All I'm saying podcast,
all I'm saying,
I'm saying,
I said you can read it so easy.

27
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.320
They asked two more times before they go on stage and they go,
oh,

28
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:37.470
I'm talking about what you doing,
how's it going?

29
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.520
And so we know you didn't like getting all Sassy.
Yes.

30
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.230
And we always bet the other,
and all I'm saying isn't really a,

31
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.530
that's pretty mainstream vernacular.
I,
you know,
I didn't,

32
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.410
I thought it was a fucking kidding.
A title is hard.

33
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.100
Like you have the best title ever.
It's just doing,
yeah,
it's simple.

34
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.050
It's so simple.
That's why I did it.

35
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.530
Is that why you remember when it would come out funny and then people go,

36
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.270
we should do want every day of the week.
It's like,

37
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:05.970
well then it's not the money you got the Thursday,

38
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.690
do the third Thursday just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
Um,

39
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.790
I love when people just,
they go fuck it all out.
Yeah.
Like you show up at this,

40
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.360
some of these comics studios,
you feel like you're doing Howard Stern.

41
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.620
I don't want to be like,
dude,
you could really keep you overhead weight.
I look,

42
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:26.070
I'm not talking about guys like rogue and Mike Rogan in,
we'll have like,

43
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:29.610
you know,
fucking super,
super famous people.
I'm just talking just like,

44
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.570
oh it doesn't mix a jerk off like me and I'm having you over there a reason why

45
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:35.330
you're not in my house right now because my daughters,

46
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.420
I figured that I figured cause your daughter's sleeping and then I didn't,

47
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.020
I didn't know you moved.
Like when you texted me the address to the studio.

48
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.150
I know,
but when you texted me me or you made this,
this,
no,
you.
Yeah.
You,

49
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.310
when you texted me,
I was like,
why would he move to per bank as like,

50
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.270
that was my,
I was like pill and I was like,
you're doing well.

51
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.940
You got more bang for getting more bang for my buck out.
Say,

52
00:02:56.941 --> 00:03:00.100
why would you move to where,
man,
I liked valley.
I

53
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.730
<v 1>like the value.
You're getting better,
better conversations out here.</v>

54
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.570
You know what I mean?

55
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.600
You meet some guy who did something on mash way back in the day.

56
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.970
A bunch of Trump supporters,
you know?

57
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.040
<v 0>No.
Then the Hillary stuff gets old man in Hollywood.
It's like,
I get it.
I get it.</v>

58
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:16.090
You know what I mean?
I want to hear it.

59
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.690
I want to hear somebody actually thinks something good's going on.
I love it.

60
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.530
I fuck even make it a better every day.
My brain takes better.

61
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.940
That's Taco tastes better.
I don't,
I don't really talk to a lot of people.

62
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.120
You know that about me.
Well then why did you come down here for you?

63
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.770
It's just cause your team just won the Superbowl,
the e a g l.
E.

64
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.880
S by the way.
I eat.
I'm a fucking huge eagles fan,

65
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:44.620
but I hate that fucking song.
The fight song flow.
How does it go?
I own no fly.

66
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.670
Oh it has to be old,
right?
It's not,
it's fucking not.
I did a whole research,

67
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:52.300
I thought it was from like 1920 or 18 cause it's not fly.

68
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:55.780
Eagles fly when I see that.
Sounds like it was written the same week of for,

69
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:57.910
he's a jolly good fellow

70
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.360
back when that wasn't corny to say.
It's,
it's weird cause it's supposed to sound,

71
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:07.490
oh it's got the boom boom boom.
Like the jobs up front and go get him.

72
00:04:07.491 --> 00:04:12.491
I hit him low so I looked it up razzmatazz 1985

73
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.790
<v 1>or something like that.
Maybe that is like 30 years ago.
32 years ago.
Fuck.</v>

74
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:19.150
I guess you put it this way.
If you look,

75
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.390
if you were in 1985 right now and that song was 32 years old,

76
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.880
they would have been written in 1953 yeah.
Oh Shit.
But I gotta be honest.

77
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:28.640
You hit them high,

78
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.230
hit him low is very like still like that sounds like it's written in the 40.

79
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270
[inaudible]

80
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.170
<v 0>it sounds very college.
Very,
no,
not knowing college.
Like high school.</v>

81
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.970
I would say college.
You still call it won't be too,
too hard.
Oh No.

82
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.740
I love the song.
I love,
here's the thing.
It's one of those songs where I love it,

83
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:48.260
but I acknowledge as corny.
Okay.
Jimmy is cheesy,

84
00:04:48.261 --> 00:04:52.610
but I love fly eagle.
Fly Up up to this gap.

85
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.720
Is it like a disco remake and like getting uncomfortable?
You singing?
No.

86
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.260
Fucking sing yourself.
Do you know,
uh,
the Po by,

87
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.740
he's a jolly good fellow.

88
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.430
He goes one the fucking Superbowl number one.
Uh,

89
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.663
<v 1>we were going to,</v>

90
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.930
Breyer is like years ago I had to lock all of those gigs out yet [inaudible]

91
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.530
does drives,
we hate those fucking jobs.
No,
I swear to God,
Dude.

92
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:22.150
I almost like was ready to fucking just leave la yesterday.
No way I did.

93
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.320
I did go,
it was like fucking Saturday.
It was a Saturday afternoon and I was,

94
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:30.490
I can rush hour traffic and you want to get mad but you're going to be like,

95
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:35.491
well I'm also out here and they're all do this fucking nobody is fucking talking

96
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.790
about doing something about this population problem.
And uh,

97
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:42.550
I'll tell you one thing we have to get a problem of is touching the desk and

98
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.770
hitting this.
This is going to be annoying in this.

99
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:49.090
We have a new podcast studio here.
Oh Shit.
Why are we doing that?
No,
no I,
I just,

100
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:52.120
I've been hearing it so we're going to have to put some sort of padding here.

101
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.780
I don't know what,
but anyways,
I like nature,
right?

102
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.980
I enjoy like animals in

103
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.780
<v 0>that type of shit.
But I always have my,
my,</v>

104
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.290
I never take the remote out of my hand when I want you to nature show cause

105
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:06.710
right when they start talking about what's going on with them and how they're

106
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:11.540
all going to die off because of us,
I shut it off.
Well my daughter always,

107
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:15.110
you know,
takes the remote and it's amazing.
My fucking remote sucks.

108
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:18.830
I can literally be pointing at the TV,
like change,
change,
change,
what the fuck?

109
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:19.664
I won't do anything.

110
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.530
My daughter picks it up and he's like walking away with it and we'll,

111
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.690
we'll somehow turn on the fucking DVD player.
I still have one of those.
Um,

112
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.980
is it digital?
Is the remote all digital with like,
no,

113
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.640
I have direct TV and I love direct TV,

114
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.840
but they're remote sucks.
You look at it,
you have to fucking reboot the thing.

115
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.040
It's like,
it's like a,

116
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:43.480
it's like it was in a abusive relationship and it's over sensitive.

117
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.290
I feel like it was recycled.

118
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.160
I'm like some racist had it before me was constantly throwing it at the TVS.

119
00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:51.410
Funny.
And then they just like,
you know,
like our,

120
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:55.160
all our old phones that you watched a bunch of porn on an aisle over there and

121
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:57.830
like Thailand or the Philippines.
Do you know why he told you?

122
00:06:57.831 --> 00:07:02.610
Did you have a I have a laptop that I use.
Just report.
Oh yeah,

123
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.510
that's,
I just said,
so that is

124
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.260
a very specific jazz proof or something.

125
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.870
It's just the hard drive.
So maybe on a latex it's just so old and shot.

126
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.360
So I don't give a fuck if he gets diseases early suddenly.
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.

127
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.920
I don't care.
It stays at separate,
but it's old is big isn't it?

128
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.970
You know what that reminds me?

129
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.270
Have you ever see these people that get like foster kids and they feed their,

130
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.490
they're real kids and they just take the checks for the foster kids and maybe

131
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.080
the kid will look like he's fucking eight years old and really bony and you'll

132
00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:37.820
be a cup holder and he's like 26.
So that was a thing that is a thing.

133
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.920
Oh,
feed him like fucking paste and shit.

134
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.990
But here's was confusing when I was younger.
I'm a,
I'm adopted.
I never,

135
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.050
it doesn't surprise me the irritating,

136
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.770
I don't know the difference.
I didn't know the difference we foster and adopted.

137
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.420
Okay,
so you thought there was like foster kid means,
uh,

138
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.540
you just take them for a little while,
right?
Yeah,

139
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:07.541
but they were always like abused and I was never abused and I couldn't wrap my

140
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:11.000
brain as a kid.
I called my parents,
mom and dad,

141
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.290
but then my friends down the street who were a family,

142
00:08:15.291 --> 00:08:18.560
but they were divorced with kids,
call them by their fucking names.

143
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.810
While it's great to hear,
that's why they got a divorce.

144
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.940
They were never committed.
They weren't committed to each other.

145
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:24.090
They weren't committed to having a kid.

146
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.790
It weird like when they would call their mom by their first name.
Well My,
well,

147
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:31.670
my daughter learns how to speak.
I'm going to be like,
this is mister shade.

148
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.740
She's not going to call you Kevin.
I don't like that.
I don't make it.

149
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:38.460
Ain't a fucking can't stand when people do like my buddies,
we'll talk to you.

150
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.650
There are other parents and they say,
Hey John Paul,
it's weird.

151
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.080
It would help if we kind of dressed like adults though.

152
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:51.200
I mean you gotta you of me.
I go,
you're an adult.

153
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.620
It's not,
you don't have a no.
You know what it was.
No,

154
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:56.040
but back the day like you know,

155
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.730
<v 1>people just to fucking like if you want,
I was,
I tape recorded all,</v>

156
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:01.560
like they had all the NFL films,

157
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.250
Superbowls in a row on NFL films and I taped all 51 of them and I'm just working

158
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:12.240
my way through them.
I love them.
I can't get an awesome,
they're awesome.

159
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:15.840
So I was watching them and first of all,
like the first,

160
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.650
like 11 bowls were played in like the afternoon.

161
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.600
I know they played it like rice stadium at two lane,
you know what I mean?

162
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:27.810
And there was just like,
like I like the fucking college band.

163
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:31.900
Like what if I'm like the Michigan marching band went out there and play.
Did it?

164
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.950
Uh,
the niners I thought you was scatting horn.
Did it

165
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.410
even start doing a band or something dumb?
You're my fucking head.
Okay.

166
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.590
Didn't a bed if
the liners,

167
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.320
yeah,
they played in Golden Gate Park.
Yeah.

168
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.420
Give me a ships and probably an NFL championship,
but you guys sucked back then.

169
00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:57.030
So I don't know.
I think you had like one good year in the forties and 50s.

170
00:09:57.031 --> 00:10:01.290
I said no,
there was one,
it was one in the 50s,
in the 1960 was the last one.

171
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:04.940
And we used to,
we always get into this discussion about,
uh,

172
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.570
like you think it matters what the NFL championship,
NFL title should count.

173
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.160
They do count,
but they're not super bowls.
And you know,
I don't get that.
I,

174
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.090
you know,
there was no one in the league.
I get it.
I get it.

175
00:10:18.091 --> 00:10:21.360
But now there is another league.
There's no,
they're still was,
there was,

176
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.620
there was still a fucking no,
you don't understand.
The AFL started in 1960.

177
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.290
Before then there was,
there was only the,
no,

178
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.650
there was the NFL and then the AFL came in.

179
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.010
I'll give you a little history lesson.
The first year,
the AFL,
okay,

180
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.450
all the NFL owners laughed.
Baja Ha,

181
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.720
look at these fucking morons wasting their money.
But while they laughed at him,

182
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:47.880
they then they made two moves to fuck over the AFL.
The first thing they did was,

183
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.540
um,
I think the team with the most amount of money was,

184
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:55.860
was that was the Dallas Texans.
They will read and white,
right?
They let him,

185
00:10:55.861 --> 00:11:00.240
he became the Kansas City chiefs.
So what the NFL did was immediately or,
uh,
uh,

186
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.440
gave Dallas and NFL franchise.
That's how the cowboys started.

187
00:11:04.441 --> 00:11:09.180
That started so that there would be a team in the same city as the wealthiest

188
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:11.910
AFL team.
They're trying to cut the head off the snake here.

189
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.720
So then basically the figure in both,
they're going to be low quality of,

190
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.540
of players because they're both brand new.
However,

191
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.650
you could see Jim Brown or whoever,
like the superstar that day was,

192
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.180
would come in and play the cowboys.

193
00:11:24.181 --> 00:11:26.280
So you're going to go that game rather than the Dallas Texans.

194
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:30.630
And it kind of worked because the Texans ended up moving to Kansas City and

195
00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:31.740
became the chiefs.
All right.

196
00:11:31.741 --> 00:11:34.440
Then the other move they made was one of their franchises.

197
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:38.670
The Minnesota Vikings were initially going to be an AFL team and they came in

198
00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:42.690
and they said,
hey,
uh,
you want to join the NFL?
And then they said,
hey,

199
00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:45.080
fuck the AFL.
Let's go with this team.
So that's what they did.

200
00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.080
They tried to fuck over to teams.
That's what they take.
Now the NFL continues.

201
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.450
There's all these fucking championships being one.

202
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.300
The Green Bay packers won like fucking 13 of them and they're the New York

203
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:57.340
Yankees.
They're the fucking Celtics.
They're the,

204
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.250
they're the Montreal Canadians of football,

205
00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:03.520
but they just don't recognize their first 12.
So they say the Steelers,

206
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:07.060
I was six Superbowls.
So in 90,

207
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:11.230
after 1969,
when the jets beat the fucking,

208
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.720
uh,
hackers know colts,
they beat the colts.
And um,

209
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.490
there was a merger talk was already there in the AFL was actually doing so well

210
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:25.080
and was such an exciting product that it was kind of looking like they might

211
00:12:25.081 --> 00:12:27.460
actually might take over the NFL.
All right.

212
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:32.350
And the only guy who had the balls to say fuck the new NFL merger deal was,
uh,

213
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:36.930
was,
was what's his face there?
Jesus Christ.
It just based on his name,
uh,

214
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.780
with the Raiders.
Oh,
out Dave Al Davis out there.
It's this fuck that.

215
00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:42.670
He just didn't want to beat him.
He wanted to bury him.

216
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:45.310
He wanted to put them out of business and everybody else was like,
no,
fuck that.

217
00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:49.990
Let's join.
So they joined.
Okay.
Now that has happened in other leagues.

218
00:12:49.991 --> 00:12:54.100
The Nhl with like the Ihl with Wayne Gretzky's where the fuck he played with

219
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.760
India?
Uh,
Indianapolis like um,
I guess that was his first team.

220
00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.740
I used to know all of this shit.
But they,

221
00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:01.690
they've absorbed teams from other leagues.

222
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.930
The NBA took in Aba team.

223
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.110
<v 0>Yeah,
but they they,</v>

224
00:13:06.111 --> 00:13:10.010
but they still count the Celtics championships but they didn't change the name

225
00:13:10.011 --> 00:13:13.970
of the title.
I think it's cause of the event.
You changing the name of the title.

226
00:13:13.971 --> 00:13:17.060
I will.
I'll go with this.
Maybe that's what it is.

227
00:13:17.061 --> 00:13:19.610
I haven't thought of that because you're changing the name of the title.

228
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.010
The basketball never changed the name of the top.
What is the thing?

229
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:27.040
The first two green bay one out with the NFL AFL championship game as was the

230
00:13:27.051 --> 00:13:31.700
third one,
which,
which jets?
The jets was so AFL title game,
which was great.

231
00:13:31.701 --> 00:13:36.290
But you know what's funny about the whole story?
You heard?
You just told me.
No,

232
00:13:36.291 --> 00:13:38.990
just say it.
Oh my God,
the vikings still suck.
But the,

233
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:45.890
you know,
the Patriots now have tied,
they've lost the most super bowls.

234
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.150
But they also,
they don't,
there's also the thing is we've also been to the most,

235
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.990
you've been fucking 10.
We're five and five.
Your,
you've been a tech.

236
00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.260
Here's the thing I saw is not an elearn fell fan out there that wouldn't take

237
00:13:57.261 --> 00:14:01.730
that except for the steel is steel reserve or the 49 is in the uh,

238
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.200
the 49th and the cowboys,

239
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.360
cause they already have five and they put like eight or something.

240
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.320
There's been five Seversville Denver last five because one three.

241
00:14:09.321 --> 00:14:10.400
So they've been to eight

242
00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:16.010
<v 1>cowboys have one five and they'd see they lost to the colts.</v>

243
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.530
They lost to the Steelers twice.
I think that's,
I think they'd been to eight.
Do

244
00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:25.920
<v 0>you?
I saw him clip on when they've been to a morning and you go,</v>

245
00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.100
oh I've been through five of these losses.
I'm like,
how old are you?

246
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.940
Cause the first patriots Superbowl [inaudible] 86.
Okay,
that makes sense.

247
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.470
Cause I was,
I am old.
I'm turning 50 in June.
Well congratulations.
I turned,

248
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.360
I turned a 42 on Friday in America.
Yeah,

249
00:14:42.361 --> 00:14:45.830
you look great.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Considering how much both of us drink.
I mean,

250
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.370
yeah,
we're both in good shape too.
I know,
I know.

251
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.540
This is the sucker digs podcasts.

252
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.160
<v 1>So anyways,
uh,
before we get into your big win,
cause I really,</v>

253
00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:01.640
cause I gotta be honest with you,
I actually as a spouse,

254
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:04.790
I'm old enough to remember when all the Boston team sucked except for the

255
00:15:04.791 --> 00:15:07.880
Celtics in the 80s.
But then Len bias died and Reggie Lewis,

256
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.830
Diana was just fucking over.
Um,
I,

257
00:15:11.831 --> 00:15:15.650
I remember what it felt like the first time.
So I was actually,

258
00:15:15.651 --> 00:15:19.750
when the Patriots were not looking good to me.
Okay.
You know,

259
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.480
when we played the Steelers and we had the game won and we let up that 90,

260
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:28.040
we let up 90 yards on a screen pass and then the first year they want,

261
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.880
no,
this year,
this year,
this year in December we did that.
Oh,

262
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:35.150
against the playoff team.
And then they threw a touchdown to win the game.

263
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:39.290
But the NFL now is like,
oh,
when he had the ball,
did he really have the ball?

264
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.370
So it's not a catch.
But that was,

265
00:15:40.371 --> 00:15:43.910
that game was a fucking lost and that gave us home field advantage and that

266
00:15:43.911 --> 00:15:47.690
helped us fucking go the simple go to Superbowl.
Yeah.
So here was the thing,
my,

267
00:15:47.691 --> 00:15:50.660
I was kind of watching you guys.
Yeah.
Cause I was just going right,

268
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.650
who am I gonna root for?
I was like,

269
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:53.630
oh la rams would be cool if they got something.

270
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.110
The fucking eagles would be cool cause they never won out.
So here's the thing,

271
00:15:57.111 --> 00:16:01.460
if my team is in fucking in it,
I'm going to root for the team.
That is all,

272
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:04.760
there you go.
I'm going to do it.
I'm not a dick.
I didn't tell you I'm not a dick.

273
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.290
All right.
So,
but you know,

274
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:08.570
if it's the Yankees fuck the Yankees and if it's the cadence,

275
00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:11.810
fuck the planes and if it's a Lakers,
fuck the Lakers.
But other than that,

276
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.430
I've got to ask you why,
why are they Canadians?
Oh Bruins Canadians is okay.

277
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.950
Used to be a huge rivalry.
And what happens is,

278
00:16:18.951 --> 00:16:22.970
is one team never wins it and then the other team always wins it.
And then,

279
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.720
then what happens is then you win it and that's the end of the movie.

280
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.410
Then the credits are rolling like they tried to make like the red sox Yankees

281
00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:33.320
thing.
It's not the same.
No,
it's over and it's Kinda like,

282
00:16:33.321 --> 00:16:36.440
you know when they make the sequel but the star in the movie doesn't sign on to

283
00:16:36.441 --> 00:16:39.470
do it again.
Yeah.
Or bike back in the day when like a movie,

284
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:44.340
like Major League too.
Without Wesley Snipes.
They took Omar Epps,
slashed all.

285
00:16:44.341 --> 00:16:46.690
He was a,
okay.
There you go.
There you go.
There you go.

286
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.610
Well I would say at Major League without Charlie Sheen.
Yeah.
Okay.

287
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.760
This third one then.
Okay.
The third load or jaws,

288
00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:57.170
three d jobs three just to the second Spielberg goes,
Nah,
I'm not doing it.

289
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.040
It just became a,
became a good lay.
It

290
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.570
was that the one,
what was the one where the sharks started roaring?

291
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:07.790
That was the third one,
right?

292
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.340
It was going like [inaudible] is coming out with the one.

293
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.670
The fourth one is one that's bad.
Okay.
That's bad.
Aaron,
you knew that.

294
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:17.300
That's hilarious.
He just,
he was so immediate with the four.
I was like,

295
00:17:17.301 --> 00:17:18.650
that's why that's so fucking funny.

296
00:17:18.651 --> 00:17:21.930
Everybody looks at Shark Nedo like it's this worst thing ever.
It's like,
no,

297
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.580
do the groundwork had been laid.
But I like that movies.

298
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:30.740
But let's get back to this world.
I,
so I was going to sit there and you know,

299
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.480
you know,
I've got a lot of friends yourself.

300
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.990
Like I have a good half dozen people that I know that are from Philly.
You know,

301
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.600
I,
there's a lot of cool chicks and Philly to shake.

302
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.690
The women will fill your cool.
Yeah.
So I wasn't going to be that fucking,

303
00:17:44.691 --> 00:17:46.820
you know,
asshole.
So anyways,

304
00:17:46.821 --> 00:17:51.300
so you guys beat us and now you know the deal,
you lose a big game like that.

305
00:17:51.301 --> 00:17:54.660
You go on radio silence.
I'm not going on fucking the Internet.

306
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.940
I mean I kind of still have to because of the podcast,

307
00:17:56.941 --> 00:17:59.550
but I'm not going to watch ESPN so I didn't get to see you guys.

308
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:01.440
My favorite thing ever is,

309
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.850
is fucking grown men crying over sports is the funniest.

310
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.700
Like that Eagle's fan who called them with Carson Wentz went down.

311
00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:09.534
Did you hear that?

312
00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.940
<v 0>I didn't see that one [inaudible] going to happen for us,
man.</v>

313
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:15.700
<v 1>He was,
the funny thing is the sports casting,
it's like freaked out.
He's like,</v>

314
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.140
Hey,
he's like,
buddy,
you're crying.
He's like,
oh,
well we'll win it next year,
man.

315
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.000
Relaxed.
So flight.
Did you see the guy
who's waiting at the fence

316
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.760
<v 0>when they won the Superbowl and when they're landing just to watch?</v>

317
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:28.320
He was crying.

318
00:18:28.321 --> 00:18:33.180
He was like a 54 year old black dude just sobbing.
Yeah.

319
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.290
Why sobbing?
He's just like my whole fucking life.

320
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.850
My whole fucking life everywhere.
And here's the,

321
00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.120
that Patriots Kinda got me hurts.
Like way less now.
They kinda got me.

322
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:48.680
<v 1>That hurts way less now knowing that somebody's an eagles fan ended up being</v>

323
00:18:48.681 --> 00:18:51.330
that fucking happen.
Come on,
man.
We fucking,

324
00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.460
<v 0>we're trying to with drowning and rings over here,
Kevin.
But here,</v>

325
00:18:54.461 --> 00:18:56.930
here's the thing.
Your first one,
you know,
you know

326
00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.950
<v 1>game.
Oh,
shut the fuck up.
People were losing it.
Oh No,
no,
no.</v>

327
00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.630
Everybody like we were in the exact opposite end zone.
Uh,

328
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.550
and he like kicked the field goal.

329
00:19:07.551 --> 00:19:10.970
And I remember I put my hands out like I was holding back a crowd on Beatlemania

330
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:14.060
and my role cause my brother and dad when they was like,
oh fuck,
oh fuck.

331
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.710
And it went through and it just,
I,
I couldn't believe it when I went through,

332
00:19:18.711 --> 00:19:21.170
then I saw the confetti and all of a sudden,

333
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.850
next thing I knew I was on the ground,

334
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:27.740
what it just a whole section just tackled each other.
Oh that's fucking insane.

335
00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:28.340
This fuck.

336
00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.800
And then I was worried about my dad because I was saying to my dad and he was

337
00:19:30.801 --> 00:19:33.230
like in his sixties at the time and he got up and he just,

338
00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.970
he couldn't fucking believe it.
Right.

339
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.770
And I looked over and there was one guy still standing up and he was just

340
00:19:39.771 --> 00:19:42.890
standing there and I looked over and he was for some reason staring at me,

341
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.490
<v 0>he just had tears in his eye and eye eyes kind of locked.
I had to like,</v>

342
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.410
oh I hit it,
go

343
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:49.660
<v 1>away.
Like dude,
what the fuck?</v>

344
00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.050
And I remember walking out of the stadium like just cause I,

345
00:19:54.051 --> 00:19:56.350
I went to the one week when we lost to the packers,

346
00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.250
so I know what that feeling feels like.
And then when that one it,

347
00:20:00.251 --> 00:20:04.960
but that wasn't close though.
That one.
It was until the opening of the half.

348
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.100
So to have two.

349
00:20:06.101 --> 00:20:10.960
So I basically had faith through fucking 18 and a half games.
So yeah,

350
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.823
it was close.

351
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.780
And then they kicked the fucking ball off and Tyrone Wheatley is out on,

352
00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.010
that was his name.
Desmond Howard.
I know,
I know.

353
00:20:18.011 --> 00:20:22.750
It was a kicker to win a fucking MEP,
a super kick returner kick returner.

354
00:20:22.751 --> 00:20:26.610
Yeah.
So he ran the fucking thing back right at us.
That's,

355
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.510
I might've been in the same end zone.
I Dunno.
I both times I had,

356
00:20:29.511 --> 00:20:32.590
I had upper deck end zone seats.
So then when we want it,

357
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:35.530
I was thinking like every time the Patriots go,

358
00:20:35.531 --> 00:20:38.560
I'm going at such a great experience.
So the next time we played,

359
00:20:38.561 --> 00:20:41.740
I believe you were playing the panthers and I was going to go,

360
00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:43.450
but it was on Sunday obviously.

361
00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:48.190
And then that Monday we were shooting the world series of dice sketch in the

362
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.220
morning

363
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.260
<v 0>for a Chappelle show.
Okay.</v>

364
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:53.830
So I couldn't go and I went there and that's the first time I met Charlie Murphy

365
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.660
,
rest his soul.
And uh,

366
00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.660
I remember being pissed that I was psyched to have the acting work.

367
00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.850
Obviously it's like to be on the Chappelle show,
but I was like,
fuck man,

368
00:21:00.851 --> 00:21:01.870
I really wanted to go to that game.

369
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.700
But I remember when the game was over and I was in my apartment,
we won.

370
00:21:06.701 --> 00:21:11.200
I was psyched that I still had two grand in my pocket.
I was like,

371
00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:16.090
wait a minute,
this is kind of fucking cool.
So then I was just like,
yeah,

372
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:19.450
I don't need to go.
I saw the first one ever.

373
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.690
Why am I going to go there and use up a ticket somebody else could have.

374
00:21:22.691 --> 00:21:25.450
And like someday,
you know,
if I have a kid now I have a kid.

375
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.740
If she ever wants to go,
I'll take her and I'll do that.
But other than that,

376
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.910
you know,
I'm on the road all the time.
Did you,

377
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.010
you obviously get the feeling.
I don't,

378
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:40.170
I don't know if I'd be like if I was at the Superbowl,
my buddies went,
uh,

379
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.160
they lost it.
They lost their minds.

380
00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:45.940
But they actually came back immediately and watched the game cause they said

381
00:21:45.941 --> 00:21:49.690
they couldn't really believe it.
Yeah.
They call the leave at one or two.

382
00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:52.060
They didn't really see what was going on.
Well,

383
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:55.510
you don't get the analysis in the breakdown and all of that.
Let me ask you this.

384
00:21:55.511 --> 00:21:59.950
When,
when Brady fumbles the ball and you guys recover,
man,
dude,

385
00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:03.550
what did you do dude?
But by the way,
are you thinking like,
fuck,

386
00:22:03.551 --> 00:22:07.030
he's going to drive down the field,
we're going to lose?
No,
no,
no,
no.
I never,

387
00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:11.020
this is just crazy.
Normally with all the egos teams,
I'm like,
ah,

388
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.640
they don't got it right that we're stomach feeling.
But this team,

389
00:22:15.641 --> 00:22:18.220
it was just this,
this year and I saw destiny.

390
00:22:18.221 --> 00:22:21.220
They lost their fucking quarterback.
I'm getting misty eyed thinking about it,

391
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.940
but then I was like,
ah,
it's not about Tom,
it's about the eagles.

392
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.220
That's how it felt this year about this team.

393
00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:31.420
So when I didn't like how you guys all ran out as a team and everybody will show

394
00:22:31.421 --> 00:22:35.560
the wins like we've been doing that you stole I fucking by.

395
00:22:35.561 --> 00:22:38.690
That was our thing.
By the way.
I think it's stupid.
Well,

396
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.520
when you guys did it to now I think is stupid.

397
00:22:42.521 --> 00:22:47.500
I love the intros.
I can't miss.
It was like,
if I got to tell you,

398
00:22:47.501 --> 00:22:49.180
dude,
we went,
we've,
we've gone,

399
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.540
we've gone five and three doing it that way and we've been to eight of them.

400
00:22:52.541 --> 00:22:57.490
So you might want to keep doing that.
No one else was driving me nuts.

401
00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.030
Or is Chris Collins with flicker flipping out about that trick where,

402
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.830
<v 2>well,
one of the most unbelievable fucking thing.
It's like,</v>

403
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.110
don't we just ran that fucking plate.
But

404
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.460
<v 0>here's the thing I saw,
I saw that clip and you,
uh,</v>

405
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.240
when you were calling you said,
oh,
we should tell would have laid out.

406
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.450
I wish he caught it and the only reason cause I wanted to get,

407
00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:17.780
and I wanted him to get hit.
Oh,
you just,
just like,
can I be honest with you?
Yeah.

408
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:22.180
That guy.
Every fucking super bowl has driven us down for the wind.
Everyone,

409
00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:22.500
you know,

410
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.400
and I actually looked at all the super bowls and I would say that we very easily

411
00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.670
could have been seven and one and the one game we should have lost was the

412
00:23:30.671 --> 00:23:34.750
Seattle gets.
Yeah.
Just given it to Marshawn lynch,
both giants games.

413
00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:37.240
We had Brandon Welker boom.

414
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:41.350
First down over a Satay Sam most intercepts the fucking ball that hits them at

415
00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:45.460
both hands.
Yeah,
we got that one.
But that assate Samuel.
But this eagle's one

416
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.490
<v 1>minded.
I was pretty fucking John by the end of it,
by the end of the game.</v>

417
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.700
And I just,
I'll tell you,
I'll tell you,
I never felt good about this.

418
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.820
I'd never felt good about the team or the game going in.
I said,

419
00:23:55.821 --> 00:23:59.210
I believe I sent every podcast,
take the eagles in the points and the points.
Yes,

420
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:04.130
yes.
Yeah.
And I thought you guys,
I has had an unbelievable defense.
I'm like,

421
00:24:04.131 --> 00:24:06.260
these guys,
this is looking like the fucking giants do.

422
00:24:06.261 --> 00:24:09.830
Where was the defects in that game?
It was like a fucking pro bowl,
by the way.

423
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.310
I've watched the game four times afterwards just to watch it.

424
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.940
Only Tom could have done that against that defense.

425
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:21.290
You know what's funny is I was watching some of those fucking passes and how,

426
00:24:21.291 --> 00:24:24.620
how he got out of the pocket.
Only Tom could have done that.

427
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.660
Well against that defense because most of the most lie,
most I'll have to wine.

428
00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.550
I'll have to watch it again because I didn't think you guys do and I thought

429
00:24:31.551 --> 00:24:33.170
both quarterback's head like all day.

430
00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:36.530
I don't think you've really got to break fucking nick falls had all day.

431
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.910
Tom got hit like 12 times,
but your line was better than most.

432
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.390
Yeah.
We just didn't have a TV.
I tell Ya,
I,

433
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:50.240
I would never question our coaching staff of the Melcor.
Anytime we do that,

434
00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:53.610
I'm at that time Wes Welker like made all when,
when,
uh,
uh,

435
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:58.220
what's his face find out he had the foot fetish.
Rex Ryan so welcomed us.

436
00:24:58.221 --> 00:25:01.550
This whole interview,
like sort of giving him shit going,
you know,
hey,

437
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:03.770
we're just a,
you know,
you're playing the jets.
What?
He says,
yeah,

438
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:08.270
we're gonna put our best foot forward.
That,
you know?
Yeah.

439
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:12.770
It was funny.
And then they kept him out for the first court.
Anytime we do that,

440
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.020
I don't know if we've probably done that other times,

441
00:25:15.021 --> 00:25:16.700
but it just reminded me of that game.
Be Like,
oh,

442
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:20.420
we're fucking with the chemistry here,
but,
but I'm a stand up comedian Kevin.

443
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.870
I'm not a fucking offensive coordinator.
So what our defensive coordinator,

444
00:25:23.871 --> 00:25:28.360
what do I know?
But I watched that game four more times.
Like I said,
oh,

445
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.180
so that I still have the fucking Seattle and the Atlantic.

446
00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.210
You still still on my fuck.
I still have it.
I bought and I got the thing.

447
00:25:35.211 --> 00:25:38.270
Never erase them.
My wife's like,
you never going to watch.
She's like,
yeah,

448
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.350
you are.
Yeah,

449
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.650
you will when you're bored or you want to get your fuck his spirits on.

450
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.190
Has she goes to bed early?
Dude,
I just say,
I'm never going to watch this.

451
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:50.810
I just take the highlights of all 51 foot.
It's like this five losses in there.

452
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.420
Well for losses.
Now we've got a fifth one and I'm still going to watch those.
No,

453
00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.730
it's,
it's the best buy.
I,
I'm trying to the Superbowl 20,
we were up three,

454
00:25:58.731 --> 00:26:02.600
nothing against the 46 defense.
Tony Franklin,
speaking of feet,

455
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.830
his bare feet came out and kick one.
And I'm like,
yeah,
you know,
I don't know.

456
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.040
There's a talk and all this shit.
Or two.

457
00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:12.710
That was the most dominant defense that I ever saw.
Here's a good one.

458
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:18.190
Superbowl six Superbowls six is the Dallas cowboys in the Miami Dolphins.

459
00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:20.870
What's interesting is his office,

460
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.730
Tom Landry and Don Shula to legendary coaches.
But when that game went down,

461
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:30.020
they were both considered losers and like one of them is finally going to get

462
00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:31.880
the monkey off the back.
Dallas had the thing,

463
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:35.570
they could never win the big one and they'd only been around since 1960 but they

464
00:26:35.571 --> 00:26:39.650
lost the ice bowl up in green bay.
I know,
dude,
I'm a fucking nerd.

465
00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.890
And then the year before they played the colts,

466
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.710
they got there again and they fucking lawsuit Colton a really messy game.

467
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.580
And then Don Shula,
his big thing was,
uh,
he was,

468
00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.730
when he was coaching the 69 colts that lost to the jets,

469
00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.820
the first NFL team to lose to an AFL team was a major embarrassment and a,

470
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.310
that ended his career there.
And then he went over to the dolphins.

471
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.220
Wasn't that the undefeated season?
No,
no.
They went,

472
00:27:05.221 --> 00:27:08.490
they went three years in a row,
one,
one of a,

473
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:10.350
I think two teams to ever go through years in a row.

474
00:27:10.351 --> 00:27:14.150
And only one has ever gone four years in a row.
And that's the,
the bills,
uh,

475
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:18.900
they lost to the cowboys and then the next year they beat the,

476
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:22.710
uh,
they beat the red Thea.
They beat the Redskins.
That was the undefeated year.

477
00:27:22.711 --> 00:27:25.260
That was the year that they hadn't before.
There was 14 to nothing.

478
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.150
And they would line it up to kick a field goal.

479
00:27:27.151 --> 00:27:28.590
This is how much of the NFL has changed.

480
00:27:28.591 --> 00:27:31.840
It's like there's like two minutes left in the third quarter,
and if,

481
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.230
if this thing goes through,
they like the gut announcers are going,

482
00:27:34.231 --> 00:27:36.930
this game's over.
It's in the third quarter.
Yeah.

483
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:38.500
Cause no one's going to score that cuts through it.

484
00:27:38.501 --> 00:27:42.240
All I did was fucking run cause they were like greasy was four for four in the

485
00:27:42.241 --> 00:27:43.140
first quarter.

486
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.040
<v 0>It's funny.
Do you know,
I I love,</v>

487
00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:49.770
I love the fact that back then how much cocaine those guys did.
Do you,

488
00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:54.730
did you ever see the cocaine cowboys and,
uh,
the one that's not a movie,

489
00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.420
it was a documentary.
It was about,
you know,
the cocaine chancellor.

490
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.300
What the cocaine in the Superbowl or wasn't it about cocaine trafficking,

491
00:28:01.301 --> 00:28:02.170
cocaine trafficking.

492
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.220
They tell the story about the Steelers and the dolphins and the AFC championship

493
00:28:06.221 --> 00:28:08.770
game or sealers in the Super Bowl in Miami.

494
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:14.190
That entire old line went out the night before and the guy gave them all the

495
00:28:14.801 --> 00:28:17.120
coke.
They wanted up to like four more.

496
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.250
So a jail bird trying to get into a fucking documentary,
right?
No,
no,
he was,

497
00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.240
he was the main guy.

498
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.080
<v 1>Well,
here's the thing though.
They also,
uh,</v>

499
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.040
like the medical industry,
whatever you call them,

500
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:33.860
said cocaine is no more addicting than coffee or caffeine.
Yeah.

501
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.880
So that's what they initially said.
If you ever want to read,
uh,

502
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:39.630
an unbelievable book,
read the Hollywood Henderson.

503
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.800
He was basically the Lawrence Taylor before Lawrence Taylor and he got crazy on

504
00:28:43.801 --> 00:28:44.071
drugs.

505
00:28:44.071 --> 00:28:46.980
And the reason why Lawrence Taylor looks like he just fell out of the sky and no

506
00:28:46.981 --> 00:28:50.220
one ever played the game like that is because Hollywood Henderson messed up his

507
00:28:50.221 --> 00:28:53.820
career so bad.
But there's highlights of that guy.
That guy was unbelievable.

508
00:28:53.821 --> 00:28:58.740
In fact,
I believe Super Bowl 10,
1976 when he played,

509
00:28:58.741 --> 00:29:02.880
when the cowboys played the Steelers,
they kicked the ball off.

510
00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:07.470
He's a linebacker.
They had him return it and he ran it like 55 fucking yards.

511
00:29:07.471 --> 00:29:11.190
The only person who stopped and was Roy Cherrella dove to knock them out of

512
00:29:11.191 --> 00:29:15.300
bounds and had his ribs exposed and Henderson's knees hit him in the ribs and it

513
00:29:15.301 --> 00:29:17.430
fucked him up.
And it caused darella.

514
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:21.950
This really interesting caused him to fuck up a couple of kicks in.

515
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:26.220
So that was a big thing for the cowboys,
but they fucked up.
Cause when one,

516
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.990
the second miss or something or the first or second Miss Cliff Harris from the

517
00:29:30.991 --> 00:29:35.340
cowboys gets in,
you're Roy his face going like,
hey,
you fucked up buddy.

518
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:36.503
And uh,

519
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:40.690
Jack Lambert was on the field and just picked fucking cliff Harris up like a rag

520
00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.830
doll and throw him under the ground.
Like basically it's amazing.
Yeah.

521
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:46.570
And didn't get a penalty.
There's another thing too,

522
00:29:46.571 --> 00:29:50.230
when you watch those old that back to,
hey,
knock it off fellows.
Yeah,

523
00:29:50.231 --> 00:29:53.170
they didn't give a fuck.
Telmate's they bought at Sears.

524
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.490
Dawkins is videos of him.
Suplex and guys,
well,
here's the thing.

525
00:29:57.491 --> 00:30:01.630
The cowboys had that fucking game one in the first half.

526
00:30:01.631 --> 00:30:04.210
They call all these trick plays.
They were loose.
They were throwing the ball,

527
00:30:04.211 --> 00:30:07.720
doing all that.
They got in the second half.
They played fucking Marty Ball.

528
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.070
And I'm telling you,
man,

529
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:13.570
no fucking sport fucks you more when you play.

530
00:30:13.571 --> 00:30:16.240
Not to lose than football.
I don't know what it is.
I is,

531
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:21.220
the Falcons are doing a great,
and granted Tom Played fucking lights out,

532
00:30:21.221 --> 00:30:25.050
but you know how to do.
That's a,
that's a colossal,
it's a cops.
That's,

533
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:29.320
it collapsed.
I mean,
you know more about football history.
I'm more recent,
but uh,

534
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:32.290
I don't know shit about football.
I've just watched a lot of video on it.

535
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:36.350
Like I watch Superbowl highlights the way Tom Brady actually watches to him.

536
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.400
By the way,
I'm a film,
I don't want it.
Here's the,

537
00:30:39.401 --> 00:30:42.190
I like Carson Wentz and you must love Tom Brady.

538
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.850
I don't want to see their personal life.
I don't,
I could give is no,

539
00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.060
I'm not built that way.
I don't like pre or post game analysis.
Yeah.

540
00:30:49.061 --> 00:30:51.070
I don't like any of that shit.
I don't want,
I don't want,

541
00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:54.400
as I sit here talking about the girl,
no,
but I don't want to human moments.

542
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.890
I don't,
this is how fuck,
I don't want to see him as human.

543
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.410
I just want to see them as athletes.
Here's the thing.

544
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.210
I think they're entitled to their privacy.

545
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:06.310
I think that you should be able to go out as an NFL quarterback and if you want

546
00:31:06.311 --> 00:31:10.780
to go out and do some blow in it in a titty bar.
Yeah.

547
00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:14.020
Here's this one.
I can't stand about fucking people today with their phones.

548
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:18.970
If they saw the local quarterback doing blow in a titty bar,

549
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:22.570
he was fucked.
Rather than thinking,
well shit,
I'm here to,

550
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:28.060
you know what I mean?
No.
They will literally filmed the fucking guys who go,

551
00:31:28.061 --> 00:31:31.540
oh my God,
I can't believe there's a starting quarterback.
It's like,

552
00:31:31.541 --> 00:31:34.980
what do you do?
You work with heavy machinery.
Yeah,
it was,

553
00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:36.430
what the fuck do you do?
You're fucked.

554
00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.570
You're in the titty bar too and like the whole like,

555
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.250
just let somebody go out,

556
00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.610
have a good fucking to shut the fuck ups like this.

557
00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.350
Everybody telling on everybody just,

558
00:31:47.351 --> 00:31:50.470
they're just so fucking mad being Jimmy John's managers and shit.

559
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.710
It's just like the guy.

560
00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.550
If you can be a Jimmy John's manager and you can have a hell of a fucking,

561
00:31:54.551 --> 00:31:56.320
exactly.
You could tell a week,

562
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:59.380
you could have a fucking weekend that would make Tom Brady be like,

563
00:31:59.381 --> 00:32:03.250
get the fuck outta here.
Well,
Tom doesn't do that.
Tom's that doing that to me.

564
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:06.670
He's not going out and getting fucking nuts.
No,
I'm not saying what I'm saying.

565
00:32:06.671 --> 00:32:09.100
He should be able to,
oh,
I have a second.
You said that.

566
00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:12.070
All I thought about was Ken Stabler.
I heard this great story.

567
00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.680
He used to play for the Oakland Raiders,
uh,

568
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:16.510
before that horrific trade where they got Dan,

569
00:32:16.511 --> 00:32:18.040
pastor Ed and they switched and both,

570
00:32:18.041 --> 00:32:21.820
and he became an oiler and finished up at the saints I believe.
And uh,

571
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.910
he farts fullest.
That's today.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
I,

572
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:28.450
that's all I did was looking football cards back then.
So it's,

573
00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:31.360
coach was giving them shit one time cause he went up booze in the night before.

574
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.083
He's just like,
it went to fuck.

575
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:36.250
He going out partying the night before you have a game.
He just goes coach,

576
00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.160
he goes,
how many hours sleep and you need to go play a couple hours football.

577
00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:46.820
<v 0>That's,
that's awesome.
And there's nothing to say.
You're right.
You're right.</v>

578
00:32:46.821 --> 00:32:49.440
Doing those guys used to go out there and they would just fucking sling it like

579
00:32:49.441 --> 00:32:53.420
I,
I don't know.
So anyways,
um,
real quick.

580
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:57.030
How far into this hour?
Half Hour.
Fuck.

581
00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.490
At some point I've got to read some advertising.

582
00:32:58.491 --> 00:33:02.060
So when they finally fucking winning.
Are you with other eagles fans?

583
00:33:02.061 --> 00:33:05.480
Are you crying?
He attacks you in stunned silence by yourself.

584
00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.190
Where'd you watch the game?
I'd ever,

585
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:09.800
do you remember that casino we played in San Diego?

586
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:14.630
We flew in a helicopter is north.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
you were there.

587
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:18.440
So we were there.
The girl,
I'm dating a girl,
I'm saying,
the lady friend,

588
00:33:18.441 --> 00:33:21.290
she's like,
I know you're not going to want to be around anyone,

589
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:25.520
so I'll get your old tail.
So she got us a hotel and then she's like,

590
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:30.050
I want to sit by the pool.
So
Realistic Cabana with the TV.

591
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:34.490
It was fucking awesome.
We had a whole entire Cabana just herself.
I don't know,

592
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.690
putting pressure on the relationship,
but you've got to marry that girl.

593
00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:42.070
I couldn't believe it.
She goes,
she's a Steelers fan.
She loves softball too.

594
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.650
But she goes,
I get it.
She goes,
this is your fucking day,
dude.
She's like,

595
00:33:45.651 --> 00:33:49.640
I understand.
I know I could.
How many times have you said to a woman,
I get it.

596
00:33:49.641 --> 00:33:53.120
And you were right and you made their day.
No,
I'm telling you what she,

597
00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.810
when I said to assign a woman that gets a guy,
totally said to her,
I go,

598
00:33:56.811 --> 00:34:01.760
you can totally buy my love.
I'm all,
I'm all for it.
So I never daydream.

599
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:06.120
Classic Guy.
She does something great.
Something sweet.
I can say ish,

600
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:10.010
maybe a little bit,
little bit.
So I,
I don't every day drink.

601
00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:13.340
That's one of the reasons why the Rosebowl thing is out the window.
Cause I,

602
00:34:13.341 --> 00:34:16.970
I'll give you see me when I'm drunk.
Do you think that's why you've never been?

603
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:21.050
What do you made?
Because the reason they're actually,
I'm going to come clean.

604
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:25.190
Okay.
We've never had you there.
Well,
the first couple of years.

605
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.030
No,
you've never been there?
No,
no.
I'm saying the first couple of years you say,

606
00:34:29.031 --> 00:34:32.720
hey come.
I said,
I don't think I got to know you better.
I told you.

607
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:37.730
And then we had a talk,
me and Bartner,
we're like,
listen,
we love Shea,

608
00:34:37.731 --> 00:34:41.110
but the year we bring Shea is the year we get kicked out in the first quarter.

609
00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:45.920
And I emit,
I told you guys that I even told far lane I go bar in it.

610
00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:51.350
And if you,
if I come and I'm start drinking at 10,
oh it's done 10,

611
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:56.270
seven,
we get down,
it starts,
how the fuck do you mean go to the game?

612
00:34:56.270 --> 00:35:00.110
I'm always blown too.
I literally drink,
pass out,

613
00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.950
wake up with a hangover and recover before the game even starts.

614
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:06.620
I still can't believe its Sunday.
That's amazing.

615
00:35:06.621 --> 00:35:10.040
I always fall asleep on when lie had light.
Always make some fucking insane.

616
00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.110
Uh,
like for,
for the,
for the main course.
I never make it to the main course.

617
00:35:15.111 --> 00:35:17.270
I always wake up,
I always wake up,
it's already over.

618
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:18.800
I mean one year I was so shit faced.

619
00:35:18.801 --> 00:35:21.920
I actually had the afternoon his cigar first and then all of a sudden he brought

620
00:35:21.921 --> 00:35:24.930
over like a pork shoulder and I was smoking a cigar shifts.

621
00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:30.230
I'd eat pork shoulder with my hands and occasionally I would look up and see

622
00:35:30.231 --> 00:35:33.950
families walking by with children.
Oh my God.
I was just like,
wow man.

623
00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.740
I remember going to Sullivan Stadium back in the day and seeing guys like me.

624
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.080
That's amazing.
Oh real quick.
So I got wasted by yourself.
Why?

625
00:35:42.081 --> 00:35:45.860
What are you drinking?
Jameson soda all the time.
James and soda.

626
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:49.640
And she's facing the room.
The bed still made,
right?
Oh No,
no,

627
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.090
I'll come back and seeing the Cabana.
Oh the companion.

628
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.970
That's a banner with no shirt,
just shorts,
no shoes,

629
00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.460
a hat and just a drink in my left hand.

630
00:35:58.461 --> 00:36:02.330
And then there's other command and next to us was all patriots fans.

631
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:07.130
They were all like big white dudes.
Oh God.
But they were,
they were great.

632
00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:11.960
They were like nice guys.
Cause I,
I became the loud one.
Obviously I became nuts.

633
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:13.970
So there's one guy who was like,
this big fat,

634
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:18.380
why do the beer every time you walk by the Taiko go pass?
I go,
Eh,

635
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:23.630
I couldn't even speak.
I was just so angry.
I'm like,
Eh.

636
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:27.350
So at the end of it.
Well,
he's being an account.
Yeah,
I know he's been a cut,

637
00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:30.290
but he actually came up fat white country.
Yes,
exactly.

638
00:36:30.291 --> 00:36:33.350
But he came over and he was really cool.

639
00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:37.580
He shook my hand and congratulated me.
But by the end of the game,
dude,

640
00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:42.140
I lost it.
I started throwing the,
flip it over the lounge chairs.
Oh God.
Yeah.

641
00:36:42.141 --> 00:36:46.160
You know why?
Cause I was just fucking excited that that's how I get,

642
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:47.570
so I just started flipping over.

643
00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:52.040
<v 1>Do you think that that eagles fans are really that bad or the rep was there so</v>

644
00:36:52.041 --> 00:36:54.500
now they just try to find the guy eating horse shit.

645
00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.730
You gotta Admit Horse Shit's pretty big.
That's all fuck is

646
00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.400
<v 0>sports fans are bad.
The whole line,</v>

647
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:05.580
<v 1>those fans are pedestrian compared to out here.
We'll clue fans.
Dude.
You fucking,</v>

648
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.930
you can get killed out here.

649
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:10.290
A guy got killed at a Dodgers game doing a gut feels by,

650
00:37:10.291 --> 00:37:12.450
they'll throw full beers that year.
They'll dump went over your head.

651
00:37:12.451 --> 00:37:14.160
You want to get to a fist fight.
They'll do that.

652
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.440
A guy built like a farm animal shit.

653
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:20.610
Evidently stab at a Raiders preseason game like greatest 40.

654
00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:21.733
Niners fuck cares.

655
00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:25.030
<v 0>I'm so sick of the fucking snowball is Santa</v>

656
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.590
<v 1>the fuck.
You know,
and I was making fun of who gives a full time?</v>

657
00:37:27.591 --> 00:37:30.650
You guys are in a big game,
like the big cheesy thing.

658
00:37:30.651 --> 00:37:34.610
Whenever Boston is in a big game,
uh,
what they talk about is they'll talk about,

659
00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.170
um,
you know,

660
00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.620
they'll show like fucking the Paul revere statue or something in north end.

661
00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.160
All this shit that nobody from Boston ever went to unless you went on some field

662
00:37:43.161 --> 00:37:43.720
trip that you've,

663
00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.800
that you've probably psyched as a kid because you didn't have to go to school.

664
00:37:45.801 --> 00:37:50.801
The freedom trail and the foliage and fucking some lobster fishermen Tyna

665
00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.620
sailor's knot.
I don't even know why I didn't get to what they do.
You guys,

666
00:37:54.621 --> 00:37:57.080
it's always,
ah,
you know what it is?

667
00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:02.750
Rocky statue Philly cheese steaks.
Yes.
No Buy Sienna.
I'm like,

668
00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:06.890
did you just say Pennsylvania is a fucking young,
that's Tyler.
Go to Philly.

669
00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.330
Next time I go to Philly,

670
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.690
I'm going to go on one of those fucking cheese steak places.

671
00:38:11.691 --> 00:38:15.290
I'm going to say this.
Hello?
I would like a Philadelphia cream,

672
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:19.430
a Philly Philadelphia cheese steak sandwich with peppers and onions and

673
00:38:19.431 --> 00:38:21.460
provolone cheese.
Please.
Sure.

674
00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.480
I'm so sick of them telling me how to you guys you'll be a Wiz with,

675
00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:29.390
I'm not saying that his so soup.
I have legal tender.

676
00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:34.390
Make me a fucking sandwich.
It's the only city that's like,
oh,

677
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:38.290
in Boston you want some clam chowder and you gotta go so stupid.
I'm like,

678
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.400
I don't care.
I love Philly cheese steaks.
I'm from Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania.

679
00:38:42.401 --> 00:38:46.000
I love him,
but I don't love him enough to say this is what I'm about.

680
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:50.440
I'm not a fucking Hoagie.
Can I tell you something to,
Oh God,
I hate clam chowder.

681
00:38:50.441 --> 00:38:54.300
Clam chowder tastes like it was in,
you know what it tastes like.
Fixtures.

682
00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:55.690
Nobody's,
you know what he said?
Shit.

683
00:38:55.691 --> 00:38:59.410
That cow's chew one of the in between their three stomachs and they just Yak and

684
00:38:59.411 --> 00:39:03.430
a ball.
That's what the fuck it tastes like.
You took it to another level.
Uh,

685
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:07.030
I like clam chowder.
Fishes,
fishes to me still seems like it'd be clear

686
00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:10.990
across every part of the ocean.
Would be foggy

687
00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:17.250
there.
Exit clear.
They got clear.
Just I like,

688
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:19.360
I like clam chowder and I don't even like Gnocchi Shit.

689
00:39:19.361 --> 00:39:21.640
I'm like lactose intolerant.
I liked clam chowder.
I,

690
00:39:21.641 --> 00:39:26.350
but I know it's not a big deal like Philly cheese steaks that it's just so

691
00:39:26.351 --> 00:39:31.330
fucking nuts and they show it cooking.
I'm cooking.
It will gain core cut of meat.

692
00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:35.160
I actually,
I liked,
I really like cheese sticks,
but uh,

693
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:40.170
I just hate that whole fucking thing.
You gotta say it this way now?
I don't,
I,

694
00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:43.490
I haven't played affiliated so fucking long.
I don't,
I don't,

695
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:47.350
I've never eaten into any of those places.
All right.
Yeah.
I stay away from home.

696
00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:49.000
I gotta I gotta tell you something.
I got fucking,
you know,

697
00:39:49.001 --> 00:39:52.300
when I got this old truck,
so I listen to fucking am radio.

698
00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:54.520
So it's just a sports talk.
Uh,

699
00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:58.870
somebody's speaking some sort of Korean or like political shit.
Yeah,

700
00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.621
right wing stuff.

701
00:39:59.621 --> 00:40:03.070
So I'm listening to the sports talk and they were talking about that,

702
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.280
whatever that fucking,
whatever our coordinator,
his name is Josh Assam Shit.

703
00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:11.410
He interview annuals,
interviewed for the colts job.
All of that,
all of that shit.

704
00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:13.690
And then he,
then he walks away the last second and then,

705
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:16.720
then they're talking about it.
And this one guy's going like closer.
You know,

706
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.660
there's not an illegal bar.
Uh,
I don't like the way it went down,

707
00:40:19.661 --> 00:40:24.300
but the blah blah,
and this other guy on the show,
he goes
[inaudible] uh,

708
00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:28.180
the patriots,
once again,
bending the rules.
It's like,

709
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.040
you've gotta be shitting me.
It's like they'll,

710
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.430
the level that people didn't pay attention to deflate gate.

711
00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:37.330
It's like what that guy did to us,
if that's all we do.
Back to,

712
00:40:37.331 --> 00:40:39.970
let's just say that was a conspiracy.
Yeah.
Okay.
Josh,

713
00:40:39.971 --> 00:40:43.060
you're going to go in there and even though we're preparing for the Superbowl,

714
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:44.320
fuck all of that,

715
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.310
we're gonna have this big conspiracy and we're going to just waste their fucking

716
00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.900
time if that's all we did to them,

717
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:55.080
he got off easy because it's $1 million and to draft picks over some bullshit.

718
00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:59.620
You guys deserve that.
Why I'm fucking with you.
Yeah.
All right.

719
00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.230
But here's the thing with the open,
you had a point,

720
00:41:02.231 --> 00:41:05.020
I could actually become the piece,
my favorite thing,

721
00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.520
but cherry on top of that story,

722
00:41:06.521 --> 00:41:10.390
the Cherry on top of that story is not that the fucking idiot found deflated

723
00:41:10.391 --> 00:41:11.770
balls on the cold side too.

724
00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:15.130
It's that the fucking guy in the cults that caught the ball,

725
00:41:15.131 --> 00:41:19.140
the initial one that started all that bullshit alleged,
listen,
this.
Yeah,

726
00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:20.560
that guy.
You know what he did in the next year,

727
00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:25.270
the two years within that he tested positive for steroids where it was ESPN

728
00:41:25.271 --> 00:41:30.190
there you still are mad.
You won the Superbowl that year.

729
00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:33.190
Like no,
he didn't.
Gate did.
No,
they

730
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.680
[inaudible] remember we did for four years.

731
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.560
You're talking about the suspension or placate happen and then that.

732
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:44.570
Then the next year like he got his fucking suspended.
Then they went to court,

733
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:45.710
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

734
00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:47.840
and then it got up there and then he got fucking suspects.

735
00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:51.080
It got laughed out of court.
The judge was mad,
you're wasting a fucking time.

736
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:54.710
Then the NFL was blood hurt that we beat them and then they fucking come back

737
00:41:54.711 --> 00:41:56.870
and they go,
art is the NFL Corporation.
Yes.

738
00:41:56.870 --> 00:42:00.260
Is Tom Brady employee of does a corporation,
right?
To suspend an employee.

739
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:03.620
That's how they spread and they found a loophole.
Thani got suspended.

740
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:06.230
I was like three years of shit.
Fair enough.

741
00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:10.190
But we wasted fucking a week of that guy's life and fucked him over and season.

742
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.250
Fuck that guy.
All right,
fair enough.
I'm like,
I don't like the colts.

743
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:19.250
I agree with you,
but you've got a super,
I don't mind cold fans.
[inaudible] fans.

744
00:42:19.251 --> 00:42:20.490
I don't really do we want to work?

745
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:25.160
We want would've got the fucking Superbowl anyways.
Yeah man,
we not,

746
00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:27.740
we did do what?
No,
you don't want.

747
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:31.790
And then the 49 is when I had to spend all that money on a guy who's played five

748
00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:36.020
games.
Oh,
grappa low Jesus Christ.

749
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.350
That,
what are they doing?
What's going to be good?
You know,

750
00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:42.950
he's going to be good grappler.
He's he,

751
00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.850
he looks like he's going to be ah,
dude,
this Benz.

752
00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.380
I'm not saying he's not going to be good,
but dude,

753
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.820
that guy's making more money than like Aaron Rodgers.

754
00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.900
I,
you know,
I do disagree with you.

755
00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.950
Tom Brady would not have played as well if he just gets suspended those first

756
00:43:00.951 --> 00:43:05.150
four games.
Two years ago I listened.
I will say this,

757
00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:10.220
I liked,
uh,
39,
four year old guy getting four games off.
He like,

758
00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:13.010
that's great,
but I don't think it added any more.
He Dude,

759
00:43:13.011 --> 00:43:15.230
he's like psycho driven anyways.

760
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:18.380
My only thing about him is I don't want them to go out like Brett Farve.

761
00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:23.120
I don't cause this whole fucking thing,
Tom versus time.
If he plays these 45,

762
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:25.190
you know,
as long as he's still competitive,

763
00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.340
I just don't want to see him like on the rams,

764
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:33.020
like Joe name of fucking Johnny Unitas wearing a fucking charges uniform.
How's,

765
00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:35.000
he's too proud.
He won't.
I hope he doesn't do that.

766
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:38.910
Why the fuck is he doing this weird reality show?
I don't get it.
What is,

767
00:43:38.911 --> 00:43:41.430
what is I,
I'm not going to pay attention to it,

768
00:43:41.431 --> 00:43:44.360
but that makes me fucking nervous because he never did shit.

769
00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:49.420
Peyton manning did like 400 commercials a year.
I thought that helped us.
Yeah.

770
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:52.280
Because Hayden is kind of like that.
Every guy,
like,

771
00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:56.360
he comes off like a dumb farmer,
Amy and people like Dan fucking Midwest.

772
00:43:56.361 --> 00:44:00.380
I fucking hate.
I can't,
I don't like to cults in general.

773
00:44:00.381 --> 00:44:03.020
I don't want to have to beat the chargers.

774
00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.430
That's what I would have sunk.
Somebody asked me today like,
Hey,
you know,

775
00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.670
where does,
uh,
where does it,
this is just going to be all football talk.

776
00:44:10.671 --> 00:44:13.910
Where does,
where does,
uh,
you know,

777
00:44:13.911 --> 00:44:16.170
Tom Brady having the greatest coach of all time in the,

778
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:21.170
in the brief versus Peyton manning argument.
And that's a fair point.
But,
um,

779
00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.380
I be honest with you,
I actually liked Eli.

780
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:29.420
I would rather have had eli in January.
Yeah.
Eli's a better,

781
00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:32.110
uh,
play off quarterback.
Then Eli,

782
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:37.380
his breath doesn't stink in September or October.
But then when,
you know,

783
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:41.810
do I need him to turn it off?
Turns it on Dan Marino.
Wouldn't you say,
man,

784
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:45.870
he's the greatest regular season quarterback of all time.
Uh,
first of all,

785
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:49.650
Dan Marino gets an unbelievable bad rap.
Okay.

786
00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:53.000
Peyton manning was part of a three headed fucking monster.
All righty.

787
00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:56.280
One that said,
we will know just by Edgerrin James and,
and,
and,

788
00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:59.820
and what's his face there?
Wide Receiver.
Just forgot his fucking name.
Marvin.

789
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.870
Marvin Harrison.
He never had his football card,
so I'll never remember.
All right.

790
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:08.870
Shot to view.
No,
he didn't.
He he legend.
Legend.
Legend.
Legend.

791
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:12.970
Well maybe they,
maybe they ate is horseshit and he was upset.
Um,

792
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:18.390
they fucking,
Dan Marino had no running game and note defense.
Yes.

793
00:45:18.391 --> 00:45:21.680
Great.
His entire career.
What was he supposed to do?
I'll tell you right now,

794
00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:25.800
Tom Brady would not have won a fucking Superbowl with,

795
00:45:25.801 --> 00:45:28.380
with fucking and Don Shula.
Everybody stole all his tricks.

796
00:45:28.381 --> 00:45:32.970
By the time the two they have a read would have thrown easily per 6,000 yards in

797
00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:37.410
today's NFL.
Well,
today's NFL.
Do you like it now?

798
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:38.740
Now I don't like it.

799
00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:43.940
Pay went too far and when I'm liking about watching these first Superbowls is I

800
00:45:45.061 --> 00:45:48.960
like more the running.
I liked the diff defense has had nicknames and stuff.

801
00:45:48.961 --> 00:45:53.820
It was,
it was a meaner game and it was a more strategic game.

802
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.170
And to Paul verse,

803
00:45:55.171 --> 00:45:59.510
he said the funniest fucking shit about that Eagle's patriots super bowl.

804
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:01.380
He's like,
dude,
he goes,
that's the kind,

805
00:46:01.381 --> 00:46:04.000
that's the kind of game you're girlfriend likes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

806
00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:07.200
Like if soccer had that much scoring,
I'd be like,
dude,

807
00:46:07.201 --> 00:46:10.050
that was a great fucking care.
Then all those English guys would be like,

808
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.290
all right mate,
it's fucking belly.

809
00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:13.890
But they wouldn't be able to break down the game as to why it suck.

810
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.740
Everyone keeps telling me what a great game.
Congratulations.

811
00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.430
I'm happy because the Eagles won.
I'm happy.
But it wasn't a,

812
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:25.170
it was a shit show was a great game.
[inaudible] I said it was viewer friendly.

813
00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:30.690
Yeah.
And I have to be honest with you,
that is all those rule changes.

814
00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:34.140
I always blame to your mercy cause I'm a con,
but it's all of them.

815
00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:36.150
It's because they're trying to expand the game.

816
00:46:36.151 --> 00:46:40.230
And you know that they've done studies and you know that offense sells the game.

817
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:44.100
That's why I think MLB look the other way when everyone was all roided up and

818
00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:48.090
they actually exerprise surprise all the owners get to act surprised.
Like,
oh,

819
00:46:48.091 --> 00:46:52.470
we had no fucking idea.
I really like,
we don't know the comics set up partying.

820
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:56.000
Yeah,
the MLB does.
He pay the guy a zillion dollars a fucking year.

821
00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:56.853
You don't know what he's doing,

822
00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:00.430
but it's like the NBA by that game was fucked that,

823
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:02.910
that when they had the strike and they didn't have the world series and all of

824
00:47:02.911 --> 00:47:05.850
that shit,
they needed something to come back.
By the way,

825
00:47:05.851 --> 00:47:08.940
that was a fucking awesome mirror though.
W it was like,
it was fucking,

826
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:12.750
it was fucking amazing.
I remember Washington College,
every lunch,

827
00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:17.250
every other in the cafeteria,
we'd watch the fucking I lights like who I went to.

828
00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:19.450
Like I never,
I went through the same,
uh,

829
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.120
Mark McGuire hit his 27th or 28th home run.

830
00:47:24.121 --> 00:47:28.210
It was down in San Diego on when they're still planting Qualcomm stadium as a

831
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:28.380
chef.

832
00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:31.330
I went there with this Boston Common Dan Smith that we were sat in the upper

833
00:47:31.331 --> 00:47:36.070
deck.
I went fucking McGuire to,
but the place was packed for his,
uh,
for his,

834
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:39.580
when he would take batting practice and the whole place he came up to the plate

835
00:47:39.581 --> 00:47:41.620
for batting practice,
standing ovation.

836
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.500
It was like three quarters phasing for band practice.
Everybody's going us this,

837
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.200
the funniest shit ever.
The first pitch.

838
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:50.290
And he laid down a bunt and everybody boom.

839
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:53.830
And then he laughed and everybody laughed because it was kind of a cool way to

840
00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:56.920
get rid of the stress.
Let me,
I've got to read a couple of,
uh,

841
00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:01.570
advertisements here and then I want to talk about what's going on with
mailboxes.

842

What I'm gonna talk to you about it.

Greg.
He's a nut bag.
Yeah,
he's the best.

845
00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:20.290
Uh,
everyone wants to look as great as their date at a wedding or special event.

846
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:22.390
Now they're talking about wearing a dress.

847
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.960
Trouble is there's no way you want to spend the amount of time or money she's,

848
00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:29.200
she did shopping for outfit.
I can't read out loud.

870
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:52.330
The problem you iceberg is,
here's another one.
Here's another one.

871
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:57.190
Simply safe.
I know this.
I've got some exciting news.

872
00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:02.260
Simply safe home security company I've worked with since there we,

873
00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:07.480
they were a startup.
Who the fuck was this for?
Um,

874
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:11.410
I've watched them transform into that.
Why do they do this?
Okay,
look,

875
00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:15.670
they've transformed into the fastest growing home security company in the nation

876
00:50:15.671 --> 00:50:19.960
protecting over 2 million people while they just released their brand new home

877
00:50:19.961 --> 00:50:24.000
security system.
The all new,
simply safe.
Now this is the shit I'm into.

878
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:26.950
You got to have a home security system at this point,
right?
I don't understand.

879
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:30.890
They do.
You don't understand what they do.
I mean,
well,
I'm glad you asked.

880
00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:35.300
You'd be great on an infomercial.
Wait a minute,

881
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:39.500
but does the x stick to the pan?
Of course not.
Just watch Kevin.

882
00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:42.710
This system has been completely,
completely rebuilt and redesign.

883
00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:47.660
They've added new safeguards to protect against power outages.
Yeah,
down Wifi,

884
00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:50.570
cut landlines,
bats,
hammers and everything in between.

885
00:50:50.571 --> 00:50:53.030
Remember the under Scarface?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No,

886
00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:54.470
he wasn't doing all that blow.

887
00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:58.490
That was a simply safe system and they saw all those fucking people coming over

888
00:50:58.491 --> 00:51:03.020
the wall.
But Tony was too busy partying.
Tony,
what do you want to fuck me,

889
00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:04.490
Tony?
The all new,

890
00:51:04.491 --> 00:51:08.600
simply safe was redesigned to be practically invisible with the powerful sensors

891
00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:12.380
so small,
you'll hardly notice them.
You know who will intruders.

892
00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:15.110
This is what truly remarkable to me.

893
00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.440
Evidently simply safe spent years building the system.

894
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:20.330
They added so much more.

895
00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.990
How weird was that fucking scene that that poor actress had to play?

896
00:51:23.991 --> 00:51:24.920
You want to fuck me?

897
00:51:24.921 --> 00:51:29.540
Tony does hot now I know why you have a private computer for the point,

898
00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:33.320
but you will still get the same.
Fair,
honest price.
24,

899
00:51:33.321 --> 00:51:38.090
seven protection for only 15 bucks a month and there's no contract.
It's smaller,

900
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:40.250
faster and stronger than anything they've built before,

901
00:51:40.251 --> 00:51:45.230
but the supply is very limited.

938
00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:59.460

Wait,
we'll hold the,

940
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:07.830
I'm one of the last ones because I was going to say is no fucking,

941
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:10.950
they're starting to get rid of mailboxes.
They're starting to weld them shut.

942
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:14.270
You go up to one,
you're like,
oh good.
And then you can't get it in there.

943
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:19.650
Yeah,
they're going away.
Like,
remember those,
those,
those phone books,

944
00:54:19.651 --> 00:54:21.870
the big red phone booths that they had in England?
Yes.

945
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:25.170
And now for some reason they sold all of them over here because we're weird and

946
00:54:25.171 --> 00:54:27.900
we want to,
so they turned those into the new mailboxes,
I think.

947
00:54:27.901 --> 00:54:30.540
I think a bunch of people in England are going to buy an old post office boxes

948
00:54:30.541 --> 00:54:33.750
and someone's just to come in their man caves,
so on.
Just bought the La Times.

949
00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:38.310
So how the fuck are we gonna get the La Times?
If there's mailbox is don't work.

950
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:45.150
Don't you have a paper boy?
Oh No,
there's no paper.
Boy Wasn't there.
I do see,

951
00:54:45.151 --> 00:54:48.720
I see a Mexican moms driving their kids around in the mornings,

952
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:51.930
in the mornings and they fill their fucking paper and God bless him.

953
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:55.800
And my dad used to do this with us.
That's why I have the work ethic.

954
00:54:55.830 --> 00:55:00.570
I had a paper from third grade until the point it got weird.
Yeah,
I got,

955
00:55:00.571 --> 00:55:03.220
my voice was starting to change.
I couldn't walk away from the money.
Oh.

956
00:55:03.221 --> 00:55:05.490
My friends were always broke.
I do.

957
00:55:05.491 --> 00:55:09.930
They had no overhead football cards and candy where my biggest fucking

958
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:10.783
expensive.

959
00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:14.820
I wish wouldn't life be great if we could just get used to ride my bike up to

960
00:55:14.821 --> 00:55:19.230
the bowling alley.
Go Bowling.
I paid for the whole fucking thing.
No.

961
00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:23.250
Yeah,
never had to go to my parents.
He ain't [inaudible] me a couple of bugs,
man.

962
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:26.650
Never had to do that.
I was fucking independent.
Where you go and bill,

963
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:29.070
I've got on a bike ride.
All right.
Get the fuck Outta here.

964
00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:31.320
They didn't give a shit.
We were,
we were born and you were,

965
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.800
but you were exhausted at school and guarantee I wasn't ah,

966
00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:37.050
you were up at like four in the morning.
I rode a bike.

967
00:55:37.051 --> 00:55:40.950
I didn't go boozing cause I was a kid.
My bought my body was brand new.

968
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:45.120
All right.
Premiere League football.
People write in,

969
00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.820
they ask questions and all this shit.
All right.
Oh Nice.
I like this.

970
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:52.660
The Premier League football,
um,
the premier league,
I swear to God,

971
00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:55.110
the level of excitement,
like whenever I put these games on,

972
00:55:55.111 --> 00:55:57.090
every time when I watch him,
like,
you know,
they love it.

973
00:55:57.091 --> 00:56:00.300
I can get into it and it's always,
it's always like nighttime and shit.
Nah,

974
00:56:00.301 --> 00:56:02.960
makes you want to Bose.
You wish it was cold.
I he stuck on Ah,
fuck.

975
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:06.120
I gotta buy a scarf is just start singing some song.

976
00:56:06.121 --> 00:56:08.540
I hate to be the cliche American,
but I don't,

977
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:13.740
I don't get soccer Sir William of Albino.
Phil.

978
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:20.320
That was actually pretty great one.
They usually just go,
hey Billy,
read Ted's.

979
00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:24.370
Say you're freckled con,
you know,
usual.
I'd like that sir.
Alpine,
Oakville.

980
00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:29.860
Um,
that's almost begging for a picture.
I think I got to dress up in a regal way.

981
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:34.750
I gotta make sure we wrap this up because I'm going to go see a Todd.

982
00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:38.440
Rex is rex and he sold out both of his shows over,
sold them.

983
00:56:38.441 --> 00:56:41.110
So thank you to everybody listened to Todd on this show and bought a ticket.

984
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.711
All right.

985
00:56:41.711 --> 00:56:45.760
There is only one team you can support in the English premier league and that is

986
00:56:45.761 --> 00:56:50.150
Liverpool.
Eh,
I'm just going to pause and wait for everybody in England.
Oh fuck.

987
00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.300
A fucking kinds.
Beatle mania.

988
00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:56.740
It is deeply working class with a long Irish history.
All right.

989
00:56:56.770 --> 00:56:59.950
I'm in the city itself doesn't consider itself English,

990
00:56:59.951 --> 00:57:04.000
but a separate entity from the rest of the country.
I'll grow the fuck up.

991
00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:06.700
What are you,
the south you're going to secede from the union.

992
00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:10.750
Liverpool football club is currently owned by Fenway sports group.

993
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.450
That's the red sox.
Yeah.

994
00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:17.770
Up until recently we were the most successful team in England,

995
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:22.600
but a barren spell due to tragedy and mismanagement finally seems to be coming

996
00:57:22.601 --> 00:57:26.680
to an end,
much like the red sox during their windless run.

997
00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:30.070
Um,
so why the fuck do I want to jump on the bandwagon?
Now?

998
00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:33.700
We are the most exciting attacking line in the league,
possibly Europe.

999
00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:36.820
Our manager is an utter lunatic,
a very rich history.
Okay.

1000
00:57:36.821 --> 00:57:40.090
I'm kind of in right now.
Not all of it is good.
Uh,

1001
00:57:40.091 --> 00:57:43.300
including 18 league titles and five European cups.

1002
00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:45.880
The best team in the whole of Europe is European Cup.

1003
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:49.870
We've been targeted by the press,
the media,
and even the government.
Oh,

1004
00:57:49.871 --> 00:57:53.470
this is like the Patriots.
Let us see.
I'm a fucking Liverpool Fan.

1005
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:58.240
This isn't a franchise bill.
Once you pick your team or once your team picks you,

1006
00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:00.370
that's it for life.
No changing,

1007
00:58:00.371 --> 00:58:04.780
no moving cities through good and bad up the reds,
Billy boy.

1008
00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:08.740
Hey,
I don't switch teams don't even fucking suggest that I do that.

1009
00:58:08.741 --> 00:58:10.390
You fucking cunt.
Quite a,
yeah.

1010
00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:13.030
I was going to pick Liverpool just cause I liked the Beatles.

1011
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:15.550
He was just trying to get you to switch to Liverpool,

1012
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:20.740
my favorite Beatle song of all time.
Uh,
we,
we uh,

1013
00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:25.240
isn't that them?
Uh,
we,
we uh,
the Beatles.

1014
00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:29.920
All right views.
Do you get into soccer at all?
A little bit.
Well,
little bit.

1015
00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:33.130
World Cup,
World Cup,
World Cups.
Kind of fun.

1016
00:58:33.131 --> 00:58:36.400
Except that one year that one year in Africa and they had us [inaudible] that

1017
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:40.900
was fucking horns.
Yeah.
What were those things?
Ah,
I don't know.

1018
00:58:40.901 --> 00:58:44.500
I didn't watch much of that instrument if like a Kazoo fucked up bagpipe

1019
00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:52.630
and Yoko ono played it all right.
Uh,
views on public speaking fees.

1020
00:58:52.631 --> 00:58:53.340
Hey Bill,

1021
00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:57.350
long time fan and listener and I always enjoy your point of view on things.

1022
00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.770
I'm that he just went straight ahead.
Yeah,
there you go.
Anyways.

1023
00:58:59.771 --> 00:59:01.640
Was listening to the most recent,
uh,

1024
00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:04.600
Monday morning podcast and I was surprised to hear your point of view on

1025
00:59:04.601 --> 00:59:09.601
speaking fees considering that you are inset in essence a public speaker.

1026
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:15.270
I guess that you have some understanding how much more money this is relative to

1027
00:59:15.821 --> 00:59:17.260
other named acts.

1028
00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:21.860
I would be curious to see how much money other famous people get to talk if you

1029
00:59:21.861 --> 00:59:26.090
knew those without naming names.
Apparently Obama gets 400 grand per speech.

1030
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:31.490
Uh,
no,
I'm not a public speaker.
I'm a coach.
I'm a comedian.
Yeah.
You know,

1031
00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:35.300
I mean at that point,
like somebody going like,
Eh,
you know,
extract stem,

1032
00:59:35.301 --> 00:59:39.620
you know about it.
I don't like the ones I like motivational speakers.
Yeah.

1033
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:44.180
There's a reason that someone's called the public speaker.
What do you mean?

1034
00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.770
Because they're boring and they're not funny.
You're called the community.

1035
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:51.950
We're actually entertaining.
It's like tedtalk.
Yeah.
Uh,
no.

1036
00:59:51.951 --> 00:59:54.380
My problem that I had with these guys say like Obama,

1037
00:59:54.381 --> 00:59:58.160
where everybody's looking at this guy like he's a fucking saint is he's doing

1038
00:59:58.161 --> 01:00:01.130
what all of these guys do.
They all go into public office.

1039
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:02.900
They say they're there for the people and by the,

1040
01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.460
by the end of his administration,

1041
01:00:04.461 --> 01:00:08.090
he was already worth $80 million when he was making like four or 500 grand a

1042
01:00:08.091 --> 01:00:12.680
year.
But she got to make some,
I mean,
everyone wants to make money now.
Yeah.

1043
01:00:12.681 --> 01:00:16.130
But I mean they,
they,
they should give the president fuck you money.

1044
01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.020
I'm not upset.
It's the fact that I don't have the money to be like,

1045
01:00:21.021 --> 01:00:24.180
hey,
Obama know a Trump when you get an office,
uh,

1046
01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:27.070
makes sure that comedy club always has fresh Carol Marie,

1047
01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.530
his fucking 10 million bucks.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Like they do,

1048
01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.230
except they do it on a fucking global level.

1049
01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:36.830
Is he asking how much performers get paid?
I don't know what he's,

1050
01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:38.990
I don't know what the fuck is asking.
On the flip side,

1051
01:00:38.991 --> 01:00:43.430
should we even care how much money they get after they're out of office,
sir?

1052
01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:47.600
Yes.
Oh,
you have to do,
how does the president,
again,
into office,

1053
01:00:47.601 --> 01:00:49.340
how does he afford to get into office?

1054
01:00:49.341 --> 01:00:52.550
He needs people to make campaign donations.
All right.

1055
01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:56.430
And when these fucking rich people make the donations and then after we,

1056
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:59.000
after they're done and he does everything that they want to,

1057
01:00:59.001 --> 01:01:02.930
then they go on the tour.
That's them washing their bribe money.
Yeah.
Hey,

1058
01:01:02.931 --> 01:01:06.380
I'm going to give you a 400 grand to give an hour long speech.
Yeah.

1059
01:01:06.381 --> 01:01:11.030
The whole fill space.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
it's so fucking out.
That's what it is.

1060
01:01:11.031 --> 01:01:12.950
I'm not,
I'm not upset that this guy,

1061
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.890
I'm not upset that anyone can go out and make money.

1062
01:01:15.891 --> 01:01:18.680
It's just the fact that you've got these guys,

1063
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:23.270
they need $100 million to get a job that pays for 500 grand a year.

1064
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.360
And before that they make in 500 grand a year and by the end of it,

1065
01:01:26.361 --> 01:01:28.340
they are there already worth like 80 million bucks.

1066
01:01:28.341 --> 01:01:31.430
Like how the fuck did that happen?
Does that happen?
How does that happen?

1067
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:35.000
How long someone should get to the bottom of how the fuck does that happen

1068
01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:39.610
because it's all fucking corrupt.
Um,
that's my problem,
sir.
And I think that the,

1069
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:42.080
the,
the only true like really decent,

1070
01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:45.680
like truly public servant that I've seen as a,

1071
01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.290
as a president in my lifetime was Jimmy Carter.

1072
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:51.500
I'm not saying he didn't go out and do public speeches.

1073
01:01:51.501 --> 01:01:54.530
I didn't even look up to that.
But the guy has spent his fucking,

1074
01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:59.300
his golden years where he could just be sitting there painting like fucking,
uh,

1075
01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:04.010
George Bush.
You know,
it can be out there tagging brides like Clinton.
He's,

1076
01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:06.650
he phase fucking building things for the home.
Isn't,

1077
01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:11.420
is shaking hands on an airplane too.
He's a fucking great dude.
Is that the guy?

1078
01:02:11.421 --> 01:02:14.780
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you know what's funny?
You know,
it's funny,
he was the most human,

1079
01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:17.600
you most humane guy I've seen and as a,

1080
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:20.370
and he was considered to an absolute pussy,

1081
01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.570
but we know that's the truth.
That's how it works.

1082
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:27.690
You can't be nice to not be considered opposed to no,
you can be,

1083
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.600
it could be that.
You can be a decent thing about it is,

1084
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:34.110
is he was nice enough when that whole fucking around shit,

1085
01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:38.190
what the hostages went down.
He settled that without getting dragged into a war.

1086
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:41.820
So it was considered a pussy because big business could have gone in there and

1087
01:02:41.821 --> 01:02:44.130
made them money,
you know?
Yeah.

1088
01:02:44.131 --> 01:02:47.550
That's kind of not have to wait for another event to go in there and try to get

1089
01:02:47.551 --> 01:02:52.320
a bunch of fucking oil.
Alright.
Cheating with a boyfriend.
I like to,
yeah,
go.
Jeez.

1090
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:57.210
Here we go.
Uh,
hey Billy burger.
It's cold

1091
01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:02.250
so we fuck,
yeah,
no,
no,
no.
That's making fun of my last name.

1092
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:05.550
That kicks me back to like grade school.
All right.
I'm a female.

1093
01:03:05.551 --> 01:03:09.510
I got a lady right in it,
by the way,
dude.
You're a fucking great guests,
man.

1094
01:03:09.511 --> 01:03:11.280
And you're a fucking great comedian.
Kevin Shea.

1095
01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.000
[inaudible] you gotta see Kevin Shay and listened to the old fuck dog.
Why wait,

1096
01:03:15.001 --> 01:03:19.710
wait,
wait.
Alls I'm saying,
Oh,
I'm saying,
oh no.

1097
01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.630
He goes all I'm saying.
Uh,
and where are you performing next?

1098
01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:30.360
Ah,
I'm at the Ice House Tuesday to,
Oh,
give me a fucking paid Gig,
man.

1099
01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:34.870
Oh Shit.
Um,

But that's a,
I'm with Ken Jones.

Well,

There you go.
There.
Go See,

1102
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:46.020
go to Kevin,
shade.com.
Go to the Kevin Shade,
that TV,

1103
01:03:46.021 --> 01:03:50.510
some dark white guy in uppers upstate New York has given shit.
Kevin,

1104
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:56.250
shade.tv and go down and check him out.
He's fucking hilarious.
All Right,
Bill,

1105
01:03:56.251 --> 01:03:59.880
I'm a female.
The story isn't about me.
It's about my friend.
Uh,

1106
01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:05.310
that's a lie.
I know my friend wants to fuck around on her husband.

1107
01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:09.060
We're in our early twenties and have been friends since high school.

1108
01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:12.120
We've always been there for each other and even though our friendship has been,

1109
01:04:12.590 --> 01:04:16.900
it has been long distance since then.
However,
now we have a slight problem.
Uh,

1110
01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.790
she's been dating a guy for a year and they've been butting heads lately.

1111
01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:24.180
One night she got high with her roommate who's a guy and they started to kiss

1112
01:04:24.181 --> 01:04:26.040
and then of course one thing led to another.

1113
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:30.210
Apparently her roommate has been having feelings for her for a long time and

1114
01:04:30.211 --> 01:04:34.860
wants to be in a relationship with her instead of just banging her.
Uh,

1115
01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:38.280
she broke up with her boyfriend using their conflicts is the reason.

1116
01:04:38.281 --> 01:04:42.150
Instead of saying she cheated,
we've all done that.
Yeah,
we lie on.

1117
01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:46.140
All three of them have been,
have a bunch of mutual friends,

1118
01:04:46.141 --> 01:04:48.780
so she wants to lay low on the fact that she cheated.

1119
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:53.990
She also wants to give her now ex boyfriend time to heal before he finds out she

1120
01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.100
staying in a roommate.
This is called being a class act.
Why bring extra hurt,

1121
01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:03.870
right?
Yeah,
but why not?
I mean,
at this point,
if she's feeling guilty,

1122
01:05:03.871 --> 01:05:08.820
just fucking say it.
That's easy to say at our age.
But when you're young,

1123
01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:11.760
when you're young.
Yeah.
Okay.
When you're younger,
you don't know how to do it.

1124
01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:16.430
She doesn't even have,
she doesn't even know that it's obviously her that she,

1125
01:05:16.550 --> 01:05:17.560
all right,
well let's going here.

1126
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:20.980
I keep trying to tell her that would be better to come clean about what she's

1127
01:05:20.981 --> 01:05:24.520
done now than to wait it out.
I know.
Whatever their,

1128
01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:26.200
whatever their gender.

1129
01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:29.260
I know people in whatever their gender have the ability to cheat.
Growing up,

1130
01:05:29.261 --> 01:05:33.130
I've seen how being cheating on has affected people around me,
including myself.

1131
01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:38.050
I never thought that she would be the person to cheat.
So my question is

1132
01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:43.270
I people cheat,
whatever.
And then like now she's judging her.
Uh,

1133
01:05:43.310 --> 01:05:47.400
so my question is how can I get it through her head and she needs to handle this

1134
01:05:47.401 --> 01:05:51.760
situation better,
but also be a good friend to her at the same time.
Uh,

1135
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:54.430
if need is there and has any advice,
it would be great.
Thanks.
And Go fuck.

1136
01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:59.530
Fuck yourself a second date problem.
Oh,
this is a different one.
Um,

1137
01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:04.210
you know what?
I think you need the bought out.
Yeah.
Well,
okay.
If we,

1138
01:06:04.211 --> 01:06:08.650
if we actually think this isn't about her,
which I don't,

1139
01:06:08.651 --> 01:06:13.570
I think it's about her and some are saying that to her.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
if it's,

1140
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:14.470
if it's you,
if it's,

1141
01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.810
this is actually the picture you would have worded it that way.
I believe it.

1142
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:20.770
Okay.
If we believe it,
it's none of your fucking business.
You know,

1143
01:06:20.771 --> 01:06:25.360
people make mistakes.
We're all human.
So if she,
if you're a good,

1144
01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.850
this is the actual estrogen.
If you're a real fucking friend,

1145
01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:31.960
you wouldn't judge her.
Can I tell you something?
Once you get past the pain,

1146
01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:37.300
she did you a favor.
Yeah.
Cause you know you weren't married,

1147
01:06:37.301 --> 01:06:41.050
you didn't have any fucking kids.
You didn't have a house together and all that.

1148
01:06:41.051 --> 01:06:43.930
So who gives a fuck?
And then she,
you know,
they were already butting heads.

1149
01:06:43.931 --> 01:06:47.080
They weren't getting along was the end it and they were twins to that.

1150
01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:50.140
It's already over relationship and you go fuck somebody.

1151
01:06:50.141 --> 01:06:52.210
I mean it's still like girls.
You know what that's like.

1152
01:06:52.211 --> 01:06:53.710
It's like an empty net goal,
you know what I mean?

1153
01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:56.910
<v 0>I mean,
I'll plot it,
but I mean,
you know,
you didn't fake out a golden,</v>

1154
01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:02.950
it's garbage time.
We've got all this start is on the bench.
It's garbage.

1155
01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:08.350
It's garbage time.
Fucking,
you know what?
You have you ever,
I've done it.

1156
01:07:08.351 --> 01:07:13.000
I've had done me.
Oh God.
I found out later that I got man,
I was just like,
Eh,

1157
01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:14.200
it's a fucking,
was over

1158
01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:20.540
<v 1>one more than that.
Whatever time you're in a relationship as it was over a half.</v>

1159
01:07:20.541 --> 01:07:24.050
Like if you're in four years,
it's been done for two years.
Does that make sense?

1160
01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:27.560
I would say a year and a half year and a half break ups just don't happen

1161
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:29.930
overnight.
You don't want to go with like,
you know what,
I'm fucking out of here.

1162
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:32.630
You draw it out,
you start to get distance.

1163
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:37.870
You start fucking this fucking course in how to break up in highschool,

1164
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:40.120
ani in high school,

1165
01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:45.290
they should teach young people that are doing it would be so much better I

1166
01:07:45.291 --> 01:07:49.670
think.
Just so you don't fucking drag some alarm or you don't get dragged along.

1167
01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:53.240
All you had to do is you just got to sit down.

1168
01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:57.170
I've been one time I had to get out of relationship and I remember,
uh,

1169
01:07:57.230 --> 01:08:00.770
Steve Byrne had just got out of one.
This is like fucking,
you know,
years ago,

1170
01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:04.940
2025 years ago,
right?
And,
uh,
not 25,
like 20 years ago.

1171
01:08:05.570 --> 01:08:07.730
And I literally asked him,
I was like,
what did you say?
He goes,

1172
01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:12.380
I just sat down and said,
I just said I'm not happy.
That's what he started with.

1173
01:08:12.381 --> 01:08:14.840
And I've given that advice on here cause I use that.

1174
01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:16.100
I think I ever told him that I just

1175
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:20.510
<v 0>fucking used it.
I don't,
I,
we need to tell.
I'm just not like,
yeah,</v>

1176
01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:25.910
I just,
you know,
it's just not working.
It just doesn't feel right.
I'm not happy.

1177
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.750
And this is a thing,
but this is the thing.
You have to get it all out.
Yeah.

1178
01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:33.410
And I think we should break up and you got you like,
I think you just go boom,

1179
01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:36.680
boom.
It's like monkey bars,
boom,
boom,
boom.
Get across it.

1180
01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:38.780
And then you say,

1181
01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:42.710
we gotta break up and she's going to drag you through it like 50 fucking times.

1182
01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:46.820
It's like lying to the cops.
You just stick to your fucking story.
Yeah.

1183
01:08:46.821 --> 01:08:50.360
It's that whole,
I'm not happy.
I've heard it and I've said it.

1184
01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:54.150
It usually drags out for seven more months.
No,

1185
01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.700
but that's you.
It's no,
we're not happy.
It's not working out.

1186
01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:04.010
We need to break up.
You know?
I want to break up.
What the fuck it's done.
Yeah,

1187
01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:07.010
no,
I get it.
I get it,
but it never works that way.

1188
01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.220
Usually the other person is like,
no,
we can work this out.

1189
01:09:10.221 --> 01:09:12.900
Then that's when you have to go al Madrigal listen,

1190
01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:17.780
if you are living together.
Yeah.
If you're living together,
it's hard.

1191
01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.880
Then it's hard.
They're not living together.

1192
01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:24.110
You have to go al Madrigal wa now and no one ever told you that.
No.

1193
01:09:24.111 --> 01:09:28.010
I want to know.
Alan had a breakup one time.
The chick had some shit at his house.

1194
01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:30.980
He knew he was going to break up with her before we broke up.

1195
01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.750
You said he told her,
hey,
I'm going to come over tonight.

1196
01:09:32.751 --> 01:09:35.000
I think we need to talk about some things.
So she's like,
oh,
okay.

1197
01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:36.950
He fucking got a box,

1198
01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:41.960
packed all his shit up that was at his apartment,
walked over,

1199
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:45.200
set the box down and said,
we got to break up.
It's not working.

1200
01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:50.180
It was fucking clean.
Yeah.
Over.

1201
01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:54.470
That's,
that's easy for al because Al as a fucking maniac,
like he does,
he,

1202
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.420
when he has,
he didn't learn from maniacs.
No,
I love maniacs.

1203
01:09:57.470 --> 01:10:00.850
I've been kind of a maniac.
I are.
I am kind of a media cycle.

1204
01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:04.070
What are they willing to come to cycle when it comes to breaking up?
Uh,

1205
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:07.640
they've never been good.
No,
it's good.
That's why you got to get through it.

1206
01:10:07.641 --> 01:10:10.970
If you live with them is harder.
If you don't live with them,
it's easy.

1207
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.900
And that's why people fucking hang in and then they start cheating and they're

1208
01:10:14.901 --> 01:10:18.560
doing all of this fucking shit because they're basically mentally broken up.

1209
01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:21.830
So that a woman there essentially didn't even like,

1210
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:24.920
as far as like an on an emotional level.
Yeah.

1211
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:29.000
Didn't fucking on a physical level,
she cheated,
but on an emotional level,

1212
01:10:29.001 --> 01:10:32.010
she didn't cause she already fucking broke up with the guy she was done.

1213
01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.660
I find that when they're done,
here's one,
here's,
here's one.

1214
01:10:35.661 --> 01:10:39.860
When you know the other person was already fucking other people.
Okay.
When you,

1215
01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.850
someone breaks up with you and they're not even crying like that means they're

1216
01:10:43.851 --> 01:10:45.920
already cried it out with their fucking friends.

1217
01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.380
They got no tears left and it's just like,
wow man,

1218
01:10:48.381 --> 01:10:51.740
this is how long has this shit?
Yeah.
You know,
I've never cried at a breakup.

1219
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:55.400
I can't.
And they get guys don't crow all,
all the girl,

1220
01:10:55.610 --> 01:11:00.110
all my ex girlfriend,
all my ex girlfriend's ex boyfriend,
they're like,
they cry,

1221
01:11:00.111 --> 01:11:03.310
they cry.
I was like,
cause they were fucking
pussies.

1222
01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:06.120
I was going to say the other words.
So I'm glad I did it,
but uh,

1223
01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:08.313
I would have known,

1224
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:12.290
this is how I know this is how I know this is how I know when it's done,

1225
01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.400
when they kiss you goodbye in the morning.
Like,

1226
01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:19.510
cause I don't get off of work.
This is how I know it's done.
When,

1227
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:22.450
when they're mad at you and you don't give a fuck.
Yeah,

1228
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.393
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1229
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:25.730
<v 0>yeah.
You're like,
ah.</v>

1230
01:11:26.290 --> 01:11:29.540
And they come in and they start doing the cold shoulder and they're not fucking

1231
01:11:29.541 --> 01:11:34.390
you.
It's just like,
hey,
like good,
good.
No,
you're right.

1232
01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:35.200
You're right.

1233
01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:39.310
Cause then you start getting more productive because you've got so much mental

1234
01:11:39.311 --> 01:11:42.460
time.
Oh this.
There's nothing worse than getting dumped,

1235
01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:45.100
but if you're the one breaking up with something,
I do it.

1236
01:11:45.101 --> 01:11:48.340
I've been on both sides of the broken hearts.
I've had my heart broken.

1237
01:11:48.341 --> 01:11:52.540
It's brutal.
It's brutal.
I think that's why I'm so numb to it all now.
Yeah,

1238
01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:55.300
just fucking numb.
Oh No.
I already know if,
if my,

1239
01:11:55.301 --> 01:11:56.290
if my marriage is I've worked at,

1240
01:11:56.291 --> 01:11:59.470
I would never get married again and I would just give my wife fucking everything

1241
01:11:59.471 --> 01:12:03.410
and then I'll just go,
I'll go live in a fucking trailer.
My Buddy,

1242
01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:07.900
I'm not doing it again.
I'm,
I'm not getting on the fucking right again.
That's it.

1243
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:09.340
Now.
Just fucking wherever she lives,

1244
01:12:09.341 --> 01:12:11.920
I'll just drive the trailer down the street so I can still see my kids.

1245
01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:18.040
You can send him one of those air pods.
You ever see those things?
I don't know.

1246
01:12:18.370 --> 01:12:22.270
I would get to fucking,
I buy one of those VW buses,

1247
01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:28.180
you know,
I get a studio.
They get all the sports packages.
That would be it.

1248
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.900
I just,
I don't electronic drum kit.
I just go back to what the fuck I had.

1249
01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:34.450
I'm actually shocked that you got married.
To be honest with you.

1250
01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:38.470
Best thing I ever did.
One is great,
but it's weird.

1251
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:41.860
I don't know.
I don't know if I'll ever get married to be honest.

1252
01:12:42.370 --> 01:12:46.000
It's like I want to get married,
but I don't know how to do it.
When you're ready.

1253
01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:47.830
Yeah.
I'm 42 I wasn't married.

1254
01:12:47.831 --> 01:12:52.240
I got married 45 I got three more years I'm going to,
it's great.

1255
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:53.660
And then all of a sudden I'm like,
five years in,

1256
01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.340
I'm already going to turn 50 what the fuck am I going?
Actually,
where am I going?

1257
01:12:57.370 --> 01:13:01.030
What am I gonna go back to fucking,
there's a club.
This gray ladies,

1258
01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:04.330
you're looking for a bold red head and God is so sad.
I saw,

1259
01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:08.440
I see comics like that.
I don't,
I don't mention any names,
but when you see,
oh,

1260
01:13:08.441 --> 01:13:11.440
believe me do.
That was a motivation.
I'm not going to be the cliche.

1261
01:13:11.441 --> 01:13:14.780
It's so fucking sad.
I was like,
Oh God,
I don't,

1262
01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:17.980
it's so sad.
I'm like dating.
I don't,
I don't,

1263
01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:21.550
I can't tell you I've haven't dated since I just started doing stand up really,

1264
01:13:22.330 --> 01:13:23.260
if that makes any sense.

1265
01:13:23.261 --> 01:13:27.160
Like I'd meet girls and then we just started hanging out and then I sent in a

1266
01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:29.440
picking them and that sounds weird.

1267
01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:32.590
You start why we start hanging out and then I just picked them.
I was like,
oh,

1268
01:13:32.591 --> 01:13:34.330
this is the one I'm going to hang out with this one for a while.

1269
01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:37.720
Do they know that's what you're doing?
I don't know if they do.
Yeah.

1270
01:13:37.721 --> 01:13:40.930
You need to listen to the first thing I am fucking learned is you just got to

1271
01:13:40.931 --> 01:13:44.920
fucking say what you're thinking.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1272
01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:47.890
You know that's one of the reason most of the women that I date like me,

1273
01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:50.020
cause I pretty much say what I'm thinking.
That's all.

1274
01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:53.590
How happy would you be if a woman did that?
That'd be fucking amazing.

1275
01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:56.830
I'm not saying like,
Hey,
you look ugly today.
I'm not saying that,
but I mean like,

1276
01:13:56.831 --> 01:14:01.640
you know,
don't,
don't be me,
but like just say to them one more time.
I,

1277
01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:03.070
the watershed moment,

1278
01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:06.940
my relationship was near had one of her friends was having a fucking birthday

1279
01:14:06.941 --> 01:14:07.780
party.
Yeah.
Right.

1280
01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:11.740
The same night the Celtics and Lakers were playing like game six of the NBA

1281
01:14:11.741 --> 01:14:12.574
finals.

1282
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.210
<v 1>Okay.
She's like,
why are you doing Tuesday?
Right.
She doesn't talk like that.</v>

1283
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.350
That's just how it sounds in my head.

1284
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:21.423
<v 3>So</v>

1285
01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:27.280
<v 1>what are you to see?
So I'm like,
I'm watching the game.
She's like,</v>

1286
01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:31.690
ah,
does the pouty face,
you know,
the manipulations starts.
I hate this sexy voice.

1287
01:14:31.691 --> 01:14:32.524
And then the cow,
right.

1288
01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:37.090
So she's already tried to fucking tactics and not only is it friend having a

1289
01:14:37.091 --> 01:14:41.080
birthday party,
it's like some fucking 1920 steam birthday party.

1290
01:14:41.081 --> 01:14:44.740
So I have to buy a fucking costume.
Like a flapper.
Yeah.

1291
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:47.350
I get addressed like I'm in the purple gang or some shit.
Right.

1292
01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:52.720
So she goes,
do you want to go?
And I just,
I said,
no,

1293
01:14:56.180 --> 01:15:01.130
I like that.
I like that.
Yeah.
What do you mean no?
She goes,

1294
01:15:01.131 --> 01:15:06.020
why not?
I go,
it sounds horrific.
Yeah.
She goes,
and she laughed.
She goes,

1295
01:15:06.021 --> 01:15:09.260
what do you mean?
She goes,
she's a friend of yours.
I go,
no,
she isn't.
I go,

1296
01:15:09.261 --> 01:15:13.900
she's your friend.
I've become friendly with her because you know her,

1297
01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.890
but she's not my friend.
I was sick this week.
She didn't know.
She didn't call.

1298
01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:22.840
She's not my friend.
Oh.
I just kept,
I just kept saying no,

1299
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:27.730
and the more I said no,
the more she thought it was funny.
Who?
She got frustrated.

1300
01:15:27.731 --> 01:15:29.540
Then she just started laughing.
I go,

1301
01:15:29.541 --> 01:15:31.990
I'm not going fucking down at dress like Charlie Chaplin.

1302
01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:37.840
I want to watch this game.
I don't want to fuck a dues.
So then she was let go.

1303
01:15:37.841 --> 01:15:40.580
She can't,
she just,
she goes,
well,
what time does the game start?
I go,

1304
01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:44.490
just such an asshole.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So now I gotta go to this fucking party,

1305
01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:46.750
then race back.
So then I just made a compromise.
I said,
all right,

1306
01:15:46.810 --> 01:15:51.310
the game fucking starts.
Are you wet?
And whatever.
I said,
here's the deal.
I go,

1307
01:15:51.311 --> 01:15:53.830
I will drive you there.
I will make an appearance.

1308
01:15:54.130 --> 01:15:58.420
I'm not dressing up and I'm leaving with plenty of fucking time to get back.

1309
01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:03.200
Yeah.
So the before the game starts.
Yeah.
All right.
And I don't want,
here you go.

1310
01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:07.180
I don't want to hear that.
Once again,
that's not us.
She sounds,

1311
01:16:07.210 --> 01:16:10.660
that's how she sounds when she says shit like that.
So she said,
fine.

1312
01:16:10.661 --> 01:16:12.430
So I fucking show up.
I dropped a sing off on,

1313
01:16:12.431 --> 01:16:14.020
I show up and there's all these fucking guys,

1314
01:16:14.210 --> 01:16:17.710
their dress like fucking Charlie Chaplin and Al Capone and Shit.

1315
01:16:17.711 --> 01:16:20.950
And I come walking in with like a fucking Celtic shirt on,
dressed all regular.

1316
01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.980
There's like,
hey,
you didn't dress up.
I said,
no,

1317
01:16:23.981 --> 01:16:27.730
no mom getting out of here in like 10 minutes or they go,
where are you going?

1318
01:16:27.731 --> 01:16:31.270
I go,
I'm going to watch the Celtics game.
And it's the finals.
This fucking,

1319
01:16:31.271 --> 01:16:35.170
hold on.
I remember the look on their faces,
the secondly,
I felt awesome.

1320
01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:38.110
I bet there were so jealous,
dude.
You know what I do?
I've,
you know,

1321
01:16:38.111 --> 01:16:41.700
many times I've been the guy in the fucking Charlie Chaplin outfit.
I've always,

1322
01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:46.660
yeah,
then pretty hard about saying no.
Like I'll just say no.
Yeah man.

1323
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:49.660
But then I,
I'm pretty good about compromise though,

1324
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:52.690
if they want to do something important to them.

1325
01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:56.670
So as long as I get to do what I want and then if they have something,
yeah,

1326
01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:59.680
I know.
I have a bunch of compromises.
I have the,
okay,

1327
01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:01.120
but you're driving and I'm drinking.

1328
01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:04.380
<v 3>Oh,
okay.</v>

1329
01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:10.010
<v 1>You go to Brunch if you drive and I can drink.
That's the thing,
you</v>

1330
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:12.380
<v 0>know that is,
I still don't,
I still don't,
I don't do brunch.
Yeah.</v>

1331
01:17:12.381 --> 01:17:16.430
That's the one thing I fucking is every time they walk there's a line and then

1332
01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:20.210
they walk in,
they come on and go,
it's going to be 40 minutes.
Is that all right?

1333
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:24.760
No,
it's not.
All right.
This is my fucking day too.
And it's a Sunday.
Fuck,

1334
01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:26.630
it's a summit.
You're going to get pissed,
dude.

1335
01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:30.660
What the fuck do we take them to on a weekend where we walk out,
be like,

1336
01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:34.260
if they said it's going to be 40 minutes,
they would lose their shit.
Well,
they,

1337
01:17:34.530 --> 01:17:39.020
what bait?
They would gain their fuck out.
They would pow,
they would pop.

1338
01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:42.350
All right.
Do I have time to read?
What,
how far into this are we?

1339
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:47.120
Fuck.
Alright.
Hour and 20.
We've got to wrap this up.
Um,

1340
01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:51.020
I'll read the rest of these some of the time.
Kevin,
this was effortless.
Oh,

1341
01:17:51.021 --> 01:17:54.020
thank you.
You fucking hilarious.
Leslie.
Funny.

1342
01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:57.980
And everybody should go out to the Improv and West Palm,
West Palm Beach.
