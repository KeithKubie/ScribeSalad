TODD KERPELMAN: Hello, and
welcome to episode

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.780
seven of Game On!

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.070
I am Todd Kerpelman.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.710
I am your host and a Developer
Advocate on

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.160
the Play Games Team.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.000
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm
Wolff Dobson.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.690
I'm the Developer Programs
Engineer on

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.620
the Play Games Team.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.040
And we're here to talk to you
about the latest in the Play

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.340
Game services API.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.140
TODD KERPELMAN: We're here to
talk about management tools.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.300
And we're going to end with
a special surprise.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.860
And I don't want to give too
much way, but it's a graph.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.580
So I guess I kind
of gave it away.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.990
All right.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.050
Let's move on to News
and Updates.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.690
We don't really have any.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.180
Not a whole lot happened.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.860
WOLFF DOBSON: It's
going great.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.340
TODD KERPELMAN: It's
been relatively--

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.360
WOLFF DOBSON: Keep playing
those games.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.080
TODD KERPELMAN: Keep
playing games.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.770
And I guess no news
is good news.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.380
So we'll move on to This Week's
Topic, which are the

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.460
management APIs.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.715
These are a set of APIs we've
had available for a while, but

00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:57.930
I'm not sure people have taken
advantage of them to the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.300
extent that they should have.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.590
And so Wolff has come to the
rescue on behalf of all you

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.290
developers.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.120
And he's made life
easier for you.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.850
So we're going to have
him talk about it.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:08.320
WOLFF DOBSON: All right.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.820
So the admin tools--

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.470
here's this link to the
docs if you want to

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.850
check them out yourself.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.980
Basically, they are a bunch of
REST calls that allow you to

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.660
do certain management tasks,
like reset achievements, hide

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.550
players on high score lists,
un-unlock achievements--

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.490
that sort of thing.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.620
TODD KERPELMAN: Reset
your score--

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.170
WOLFF DOBSON: You've got it.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.260
TODD KERPELMAN: --while
youre in testing.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.980
WOLFF DOBSON: And I bet when I
say that, you're thinking, I

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.330
don't want to make all these
REST calls myself.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.640
I wish somebody had actually
written that for me.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.280
And the answer is
somebody has.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.170
And that person is me.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.360
So let's take a look.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.830
So here's the first
of three tools.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.890
This is the Play Games
Score-o-matic.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.190
And what this allows you
to do is set and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.080
reset leaderboard scores.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.800
So this is the leaderboard from
Firewall Defense, Bruno's

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.010
excellent game.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.220
And I can get the scores
that I've submitted.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.920
Now, I haven't submitted any
scores, so let's make myself

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.795
score a whole bunch of scores.

00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:10.380
I'm going to score
10,000 points.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.135
And it says, great.

00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:12.770
Your score is submitted.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.820
And then if I call to
get my scores, I've

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.790
scored 10,000 points.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.080
And I'm first in my social
group of two.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.755
TODD KERPELMAN: How come you're

00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:24.300
listed three times there?

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.650
WOLFF DOBSON: That's for
all-time high score, weekly

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.780
high score, and daily
high score.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.480
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.100
WOLFF DOBSON: And I can reset
all the scores with one click

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.910
of a button.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.730
I'm reset--

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.500
boink.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.985
And when I get my scores again,
I've disappeared.

00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:38.330
TODD KERPELMAN: Ah.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.120
So this would be very
useful if, say,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.320
we're testing our game.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.700
Our scoreboard is full of
testers that have either found

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.195
bugs to get ridiculously
high scores, and

00:02:48.195 --> 00:02:48.770
we're like, oh man.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.790
We've got to clear this
out before we launch.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.405
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:55.390
Or you have a system that does
something special when you get

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.100
daily high scores or something
like that.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.770
You want to be able to set
that off again and again.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.250
So this is a way for
you to reset that.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.740
You can only reset
your high score.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.240
You can't reset everybody's
high score.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.840
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.050
That's probably important
to know.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.640
WOLFF DOBSON: OK.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.600
Next up is the Reset-o-matic.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.220
The Reset-o-matic is the
same thing, except for

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.880
achievements.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.090
So here, we have a list of

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.180
achievements in Firewall Defense.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.510
I'm going to take this
cadet thing, and I'm

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.820
going to unlock it.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.520
Da-ding--

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.560
achievement unlocked.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.270
And when I refresh this--

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.010
phoomph--

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.330
you can see it is
now unlocked.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.750
Hooray.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.360
I could also, if it were an
incremental achievement,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.320
increment it.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.240
And I can also just say,
nah, I didn't win

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.540
that on second thought.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.360
And when I refresh,
it is now still

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.610
revealed rather than unlocked.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.760
TODD KERPELMAN: Revealed
here meaning that--

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.590
I always find our achievement
states confusing.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.150
Revealed means that you know
the achievement is, but you

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.990
haven't earned it yet--

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.300
WOLFF DOBSON: Right.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.253
TODD KERPELMAN: --as
opposed to hidden.

00:03:51.253 --> 00:03:53.920
WOLFF DOBSON: Or unlocked, which
means you've actually--

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.740
achievement unlocked.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.480
TODD KERPELMAN: Yes.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.450
And so this is incredibly
useful if, again, we're

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.960
testing achievements before
our game goes out.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.210
And we want to practice earning
an achievement, we

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.810
want to test that over
and over again.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.150
You don't have to create
500 test accounts.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.080
We just--

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.470
WOLFF DOBSON: No, you wouldn't
want to do that.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.620
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah-- reset
this achievement.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.840
WOLFF DOBSON: You'd be sad.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.550
OK.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.600
So then lastly, we have
the Hide-o-matic.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.610
And the Hide-o-matic is the one
that you're really going

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.250
to use, possibly, from week
to week when you're

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.600
developing your game.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.370
So this is the main high score
list for Firewall Defense.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.525
And you might look through here,
and you say, well, all

00:04:31.525 --> 00:04:33.130
these guys got their scores
legitimately.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.060
But when I say I look through
here, I see Bruno.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.320
And Bruno is a developer
of the game.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.125
It's clear he didn't score those
6,000 points by himself.

00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:42.970
TODD KERPELMAN: No way.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.500
WOLFF DOBSON: So I'm going
to go here, and I'm

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.140
going to say, be gone.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.550
I'm going to hide you forever.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.440
And so this player's
now hidden.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.730
And if I refresh the high
scores and I page to the

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.460
second page, you can
see there's no

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.020
Bruno there any longer.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.580
That's totally cool.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.280
And if I decide to have mercy on
Bruno and bring him back, I

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.950
can click Unhide and
he's unhidden.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.700
It'll take 12 hours for
Bruno to reappear.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.370
It's a low priority job, so it's
going to come back when

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.290
it's going to come back.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.400
TODD KERPELMAN: Now, when you
hide this player, are they

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.540
hidden from all leaderboards,
or just this particularly

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.490
leaderboard?

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.420
WOLFF DOBSON: No, they are
hidden from all leaderboards.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.950
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.590
WOLFF DOBSON: All right.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.430
Well, those are the
management tools.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.640
These are all open source.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.640
You can get them yourself
from GitHub

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.485
from our regular samples.

00:05:30.485 --> 00:05:32.060
TODD KERPELMAN: And I guess it's
probably worth noticing,

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.600
compared to most of our sample
apps that are like, hey,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.870
here's a sample that you can see
how it works, but then you

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.560
need to go and make your own
game and copy and paste bits

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.470
here and there from our samples,
this is really

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.790
intended for people to
essentially use as an entire

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:47.200
application.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.750
You download this thing.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.520
They run it.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.840
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.690
TODD KERPELMAN: And in fact, I
guess, probably, you can walk

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.810
us through the setup steps.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.650
But it really is hey, this is
the code that you should be

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.280
using on your own.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.860
WOLFF DOBSON: And because it's
an API, you can expand it

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.400
anyway you want.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.260
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.540
WOLFF DOBSON: All right.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.202
Well, let's take a look at how
we're going to set this up.

00:06:04.202 --> 00:06:07.345
For you to use these tools,
you're going to need to host

00:06:07.345 --> 00:06:08.100
them someplace.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.980
They're just a couple
of HTML pages and

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.240
some JavaScript pages.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.690
You'll need to put
them someplace.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.410
Localhost even works
for testing.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.660
You're going to need
to link a web

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.840
application in the console.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.820
And you're going to need to go
into these JavaScript and the

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.440
HTML files and replace
couple of constants--

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.770
in this case, CLIENT_ID,
APP_ID, and in the

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.540
Hide-o-matic, you need
the leaderboard.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.630
So even if you don't have a
web version of your game--

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.820
TODD KERPELMAN: --which probably
applies to a lot of

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:37.260
our mobile developers.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.510
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly--
a lot of your developers.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.530
You're going to need to link
a web application anyway.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.090
And this web application
is actually your game.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.190
So you should be careful with
those credentials like you

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.050
would normally.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.130
TODD KERPELMAN: So sorry, just
to clarify, I'm not going to

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.630
create a new application that's
my admin for my Angry

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.130
Fruit game.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.310
I'm actually going to go into
my Angry Fruit game and I'm

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.490
going to link to
a new web-based

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.640
client ID for this game.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.650
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, it's
a web version of

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.010
your Angry Fruit game.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.970
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.396
WOLFF DOBSON: And you're going
to fill out where you want it

00:07:07.396 --> 00:07:10.190
to point to, and you're going
to create a client ID.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.560
And when you create the client
ID for the web console, you

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.840
need to set your JavaScript
origins to wherever you're

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.680
hosting these pages.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.850
In this case, I have it on
localhost, but you could also

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.280
host it just on a server inside
your firewall, or even

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.830
public, although you'd
have to be pretty

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.080
careful with that URL.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.130
It is worth noting that
this is, in fact, a

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:31.990
version of your game.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.080
It's just a version of your game
with your game missing

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.570
and just the leaderboards and
the scoreboard stuff in there.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:41.400
And so if you have a JavaScript
origin set to

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.780
localhost, it means
that anybody else

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:44.810
can download this.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.360
And they can go to the web
version of your game and they

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.690
can pull out the client ID and
the app ID and paste those in

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.180
your things and unlock all
the achievements and give

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.580
themselves arbitrary score.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.940
They won't be able to do the
management tasks, because you

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.270
have to be an owner or
on the tester list

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.260
to use those things.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.050
But they will be able to,
obviously, just set their

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.020
scores arbitrarily.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.130
And you want to be careful
with that.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.560
So I would advise, if your game
is launched, you probably

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.760
want to set your JavaScript
origin to something besides

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.740
localhost--

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.270
probably an internal server
that's inside your firewall.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.760
OK.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.430
Let's go onto the Q&amp;A.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.480
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh, all right.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.250
Oh.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.770
You got something changing
your JavaScript origins.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:24.900
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.900
TODD KERPELMAN: Why would
you want to do this?

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.770
WOLFF DOBSON: Again, after
you've launched your game, you

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.130
might still want to do
management tasks.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:30.530
TODD KERPELMAN: Gotcha.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.840
WOLFF DOBSON: So you
can change that

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.419
from inside the API.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.809
TODD KERPELMAN: So we'd go to
the API's console, or I guess,

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:35.944
coming soon, the
cloud console.

00:08:35.944 --> 00:08:36.220
WOLFF DOBSON: Exactly.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.500
TODD KERPELMAN: And this is
basically where we could

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.120
change our settings, to be like,
I don't want to be on

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.080
localhost anymore.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.980
I want to be on

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.400
internalserver.google.com or whatever.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.195
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, probably
not google.com,

00:08:45.195 --> 00:08:46.370
unless you're us.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.050
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah,
probably not you.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.960
WOLFF DOBSON: OK.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.390
Here we go.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:50.740
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.640
So first question,
it looks like--

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.750
very clearly, I would want to
use this hide mechanism if it

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.580
looks like somebody is doing
something kind of nefarious or

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.200
they're being a jerk, and
they're like, hey, I'm going

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.090
to get a fake score upon there
because I'm a lead hacker.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.350
So why not just ban
these players?

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.030
WOLFF DOBSON: You
could ban them.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.400
But then they might notice and
they might get angry and come

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.180
after you again.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.170
But also, really, they're still
going to appear in their

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.750
social scoreboards.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.480
And so if somebody looks and
says, yeah, he's still got the

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.470
highest score, that's great,
but they may be ruining the

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.490
experience for the people
in the public boards.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.300
So this allows them just to be
like, well, they're not going

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.850
to appear in the
public boards.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.480
And then when they look at the
public board, they'll still

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.210
see themselves.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.470
But if anybody else looks at
the public board, they will

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.990
not be there.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.470
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.170
So that's probably something
to make sure--

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.290
hiding means hide from
everybody except

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.160
the cheating or the--

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:44.770
WOLFF DOBSON: Adverse--

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.620
TODD KERPELMAN: --the
hidden player.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.690
WOLFF DOBSON: The
adverse player.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.300
TODD KERPELMAN: Yes.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.690
So they wouldn't even know
that they've been hidden

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.380
unless they were to get another
friend with an account

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.610
to look at the leaderboards.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:54.450
WOLFF DOBSON: Look at
public leaderboards.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.060
TODD KERPELMAN: Public
leaderboards.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.320
WOLFF DOBSON: They will appear
in the social leaderboards.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.676
TODD KERPELMAN: And that looks
like a lot of work.

00:09:57.676 --> 00:09:58.130
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.770
TODD KERPELMAN: I suppose the
other advantage is if you hide

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.460
someone that you suspect has
gotten a score through

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.510
nefarious purposes and that it
turns out they're just a

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.880
really, really good player,
you do have the option to

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.380
unhide them.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.420
WOLFF DOBSON: You can put
them right back in.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.470
TODD KERPELMAN: And all
of their old scores

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.415
will still be there.

00:10:11.415 --> 00:10:11.790
WOLFF DOBSON: Right.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.680
And another real use is that
you have a bunch of testers

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.850
who've been playing
it in beta.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.400
And they all have really
high scores.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.390
And you're like, I don't want to
destroy your guys's score,

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.750
but really, we need to get that
off there so people can

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.140
have a chance.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.590
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
makes sense.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.750
Now, using this tool, could I--
for instance, my customer

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.040
service people, someone emails
me and says, hey, I didn't get

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.750
this achievement.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.150
Can we grant them that
achievement using this tool?

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.620
WOLFF DOBSON: No.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.750
You need a valid access token
for each account to be able to

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.160
unlock achievements or lock
achievements for them.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.430
TODD KERPELMAN: So the idea is
this is really used for--

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.850
WOLFF DOBSON: For unrevealed--

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:45.720
set back to revealed.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.850
TODD KERPELMAN: So this
is really just

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.350
used for testing purposes.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.320
My testers have earned
the achievements.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.180
They want to practice earning
the achievements again or they

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.550
want to test that
scenario again.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.840
So we can get them all back
to the original state.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.850
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, the player
hiding is the only thing you

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.260
can do to somebody else, and
again, only if you're an owner

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.090
of the application.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:01.420
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.920
I guess that links into our
third question-- sort of what

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.240
you mentioned.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.480
How do I know who has access
to these tools?

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:07.680
WOLFF DOBSON: Right.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.450
So for the testing tools, you
just need to be on the tester

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.600
list in the Play Games
developer console.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.350
TODD KERPELMAN: And chances
are-- that's the one you've

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:19.000
got to add so that people can
try your game before any game

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.250
services has been published,
basically.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:20.970
WOLFF DOBSON: Right.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.450
And the owner of the application
is the person who

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.024
can do the hiding
and unhiding.

00:11:25.024 --> 00:11:25.910
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.450
WOLFF DOBSON: And you have to
sign in as that person when

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.950
you're using this application.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:29.360
TODD KERPELMAN: Gotcha.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:29.620
All right.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:35.450
So even if somehow I were to get
your client ID and you're

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:36.030
on localhost.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.585
I'm still using that, and I
do all that stuff you said

00:11:38.585 --> 00:11:40.950
before, I'm still limited
in what I do.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:41.058
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:11:41.058 --> 00:11:44.030
It makes you log in as that
person that you can't make

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.060
change anything, or as an owner,
and hopefully, you're

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.900
not leaking your owner
credentials.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:48.920
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.840
WOLFF DOBSON: That
would be bad.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.750
TODD KERPELMAN: That
would be bad.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.720
Well, all right.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.100
Great.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.140
I think that's everything we
have on management tools.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.900
So Wolff, we've got to get you
out of here so we have time

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.540
for our graph.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.542
So you're on.

00:12:03.542 --> 00:12:03.980
JAVIER SNIDER: Hello.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.330
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh,
hey, it's Javier.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:07.060
Javier, welcome.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.290
Why don't you introduce
yourself?

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:08.570
JAVIER SNIDER: Yes.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:13.850
Well, I'm Javier Snider from
the Google Play Games team.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.180
Well, here I am.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.620
TODD KERPELMAN: And you're here
to talk about a graph

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.210
that we're about to see.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.510
JAVIER SNIDER: Yes.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:21.890
TODD KERPELMAN: I've got
this whole seat here.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:25.030
I think I really only need the
edge, because we're about to

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:26.220
reveal it right now.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:26.900
JAVIER SNIDER: OK.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:27.730
TODD KERPELMAN: Hey,
check that out.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.420
JAVIER SNIDER: OK.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.680
TODD KERPELMAN: So what
are we looking at?

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.130
JAVIER SNIDER: What is this?

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:30.440
TODD KERPELMAN: What is it?

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:30.720
JAVIER SNIDER: OK.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.350
Well, this is an improvement
in the unreliable latency

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.450
between peers and real-time
multiplayer games.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:39.840
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.930
So I know we launched
multiplayer matchmaking at

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.130
Google I/O a few months ago.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.680
Since then, we've been
integrating and improving.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.460
One of those areas has
been match quality.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.600
JAVIER SNIDER: Yeah,
match quality.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.430
So what is this?

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:01.840
This is a factor that we are
always trying to improve in

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.860
our matchmaking system so the
players can have a better

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:12.860
experience in the matches
that we create.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.010
TODD KERPELMAN: It looks like a
couple weeks ago, this graph

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.870
took a nice little dip.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:17.440
JAVIER SNIDER: Yes.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.020
TODD KERPELMAN: What
happened here?

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.430
JAVIER SNIDER: So
what is this?

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:29.850
We started considering the broad
geographic place of our

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:35.170
players to estimate the latency
that they are going to

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:40.360
have when we form the match.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:40.760
TODD KERPELMAN: Gotcha.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.550
So you basically now prefer--

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.760
if I'm somewhere in, say,
Seattle, you're saying, hey,

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.070
we're going to try and match you
with other people in the

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:52.000
Pacific Northwest area, because
chances are you'll

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.200
have better latency than if we
match you with somebody in--

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:55.470
JAVIER SNIDER: Exactly.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:14:00.305
So this is something tricky,
because we don't know the

00:14:00.305 --> 00:14:05.015
right latency after the match is
formed, and at that point,

00:14:05.015 --> 00:14:08.010
it's too late to choose
a different player.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:08.980
TODD KERPELMAN: You can't
kick someone out

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.810
for having low latency.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.090
JAVIER SNIDER: No,
of course not.

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:15.340
So what we have to do is to
collect data for all the

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.850
matches between all the regions
around the world.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:23.340
And that data, we estimate
what is likely to be the

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.220
latency between two players
in different regions.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:27.750
TODD KERPELMAN: Ah.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.570
So it doesn't necessarily have
to be in the same region.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.280
If we know that, for some
reason, City A and City B have

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.700
a really good internet
connection between them--

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.390
JAVIER SNIDER: Yes, exactly.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.660
TODD KERPELMAN: --your system
would say, oh, it's OK to

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:37.350
match up these two.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.840
JAVIER SNIDER: Yes, exactly.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.020
So essentially, we do that.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:47.330
And with this feature, we get
better quality in the matches.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:52.040
As you can see the graph, we've
had almost 15% or 20%

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.405
improvement.

00:14:52.405 --> 00:14:53.600
TODD KERPELMAN: That
looks nice.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.160
JAVIER SNIDER: Yeah.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.590
TODD KERPELMAN: So were there
any trade offs involved in

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:57.510
having to do this?

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:57.590
JAVIER SNIDER: Yes.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:58.880
You always have those.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:05.830
So if we have a match or if when
we are forming a match we

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:10.220
seen that this match is not
really a good quality or the

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:16.700
latency is likely to be not so
good, but we don't have other

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.790
players, probably we have to
wait a little longer to

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:27.110
combine the matches in order
to wait for new players to

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:33.230
arrive and see if they have
better quality or better

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.580
expected latency between them.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:41.580
So this is the trade off, so
maybe we need the players to

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.770
wait a little longer before
we find the matches.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:45.110
TODD KERPELMAN: Gotcha.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:48.000
So what you're saying is for
instance, I might be ready to

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.500
play and the only other player
available right now is in

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.810
Australia or somewhere
where it's far away,

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.340
probably longer latency.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.190
The system's going to say, we're
not going to match you

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.770
up with that guy.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.610
We're going to look for somebody
else with a better

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:03.430
connection.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:06.380
And so it might take me longer
to get into a match because

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.910
I'm not going to play this
guy in Australia.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:08.460
JAVIER SNIDER: Yes.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.890
But of course, we don't want our
players to wait too much.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:18.500
So what we also estimate is the
waiting time to another

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.260
player to appear for this
particular game.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.960
And if we think that it's going
to be too long, we don't

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.660
wait, and combine the
players right away.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.440
TODD KERPELMAN: So you change
the criteria a little bit

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.330
based on how popular the game
is, how many players are

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.380
playing multiplayer
at that time?

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.420
JAVIER SNIDER: Yeah, exactly.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.300
And this is something that
is dynamically adjusted.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:49.260
So for each application, each
variant, and each moment, we

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.530
calculate all these variables
and decide if wait is a good

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:54.770
idea or not.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:17:00.010
So we prioritize these two
things to have a good quality,

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:05.450
but also not to wait too much
that the player drops the

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.140
match or whatever.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.589
TODD KERPELMAN: So for instance,
in a very popular

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:12.480
game, you could afford to reject
players that are too

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.700
far away, might not have a good
connection, because we

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.119
know that there's constantly new
people coming in and that

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:19.410
I won't have to wait
too much longer to

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.030
find a matching player.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:24.869
Whereas a game where it's just
been released or it's not very

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:28.600
popular, no one's playing
multiplayer, even if some

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.350
connection isn't optimal, the
system will say, we're going

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.300
to try and match you with them
anyway, because at least it's

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.670
better to have some game
than no game at all.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.800
JAVIER SNIDER: Yeah, exactly.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.670
That's the idea.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.865
And by the way, we don't
reject players.

00:17:39.865 --> 00:17:40.140
TODD KERPELMAN: Sorry.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.550
JAVIER SNIDER: We just
choose to combine

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.640
them with other players.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.480
TODD KERPELMAN: You're right.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.210
I should pick better language.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.740
We love all of our players.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:49.480
We just--

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:49.780
JAVIER SNIDER: Yeah.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:50.150
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.160
JAVIER SNIDER: OK.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.260
So this is it.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.160
TODD KERPELMAN: That's
very cool.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.770
So basically, our players should
be noticing a better

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.250
multiplayer experience.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.280
JAVIER SNIDER: Yeah,
that's the idea.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:02.560
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:08.780
And over time, as you adjust
these matching systems, and I

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.770
guess as more people start
playing multiplayer, they'll

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.370
start to see improvements,
as well.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:14.620
JAVIER SNIDER: Yes.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:22.500
So another thing that maybe in
the future happens is if a

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:28.900
player or developers want to
improve based on the skills of

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:33.820
the players, we can do
some similar stuff.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.100
TODD KERPELMAN: I've seen
requests for that in the

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.170
public database--

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.250
hey, I want to match advanced
players with advanced players

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.830
or people of the same
difficulty level.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.290
But I guess you do have a good
point where there's a trade

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:47.260
off there, where if we start
not matching people with

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.030
potential opponents just because
maybe they're not the

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.790
same skill level, the wait
time is going to go up.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:58.150
And depending on how picky we
get, the more factors we have

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.330
to wait until we get a perfect
match, the longer the wait

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:01.210
time could be.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:02.000
JAVIER SNIDER: Yes.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.290
But of course, we have to
consider all these features or

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:12.640
these parameters when we try to
combine matches of players.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:18.070
And of course, always,
the wait time is a

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.210
very important factor.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:22.130
And we don't want our players
to wait too much.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.800
TODD KERPELMAN: Gotcha.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.010
So yeah, it sounds like
a tricky problem.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.270
JAVIER SNIDER: Yeah, it's
not a simple one.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:34.920
And again, the major problem is
that you don't know all the

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.660
information until
it's too late to

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:39.735
take the optimal decision.

00:19:39.735 --> 00:19:46.120
So you have to estimate a lot of
details to do this process.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.530
TODD KERPELMAN: Well, I'm
glad you're working

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:49.360
on it and not me.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:49.740
All right.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.890
Well, I think that wraps up
this episode of Game On!

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.750
I'd like to thank Wolff and
Javier for joining us.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.550
And we will see you
in two weeks.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:19:59.800
Thank you very much,
internet audience.
