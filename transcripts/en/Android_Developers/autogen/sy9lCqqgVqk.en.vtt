hello and welcome back to what i guess

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910
hello and welcome back to what i guess
 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.089
hello and welcome back to what i guess
i'm going to call our interlude between

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099
i'm going to call our interlude between
 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.030
i'm going to call our interlude between
chapter 1 and chapter 2 since i've

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040
chapter 1 and chapter 2 since i've
 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.440
chapter 1 and chapter 2 since i've
started recording our first batch of

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450
started recording our first batch of
 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.810
started recording our first batch of
videos a number of things have changed

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820
videos a number of things have changed
 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.760
videos a number of things have changed
and so i just want to touch on those

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770
and so i just want to touch on those
 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.279
and so i just want to touch on those
before we get into chapter 2 the first

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289
before we get into chapter 2 the first
 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.779
before we get into chapter 2 the first
and most obvious thing you'll notice is

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789
and most obvious thing you'll notice is
 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.140
and most obvious thing you'll notice is
that i'm now using Xcode 5 and my guess

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150
that i'm now using Xcode 5 and my guess
 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.640
that i'm now using Xcode 5 and my guess
is you're going to be using it to and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650
is you're going to be using it to and
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.890
is you're going to be using it to and
for most of the stuff moving forward I'm

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900
for most of the stuff moving forward I'm
 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.799
for most of the stuff moving forward I'm
going to be testing on iOS 7 devices so

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809
going to be testing on iOS 7 devices so
 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.229
going to be testing on iOS 7 devices so
that's the first and biggest change the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239
that's the first and biggest change the
 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.660
that's the first and biggest change the
second is that we've upgraded both the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
second is that we've upgraded both the
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.450
second is that we've upgraded both the
Google+ and the google play games SDKs

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
Google+ and the google play games SDKs
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.139
Google+ and the google play games SDKs
since we first launched these videos in

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149
since we first launched these videos in
 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.639
since we first launched these videos in
Google+ land we are now using SDK

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649
Google+ land we are now using SDK
 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.209
Google+ land we are now using SDK
version 1.4 and on google play games

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219
version 1.4 and on google play games
 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.600
version 1.4 and on google play games
we're now using version 1.2 if you've

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610
we're now using version 1.2 if you've
 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.430
we're now using version 1.2 if you've
used old versions of either of these

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440
used old versions of either of these
 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.049
used old versions of either of these
libraries you're going to need to

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059
libraries you're going to need to
 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.849
libraries you're going to need to
download the new versions of these

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
download the new versions of these
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.330
download the new versions of these
libraries and install them and actually

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340
libraries and install them and actually
 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.770
libraries and install them and actually
need to do that here so I'm going to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
need to do that here so I'm going to
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.929
need to do that here so I'm going to
show you how I do it it turns out that

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
show you how I do it it turns out that
 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.719
show you how I do it it turns out that
at least in my case upgrading frameworks

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729
at least in my case upgrading frameworks
 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.530
at least in my case upgrading frameworks
and bundles with in Xcode is a it causes

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
and bundles with in Xcode is a it causes
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.090
and bundles with in Xcode is a it causes
some issues for me I've never had good

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
some issues for me I've never had good
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.280
some issues for me I've never had good
luck with this xcode suddenly seems to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
luck with this xcode suddenly seems to
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.710
luck with this xcode suddenly seems to
you know forget what my GP g manager is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
you know forget what my GP g manager is
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.140
you know forget what my GP g manager is
and can't seem to find it and you know i

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
and can't seem to find it and you know i
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.230
and can't seem to find it and you know i
run into a lot of odd issues and as

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
run into a lot of odd issues and as
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.570
run into a lot of odd issues and as
counterintuitive as it might seem I've

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580
counterintuitive as it might seem I've
 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.460
counterintuitive as it might seem I've
actually had much better luck if I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470
actually had much better luck if I
 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.370
actually had much better luck if I
update these frameworks just using

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
update these frameworks just using
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.920
update these frameworks just using
finder so I'm going to do that so first

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930
finder so I'm going to do that so first

thing we're going to do I'm going to
 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.940
thing we're going to do I'm going to
close this project next code next up I'm

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950
close this project next code next up I'm
 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.410

new SDKs let's extract the zip and this

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360
new SDKs let's extract the zip and this
 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.160
new SDKs let's extract the zip and this
will probably say 12 not one to beta and

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170
will probably say 12 not one to beta and
 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.990
will probably say 12 not one to beta and
now we can replace the frameworks so

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
now we can replace the frameworks so
 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.370
now we can replace the frameworks so
here's what I'm going to do it's pretty

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380
here's what I'm going to do it's pretty
 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.020
here's what I'm going to do it's pretty
straightforward first let's do the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030
straightforward first let's do the
 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.229
straightforward first let's do the
Google+ SDK so I'm going to go into my

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239
Google+ SDK so I'm going to go into my
 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.630
Google+ SDK so I'm going to go into my
guess my number folder or wherever it

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640
guess my number folder or wherever it
 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.540
guess my number folder or wherever it
turns out xcode has copied the framework

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550
turns out xcode has copied the framework
 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.729
turns out xcode has copied the framework
folders for you in my case that's right

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739
folders for you in my case that's right
 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.670
folders for you in my case that's right
in here I'm going to delete these two

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680
in here I'm going to delete these two
 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.160
in here I'm going to delete these two
frameworks there we go just the two

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170
frameworks there we go just the two
 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.229
frameworks there we go just the two
frameworks and I'm going to copy them

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239
frameworks and I'm going to copy them
 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.430
frameworks and I'm going to copy them
over again with in finder into the same

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440
over again with in finder into the same
 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.610
over again with in finder into the same
location and then I'm going to do the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620
location and then I'm going to do the
 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.380
location and then I'm going to do the
same thing with my Play game services

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390
same thing with my Play game services
 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.180
same thing with my Play game services
framework and bundle delete it and then

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190
framework and bundle delete it and then
 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.600
framework and bundle delete it and then
copy these two over there we go again I

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610
copy these two over there we go again I
 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.410
copy these two over there we go again I
know this seems a little

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420
know this seems a little
 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.000
know this seems a little
counterintuitive we're sort of swapping

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010
counterintuitive we're sort of swapping
 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.250
counterintuitive we're sort of swapping
out frameworks kind of under the feet of

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260
out frameworks kind of under the feet of
 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.560
out frameworks kind of under the feet of
Xcode and it doesn't seem to know that

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570
Xcode and it doesn't seem to know that
 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.840
Xcode and it doesn't seem to know that
it's happening but if you open up this

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850
it's happening but if you open up this
 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.259
it's happening but if you open up this
project again in Xcode it seems to

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269
project again in Xcode it seems to
 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.990
project again in Xcode it seems to
handle these changes pretty elegantly

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000
handle these changes pretty elegantly
 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.440
handle these changes pretty elegantly
which is nice now once that's done if

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450
which is nice now once that's done if
 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.150
which is nice now once that's done if
you try to compile this thing you'll

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160
you try to compile this thing you'll
 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.690
you try to compile this thing you'll
probably get a number of errors yep it

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700
probably get a number of errors yep it
 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.310
probably get a number of errors yep it
looks like it's you know stuff that

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320
looks like it's you know stuff that
 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.190
looks like it's you know stuff that
looks like this and that's because the

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200
looks like this and that's because the
 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.740
looks like this and that's because the
new Google+ SDK requires four more

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750
new Google+ SDK requires four more
 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.500
new Google+ SDK requires four more
frameworks for us to add so we'll go

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510
frameworks for us to add so we'll go
 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.960
frameworks for us to add so we'll go
into these and so first thing we're

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970
into these and so first thing we're
 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.170
into these and so first thing we're
going to add is core motion there we go
