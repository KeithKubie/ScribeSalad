So now that we've learned how the brain sends an receives signals, let's talk

00:00:03.138 --> 00:00:07.481
about how the brain functions. Now the brain isn't just one big black box where

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:11.534
there's one unique function. It's actually made up of several important parts,

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:16.202
each with a unique purpose. Now just like we learned in the evolution material,

00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:20.683
the brain is the result of millions of years of development. At the broadest

00:00:20.683 --> 00:00:24.709
level, there are three major regions of the brain, the hindbrain, the midbrain

00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:30.756
and the forebrain. These areas represent different evolutionary ages, meaning

00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:34.178
the hindbrain evolved first, followed by the midbrain and finally the

00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:40.352
forebrain. In fact, we can see some of the oldest animals on the planet. Fish

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:44.384
and reptiles only have a hind brain. Birds and mammals have a mid brain and

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:48.256
fore brain. But it's really the primates who have the most complex and

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:49.850
developed fore brains.
