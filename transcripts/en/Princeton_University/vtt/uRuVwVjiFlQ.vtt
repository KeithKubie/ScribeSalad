[DUCKS QUACKING]

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.455
JEAN BELLAMY: This way.

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:08.449
Turn around.

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:09.460
Good boy.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.590
I've been riding since
I was 5 years old.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.252
I really wanted to
continue that passion

00:00:14.252 --> 00:00:15.460
when I got here to Princeton.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.450
And the equestrian
team gave me that.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.640
We have so many
people on this team

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.550
who have never seen a horse
before they got onto the team.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.352
And our coaches are really happy
to teach you from step one,

00:00:30.352 --> 00:00:31.810
like, here's how
to handle a horse.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.970
Here's how to get on,
and then all the way up

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.737
to people who have been
riding for 15, 20 years.

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:38.320
ASHTON PHILLIPS:
Following your horse.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.580
But you're sort of following
the trajectory of the horse --

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.020
I knew that riding
and horses were

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.620
going to be a part of my life
immediately after school,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.810
whereas a lot of the
Princeton students

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.300
don't necessarily have that
ambition, although they

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.750
do very often want to
keep riding in their life.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.970
For them, I think
it's a great outlet.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.090
It's a bit of a
break from academics.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.440
It's an opportunity to get
to do what they love to do.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.070
And hopefully, many
of them will continue

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.830
with horses in their life,
regardless of what career

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.701
path they ultimately choose.

00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:16.625
-- or sink and let them walk.

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:19.270
NIKOLAY SUKHOV: My work
is very theoretical.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.380
I mostly sit and focus on the
formulas, like, all day long.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.950
And this is a really
very opposite thing.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.050
You're not focused on
something specific.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.090
You're just enjoying the ride.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.266
It really teaches you to
be patient but diligent.

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.390
ASHTON PHILLIPS: Excellent.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.181
JEAN BELLAMY: When we
come out on weekends,

00:01:40.181 --> 00:01:43.240
it's really a full day of
handling horses in a way

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.040
that we don't when
we're just riding.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.310
We have to muck stalls,
and do hay, and everything.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.840
And it's really good.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.050
It shows you both sides of
riding, which is both, like,

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.390
this really fun exercise
riding part of it

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.682
and also the horsemanship.

00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:02.818
You've still got a
noseband though, big guy?

00:02:02.818 --> 00:02:04.620
ANNE STEVENS: We want
them to be confident,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.320
because when you can start being
confident around a 1,200=-pound

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.130
animal, you can be confident
in most aspects of your life.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.800
Those that really
embrace it, you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.950
can see them grow year
after year in their ability

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.785
to deal with situations that
make them uncomfortable.

00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:20.655
[KISSING]

00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:21.960
JEAN BELLAMY: You're good.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.320
I love being on the team just
because it's a good release

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.810
to get off of campus,
and to be around animals,

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.970
and spend two or three
hours every week just

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.200
hanging out around horses.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.010
It's wonderful to be able
to decompress like that.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.660
And I would say that my
academics have really, like,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.970
benefited from it,
because I'm not constantly

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.440
studying and stressing out.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.800
I get to come out, and really
relax for a little bit,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.810
and do what I love.
