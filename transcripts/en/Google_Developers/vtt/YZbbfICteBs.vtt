BEN FRIED: Good afternoon.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.960
Who cares about
new domain names?

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.060
The short answer is
we think you should.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.790
And we certainly do,
too And actually, this

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.050
is the most
important, and I think

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.041
an exciting change, in the
internet in a long, long time,

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.040
maybe since the beginning
of the modern internet

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.500
as we knew it, at least as
users will experience it.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.300
And we are incredibly
excited about this.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.200
And if that is not enough, if
our excitement and the changes

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.600
in the internet aren't
enough to get you excited,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.900
we're going to give each
and every one of you

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.166
a free domain name
registration to use soon,

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.040
as part of our new domain
registrar business.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.830
So hang on till the end
to learn more about that.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.990
I hope that that
helps excite you

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.198
about the topic a little bit.

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:51.100
Yay!

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.880
Free!

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.860
Free is good!

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.760
Domain names actually cost more
than t-shirts, even in bulk.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.020
So you're getting a good deal.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.290
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.840
I'm Ben.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.500
Ben Fried.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.125
I'm Google's chief
information officer.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:06.430
I'll be joined on stage later
by Kripa, and during the Q&amp;A,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.630
Corey's going to come
and join us as well.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.820
So just out of curiosity, how
many of you manage a domain,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.585
have a domain under management?

00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:16.760
Oh, all right, awesome.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.060
How many manage more
than 10 domains?

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.840
How many of you
manage more than 50?

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.420
You're an impressive bunch.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.200
You certainly
out-domain manage me.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.700
OK.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.160
And so you're clearly experts.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.790
So this is material that
you didn't need to hear,

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.690
but just to set expectations
for the broader audience, what's

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.570
in a name.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.169
Obviously, names are locations.

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:38.960
They're how we find
things on the internet.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.876
They're what make the
web nameable and usable.

00:01:40.876 --> 00:01:42.400
They're incredibly important.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.858
The key components
that we're going

00:01:43.858 --> 00:01:45.810
to be talking about in
names are that stuff

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.960
to the right of the last dot
is called the top-level domain.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.560
.com is an example of what's
called a generic top-level

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.060
domain.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.120
There are also country code
top-level domains, like .us,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.440
for example.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.340
Google is the second
level domain here.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.461
Obviously in the site
name, google.com.

00:02:00.461 --> 00:02:03.650
Keep those terms in mind if
you didn't already know them.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.420
It's very important.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.297
So why are we talking
about domain names?

00:02:07.297 --> 00:02:08.380
Why do we care about them?

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.550
What makes them
important in our lives?

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.152
And the answer is
that domain names

00:02:12.152 --> 00:02:14.110
are the key to making
the internet work for us.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.166
What's important about names is
that they need to be readable.

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:19.540
You need to understand the
location, address of the place

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.810
that you want to go.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.070
Domain names also
need to be memorable.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.170
It does you no good to
have a location or a place

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.020
that you want to go if you
can't remember it in the future.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.730
And finally, names, as
in all things in life,

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.380
names work best when they're
meaningful to us and actually

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.460
kind of convey something
that's important to us.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.270
But it's no secret to
this group of experts

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.900
that as the internet
has matured,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.500
something has happened to names.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.740
Finding meaningful names
has become a lot harder.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.390
And when I try to explain
this to friends and family,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.580
I go to that oracle of the
internet, Jack Donaghy,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.320
the character played by
Alec Baldwin in "30 Rock."

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.530
And here's a quote from the
television show "30 Rock."

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.740
"I just registered the domain
name for my campaign website.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.549
Jackdonaghyisrunningformayor2013newyorkthisisthewebsite.com.

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:09.840
That's as close as I could get.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.660
Everything else was
already pornography."

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.400
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.920
So how did we get here?

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.400
How did we get to the point
where a broadcast prime time

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.797
comedy can actually
be telling us

00:03:20.797 --> 00:03:23.130
something we all relate to
about the exhaustion of names

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.300
on the internet?

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.480
You actually have to go back
and put this in context.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.780
In 1985, when the modern
internet naming was created,

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.560
there were seven
top-level domains.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.535
And in fact, the very first name
registered, which was in .com,

00:03:35.535 --> 00:03:39.710
was symbolics.com, which was
owned by the Symbolics Computer

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.240
Corporation.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.880
But over the next,
I guess 29 years,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.550
we've seen over 240 million
domain names registered

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.440
in the second-level
domain space.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.952
And the result is the
situation that Jack described.

00:03:51.952 --> 00:03:53.410
To give you more
color on it, and I

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.750
think this is probably
obvious to all of you.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.340
Of the almost 460,000 four
letter .com domain names that

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.440
are possible, there are
none that are available.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.520
So we're out.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.390
Is it any secret to any of
us that we're out of names?

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.080
Finding names is awfully hard.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.935
Anyway, I guess the
good thing to know

00:04:12.935 --> 00:04:16.200
is that we've known this problem
was important for a long time.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.890
There's an organization called
ICANN, the internet Corporation

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.670
for Assigned Names and
Numbers, whose mandate it

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.250
is in part to worry about
naming on the internet.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.150
And they've been worried
about this problem since 2000.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.190
And in fact, in 2000
and then in 2004,

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.130
ICANN created a
handful, a total of 15,

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.040
new generic top-level domains.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.740
But whether, considered
as experiments,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.180
those worked or didn't, I
don't think they really changed

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.260
the naming crisis that
we have on the internet.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.370
I'd imagine all of
you would agree.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.300
So in 2011, as you can
see here in this picture,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.060
ICANN voted to open up the
top-level domain name space

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.820
and allow any applicant
to suggest and apply

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.230
for a new top-level domain.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.730
And that has actually happened.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.720
So over 1,400 new top-level
domain names have been approved

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.930
and are working their
way into the name space.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.220
In fact, there have been
over a million registrations

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.290
in the new top-level
domains since ICANN

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.960
opened this program.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.710
So the other important
thing to understand

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.300
is unlike those prior 15
new top-level domains,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.845
there are tons of
important interests

00:05:19.845 --> 00:05:22.190
that are invested in making
these new top-level domains

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.114
successful.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:25.155
Companies, not just Google,
but lots of companies

00:05:25.155 --> 00:05:28.200
that you've all heard about,
for whom top-level domains are

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.990
an incredibly important
part of their strategy.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.410
And even cities, like New
York, London, and Berlin,

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.511
are getting into the
top-level domain business.

00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:39.760
So it's really, really likely
that we're going to see,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.320
incredibly likely,
it's a given, I think,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.410
that we're going to see
new names on the internet.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.260
And I think we'll be talking
to our children or our friends

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.760
children one day and laughing
about the days when there were

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.610
only seven top-level domains and
when finding a meaningful name

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.640
in .com was incredibly hard.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.920
So anyway, when ICANN
created this program,

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.864
we, Google, decided
to get involved.

00:06:01.864 --> 00:06:03.280
We care deeply
about the internet.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.863
The web is incredibly
important to us.

00:06:04.863 --> 00:06:07.780
And naming and location and
finding things on the web

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.060
is at the heart of what
we think our mission is.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.230
So that was why we created a
new business, Google Registry.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.270
Now let me tell you a little bit
about how this business works.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.010
In the world of naming
there are three participants

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.020
in the naming business.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.020
The first is a registry.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.510
You can think of it as a
factory that creates and manages

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.590
top-level domains, but they're
kind of the top-level domain

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.610
factory.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:31.700
Then there are registrars.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.290
These are the storefronts,
the businesses

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.740
that sell second-level domains
from n-tuple domains made

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.779
by registries to the public.

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:42.820
And we call the public
registrants, in this case.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.140
So registries create
top-level domains,

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.560
registrars sell names in
those top-level domains,

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.310
and registrants purchase
those top-level domains.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.620
And as I said, Google last
year launched a new business,

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.450
Google Registry, which is built
on App Engine, by the way.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.364
We run on the Google
Cloud Platform.

00:07:01.364 --> 00:07:02.780
And it provides
the infrastructure

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.340
for powering our
top-level domains.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.840
And in fact, as part
of that ICANN process,

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.500
we applied for about 100
new top-level domains.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.220
And these top-level
domains, as you

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.540
can see if you look at
the list on the screen,

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.830
reflect a variety of
potential business models

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.700
that we think are
going to emerge

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.430
in the world of this new
top-level domain name space.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.130
So we have a bunch
of cases of things

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.070
that are Google brands
or Google products,

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.825
and you can clearly understand
what their relationship is

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.450
to us and why we might do them.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.200
And then all the way
on the other extreme,

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.990
from things like
Android, and Chrome,

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.460
and .google as
top-level domains,

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.230
all the way on
the other extreme,

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.800
we have things like
.dad or .lol or .meme.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.010
More whimsical
things where we're

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.380
looking at other ways of
using domain names to light up

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.270
entirely new ways of
interacting with the internet.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.437
Now as it turns out,
other applicants,

00:07:55.437 --> 00:07:57.520
there are other parties
who are interested in some

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.974
of these top-level domains.

00:07:58.974 --> 00:08:01.140
Google may not end up in
possession of all of these,

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.230
but this was our intent.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.438
And this is where we started.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:10.050
So not only did we
think it was important

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.597
as the DNS name space, as the
top-level domain name space was

00:08:12.597 --> 00:08:14.680
expanding, did we think
it was important to create

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.990
a registry in new
top-level domains,

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.810
but it made us think hard
about the experience of getting

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:20.430
online.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.730
What it's always been
like, what it will be like,

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.080
what we would like
it to be like.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.990
And we realized that that
moment of bringing your business

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.920
online, bringing yourself
online, acquiring a domain

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.659
name, managing a
domain, these are

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:37.830
incredibly important experiences
in the lives of our customers.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.809
And we wanted Google
to be a part of that.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:41.940
Not only that, we
wanted to make sure

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.520
that Google could provide an
experience to people buying

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.510
domain names that was a Google
experience, that was one where

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.670
we thought we could set
the bar for what the user

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.470
experience and the quality
of that experience would be.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.630
And that was why we've launched
a new business, Google Domains,

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:01.360
which is a registrar which will
sell domains to the public,

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.140
to registrants.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.384
And these are not just
new top-level domains

00:09:04.384 --> 00:09:06.800
that we'll sell, not just
Google top-level domains, but as

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.100
many as possible.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.450
The historic top-level domains
that we all know about,

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.310
and as many of the 1,400
new top-level domains that

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.960
are coming online
as we can sell.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.940
So we think that
this registrar is

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.750
going to do a lot to help
us make the new names more

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.057
meaningful.

00:09:24.057 --> 00:09:26.640
But let me tell you a little bit
about the other features that

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.060
are coming in the registrar
in Google Domains.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.580
And I should point
out that we've

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.010
announced this as
a new business,

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.670
but we're not
feature complete yet.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.870
We're in a limited
access beta period.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.420
Soon I'll tell you how
to get a free code so you

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.680
can register a domain name,
or transfer an existing domain

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.429
name to Google domains.

00:09:47.429 --> 00:09:48.720
But we're not feature complete.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.600
We're still in beta.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.964
It's invite only
beta, as I mentioned.

00:09:53.964 --> 00:09:55.588
But here are some of
the things that we

00:09:55.588 --> 00:09:57.740
think are important about
what our registrar does.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.460
First of all, as I said,
it's a Google experience.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.210
And I think it's one
that you'll recognize

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.610
the signposts of with relation
to other Google products.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:10.540
Secondly, we want to make
things simple and transparent.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.850
So for example, we're
not going to charge.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.410
We're going to
build in the pricing

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.400
for private registration,
for example.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.280
We're going to build
in all the features

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.582
that you expect in one
price for the domains

00:10:21.582 --> 00:10:22.665
that you want to register.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.320
We want to make it incredibly
easy to find a name that's

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.349
meaningful to you, and
we're using technology

00:10:31.349 --> 00:10:32.890
from Google's
Knowledge Graph to help

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.650
you find domain names
in the top-level domains

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.650
that you care about, that
are meaningful to what

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:38.910
you're trying to search for.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.079
So we're going to
help you find names

00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:44.370
that you want to acquire,
help you acquire those names,

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.017
help you transfer names
in, help you manage them.

00:10:47.017 --> 00:10:48.600
And if you want to,
we'll make it easy

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.016
for you to transfer
the names away

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:52.940
from us if you decide you
don't like us as a registrar.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.390
We're going to give you
a live customer support.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.770
During the beta period, that
support is 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM,

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.540
but you'll be able to actually
talk to a person to get answers

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.320
to any problems you have
with your registration.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.550
And another thing that's
important to mention

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.130
is this is the
same infrastructure

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.260
that we use for
our own services.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.640
So we think it sets
an incredibly high bar

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.335
for reliability,
security, and performance.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.190
So we've also decided it was
really important to launch

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.960
with partners who can make
it really, really easy

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.800
for you to create
a great website.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.840
And so many people want to get
on the web in the first place,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.770
to create a website.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.840
So we've done very,
very deep integration

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:46.890
with four partners, Shopify,
Squarespace, weebly, and Wix,

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.610
to give Google
Domain's customers

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.540
the option of easily working
with and using these companies'

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.750
products for the sites
that they're creating

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.720
through the domains they
purchase through Google

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.310
Domains, the registrar.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.760
We worked really hard
to make the integration

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.380
of the registration experience
and the experience working

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.420
with the site builder
incredibly simple.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.749
It's a really deep integration.

00:12:10.749 --> 00:12:12.790
it's going to make it
really, really easy to use.

00:12:15.877 --> 00:12:18.420
Of course, I should mention
that use of these companies'

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.300
products is available
at an additional cost

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.310
beyond that of acquiring
your domain name.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.960
But, as I said, this is a beta.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.470
It's an early invite only
beta and we've gone about

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.220
as far as we can
go by just testing

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.070
the registrar on our
colleagues and ourselves.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.320
And this is why we're
moving to an invite

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.350
only beta period
because we want data.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.239
Apologies to Brent Spiner.

00:12:42.239 --> 00:12:44.030
I doubt he's in the
audience or watching us

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.405
on YouTube, but
Brent, apologies.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.810
We want data.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.386
We want your feedback
about the registrar.

00:12:52.386 --> 00:12:56.170
I'll remind you once more, we're
still not feature complete,

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.770
but we really want to hear what
you think of this experience.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.400
So, as I said, to
help you get started,

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.080
and feedback is so
important to us,

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.770
every Google I/O attendee
will get one free domain name

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:15.730
to acquire or to transfer
in into Google Domains.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.660
You'll get an email soon with
more information about that.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.940
I'll tell you more about
the email sign-up process

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.190
flow soon.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.150
So we're really excited
to get your feedback

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:29.170
to help us make this
a great product.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:33.510
Now kind of as a transition,
1,400 new top-level domains

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.550
are being created in
the world right now.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.050
And although we're really
excited about what this means

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.760
for solving the problems
of domain name exhaustion,

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.410
or domain name space
exhaustion, unfortunately

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.300
there's an awful lot
of code out there

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.110
that is about to break
as a result of going

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.460
from a very small number
of top-level domains

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.260
to a very, very large
number of top-level domains.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.980
And the person at Google who's
responsible for making sure

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.380
that we fix all the code that
breaks is Kripa Krishnan, who's

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.400
here to tell you
about what you need

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.120
to do to fix your
code that's going

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.830
to break as a result of this.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.972
Kripa, over to you.

00:14:06.972 --> 00:14:08.180
KRIPA KRISHNAN: Hi, everyone.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:08.888
My name is Kripa.

00:14:08.888 --> 00:14:11.270
I'm a technical program
manager at Google.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:16.055
And I'm here to tell you about--
to worry about the concerns

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:18.430
that we have to face and the
issues that we have to face,

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.050
as hundreds of new TLDs
enter our internet ecosystem.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.982
So let's just dive
in very quickly

00:14:23.982 --> 00:14:25.940
and start looking through
a series of examples,

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.170
and we can see how this is
actually going to play out.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.830
Taking a look at this
slide, there are three TLDs.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:35.810
.foo, .photography,
and .minna in Japanese.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:40.030
Nothing special about them,
except they're all new strings.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.030
And hundreds more, if
I recall correctly,

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.590
close to 1,500
new TLDs are going

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.240
to be entering our ecosystem.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.280
They are much longer than
some of our old strings.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.064
We had a limited set
of TLDs in the past.

00:14:52.064 --> 00:14:54.230
And if you look at the new
TLDs, the lengths of them

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.710
are quite unpredictable.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.990
And they now come in a host
a brand new characters.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.290
In the past, we had a very,
very ASCII, Roman character set,

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.730
very dominantly on the internet.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.950
Now we have new character
sets from various languages

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.110
and scripts.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.500
So just the fact that
you have new strings,

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.171
new lengths of strings,
and new characters,

00:15:14.171 --> 00:15:15.920
lends itself to a host
of different issues

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.106
that we need to worry about.

00:15:17.106 --> 00:15:19.230
So we're going to talk
about a few of these issues.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.779
There's several
more to consider.

00:15:20.779 --> 00:15:22.820
The point of my talk here
is not to just tell you

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.403
all the various
problems that we have.

00:15:24.403 --> 00:15:26.455
I'd like to offer a few
fixes, but something

00:15:26.455 --> 00:15:28.580
so you can take home with
you, and sort of consider

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.230
as you start designing your
applications if they're working

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.750
with URLs or email
addresses in general.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.740
So let's start talking about
validation of new TLDs,

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.720
or TLDs in general.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.020
Just a show of hands in the
audience, how many of you

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.130
have written any
code to validate

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.320
a URL or an email address?

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.860
How many of you believe
you got it right?

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.260
Wow.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.100
That was a significant
drop of hands.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.600
But the reason is,
it's complicated.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.030
It's hard.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.550
It's not a
straightforward problem.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.920
And nobody builds a consistent
set of rules around this.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.127
A lot of rules for
validation are hard-coded.

00:16:03.127 --> 00:16:04.710
So it's very hard
for two applications

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.760
to actually do the same
thing on the internet.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.760
So in our research, when we
were trying to find issues

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.480
with the way we validate code,
we found several such issues.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.740
And I'll walk you through
a handful of them.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.260
One of the issues
that we found was

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.680
validating based on
the length of a TLD.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.640
For a very long time, when
we had a few dozen TLDs,

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.150
.museum was one of our longest
TLDs and it had just six

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.080
characters.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.800
So a lot of validation
scripts around,

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.650
hey, if the TLD is longer than
six characters, reject it.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:34.940
It's no longer valid.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.381
So that obviously doesn't
work in the new world

00:16:37.381 --> 00:16:39.380
because there are several
new TLDs coming about.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.689
And we don't know if this
is the final wave of TLDs

00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:42.230
coming about.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.896
We don't know if ICANN will come
out and say, have a bunch more.

00:16:44.896 --> 00:16:47.610
So this is not a usable
solution any more.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.430
Another approach
people often use

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.720
is they create a white
list in their code.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.160
And the white list
has a list of TLDs.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.250
So if your application
is using TLDs

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:00.670
that are part of that hard-coded
white list, then great.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:01.565
It all works.

00:17:01.565 --> 00:17:02.710
Else it's rejected.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.160
Well, this kind of might
have worked for a while

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.369
because the number of TLDs
we had was somewhat static.

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:11.079
Had a few dozen, so you
could hard-code a white list.

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.380
For a little while, it was OK.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.355
But right now we're looking
at crazy refresh rates, right?

00:17:15.355 --> 00:17:17.369
They're talking 1,500 new TLDs.

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:20.260
And so doing this sort of
white list creation thing

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.550
is impractical,
completely not feasible.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.920
Probably time for us to
throw this technique out.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.770
So this is not a great idea.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.940
And finally, another
type of example

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.120
we've seen in hard-coding
validation rules,

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.180
is one where you check
for whether the TLD is

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.890
in ASCII characters.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.550
It doesn't work
anymore because we

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:42.190
have 100 of the 1,500 new
top-level domains are all

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.850
going to be in various
languages and various scripts.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:49.430
And this validation method
rejects several applications

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.920
that should be working.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.060
So these are minor-ish in
terms of the problem space

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.127
I'm stating.

00:17:55.127 --> 00:17:56.210
Why does this even matter?

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.660
Why is this even important?

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.220
Well, there's one reason.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.110
On the internet,
your email address

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.390
is your primary identifier.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.030
You can sign up
for a bank account

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.730
if you'd like, probably with
a user name and a password.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.490
But if your account
is getting hijacked,

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.940
the bank needs to validate
your email letters correctly

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.180
and send you a note and
not a note to dev/null.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.513
You need to know something's
going on with your account.

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:19.930
The Internet communicates
with you via email,

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.882
and if different
applications on the internet

00:18:21.882 --> 00:18:24.340
are validating different email
addresses in different ways,

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.210
failing silently
in some cases, not

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.190
a great experience for the user.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.550
So now what?

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.890
We get from what do we do
with respect to validation.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.796
So do you actually need
to validate TLDs at all?

00:18:36.796 --> 00:18:38.670
You might want to consider
if it's worthwhile

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.184
just not validating TLDs at all.

00:18:40.184 --> 00:18:42.100
Treat them like SLDs,
allow any sort of values

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.600
to go through, unless there is
a solid reason for your product

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.420
to actually validate a TLD.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.920
And these reasons do exist.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.420
For example, if you take
the Chrome address bar,

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.540
Chrome actually likes
to pre-determine

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.340
whether a string that someone
puts into the address bar

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.590
is a URL or a search term, so
it can treat it accordingly.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.510
So in this manner, yes,
validation is important.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.100
And if you do have to
validate in such a case,

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.970
then use something
more authoritative

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.330
than a hard-coded list or
a hard-coded set of rules.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.020
Authoritative sources could
be things like Mozilla Public

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.146
Suffix List, or you could
check against DNS, for example.

00:19:16.146 --> 00:19:17.520
These are just
ideas for what you

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.360
could do with respect
to validation,

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.460
but it is worthwhile
considering whether or not

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.539
you actually need
to validate a TLD.

00:19:23.539 --> 00:19:25.205
So we talked a little
bit of validation.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.380
Validation pretty much
tells you whether or not

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.290
an end user can work with
your application or not.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:37.110
So now I want to show you a set
of issues that confuse the end

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.310
user because you're surfacing
the problems with these TLDs

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.310
to an end user.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.080
So we talk about a
handful of display issues.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.514
So let me ask you
guys a question.

00:19:45.514 --> 00:19:47.430
If you know the answer,
just raise your hands.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:51.210
So if I were to
type www.example.com

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.710
in the body of something, in
the body of my Gmail message,

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:59.430
or if I type www.example.com,
press Space in a document,

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.760
what is the expected result?

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.000
Do you guys know what
is supposed to happen?

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.440
It's supposed to link, yeah?

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.850
Ideally, it's supposed to link.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.650
In our own products, this
is what we found at Google.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.230
Different products,
all of these URLs

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.840
in, I guess my left,
or right, whatever,

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.970
one of them, set of URLs
is absolutely correct.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.920
And they're all valid, but
each application actually

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.730
figures out whether they
are TLD and auto-linkifies

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:23.540
in their own way.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.970
So there's no consistency
even within our own products.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.200
We found this to be
a very big issue.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.700
It sounds pretty
silly right now,

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.180
but if you really
think about it,

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.215
a user copying and pasting
a URL from app to app

00:20:33.215 --> 00:20:35.590
will have completely different
behaviors from app to app.

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:36.820
Seems small, but
we are working very

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.944
hard on trying to standardize
these sorts of things

00:20:38.944 --> 00:20:40.840
and fixing this
within our products.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.400
Let's take a slightly
more complicated example.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.920
So in the case where your
top-level domains are

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.722
made of internationalized
characters,

00:20:48.722 --> 00:20:50.930
we refer to them for the
purpose of this presentation

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.660
as internationalized
domain names.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.680
Internationalized domain
names are domain names

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.054
where any part of
the domain name

00:20:56.054 --> 00:20:58.000
has something of a
different script that

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.874
is not a Roman character.

00:21:00.874 --> 00:21:02.790
I would like to dive
into a tiny bit of detail

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.170
as to how this actually
works, so we can talk to you

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.878
about the kinds of
problems this actually

00:21:06.878 --> 00:21:08.510
surfaces to an end user.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:10.470
In this example, in
the blue box you've

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.600
got a Russian domain name.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.760
The Russian domain
name is human readable

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.970
and is encoded by an
encoding called Unicode.

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.840
However, the internet at
large, DNS specifically,

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.300
doesn't understand Unicode.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.740
And it needs to translate this
Unicode into ASCII characters

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.780
for us to be able to move this
data through our DNS service.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.030
So for this to happen, we
use encoding called Punycode

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:34.180
to translate between the Unicode
domain name and the ASCII

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:34.920
version.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.950
What I'm really saying is that
the stuff in the blue box that

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.330
says Unicode and the stuff
in the yellow box that's says

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.450
ASCII both point to the
exact same location.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.200
And the only reason
the ASCII version,

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.020
the xn dash dash
version exists, is

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.020
so that you can talk to
the rest of the internet

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.410
in the back end.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.740
So what's the problem?

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.297
Here's an example.

00:21:52.297 --> 00:21:53.380
Let's say I have a friend.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.754
My friend's name
is Testing IDNs,

00:21:54.754 --> 00:21:56.740
and my friend has a
Russian email address.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.000
I put this person's address in
my address book in Contacts.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.540
Looks great.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:01.580
Everything's good.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.650
Now I want to send
my friend an email.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:07.670
So I say to Testing IDNs in the
To field, and if you notice,

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.380
the auto-complete over there
gives me the correct email

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.410
address for Testing IDNs,
except it translates it back

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:14.470
to the Punycode version.

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.636
So you'd see that it's the
exact same email address,

00:22:16.636 --> 00:22:19.380
but now it has the
xn dash dash version.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.800
So to most users, these
two are not the same.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.300
This is a very
confusing experience.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.740
Most people don't know if
they're doing a safe thing

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.240
or not.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.690
This actually is quite sad.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.759
And if you were noticing,
this is Google's Gmail

00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:32.300
and Google's Contacts,
and we thought

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.760
this was highly embarrassing.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.524
So we just went ahead
and we fixed it.

00:22:35.524 --> 00:22:37.190
In the next few weeks,
you will actually

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:41.580
find this rolling out to all
of your inboxes eventually.

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.830
Anyway, so what
actually happened here?

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.240
Why are we surfacing this?

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.200
This is what we did.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.630
We take this system that we
use to transcribe and move

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.930
stuff along the internet,
and present this ASCII

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.620
version directly to the users.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.339
Simple fix.

00:22:55.339 --> 00:22:57.630
Just make sure you translate
everything back to Unicode

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:58.296
at client level.

00:22:58.296 --> 00:23:01.060
Every client upgrades to Unicode
when presenting information

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:04.250
to the end user, unless there
is an actual reason not to.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.260
Yeah, just translate
everything to Unicode.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.640
If you are paying
very close attention,

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.470
you might notice
that this actually

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.680
comes with it a problem.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.660
And this is a
problem in security.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.450
If I were to just show Unicode
characters to my end users,

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.740
we could end up with, just for
the purposes of an example,

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:26.575
something like this.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.510
Do you see a difference
between www.google.com

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:34.355
and www.google.com?

00:23:34.355 --> 00:23:37.110
These are actually
quite different,

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.180
even though they are
virtually indistinguishable

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.945
in certain fonts.

00:23:41.945 --> 00:23:43.570
In a different font,
you could actually

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:45.640
see that the google.com
in the second row

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.350
actually has Greek characters
in place of other O's that we're

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.260
using in the first google.com.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.752
So it is that easy to dupe
a user into using a site

00:23:53.752 --> 00:23:55.710
that they believe they
are on when they're not.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:56.793
This is not a new problem.

00:23:56.793 --> 00:23:57.660
It exists today.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.176
However, the scope of
it is much, much larger

00:24:00.176 --> 00:24:01.550
with the large
number of new TLDs

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:04.730
and the large number
of IDNs we have.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:08.110
Some products tend to
solve this by exposing

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:11.180
the Punycode version of
that, especially for IDNs.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.400
They surface the Punycode
version to the user

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.920
because Punycode is a
fingerprint for every URL.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.610
But to an end user, if you
show them a www.xn dash dash

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.520
sort of domain,
they are actually

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.850
feeling even more insecure
than they were a minute ago.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.610
So this is not a great
experience either.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.520
Unfortunately, we don't have
a great, simple one line

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.176
solution for this just yet.

00:24:31.176 --> 00:24:32.800
We are experimenting
with a few things.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.790
We are definitely
experimenting with things

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:36.706
like warning messages
to educate the user

00:24:36.706 --> 00:24:38.830
if they are using character
sets or mixed character

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.350
sets that they may
not be aware of.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.350
So at the moment we're
playing around with this,

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.990
but we don't have a
straightforward solution.

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:45.350
The point of this is
there are several others.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.340
If you keep looking
under the hood,

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.180
there's several other issues.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.460
How do you normalize TLDs?

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.600
How do you store TLDs?

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.494
How do you index them as
the environment changes?

00:24:52.494 --> 00:24:53.910
And the point of
this is we really

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.060
need to take this into
consideration as you start

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.720
developing code where you
are using URLs or email

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.300
addresses primarily.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.620
Now we also really want to help.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.440
So in whatever way we
can, we'd like to help.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.110
And to this end, we
have launched a new tool

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:13.970
in the last week or two.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.010
We've been working very
hard towards this tool.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.670
We've worked on a tool
that will help developers

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.491
use their applications
and validate TLDs

00:25:20.491 --> 00:25:22.990
against their applications to
make sure that there's nothing

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.607
in their stack,
maybe UTF-8 issues,

00:25:24.607 --> 00:25:26.690
if you're using a hard-coded
white list, whatever,

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.460
to surface these issues and
tell you how the TLD actually

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.450
interacts with your application.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.080
This is not particularly new.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.015
There are other such
examples that do exist.

00:25:37.015 --> 00:25:38.890
However, the two big
differences between this

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.050
are we would like to
launch this tool on

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.620
pretty much every
new TLD if we can,

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.380
on as many new TLDs as
possible, and we would also

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.296
give you the ability to test
email with this same tool.

00:25:49.296 --> 00:25:50.420
So let's just dive into it.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:51.310
It's a simplistic thing.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.518
So let's just walk through
it and see how this works.

00:25:53.518 --> 00:25:55.210
The tool's called
Domain Test, and you

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:56.910
would find it on
several new TLDs.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:00.140
For example, domaintest.foo,
domaintest.photography,

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.601
domaintest.minna.

00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:03.600
The canonical source for
this is domaintest.foo.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.652
We'll see a few more
examples in a little bit.

00:26:05.652 --> 00:26:07.110
Let me walk you
through an example.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:11.290
And for example, let's
use domaintest.minna.

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:14.770
So what I'm going to do is go
to the site domaintest.minna,

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.330
and Domain Test,
as a tool, supports

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.030
a whole host of HTTP commands.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.030
If you look at this,
you will actually

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:21.280
notice that we support a
whole bunch of Echo and Stash

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.760
commands, so you can
use this for an example.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.330
So in my Chrome browser,
I'm going to go ahead

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:27.700
and type domaintest.minna.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.350
And I'm going to ask my tool
to echo back to me a string,

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:33.400
and the string over
here is, hello world.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.120
So it's a browser, it
should technically work.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.620
And if it works,
everything is good.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.940
So here's what I get.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.050
I get hello world
back from this URL.

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:41.550
Great.

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.810
Everything is dandy.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.670
Now we need to see if
this would actually

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.760
work on a different
Google product.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:51.390
So let's try something
with Google+.

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:56.590
So if I were to, by accident,
sign in to Ben's Google+

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:59.254
account and then
try to post as him.

00:26:59.254 --> 00:27:00.670
And I want to see
if URLs actually

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:03.900
work in the link field
in this share box.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.880
So what I would do is I would
take the exact same URL,

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.950
domaintest.minna, and
I'm trying to echo

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:10.960
the same thing, hello
world, back to me.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.780
So what you'd notice is that
it would echo hello world back

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.240
to me, but you'd also
notice that it displays

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.867
the Punycode version
of domaintest.minna.

00:27:19.867 --> 00:27:20.950
So you know there's a bug.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.500
You go file it, and you've
got to try to get it fixed.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.875
So this is sort
of how this would

00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:25.020
work with your application.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.370
The second thing that
we tried to do over here

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:31.742
is that this tool also has
a feature for email testing.

00:27:31.742 --> 00:27:33.450
So this is something
that's a little new.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.020
And here's how are
we're going to try

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:39.910
to test an email application
to see if this tool works.

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:43.400
Send an email to any
mailbox at domaintest.minna.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.520
Again Domain Test
exists on several TLDs,

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.700
so I'm using domaintest.minna
for our example.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.840
And I'm sending a note in
Gmail to say, test everything.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.744
And if you notice,
many of you might

00:27:53.744 --> 00:27:55.160
have complained
about this before,

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.660
but Gmail actually does not work
with internationalized domains.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.720
So this was also
equally embarrassing.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.970
So geez, we just went
ahead and fixed that, too.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:06.910
So we'll show you an example of
what happens in a dev instance,

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.470
but in a few weeks, you will
see this roll out to all inboxes

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.470
where you will be able
to send and receive email

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:13.011
to all internationalized
domain names

00:28:13.011 --> 00:28:15.760
and pretty much
any TLD there is.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.200
In our dev instance,
this is how this works.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.710
We would be sending a note to
a mailbox at domaintest.minna.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.869
You will see that
the message got sent.

00:28:24.869 --> 00:28:26.910
So you have validation
that the message got sent.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.900
And you will also receive a
confirmation email in return

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.190
to show you that both your
incoming and outgoing email

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:34.410
have actually worked.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.270
So this actually
works on Gmail today.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.110
And that's pretty much it.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.760
The great thing about this is as
soon as we launched this tool,

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.200
we tried to ask a few
registries if they would like

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:53.200
to host Domain Test in TLDs
that they were responsible for.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.550
And here's what we got.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:58.440
Within the last couple of
weeks actually, over 126,

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.090
or I think roughly
126 new TLDs now

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.600
have Domain Test
running on them.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.516
Domaintest.foo is still
your canonical source,

00:29:04.516 --> 00:29:07.077
thanks to Donuts,
Uniregistry, and AusRegistry,

00:29:07.077 --> 00:29:08.660
and there are several
more on the way.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:09.840
They're ready to actually
host Domain Test.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.215
So you can go play
with this now.

00:29:11.215 --> 00:29:12.290
It's live.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.270
And if you have any
questions, there

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:15.660
are ways to get
to us from there.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.444
And that's pretty much it.

00:29:17.444 --> 00:29:19.610
From this point on, I'm
going to hand it back to Ben

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.300
to talk through the
potential that we

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.080
have the new TLDs going forward.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:24.995
BEN FRIED: Thank you.

00:29:24.995 --> 00:29:30.340
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.170
So I wanted to talk just
for, so we kind of gave you

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:36.570
the big picture about lots
of new top-level domains.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.180
Names on the internet are
never going to be the same.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:43.987
We talked a bit about creating a
new registrar business and what

00:29:43.987 --> 00:29:46.320
we think that means for the
experience of coming online.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.960
Kripa talked about the bugs
this may introduce in your code

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.960
and what to do about it.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.956
I wanted to end on hopefully the
high note of talking about what

00:29:53.956 --> 00:29:56.580
we think our vision for what the
internet may be like with some

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.840
of these top-level domains.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.342
And I'm going to do that
by talking about our plans

00:30:00.342 --> 00:30:01.800
and tell you a bit
about what we're

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.240
planning to do with
some of those almost

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.110
100 top-level
domains that I put up

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:09.144
on a slide a few minutes ago.

00:30:09.144 --> 00:30:11.310
So the very first top-level
domain that we launched,

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.880
and this actually went live
in December of last year,

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.196
is .minna.

00:30:15.196 --> 00:30:16.320
Kripa mentioned it earlier.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.200
Minna is the Japanese
word for everyone.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.650
And what was important
for us about this

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:26.220
is that the top-level domain is
in hiragana, a Japanese script.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.475
This was actually the
first top-level domain,

00:30:28.475 --> 00:30:32.280
the first generic top-level
domain, in a Japanese script.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.370
So it always struck
me as kind of strange

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:36.070
how Anglo-centric
the internet was,

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.940
that you have to understand
these strange abbreviations

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.830
of English language
words in order

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:43.680
to find sites meaningful to
you, even though you might not

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.610
speak English, or even
use a Roman alphabet.

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:48.780
And minna was important
to us because we

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.630
thought we could do an enormous
amount for the readability

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.340
of names on the
internet with it.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.950
And this was obviously
just a starter.

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:58.980
As Kripa mentioned earlier,
there's going to be,

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.270
and if you looked at the
TLD list that I put up,

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:05.610
you'll see that there are going
to be domain names in Russian,

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.910
in Chinese, in
Japanese, in Hebrew,

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.761
in many languages
coming very soon.

00:31:09.761 --> 00:31:12.260
So the internet is going to be
a lot more friendly to people

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.880
who don't use Roman scripts.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:19.410
So thinking about what we
do next at Google with new

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:21.897
top-level domains, one of the
next top-level domains that

00:31:21.897 --> 00:31:23.980
we're going to launch, we
haven't launched it yet,

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.460
is .soy.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:30.150
And in this case, we're using
it to mean the Spanish word

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:31.710
for I am.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:35.240
And what we want is to make
.soy be a top-level domain

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.250
for Latinos.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:40.120
In America, Hispanics are
one of the fastest growing

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.280
groups in the
country, and our goal

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.850
is to make this
top-level domain be

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.500
known as a place
where there is content

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.370
particularly
meaningful to Latinos.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:53.900
So we're going to work with
site creators and businesses,

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.980
content consumers,
content producers,

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.790
to create content
in .soy for Latinos.

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:04.910
But there are more things you
can do with top-level domains

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:08.680
than create meaningfulness
through readability.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.340
And there are examples of
this that you're all already

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:11.940
familiar with.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:16.650
If you think of .gov or .edu,
these are examples of top-level

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:19.720
domains where there are
restrictions to who can

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.450
register in those
top-level domains.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.330
And those restrictions
actually provide a service

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:26.450
to the registrants in
those top-level domains

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:29.100
and provide a lot of
value to the users, people

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.097
visiting URLs and using
sites and interacting

00:32:32.097 --> 00:32:33.680
with sites in these
top-level domains.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.724
Obviously, if you
go to a .edu site,

00:32:35.724 --> 00:32:37.390
you know it's an
institute of education.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.330
If you go to a .gov site, you
know it must be a United States

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:43.680
based government
agency of some sort.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.320
And with that same kind
of motivation in mind,

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.100
we are planning
on launching .esq.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.270
Imagine a top-level domain
where every registrant

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:55.660
has been verified
to be a lawyer.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.590
Imagine Jack
Donaghy.esq, for example,

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.070
would mean Jack
Donaghy the lawyer,

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:02.450
and not Jack Donaghy
the NBC executive,

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:06.409
if you want to go back to my
"30 Rock" example earlier.

00:33:06.409 --> 00:33:08.200
We think this is going
to be really, really

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.620
helpful to people, to lawyers,
and helping them provide names

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.766
that provide more meaning,
but also obviously

00:33:14.766 --> 00:33:16.640
to people who are using
these domains because

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:21.230
of the association that the
top-level domain will provide.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:25.040
So we've talked about
using the top-level domain

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.060
to provide more meaning
in language, in script,

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.610
in restriction.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:33.030
One of the other things
that we're planning on doing

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:37.040
is creating actual features
within the top-level domain

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:41.452
that provide special meaning
to the community of users.

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:43.160
One of the places
we're going to do this,

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.520
the first place we're going
to do this, is in .foo.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.570
.foo is going to be a top-level
domain for people like you,

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:53.240
developers, people
who care about code.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.960
We're planning on launching
features like requiring that

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.730
every site in .foo, there be
a well-known address that gets

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:05.054
you to the source code
repository for that site.

00:34:05.054 --> 00:34:07.470
We're thinking about doing
things like making .foo provide

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:10.590
very, very simple Click to
Publish to a cloud hosting,

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:13.110
to a cloud hoster
features, for example.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:15.940
These are things that we can do
by actually building features

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.690
into the top-level level domain
that didn't exist before,

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:20.670
and we think that we
can actually then create

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.767
new kinds of meaning for
important communities

00:34:22.767 --> 00:34:24.350
with the top-level
domain in this way.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:32.719
So that's just a hint
of what we're planning.

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:35.469
If I would go back to the
very beginning of the talk,

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:37.949
the thing that I think I'd
like you all to walk away with

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:40.520
is that we're
actually at the start

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.389
of a new phase in the internet.

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:45.154
Names on the internet are
never going to be the same.

00:34:45.154 --> 00:34:46.820
They've only just
begun these new names,

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:50.949
so we don't really know how
it's all going to play out.

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:53.370
But we are going to
be there absolutely.

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:56.179
And I know that we're going
to look back in 10 years

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:58.920
and think about how different
the internet was in an era

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:02.690
when there were only a
handful of top-level domains.

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:05.740
So thanks for listening.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.590
Oh, right!

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.100
Free domain registration.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.250
I promised you all free domain
registration or a free domain

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:12.470
transfer.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:16.630
On July 9th, expect an email
with an invitation code, which

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:19.480
you can use to get your
free domain registration

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.194
or transfer.

00:35:22.194 --> 00:35:24.360
I should mention that Google
Domains, our registrar,

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.040
is only available in the US.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.710
We're working on adding other
countries as quickly as we can.

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:32.630
There you have it.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.280
And thank you very much.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.795
We'll take Q&amp;A.

00:35:35.795 --> 00:35:38.705
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:35:43.637 --> 00:35:44.470
Are there questions?

00:35:49.206 --> 00:35:50.580
AUDIENCE: Yes, I
have a question.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:54.585
Is Google Domains going to
also do the DNS part or?

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:55.210
BEN FRIED: Yes.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:59.010
So Google Domains hosts, yeah,
can host your DNS service.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:35:59.510
Yes.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.926
AUDIENCE: Is it just going to
be a simple one or something

00:36:01.926 --> 00:36:05.730
that's fully capable of handling
sub-domains and all that?

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:06.380
BEN FRIED: Yes.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.220
It will be capable of
handling sub-domains.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.500
We'll give you something
like 100 sub-domains

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.200
for free bundled in.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.920
We'll also give you
domain redirects,

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.670
a whole bunch of other
features like that.

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:17.225
Yes.

00:36:17.225 --> 00:36:19.350
AUDIENCE: Folks were really
excited or disappointed

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:22.680
with GoDaddy's response to
SOPA and all that good stuff,

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.630
and it's getting
really political

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:28.060
as domain ownership expands,
and now there's many more TLDs.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.060
Has Google taken a
position how they're

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.570
going to deal with the political
environment for domains,

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:34.127
and censorship, and
stuff like that?

00:36:34.127 --> 00:36:35.710
BEN FRIED: We don't
have any positions

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.690
we're ready to talk about
on those matters now.

00:36:40.205 --> 00:36:41.580
AUDIENCE: I just
saw on your site

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.260
that you're providing domain
aliases, email aliases,

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.400
and forwarding it to Gmail.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.290
So how does it work when I
want to mail with that alias?

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:50.740
There was no details on that.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.490
Like say if I have my, say,
sandip@google.com-- that's

00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:00.210
my name-- and you're
forwarding that mail to,

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:03.492
I think your personal
Gmail address.

00:37:03.492 --> 00:37:04.200
BEN FRIED: Right.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.480
And your question
is-- yes, that's

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.563
the intent of the feature.

00:37:06.563 --> 00:37:09.900
AUDIENCE: How do I reply from
that alias domain name itself?

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.900
KRIPA KRISHNAN: I might
be answering this wrong.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.310
If I am, please let me know.

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:16.470
I think you are looking to
send an email to any mailbox

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:19.650
for example, test@domaintest
dot whatever TLD you might want,

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:20.150
right?

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.691
AUDIENCE: No.

00:37:20.691 --> 00:37:24.384
[INAUDIBLE] the description says
if I have sandip@google.com,

00:37:24.384 --> 00:37:26.050
it gets forwarded to
your personal Gmail

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:27.830
address, whatever it is.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:31.670
And then if I want to mail back
with sandip@google.com itself,

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:32.440
how do I do that?

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:35.106
COREY GOLDFEDER: In general, you
can set up domain email aliases

00:37:35.106 --> 00:37:35.680
from Gmail.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.660
As long as you can receive
email at the alias, it gets--

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.490
BEN FRIED: And yes.

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:42.210
And we're not restricting
that to just be Gmail, right?

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:45.159
But work with your mail
agent or your mail provider

00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:46.950
to change the settings
to allow you to send

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:51.320
mail to come from that domain,
but each mail product generally

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.430
has ways of doing that.

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:53.847
It's specific to the product.

00:37:53.847 --> 00:37:55.180
AUDIENCE: Maybe just a feedback.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.820
Like if you can give
at least one Google

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.580
Apps ID with that,
that would have

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:03.420
been a much more better
way than making an alias

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.610
and making it complicated.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:06.795
Thank you.

00:38:06.795 --> 00:38:08.170
AUDIENCE: You seem
to be painting

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:10.795
a very rosy picture
about the domain names.

00:38:14.054 --> 00:38:15.970
Do you have any concerns
about cybersquatting,

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:18.200
about people who were
going to be reserving

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:23.800
the exact same name
across 150, 200, 300 TLDs?

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.760
Because we're seeing that now.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.680
It's not helping the
name exhaustion problem.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.610
It's increasing the confusion,
and the common perception

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:36.856
is that the only people that
are benefiting from the new TLDs

00:38:36.856 --> 00:38:38.380
are the registrars.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.292
And you're a registrar.

00:38:42.292 --> 00:38:43.000
BEN FRIED: Right.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.760
So our registrar
and our registry

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.180
are separate business entities.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:51.010
We're not doing this to
enrich one or the other.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.970
I think we see a bunch of the
same problems that you see

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.550
and that you've pointed out.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.290
And one of the
things that we think

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:02.490
is a great opportunity
with new top-level domains

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:06.240
is to create rules
that prevent a bunch

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.530
of the negative attributes
that have taken place

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.080
around top-level domains.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.360
The specifics I think will vary
based on the top-level domain

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:17.279
and what we try to
do, but it's our hope

00:39:17.279 --> 00:39:19.820
that there's an opportunity to
get a clean start here and try

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.240
to prevent some of the things
in the new top-level domains

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.860
that are accepted
practices in the old ones.

00:39:27.519 --> 00:39:29.810
Since I didn't even see that
there's a line back there,

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:31.310
I'll take another question
from the back mic,

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:32.990
and then I'll move to
the group in front.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:34.948
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm wondering
about search engine

00:39:34.948 --> 00:39:35.850
optimization.

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:39.390
So if I have a website
and it's website.com,

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.930
and I have resources for
programmers on that website,

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:45.950
website.com/programmers, that
programmers part of the site is

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:50.580
benefiting from website.com
being in existence for 10 years

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.130
in the search engine.

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:55.440
So if I follow the
practice you proposed

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.750
and make website.foo and move
my resources for programmers

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.772
there, how can I
guarantee that I'm still

00:40:01.772 --> 00:40:03.480
going to get good
search engine rankings?

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:10.370
BEN FRIED: So gosh, I'm not
a search engine optimization

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:12.900
expert.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:16.440
But I think at Google
we pride ourselves

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.130
on helping people find
things on the internet

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:20.472
and making search work.

00:40:20.472 --> 00:40:22.180
And we're really
committed to making sure

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:25.300
that Google Search
works fantastically well

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.580
across the whole 1,400
new top-level domains that

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:28.920
are going to be coming out.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.450
Beyond that, I can't kind of
offer you any more specifics.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:33.710
I think we're all going
to see how this plays out

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:36.210
as these domains get
adopted and used.

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:38.660
But Google Search
isn't about favoring

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.160
one top-level domain
over the other.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.597
It's about allowing people to
find things on the internet.

00:40:42.597 --> 00:40:44.180
We hope that the new
top-level domains

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.804
makes those things
more memorable,

00:40:45.804 --> 00:40:47.470
makes them more
meaningful, gives people

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:48.510
better naming choices.

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.310
We don't intend
to have that have

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:55.947
a negative effect
on searchabiity.

00:40:55.947 --> 00:40:56.780
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.905
COREY GOLDFEDER: Let me
chime in here for a second.

00:40:58.905 --> 00:41:00.962
Also one thing we've
heard from other operators

00:41:00.962 --> 00:41:02.670
of new top-level
domains, is that they're

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:04.461
recommending people in
your exact situation

00:41:04.461 --> 00:41:06.599
to use the new
domain as a redirect.

00:41:06.599 --> 00:41:08.140
So you get the name
space advantages,

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.730
but you still have
your canonical source.

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:12.610
BEN FRIED: I mean,
if you're working

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:15.610
getting in new top-level domains
now, you're a bit of a pioneer.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.225
And I think in a
matter of years,

00:41:18.225 --> 00:41:20.850
we'll all look back and realize,
oh, that was a great practice,

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.680
and that was something
that maybe didn't work out

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.471
so well, and so on.

00:41:23.471 --> 00:41:26.210
These are early days for
these new top-level domains.

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:30.350
In 1985, and some of us I don't
think were even alive in 1985,

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:33.990
but in 1985, who could have
predicted that .com would be

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:36.980
essentially all used up, right?

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.990
Sir?

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:42.422
AUDIENCE: So are
you guys predicting

00:41:42.422 --> 00:41:43.880
there's going to
be a huge adoption

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.040
rate with the new
top-level domains?

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.620
Because I notice even
in the existing market,

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.676
well, let's leave out
the 1,500 for now,

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:54.050
people will often
consider having

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:58.240
a name, foo.com,
foo.net, and they'll

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.490
think about food.biz, foo.org.

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:03.710
But anything besides
that, they're just,

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:05.209
I'm going to think
of a new name.

00:42:05.209 --> 00:42:06.750
Do you think this
is something that's

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:08.541
going to change within
the next five years,

00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:11.615
or are we looking at
adoption hopefully within 20?

00:42:16.979 --> 00:42:19.520
BEN FRIED: I'm not a guy who's
good at predicting the future.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.080
I wouldn't.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.550
Don't ask me for stock market
tips or things like that.

00:42:25.162 --> 00:42:27.120
I want to turn the question
around a little bit

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:30.440
and say that what happens with
these new top-level domains

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.180
is dependent on people like
you, who create sites, who

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:38.170
build apps, who through
the work that you do guide

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:39.905
how people use the internet.

00:42:39.905 --> 00:42:42.865
No one actually knows what, or
when, or how this will take up.

00:42:42.865 --> 00:42:44.740
I think there's a huge
qualitative difference

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:48.320
between the 1,400, 1,500 new
top-level domains and the 15

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.790
that were added to the
gTLD pool in 2000, 2004.

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:55.120
You can't even compare them
as being similar, right?

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.820
So I wouldn't want to make any
kind of predictions about time

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.789
frames, but I do think that
people like you and people

00:43:02.789 --> 00:43:05.080
like us will be doing an
awful lot to try to figure out

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:06.964
how to make these as
meaningful as possible.

00:43:06.964 --> 00:43:07.505
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:07.505 --> 00:43:10.160
Could you ask another
question on to that?

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.150
Is Google Domains,
or Google as itself,

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:16.310
going to do anything to
accelerate every country having

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:16.810
a ccTLD?

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:22.890
BEN FRIED: We have
no specific plans

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:24.940
around that as an objective now.

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.990
Google Domains is still in beta.

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:31.150
We're really focused now on
completing our feature set

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.896
and going to GA as we
get feedback from you

00:43:33.896 --> 00:43:35.270
all over the next
several months.

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:36.080
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.029
Thank you very much.

00:43:38.029 --> 00:43:38.820
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.500
Question about privacy service.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.830
Do you provide that only in the
US or for everybody outside?

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:46.900
And if somebody comes
from, say Utopia,

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:51.230
and is going to abuse a domain
that has privacy from you

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:53.450
on it, what will you
do with such a domain?

00:43:58.357 --> 00:44:00.440
COREY GOLDFEDER: So privacy
is at the WHOIS level,

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.320
so that's definitely
any privacy [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.869
That's a question
for Google Domains.

00:44:05.869 --> 00:44:07.160
I'm not from the registry team.

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.940
But I can tell you
that at the registry,

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:12.730
privacy is global
at the WHOIS level.

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:16.560
Generally, abuse is
also a registry issue.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.420
There are abuse stopping
ways of going to a registry

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.840
and saying that a
domain is abusive.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.840
And we support, for our
TLDs, the standard ones.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:28.410
And if you had an abusive
domain on any other TLD,

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:31.539
you would go to the registry
for that TLD for that purpose.

00:44:31.539 --> 00:44:33.330
AUDIENCE: So that means
that Google Domains

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:35.540
is going to other
registries to ask

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.466
to take these domain names down?

00:44:37.466 --> 00:44:38.840
BEN FRIED: It's
a great question.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:42.510
It's one that we're not prepared
to fully answer right now.

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:44.780
Brent, do you have
any-- so Brent,

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.380
who manages the team that
built Google Domains, is here.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.130
Do you have something to add?

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:50.750
I have a mic here
for you if you--

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.240
BRENT: So thank
you all for coming.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.520
So on a WHOIS, it will
work for all countries.

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.150
It's provided by a
partner that does it

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:03.400
actually out of New Zealand.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:07.630
So it's not a service
that's going to be US only.

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:09.920
And then about abuse.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.880
Abuse is handled
for every domain.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.450
It's a requirement with ICANN
that we verify email address.

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:20.126
We do know that there's a way to
contact the owner of the site.

00:45:20.126 --> 00:45:22.000
And that has to be
checked every single year,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.870
so that we make sure that
that's always up to date.

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:26.540
If there's an
abusive situation, we

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.840
can always use then the
email to contact them.

00:45:31.745 --> 00:45:32.870
You can inform us of abuse.

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:38.410
Every registrar has its own
abuse contact, either phone

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:39.630
number or email.

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:41.010
You can get that off the WHOIS.

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:42.970
You can also contact
the registries,

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:44.654
or you can contact ICANN.

00:45:44.654 --> 00:45:46.070
Abuse is a big
problem, and we try

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:47.653
to make sure that
that doesn't happen.

00:45:47.653 --> 00:45:49.403
So there's multiple
ways to handle that.

00:45:49.403 --> 00:45:50.090
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:54.695
Final question is, which ccTLDs
do you add on Google Domains?

00:45:54.695 --> 00:45:56.249
Is there any?

00:45:56.249 --> 00:45:57.790
BEN FRIED: No, why
don't you take it?

00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:59.040
BRENT: OK.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.980
So we're working to get
a number of ccTLDs out.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.392
We currently only have two.

00:46:05.392 --> 00:46:09.212
But we're working on increasing
that pretty significantly.

00:46:09.212 --> 00:46:10.920
So I don't know which
ones we're actually

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.397
going to launch the GA with.

00:46:12.397 --> 00:46:14.730
BEN FRIED: It's our goal to
support as many as possible.

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.563
There's only a few that
we've got right now,

00:46:16.563 --> 00:46:19.910
but there's a lot of leg work
to sign up with more ccTLDs.

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:20.792
We're doing it.

00:46:20.792 --> 00:46:21.500
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:24.865 --> 00:46:25.740
BEN FRIED: All right.

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.600
This it the last question
and then we have to move on.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.440
AUDIENCE: You'd mentioned that
you're not good at forecasting,

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.270
but just one more
question around that line.

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:37.230
You see that right
now, everybody

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:41.070
understands any web address
to be just an address.

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.420
If it is a edu,
you just understand

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:49.170
that it is a university,
but it's still just a link

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:50.944
to go to a place
to look at content.

00:46:50.944 --> 00:46:52.860
Obviously, with the stuff
that you're bringing

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:55.890
in, you're saying .foo will
be for developers and on top

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:58.665
of that, there is some added
features that's going to go

00:46:58.665 --> 00:46:59.165
with it.

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:04.970
So it's kind of like
you're choosing your horses

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:07.670
in the game that might
pan out in the future.

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:11.349
So do you see that to be kind
of a fragmented version of what

00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:13.390
things might be than
compared to right now, which

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:16.450
is just an address right now?

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:18.080
BEN FRIED: So I
think the goal is

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.780
to create new kinds of
meaning for a broad set

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:22.830
of constituencies.

00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:25.760
Meaning specific to those
constituencies for them

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.815
in ways that the internet
never was able to do before.

00:47:28.815 --> 00:47:31.315
You know what I'd like to see
happen with .foo, for example,

00:47:31.315 --> 00:47:34.390
is I'm imagining a top-level
domain where people post

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:35.920
their hobby projects,
for example.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.990
Or are companies that are all
open source in their software

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:40.890
development
practices, use those.

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:42.460
And you immediately
know, oh, .foo.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:44.989
if I'm curious about
how that website works,

00:47:44.989 --> 00:47:46.530
there's a well known
URL that I could

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.220
go to to find their
source code repository.

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:51.970
And there are things like
this that exist today.

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:55.840
People think about how they
use existing source code

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.350
repositories, for example.

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:00.170
Or how important it is for
some classes of developers

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:02.180
to post links to
their source code.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.970
I think that in
the case of .foo,

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:06.697
I think we can do all sorts of
things where we accelerate that

00:48:06.697 --> 00:48:08.780
and we create kind of new
features and new meaning

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:12.820
and new value for people in the
top-level domain name itself

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:14.751
that they were only able
to achieve otherwise.

00:48:14.751 --> 00:48:17.000
And I think it kind of all
will come together for them

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.333
through those top-level domains.

00:48:18.333 --> 00:48:23.310
So maybe, hopefully in a few
years, you say, oh, a .foo URL.

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:26.284
I know that's posted by
someone who cares about code

00:48:26.284 --> 00:48:27.700
and who cares that
other people be

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.830
able to see how they
built their website,

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:32.050
or how they built their
app, and how the code works.

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:34.619
I think that there will
probably, hopefully

00:48:34.619 --> 00:48:36.910
be a lot more of that on the
internet in several years.

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:38.367
That's certainly our hope.

00:48:38.367 --> 00:48:39.950
I don't know if
that-- that's the best

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.140
I can do to answer
your question.

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:41.931
We have to end now.

00:48:41.931 --> 00:48:43.700
The next team is coming
in for their talk.

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:44.825
So thank you all very much.

00:48:44.825 --> 00:48:47.690
