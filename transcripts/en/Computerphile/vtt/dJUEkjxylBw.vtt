00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
I haven't really thought about this, so be prepared for some vigorous hand waving.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.259
But my understanding of P, NP is that
there are a group of problems which we'll

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.359
call "P type" problems: polynomial-time type problems and these are problems

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.920
that are relatively easy to solve,
and then there is another group of problems

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.300
called non-polynomial (NP) and these are really hard to solve, okay?

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.800
Factoring is one of them, you know, if
I say to you - what are the factors of 15?

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.180
You can pretty quickly tell me that was
3 and 5. If i gave you a 10 or 20

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.649
or a 100 digit number,

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.539
factoring becomes really hard. So NP
problems are hard to do

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.860
P type -- easy, NP -- hard.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.340
The only nice thing about NP type
problems is that if I give you the answer,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.200
you can check it very quickly.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.129
So, if I gave you a hundred
digit number you wouldn't be able to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.280
factor it, but if I gave you the two
factors

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.900
you would very quickly be able to say: "Oh yeah they do multiply together to give this hundred digit number".

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.820
So NP -- hard to solve, easy to check.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.480
Now the question is this:

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.820
Are NP type problems fundamentally
different

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.520
to P type problems? Or maybe there's a way
that some of the NP-type problems,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.980
if we were smart enough, could become P-type problems, are there shortcuts that we just

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.110
don't know about? That is obviously
really important for computer scientists

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.350
because there are hard problems they're working on

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.649
if there are shortcuts that could make
them easy that would be a dream.

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.720
So NP -- hard, easy to check

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.049
P-type -- pretty easy to do and easy to
check.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.140
Are they fundamentally different? Are
they divided? or are they somehow.. could

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.780
NP become P-type if we were smart
enough?

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.780
Now I'm interested in this because

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.250
I've read a book about the Simpsons and in the Simpsons one of their Halloween

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.960
episodes "Treehouse of Horror VI", one of the writers, David X. Cohen.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.520
Back then he was known as David S. Cohen. I think he changed his name but that is

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.340
David S. Cohen back then. He
embedded in one of the episodes the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.180
equation P = NP. Now by saying that
P = NP Cohen was saying that he

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.680
believed that one day they could become unified.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.620
"Did anyone see the movie Tron?"

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.580
Now that's not a popular view: they take polls

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.730
of computer scientists and
mathematicians and they say: "look do you

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.340
think P equals NP or do you think he is
definitely not

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.030
NP?" and the general consensus is
that they are not the same. But David

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.209
Cohen in the Simpsons was saying: "well actually I kind of think maybe one day

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.030
they will become unified". In "Futurama"

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.260
(David X. Cohen kind of created Futurama along with Matt Groening).

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.610
It's not him it's another writer Jeff
Westbrook who was a Yale professor of

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.230
computer science before becoming a
Simpsons and Futurama writer and Simpsons

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.910
writer. In Futurama there is a scene
where Fry and Amy are hiding in a cupboard

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.489
and behind them

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.760
there are files and books and cans and
there are two files and one is labeled P

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.739
in one is labeled NP. So I think what
Jeff Westbrook is saying is P and NP

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.100
are fundamentally different and
they're in separate folders and you have

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.930
to keep them in separate folders because you can never turn an NP type problem into a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.420
P problem, so in Futurama we get the
opposite perspective on the problem

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.070
The generally more popular view of the problem. But the astonishing thing is

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.660
that it pops up in Futurama in prime-time television as it does with the Simpsons.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.950
&lt;When you say one's hard and one's easy

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.109
which is saying, for simplicity, is it black and white or is it  a gray thing

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.880
like is that a long walk

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.380
or depends how fit you are or are they fundamental structural differences?&gt;

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:21.660
It's the way that the
problem increases in difficulty with the

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.920
kind of numbers involved: so factoring (we talked about factoring) is easy if we

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.980
have a two digit number 15 is 3 times 5.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.870
If you have a three digit number 121 was
11 x 11 is a little bit

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.200
harder but so.. As the numbers get
bigger

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.340
my understanding is, and I'm ready
for the comments to correct me on this,

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.780
the problem increases in
difficulty in a non-polynomial way

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.220
that's where the NP bit comes in. So it's the way the problem gets harder,

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.360
the rate at which it gets harder, is what
defines it as a truly difficult problem.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.460

video, and if you'd like to check out a

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.160
huge range of audiobooks go to
audible.com/computerphile and you can

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.660
download one for free.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.860
We would like to recommend Simon's book "The Simpsons and their mathematical secrets".

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.889
We think both Computerphiles and Numberphiles would really enjoy that.

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.040
So get on to audible.com/computerphile

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.900
Download the free book and thanks once

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.020
again to them for supporting this
Computerphile video.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.300
1/10 + 2/10 does

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.940
not quite equal 3/10 because to
its mind

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.040
it doesn't.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.160
I might be able to do some
magic here that will replace 8

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.080
bytes in the word "computer" with a 2 byte composite pointer of this sort..
