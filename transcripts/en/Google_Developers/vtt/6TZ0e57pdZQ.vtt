00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
WESLEY CHUN: So this is
my co-worker Chris.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.490
My name is Wesley Chun.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.025
CHRIS SCHALK: Hello.

00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:06.840
WESLEY CHUN: We're on Google's
Developer Relations team.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.020
And we represent Google
Cloud Products.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.870
App Engine is the first cloud
product that we have launched.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.290
There will be plenty
more, coming soon.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.470
CHRIS SCHALK: Can you guys
hear me OK as well?

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.810
Now that I got my mic on.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.200
Thumbs up?

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.520
All right.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.890
So shall we kick it off?

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.858
WESLEY CHUN: Yeah, I just
did the intro already.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:28.350
CHRIS SCHALK: Anyway, so as Wes
was saying, we work in the

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.110
Developer Relations.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.330
I'm a developer advocate.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.920
Wes is a developer programs
engineer.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.200
We essentially do pretty much
very, very similar stuff.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.470
We reach out to essentially
build developer ecosystems.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.240
We help companies get on board
with Google technologies.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.240
We focus specifically on
our cloud technologies.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.530
So today, we're going to be
providing a general overview

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.910
of App Engine.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.120
So granted, if you've worked
with App Engine before, some

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.280
of it might be stuff
you already know.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.970
But there's definitely some
new stuff that we

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.440
want to talk about.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.920
Also, I think we want to use
this talk as a plug for our

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.310
lab that we're doing later
today, as well.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.700
And we definitely invite
you guys to come down.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.980
We have some new content.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.770
Actually, we created content
a while back.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.620
But then for Google I/O, just
recently, we have some new

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.670
content that we'd like to have
you have some fun with.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.130
So definitely App Engine.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.100
Some fun stuff we'll be doing
in the lab today.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.390
Anything else you want to say?

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.400
WESLEY CHUN: It's just
an extension to.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.780
If you guys have done the online
tutorial, we find that

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.200
great to get started.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.110
But it's kind of boring.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.300
And so that's why we created
these code labs.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.750
So it takes the existing online
tutorial, that lets you

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.230
build the Guest Book, and
we add more uses of

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.740
APIs on top of that.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.630
And then, as Chris mentioned, we
added some new things, over

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.450
the last couple of weeks,
on top of that.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.400
So there's actually three
parts to it all.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.330
The Guest Book Tutorial, the
Guest Book Tutorial++, and

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.620
then this new material that
we're going to introduce to

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.710
you guys, for the first
time, this morning.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.470
11:45 is the lab, if
you're curious.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.030
So just bring your lunch,
because it takes place around

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.240
the lunch hour.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.430
CHRIS SCHALK: So if you want to
play with like task queues,

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.480
URL fetch, cron jobs, deferred
task queues, actually, as well

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.760
as the Channel API, definitely
recommend you to check it out.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.530
Channel APIs a really
cool technology.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.520
I'll give you a demo of
it today as well.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.800
Also we did have our feedback
QR code, so if you want to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.670
give us live feedback
as we're talking.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.160
And then we even have
another one for in

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.340
our lab session today.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.440
And I'll have this slide
also at the end of the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.310
presentation, so you can
take a quick shot of

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.120
it if you need to.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.520
And then you can also
see the URL.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.230
It's a little bit hard
to see, sorry.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.130
But it should be OK.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.725
All right, let's jump
right into it.

00:02:30.725 --> 00:02:32.968
And we do go until
10:30, right?

00:02:32.968 --> 00:02:34.252
WESLEY CHUN: 9:30 to 10:30.

00:02:34.252 --> 00:02:36.610
CHRIS SCHALK: And feel
free to jump in.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.820
I'm just going to give you guys
a bit of a high level,

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.670
landscape view of where Google
App Engine fits in.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.230
So if you're familiar at all
with cloud technology, the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.450
analysts have generally-- and
it's not just the analysts,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.420
but the overall software
development community have

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.770
divided it up in the
three categories.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.050
So at the top, you see software
as a service.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.860
So these are the applications
that you guys are familiar

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.770
with, like Google Docs, and just
going online and using

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.100
productive cool technology,
entirely in the cloud.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.260
WESLEY CHUN: In fact, you
have to have a web

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.260
browser to use these.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.920
And that's the only way.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.860
It's not like having an Outlook
application on your

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.920
desktop to check your email.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.850
You're actually logging in and
checking your Gmail, your

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.250
Yahoo mail, or your Hotmail.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.950
It's something that you
have to use online.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.010
So that's software
as a service.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.120
CHRIS SCHALK: And so
how do build the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.890
software as a service?

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.420
Well, you can drop down a level
and actually have a

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.560
software development platform
as a service.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.030
And that's where Google
App Engine fits in.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.540
Now, I'll get into the
infrastructure as a

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.420
service in a second.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.420
But App Engine, itself, is
referred to as a platform, in

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.090
the sense that it's an
entire development

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.700
platform in the cloud.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.640
So you don't really have
to focus on lower level

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.830
infrastructure, setting up your
lower level servers and

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:43.580
stuff like that.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.240
You just rely on the
platform itself.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.880
And you focus entirely on the
application logic itself.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.960
So you can see App Engine, it's
also got various other

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.240
peers in that realm of cloud
computing technology.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.950
And then, of course, probably
most people are familiar with

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.150
the historical cloud
technology.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.720
So if you've worked with
Amazon, EC2, Rackspace,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.430
VMware, and so forth, those
give you a virtual

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.510
machine in the cloud.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.550
And that's, pretty much, what
I would say, probably, the

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.300
majority of people, when they
were just getting started with

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.430
cloud technologies,
would be using.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.910
We'd like to think that App
Engine is actually more

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.920
productive, in the sense that
you can actually just jump in,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.910
create an app very quickly,
deploy it to the cloud, and

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.460
not worry about all the
infrastructure stuff.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.330
WESLEY CHUN: So you can think
of infrastructure as, I'm

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.020
renting devices online.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.140
I'm renting machines, VMs.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.370
I'm renting disk, power,
cooling, Ethernet.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.720
With the platform as a service,
you don't have to

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.010
worry about that.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.390
You only have to worry
about your app.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.100
And you don't need to think
about operating systems.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.750
You don't need to think
about networking.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.700
You just write the app.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.272
And you upload it and host it.

00:04:47.272 --> 00:04:48.565
CHRIS SCHALK: Want to take
this slide [INAUDIBLE]?

00:04:48.565 --> 00:04:49.670
WESLEY CHUN: No, go ahead.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.950
CHRIS SCHALK: So probably the
main point that we like to

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.540
stress is that App Engine,
it's easy to build.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.570
You don't have to worry about
the infrastructure.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.680
It's easy to maintain.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.215
You have a cloud based
dashboard that

00:04:58.215 --> 00:04:59.180
you can work with.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.270
And, of course, most
importantly,

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.120
it's easy to scale.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.750
You don't have to actually,
physically or even go through

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.030
a UI to start building up your
infrastructure in the cloud.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.780
It can automatically grow
as your business grows.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.000
So these are pretty much
the three main

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.805
points we like to stress.

00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:16.868
WESLEY CHUN: Emphasize.

00:05:16.868 --> 00:05:20.620
CHRIS SCHALK: So let's talk a
little bit about where App

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.840
Engine is today.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.070
App Engine, as you may
know, launched

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.640
back in April of 2008.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.880
WESLEY CHUN: It's
three years old.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.280
CHRIS SCHALK: So we just passed
a three year birthday.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.220
You may be surprised to see
some of these numbers.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.220
We have a very large developer
audience, over 100,000 active

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.850
developers.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.650
And that's not the total mass
of developers that go in and

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.870
sign in to build an app.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.100
Actually, these guys are
actually working and having

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.690
traffic on their applications.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.550
And as you can see, the
slope is not linear.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.700
It's actually continuing
to go up.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.560
200,000 active apps per week.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.830
So obviously, we have thousands
of apps that are

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:57.990
doing multiple different
things.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.190
Whether it's a front facing
web app, whether it's some

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.810
sort of web service, or some
sort of backend service to a

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.630
social or mobile app, they
come in all categories.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.950
And so, as you can see here, we
just continue to grow, with

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:09.730
more and more applications.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.930
WESLEY CHUN: The "hello world"
thing that you guys tried and

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.242
just let it sit forever, that's
not one of these.

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:19.580
CHRIS SCHALK: And we've actually
just surpassed 1.5

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.635
billion page views per day.

00:06:21.635 --> 00:06:24.950
WESLEY CHUN: This is across all
apps, on a daily basis.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.050
CHRIS SCHALK: So on a daily
basis, keep in mind.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.960
It's not just [? once ?]

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.140
[? at a ?] time.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.600
So who are these people building
all these apps?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.780
Well, we have a very large
database of partners, users

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.870
that we interact with.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.880
We even have a core set of
people that we literally talk

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.520
to almost every day.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.170
So yes, we have thousands
of partners.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.900
But we do have like a high level
set of people that we

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.850
interact quite a bit with.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.320
So you may recognize
some of the names.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.090
Some of them are more
traditional applications that

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.070
in are enterprise-y type
of applications.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.340
Also, there's many applications
that are in the

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.790
gaming space.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:03.760
And then, of course, social.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.290
Social was one of the very
important audiences with

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.560
Google App Engine back when
it launched in 2008.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.290
WESLEY CHUN: Well, the other
thing is, if you look at the

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.830
list there, you'll see big
names, like Best Buy and

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.610
Forbes and MTV.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.440
But, of course, they don't run
their entire website off of

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.020
App Engine.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.182
But they do run certain
components of their website on

00:07:22.182 --> 00:07:23.598
App Engine.

00:07:23.598 --> 00:07:26.420
CHRIS SCHALK: So I'd like to
point out one of our partners,

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.070
in particular.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.870
And they'll actually be talking

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.950
at our session tomorrow.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.210
WESLEY CHUN: And I think they
also have a Sandbox.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.240
CHRIS SCHALK: That's right.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.040
So WebFilings is one of App
Engine's most important

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.920
partners, in the sense that
they've done an awesome job by

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.540
building a SaaS application that
allows companies to file

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.515
their financial results
to the SEC.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.205
The first time we invited them
over, they gave us a demo of

00:07:53.205 --> 00:07:53.570
their application.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.520
And we were all, this
is amazing.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.010
Hats off to you guys.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.100
And they've been able to take
their very rich, helpful

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.080
application and really
be successful

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.030
in Fortune 100 companies.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.110
So if you go to their website,
you can just look at their

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.860
list of partners that they
are now signing on.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.250
And their growth rate is very
similar to App Engine.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.810
It's going by leaps
and bounds.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.300
And so they've actually had
quite bit of success, in the

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.330
Fortune 100 companies.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.640
So I think it's important to
notice that App Engine, it

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.070
came, maybe traditionally, from
grass roots developers,

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.610
social, gaming, but it's now
working itself into enterprise

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.465
adoption, essentially,
and having success.

00:08:29.465 --> 00:08:32.070
WESLEY CHUN: So App Engine is
the maturing, from just a

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.720
developer tool or developer toy,
into something that real

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.860
companies do use for
real business.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.289
You can imagine how fun
it is to create SEC

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:41.929
filings every quarter.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:44.300
So these guys have come
up with a novel way--

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.920
CHRIS SCHALK: Probably the wrong
audience for that joke.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.850
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:52.200
WESLEY CHUN: Well, they found
a way to actually make that

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.980
more pleasant for
these companies.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.950
So they're signing on
pretty quickly.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.470
CHRIS SCHALK: So BuddyPoke,
this is one of

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:58.630
our historical partners.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.450
They have numerous social apps
on both Facebook and all the

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.460
other social networks.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.990
So this is like the traditional
core, original

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.560
types of the partners that
we've worked with.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.310
And of course, gaming.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.710
We have a number of folks out
there that are building

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.340
backends, frontends with
App Engine, in

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.970
numerous manners as well.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.210
And then, you may have noticed,
a certain wedding a

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.870
little while ago.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.630
Actually, if you had watched
the news, Google App Engine

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.360
actually provided the official
royal wedding website.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.100
And so, as you can see, on the
wedding day, had up to 2000

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.820
requests per second, 15 million
page views, 5.6

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.630
million visitors So there's the
actual short link there.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.230
But you can go, and you can
Google the royal wedding

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.640
website, and you'll be going to
an App Engine application.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.480
Incidentally, one of our
engineers actually created the

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.580
blog application that
is running this.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.680
So it's entirely a homegrown
solution, in that sense.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.800
Let's jump into the App Engine
details, so a bit of the

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.760
technology.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.590
So, obviously, if you work
with App Engine, you

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:05.030
understand the key components.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.240
But if you're new, we like to
think of it as SDK in a box or

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.170
cloud development
SDK in a box.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.385
So, first of all, you get
a downloadable SDK.

00:10:14.385 --> 00:10:17.010
You download it onto
your machine.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.580
That SDK has the
capabilities--

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.810
well, you can either download
the Python or the Java SDK.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.270
And those are the two core
languages that we support.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.560
And then, in order to build
your applications, you can

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.940
pick whatever tools or
use command lines

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.420
or what have you.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.380
But we do offer, like on the
Java side, specific support

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.180
for Eclipse.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.120
So our team has actually built
a plug-in specifically

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.400
designed for Eclipse.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.560
We also have a third party IDE
plug-ins, like NetBeans,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.370
IntelliJ, and so forth that are
built out there that you

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:46.830
can use as well.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.320
Now, on the Python side, there's
also this nice utility

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.910
called the App Engine Launcher,
which allows you to

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.260
create, debug, check the logs,
and also deploy your

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.120
application on the Python
side, as well.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.420
Now, these are tools that
augment what you can already

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.770
do command line as well.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.730
And then, of course, the whole
magic of the App Engine is

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.110
you've got all these great
services that you can use.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.530
So you go through the
documentation, you can use

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.260
high speed memory caching,
memcache.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.980
You can use the backend
datastore, which is based off

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.660
of a Google's Big Table.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.140
And we're continuously updating
these new services.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.970
And they're all made available
for you, immediately, as you

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:24.490
build you apps.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.320
So you don't have to go
through-- like on the Java

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.340
side, go out and fetch JAR files
and rig your application

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.840
in a kind of Frankenstein
manner.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.210
All this content is there, ready
to go, for a wide array

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.110
of services.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.700
And, of course, the other very
important point is that, once

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.200
you build your application,
you can test

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.550
it, debug it locally.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.380
You even have a mini dashboard
to check the various elements

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.550
of your application.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.590
And then once you deploy it,
you have a dashboard in the

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.780
cloud, where you go through and
check the logs, check the

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.290
overall health, see what kind of
warnings, errors, so forth

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:56.820
that's come up.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.820
And, of course, check the
overall traffic, once you get

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.680
into an operational mode.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.960
And that application in the
cloud, you can also manage the

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.750
financial aspects, manage
the growth of the

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.060
application in general.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.670
Anything else?

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:13.320
These specialized services,
I touched on just a few.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.170
But, as you can see, memcache,
high speed memory, datastore,

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.020
URL fetch, task queues.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.780
So, literally, a very rich
palate by which you can build

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.640
your applications,
from the get go.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.730
So you build your app and
just immediately use

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:26.830
some of these services.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.520
And we have a lot of
documentation out there that

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.720
allows you to jump in and just
get busy programming.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.690
We'll show you some of that
stuff today [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.600
WESLEY CHUN: So one of the
reasons why we give you all

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.160
these services is, you need to
understand, whenever you're

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.690
writing an app in the cloud,
you're actually sharing all

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.810
these resources with other
cloud developers as well.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.720
And we certainly don't want you
to be able to break into

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.710
other people's apps and be able
to steal their data and

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:49.270
vice versa.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.000
We want to keep all
your stuff safe.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.335
So what that means
is that your app

00:12:52.335 --> 00:12:53.690
needs to run in a sandbox.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.320
A controlled environment
by which you

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.700
can't do certain things.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.820
So it doesn't help violate
security and things like that.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.290
So things you can't do are like,
you can't create a local

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:06.120
file, you can't make a system
call, you can't open a socket

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.220
connection.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.740
So those things sound
kind of restrictive.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.040
Because, if I told that to begin
with, you'd say, well

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.980
what the heck kind of app
am I going to write?

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.763
If I can't even open a socket,
it's not going

00:13:14.763 --> 00:13:16.610
to be really useful.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.850
So you have to ask yourself the
question, why would you

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:20.360
want to open a socket?

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.480
Maybe you want to send email
or even receive email.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.140
Or maybe you want to talk to
another app that's online.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.950
So that's what why we provide
these higher level APIs to

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.940
proxy for that missing
functionality.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.940
And, of course, if there's
something missing, feel free

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.670
to give feedback to the team.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:38.630
And based on how popular that
demand is for that feature,

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.140
we'll try our best to
get the product team

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.180
to implement that.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.150
So that's the reason why
we provide all these.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.320
It's not just a sales pitch,
like, oh, we got this API,

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.520
we've got this API.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.790
These things serve a purpose.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.520
And that is to get around
the sandbox.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.850
Or not actually get around
it, it's a substitute for

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.770
something you can't do, because
of the execution

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:56.590
environment that you're in.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.410
Does that make sense
to everybody?

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.900
CHRIS SCHALK: And it all boils
down to scalability.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.960
And so there's reasons why some
of those things are a

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.410
little bit more restrictive,
but they're meant so your

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.080
application--

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.690
and it's also good for you--
can actually scale to

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:13.120
thousands, just, literally,
global traffic, entirely.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.090
So let's talk about our
language runtimes.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.410
As you know, we have Python
support and Java.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:18.940
So these are both a
built-in, native

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.340
support within App Engine.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.050
We actually build out the
interfaces on both sides, and

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.840
we keep them both, essentially,
on par with

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.070
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.100
Sometimes, maybe, there might
be a new feature that comes

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.370
out in Python, but then Java
will then catch up.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.720
And then vice versa, there might
be a new feature for a

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.980
temporary time, and then the
Python one catches up.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:35.880
But it's very nice, though.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.390
Because like, for us, who
actually balance on both

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.460
sides, it's nice to see the
parallel support that our

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.070
teams are putting together.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.330
And it keeps the knowledge
still the same.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.430
So the core concepts are still
the same, across the board.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.070
So if you understand App Engine
on the Java side, it's

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.310
really not a big stress to jump
over on the Python side.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:56.400
WESLEY CHUN: But the vice versa
is probably not true.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.900
CHRIS SCHALK: Little bit, might
be a little harder.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.615
WESLEY CHUN: I'm not
balanced at all.

00:14:59.615 --> 00:15:01.150
I'm unbalanced.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.760
So I'm mostly all Python.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.920
And I don't know
too much Java.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.700
And every time I look at
Java it scares me.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.070
But I can see how
it so popular.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.170
CHRIS SCHALK: It
scares me too.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.730
So as you can see, on the Java
side, we do provide the

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:15.800
familiar interfaces.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.250
So this basically allows any
typical or standard Java EE

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.940
developer to go ahead and
use the same patterns,

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.740
methodologies that they
are familiar with.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.430
So using servlets.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.020
If they want to use JB
or JPI, they can.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.230
We also do have a low level API,
across the board, where

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.270
you can jump in directly and
just use those APIs.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:42.632
And we actually have the boot
camp lab, Ikai is running.

00:15:42.632 --> 00:15:43.436
What time is it?

00:15:43.436 --> 00:15:45.560
WESLEY CHUN: It's later
this afternoon.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.450
It's like 1:45 or 4 o'clock.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.130
I think he's running
two sessions.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.780
So if you are already a an
existing App Engine developer,

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.110
and you're still having problems
totally wrapping your

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.140
head around the datastore,
he's got some really good

00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:00.660
exercises for you to just jump
in and get knee deep into it.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:04.030
CHRIS SCHALK: Yeah, definitely
recommend it.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.700
Basically, the bottom line here
is that Java developers

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.840
can feel comfortable using
familiar interfaces.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.020
But they can drop down even
to the lower interfaces.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.670
Sometimes you might actually see
some slight improvements.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.670
Like the datastore API is
actually a little bit better

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:21.840
on the low level API level.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:26.890
So, because Java support has
essentially a virtual machine

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.470
running behind it, that
allows you to

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:29.410
even have other languages.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:33.510
So you can write your
applications in Ruby, Ruby

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.170
PHP, JavaScript, Python,
and really any other.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.290
Actually, I gave a talk, about
two months ago, at a CFML

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.010
developers conference,
believe it or not--

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.410
cold fusion markup language.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:47.320
Because there's actually a
Java runtime that will

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.720
essentially execute CFML.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.850
There's like this community of
open source CFML developers

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.570
that are building nonprofit
websites with their--

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.234
WESLEY CHUN: There are people
using cold fusion?

00:17:00.234 --> 00:17:01.102
CHRIS SCHALK: Yes.

00:17:01.102 --> 00:17:01.970
WESLEY CHUN: Oh.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:03.950
CHRIS SCHALK: I used it
too, back in the day.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.220
WESLEY CHUN: So one thing about
the PHP is that people

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.280
think, oh, this is
full PHP support.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.560
Not quite.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.839
Because App Engine runs on a
non-relational datastore, you

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:15.000
can't exactly embed SQL
inside your PHP code.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.300
You still have to talk
to JDO and JPA.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.400
So your PHP is going to
be a little tweaked.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.569
It doesn't perform as badly
as you may think.

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:23.069
It actually performs
quite well.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:25.359
However, you still have to kind
of change your way of

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.480
writing your PHP code,
if you do want to

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.640
choose and use that.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.890
The last one you might
think is kind of odd.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.880
Why would I want to write Python
and run it top of a JVM

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.360
when I can use the native
Python library?

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.050
And one of the main reasons
for that is you could have

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:41.840
spent the last 6, 7, 10 years
building out all of your Java

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.530
classes and infrastructure, and
you really don't want to

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.820
port everything over.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.800
But you do want to take
advantage of Python rapid

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.560
development.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.540
So using Jython, you can
actually instantiate Python

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.390
classes as well as Java
classes, and they

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:54.120
talk to each other.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:59.170
So that's one of the reasons
why you consider Jython.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.250
CHRIS SCHALK: So let's talk
about the platform.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.786
Hope you like the shoe.

00:18:03.786 --> 00:18:06.202
WESLEY CHUN: He spent
a lot of time on it.

00:18:06.202 --> 00:18:07.560
CHRIS SCHALK: Yeah, I did.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.040
Actually, truth be told, I had
another slide that was an oil

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.310
platform, but it just
didn't work.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.750
And so hence the.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.904
I'm proud of my little
creation there.

00:18:19.904 --> 00:18:22.285
And Wes liked it too,
so we kept it in.

00:18:22.285 --> 00:18:25.885
WESLEY CHUN: At 2:00 in the
morning, I liked anything.

00:18:25.885 --> 00:18:29.320
CHRIS SCHALK: That's right.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.990
Let's talk about the platform
in general.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.800
Oh, you want to take a picture?

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.670
Go ahead.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.884
All my hard work on Photoshop.

00:18:35.884 --> 00:18:38.120
WESLEY CHUN: You're just
feeding his ego.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.330
CHRIS SCHALK: Easy.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.350
Let's talk about the platform.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.100
So first of all, as I mentioned,
you got the SDK.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.570
You can build it, debug your
application locally, and then

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.080
you deploy it to the cloud.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.100
And this is where
you get a really

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.610
cool App Engine dashboard.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:50.670
And so I'll show you
how it works.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.070
But basically, you get all of
the important information, all

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.860
the management stuff at your
fingertips, all in the cloud.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:58.530
WESLEY CHUN: Oh, come on.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.790
That's the sales side again.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.480
Why are we really doing this?

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.340
Again, you're executing
in a sandbox.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.450
It's a restricted environment.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.530
Oh, I don't have access
to my logs.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:07.190
I can't dig.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:08.610
I can't write my own
metrics tool.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.290
I can't re-write a
reporting tool.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:10.980
Those things are bad.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.620
I mean, you're not used to
that, if you're doing

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.720
traditional hosting.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.450
So if you're going to host with
us, we need to give you

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.670
something that you would
find useful to kind

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:18.700
of make up for that.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.360
And that's what the
Admin Console is.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.060
And actually, this diagram
is about two years old,

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.060
believe it or not.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.940
It does tell you a lot
of things still.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.540
It shows you how much
usage you have.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.860
How close you are to the
end of your quota.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:31.960
How much it's costing you.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.870
All this kind of stuff.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.660
But since then, we've actually
added a lot more features to

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.670
the Administration Console.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.780
But that's just a snapshot view
of what are some of the

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.240
numbers that you do get, to show
you the kind of traffic

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.675
you're getting, what
your errors are,

00:19:45.675 --> 00:19:47.711
and things like that.

00:19:47.711 --> 00:19:50.310
CHRIS SCHALK: We also provide
a general system health

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.370
webpage as well.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.920
And so if you want to just check
up on any of the various

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.060
services, you can go to the this
overall App Engine system

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.000
health webpage.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.430
And it also provides a
historical look as well.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.910
WESLEY CHUN: Just keep in mind
that this is for all apps in

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:05.880
the entire system.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.720
So if your app is running into
any kind of difficulty, maybe

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.260
the other 199,000
apps are not.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.270
So you'll still see
green check marks.

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.220
And then you're going to be
mad, because it doesn't

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.820
reflect your particular
situation.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.900
So just keep in mind that this
is a global, overall system

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.360
type of thing and
not necessarily

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.470
just tied to yours.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:29.940
And depending on the various
thresholds that we have, these

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.330
things can go from the green
check-mark to one of the more

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.490
warning ones and then go
back within an hour.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.250
You don't really know what's
going to happen.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:41.510
So don't rely on this completely
to help you manage

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.590
and monitor your app.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.250
But it is an overall system
view, to give you an idea of

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:49.036
how well the whole thing
is behaving overall.

00:20:49.036 --> 00:20:51.560
CHRIS SCHALK: So let's talk
about the tools, the

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.030
developmental tools for App
Engine that you get.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.700
So as I mentioned before,
for Python developers--

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.620
and of course, you can work
in command line mode.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.100
You can develop entirely,
without even touching a

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:03.790
developmental tool.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.660
But for Python, we do provide
a simple utility.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.850
It's not like, obviously,
an entire IDE.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.650
But if you want to quickly
create a brand new template

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:16.140
app that gets you started,
go through and, as you're

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.510
debugging, look at the logs.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.430
And then of course, when you're
ready to deploy, it

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.710
offers, essentially, a simple
deployment utility

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.710
that plugs you in.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.380
So a simple time saving type
of utility, essentially.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.050
Now, I should also say that,
as you're debugging your

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:33.690
application locally, we actually
do provide a local

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.200
SDK console.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.510
So this comes in handy, if
you're working, say, on

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:41.380
Python, and you want to check
your cron jobs, your task

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.580
queues and see them actually
running locally,

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.470
you can do all that.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.680
And of course, most importantly,
if you're using

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.720
the datastore to check your
data, you actually go in, see

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.750
the data, and you can update it,
literally, if you need to.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.190
Now on the Eclipse side, for
you Java developers, we do

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.240
provide a very helpful tool.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.330
And similar to the App Engine
launch utility on the Python

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.320
side, it does the core things.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.900
Allows you to create a very
simple starting application

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.690
and, of course, deployment
as well.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.110
But I think, probably, the most
value add, in this case,

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:17.780
is that you're using Eclipse
IDE, which is,

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.190
obviously, very popular.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:20.920
You get debugging support.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.670
You get, essentially, a very
familiar Java development

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:24.230
environment.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.010
And this is what Google
provides.

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:31.140
There's also, as I mentioned
before, third party tools, IDE

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.730
plug-ins for NetBeans, IntelliJ,
and so forth.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.160
And so you can use
those as well.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.660
I should also say, if there's
any Google Web Toolkit

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.300
developers out there, there is a
certain level of integration

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.030
support within the plug-in.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.650
So it's actually meant for
both Google Web Toolkit

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.360
developers as well as App
Engine developers.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.470
And you can decide, if you want,
to create say, like an

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.660
initial starter application
using both technologies

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.327
together or just App
Engine by itself.

00:22:57.327 --> 00:22:58.920
Now for our labs that we're
going to be doing later today,

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.260
we're going to be focusing
purely on App Engine.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.470
But I think there's other stuff
that they're going to be

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.910
covering both of
them together.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:08.010
So definitely recommend checking
those out as well.

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.210
So let's go ahead and
just do some simple

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.615
work with App Engine.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:16.700
So this is Eclipse.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.880
So I'll do like a real
simple Java stuff.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.010
And if you want to play around
on the Python, maybe.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:23.340
Or I can just fire up the App
Engine launcher to do

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.100
something really simple.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:29.700
But just to get started, I can
do a File, New Project.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.400
And then I can select, Web
Application Project.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.630
Now, of course, I could also
just click on this little

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:38.560
handy button here, which is what
I'll do right there, New

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.060
Web Application Project.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:46.970
And I'll call it Hello
BootCamp or

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.870
I'll call it I/O BootCamp.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.695
There we go.

00:23:50.695 --> 00:23:52.880
And I'll give it a
simple package.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.690
So this is, essentially, what
you can do after you've

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:57.920
downloaded the SDK, and you've
set up your Eclipse

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.290
environment, so you're ready to
essentially start building

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:01.180
applications.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.030
Now, I can actually build and
run an application, even

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:06.600
before I've even registered
a brand new, in the cloud,

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.210
placeholder.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.550
So I'll show you that
process in a second.

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.840
But let me just start with
something really quickly.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.460
Now, this is that I thing that
I was talking about.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.150
For now, I'll leave this off.

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:19.060
If I turn that on, that will add
additional example code on

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.780
how to work and build a Google
Web Toolkit application

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.970
running on App Engine.

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.580
So I'll hit Finish.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.530
It'll create my simple
project.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.960
And it really is a very simple
project, just so

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.710
you can have a look.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.800
All it really does is set up,
with a very simple servlet

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.140
that responds to a get request
and says, hello world.

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.950
But this is a very helpful
application, in the sense that

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:51.200
you can then, very quickly,
augment what is here and add

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.430
more services as you
continue it on.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.490
Now, of course, I could hit the
Run button and just run it

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:56.410
and see it in a browser.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:00.340
But to give you a feel for the
value add that you get with an

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.506
integrated development
environment like Eclipse, I'll

00:25:02.506 --> 00:25:05.320
just go ahead and hit the
Debug button there.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.850
And that fires up the web
application in debug mode.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.100
I'll open up the browser.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.030
So I have a welcome file.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:18.270
Actually, the application
generates a simple index.html,

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.630
which is a welcome file.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.620
This has a link to the actual
servlet that I pointed to.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.200
As I click on it, I'm actually
now doing the get request to

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:30.400
the associated servlet, which
is now responding with the

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.100
hello world message.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.590
So I'll click on the
Run button, again.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:36.130
Because I've now paused
the execution.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:37.860
So for those of you who are
not familiar with Eclipse,

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:38.290
bear with us.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.840
But basically, it's basic
Eclipse debugging.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:49.570
And if I go back to the browser
window, I can now see,

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.790
basically, hello world,
right there.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:56.070
So that's a very simple demo of
how to get started with an

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.180
application.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.430
What I can do now is--

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:05.260
let me switch my perspective
back to Java perspective.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:12.680
Now, if I wanted to then go
out and create a brand new

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:18.780
application, I would
log into my

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.860
cloud application dashboard.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.350
So in this sense, I've
logged into my

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.820
external Gmail account.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.786
I can go ahead and create
an application.

00:26:27.786 --> 00:26:31.096
So I can say, I/O BootCamp.

00:26:31.096 --> 00:26:33.620
I'll just put my name on it.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.320
So this is a new application
that I'll be

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.880
creating on the fly.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.030
Let's just go ahead
and create it.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.590
I can use that later
on today, anyway.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.280
So now that I've created my
application, I can go to the

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.530
dashboard and look at
the application.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:54.910
I can see, obviously, there's
no traffic on it yet.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.420
Now, I'm going to take this
application ID or an

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.030
application title, this is the--
or actually, right here,

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.190
is probably more correct--

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.840
this is the thing that links
my application that I built

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.220
locally to the cloud version
of this app.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.575
Now, as you recall, this
is still empty.

00:27:08.575 --> 00:27:09.970
It's a placeholder right now.

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:12.490
So I'll go back to
this application.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:17.960
And I can Edit my App Engine
dash web.xml and add the

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.080
application there.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:24.730
Or I can just do a quick click
and go to Properties.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.160
And then I'll click
on App Engine.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.730
As you can see, I got a little
spot there to add my

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.550
application ID.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:31.900
So I'll place that there.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.210
And at this point,
we're good to go.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:36.640
We can actually click on the
little Deploy button.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.320
Or I do right click
and Deploy To.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.030
But I'll just click on
it very quickly.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.950
I'm going to hit on
the Deploy button.

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.800
It's then preparing my
application, getting it ready

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.910
for upload.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:48.560
And then it's now deploying the
application in the cloud.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.740
So sometimes on longer or larger
applications, it might

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.550
take a little while.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:57.260
But typically, it's anywhere
between a minute or 15

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.100
seconds, depending.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.500
So I'll give that
a few seconds.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:08.040
And then the other thing that
I'll do is prep up my first

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.040
access of this application.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.020
And I'll just query it.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:11.590
So there it is.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.320
It's now live.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.430
And I'll click on the
little link there.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:17.240
And there it is.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.380
So I actually built an
application from scratch and

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.320
deployed it to the cloud within
just, I don't know, a

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.490
few minutes or so.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:24.530
So, anyway--

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:26.136
let me switch back to
our presentation.

00:28:30.955 --> 00:28:33.500
Python side, do you want to
do a little simple stuff.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:39.210
I can fire up the App Engine
launcher, and we can do a very

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.776
simple application creation here
on this side if you like?

00:28:41.776 --> 00:28:42.680
WESLEY CHUN: Sure.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.360
CHRIS SCHALK: So let's see.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.510
I/O BootCamp.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:50.832
So I'll just give it a
real simple hello.

00:28:50.832 --> 00:28:52.185
WESLEY CHUN: That simple?

00:28:52.185 --> 00:28:54.514
CHRIS SCHALK: I/O
BootCamp Hello.

00:28:54.514 --> 00:28:58.510
I think I'll put this in
my Python App Engine.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:28:59.760
WESLEY CHUN: I'm just teasing.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.090
CHRIS SCHALK: So anyway, so
I created a very simple

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:06.770
application.

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:08.790
I can click on the Run button.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.510
That fires it up.

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:17.890
And then also what I'll do
is pop open the Finder.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:20.075
And I think actually created
it right here.

00:29:20.075 --> 00:29:21.940
There it is.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.930
So these are the main files
that you get started with.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.830
The main dot PY file.

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.530
I'll just pop that
open in TextMate.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.530
So in the similar fashion that
we had our servlet responding

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:36.010
to hello world, it's just
a simple Python handler.

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:38.690
Wes can definitely jump, since
he's the Python expert here.

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.160
WESLEY CHUN: No, no, no,
you can go ahead.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.360
Actually, change the name of
your app to the one you have

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.850
uploaded, and then you
can upload this one.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.130
CHRIS SCHALK: Oh, yeah,
that's a good one.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:52.760
So here, I'm going to change
this to that, hit Save.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.150
I'll go back to my utility
and hit Deploy.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:59.165
It's got all that saved.

00:29:59.165 --> 00:30:01.110
And it's firing off
the deployment.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:03.290
Oh, I should have changed
the hello.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:04.180
Oh well.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.540
We can do it again.

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.540
But you get the idea.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.160
So I'm now deploying the Python
version onto my cloud.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:14.820
And also, I should return back
to the cloud dashboard, which

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:15.360
is now different.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.030
Because now I actually
have an application.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:23.340
Obviously, not much going
on here log-wise.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.850
I can you put in a [? fave ?]
icon, [? ICO ?]

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:27.930
or whatever, and so forth.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.760
And of course, since I'm not
working with data just yet, my

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.810
datastore viewer is not
showing anything.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:36.060
I don't have cron jobs and
task queues and so forth.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.600
But once I got an actually full
functioning app, I would

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.270
actually be able to step into
all that stuff very easily.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:47.820
So it deployed and just for fun,
I can go out and do the

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.130
same thing.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:54.200
Let's see, boom dot
appspot dot com.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.450
Since I zoomed in.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.650
Sorry, I got to refresh.

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:01.590
The other one was still.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:02.200
There we go.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.380
So that one doesn't
have that index--

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.950
WESLEY CHUN: So you can see he
actually did switch from the

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:08.530
Java to the Python app.

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:12.730
CHRIS SCHALK: Anyway, I can
jump back into our slides.

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:14.910
And that was just the getting
started stuff.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:16.810
Apologies, if you guys are
already App Engine experts,

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:18.830
but definitely for people who
are new to it, it kind of

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:20.290
gives you an idea of
how to get started.

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.950
WESLEY CHUN: Notice which
one was faster.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:25.260
CHRIS SCHALK: I showed
debugging-- oh, well.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.280
I won't argue that one.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:32.310
So let's take a look at all
these services and just

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:35.925
provide historical viewpoint
about of App Engine.

00:31:35.925 --> 00:31:36.745
WESLEY CHUN: There will
be a quiz afterwards.

00:31:36.745 --> 00:31:39.020
CHRIS SCHALK: That's right.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:39.830
It's three years old.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:41.520
We launched it in 2008.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.390
Back when it was launched,
it was very simple.

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:44.520
It had Python support.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.470
And then as time progressed,
we started adding on

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.540
additional features.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:54.090
Memcache came not too long,
better logging support.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:57.000
And then, of course, a very
important event happened in

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.700
2009, that's the Java launch.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.420
That was a big deal.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.850
WESLEY CHUN: I thought
it was FORTRAN.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.160
CHRIS SCHALK: Well, that's
coming next.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.010
WESLEY CHUN: Anybody remember
the FORTRAN launch?

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:06.660
Yeah, see.

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:07.777
CHRIS SCHALK: People didn't--

00:32:07.777 --> 00:32:10.240
I don't know.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.720
So the Java launch came out.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:16.940
That opened up App Engine to a
whole new set of developers.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:20.020
Some key things along the
way, task queues, XMPP

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.490
for building chatbots.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.270
Which is actually part
of our lab that

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:25.160
we're doing later today.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.990
You can build your own
chatbot with XMPP.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:31.940
Blobstore, for just any kind of
blob storage, in the cloud.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.570
That was a very important
feature, came out end of 2009.

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:37.560
Datastore cursors.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:41.070
We announced App Engine for
business back last May.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:44.490
Multi-tenancy, high performance
image surfing.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.030
So obviously I'm not going
to read every feature.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.720
But the main point here is that,
as you can see, over

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.940
time, we continuously add new
features and services.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.980
And so, in that sense, what the
App Engine is today is not

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.475
going to be the App Engine of
say, six months from now or a

00:32:58.475 --> 00:32:58.870
year from now.

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:02.270
It's just going to be continued
set of features that

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.980
you can take advantage
of down the road.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.310
Also, I should say, very
importantly, we launched a

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:10.200
hybrid application datastore
and, of course, Channel API.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.650
But hybrid application datastore
is actually a very

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:13.460
important feature.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.680
It's a strategically important
feature to App Engine, in the

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:21.800
sense that it's a new and more
tolerant data storage

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.240
technology that is immune from
data latency spikes, that

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.880
sometimes have occurred
in the past.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.900
So we definitely recommend
people using this new

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.830
technology.

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:33.340
We're getting--

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.220
most of our key partners are now
switched over, and they're

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.190
getting great results.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:39.460
Like WebFilings, for example,
they have awesome results with

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.610
the hybrid application datastore
and so forth.

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:44.410
So they're quite
happy with it.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:47.530
And then also, just in general,
as you can see, the

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:51.640
overall growth and continuous
growth of all the applications

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.750
has resulted, obviously, in
continuous interest from the

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.980
overall large population.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:03.490
And, of course, looking to the
future, we have continuous

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:06.420
features with full MapReduce,
full-text search.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.270
A new feature that we're
introducing, actually,

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:10.840
tomorrow, literally.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.780
This idea of background servers,
so you can have long

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.429
running background services
that just

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:16.920
continue to do their thing.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.370
They're like daemons, I guess,
is a good way to call it.

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:22.739
As you can see, continuously
adding,

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:25.750
augmenting more features.

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:27.780
So, anyway, shall we jump in?

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.469
I want to show them, also, the
sample application that we'll

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:35.080
be doing in the BootCamp
lab today.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.389
Actually, I'll just give
you a demo real

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:38.300
quickly of how it works.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.580
And then I'll show you a little
bit of how it was

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:43.489
built, as a sneak preview of
how you can actually step

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:46.090
through and build it yourself.

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:49.889
So first of all, before I jump
to the application, let me

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:51.139
just tell you what it does.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:54.380
It uses the Channel API.

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.659
Actually, I'll step earlier.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:59.500
It actually uses URL fetch to
go out and fetch news feeds.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.330
And it pulls them down into
the local datastore.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:05.160
And it keeps a registry
of fresh news feeds.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:11.370
And then a person can just point
their browser to a URL.

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:14.720
And then, once they've
connected, the news feeds are

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.980
then streamed down to
the browser every

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.040
three seconds or so.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.730
And so what that means is, it's
able to use like a comet

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:25.170
push, using the Channel API,
down to any client browsers

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:27.340
that have connected
to this website.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.720
So in that sense, it's a
really cool feature.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.840
You can have very rich,
interactive webpages.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.260
So, in our example that we'll
do in the BootCamp today is

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:36.700
very simple.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.720
It's just grabbing an XML feed
and stuffing it down into a

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.270
client browser.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.540
But you could do any
number of things.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:43.830
The data is data.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.550
So you send down whatever
you want.

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:48.930
And then use whatever
visualization you want to,

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:50.410
whether it's some type
of visual graphs

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:51.440
and things like that.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.690
You're totally welcome
to do that.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:54.550
What we're doing in the BootCamp
is very simple.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:58.382
We just grab some JSON, dump
it into a [? DIV ?] and it

00:35:58.382 --> 00:35:59.490
gets updated very simply.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.570
So that's the application
in a nutshell.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:03.920
We have both versions,
a Java and a Python.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.750
And if you come to the BootCamp,
you'll be be able to

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:09.320
actually build that within
the lab itself.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.780
So let's go ahead and just
go to a version here.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:17.167
News channel dash and then my
email, CShalk at [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:17.167 --> 00:36:18.360
dot com.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.730
And you notice, I have
a pop up here.

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:22.520
What this means is that, as I
viewed the page, as it loaded,

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.800
it actually created a connection
to the server.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.320
And I clicked OK.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.210
And then the only other
thing I need to do.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:31.450
So now I have a socket
connection to the server, of

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:32.960
this demo application.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.945
I can then go to the
same application--

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.030
I just had it a second ago.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.560
There we go.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:46.090
And kick off a set of tasks.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:49.660
These are known as deferred
tasks, which will then execute

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:53.050
and queue up, essentially, a
set of jobs that will go

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:55.700
through and start pushing
out updates

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:56.840
to any client browsers.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:02.290
So, as you can also see, I can
pop open a new window, make a

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:05.510
connection, and I should
also see the same

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:06.660
updates in the same way.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:10.770
So anyway, just something fun
put together for the BootCamp

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:14.520
lab that you're definitely
welcome to build, either in

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.050
the lab itself or even, also,
take home as an exercise and

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:18.490
continue to augment.

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:20.130
Anything else you wanted
to touch on that?

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:21.380
WESLEY CHUN: No, that's good.

00:37:23.846 --> 00:37:28.310
CHRIS SCHALK: Let's step back
over to our slides here.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:32.330
And, of course, before we wrap
up, just also wanted to

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:35.710
provide you with where the info
is that you can learn

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.510
about App Engine if you're
just getting started.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:41.460
So code.google.com/AppEngine is,
of course, the very first

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.960
place you'll want to
go check it out.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:47.060
And, actually, that's pretty
much the home base.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.750
We also provide the blog.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.890
The blog is very important, if
you want to stay up to date

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:54.620
with any latest information,
obviously.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:57.670
Whenever we launch new APIs and
services, we always get a

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:01.100
blog post out, so you can
start trying it out.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:06.170
And, of course, you can use your
Google account to create

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:09.160
your own App Engine account,
essentially, turn it on.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:12.400
So as typical Google fashion, as
long as you have a Gmail or

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.530
whatever, you get started.

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.060
And you can actually open it up
and turn on your App Engine

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.190
account within minutes.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:20.660
And then be able to start
building applications and

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.532
literally deploying
them to the cloud.

00:38:23.532 --> 00:38:26.120
Anything else you've been
wanting to mention before we

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.580
switch into Q&amp;A mode?

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:31.410
WESLEY CHUN: So I think for the
blog, the blog is actually

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:31.900
interesting.

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:35.100
Because in addition to content
provided by us, employees, we

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.980
also, from time to time, invite
our external developers

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:41.540
and partners to also write blog
posts about interesting

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.380
products and tools that they're

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:47.052
building on App Engine.

00:38:47.052 --> 00:38:48.450
CHRIS SCHALK: I'll just
give you a quick

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:50.640
test run through here.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.120
So as you can see, there's
code.google.com/appengine.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.080
I'll jump into the blog.

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.680
And I'll head back over to
the docs really quickly.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.440
You may recognize this
particular blog post we just

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.640
did, recently, which talks about
how App Engine was used

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.690
for the official royal
wedding blog.

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:08.550
And if I continue to scroll
down, there's just a whole

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:12.740
bunch of technical information
that's constantly coming out,

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:16.200
on how you can essentially learn
what's the latest that's

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.450
going on with App Engine.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:24.600
We had a WebFilings blog that
explained how they were using

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.250
the hybrid application
datastore, and it actually

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:30.040
worked out to their advantage
and allowed them to--

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.550
here it is, right here--

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:36.360
actually sign on some new
Fortune 100 companies.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.730
They are quite happy
with it now.

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:43.150
Let me switch back to
the docs, just so

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.810
you get a basic idea.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:48.460
So obviously our developers
guide caters to both the

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.530
Python and Java audience.

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:53.520
So we have some nice getting
started tutorials.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.100
This getting started with Java
or Python is similar to the

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.580
initial set of the BootCamp
labs that we're doing.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:01.670
But it's also kind of
more simplistic.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:05.530
We actually extend upon these
getting started labs just for

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:06.260
a little bit more fun.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.430
So we get into email,
XMPP, and so forth

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:09.680
on the basic stuff.

00:40:13.195 --> 00:40:15.380
I'll switch back to the--

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:16.620
also, very importantly.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:21.030
Since App Engine itself is
available open source, we have

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:22.350
the project externally.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:24.360
And you can also log issues.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.770
So if you want to see a
particular feature, you can

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:32.590
log it in our issue tracker,
and the team regularly goes

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:35.370
through the issues and
assigns priorities.

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:37.800
Also you can vote up features,
if you want.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.710
We actually have people
want to see

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:41.390
native PHP support still.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:44.430
So we're continuously
looking into that.

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:48.630
Obviously, that's a major
engineering effort to do that.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:50.680
But yeah, we're definitely
looking at it.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.780
Now, I should also
say, community.

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.160
And this is something
that Wes might even

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.220
want to chime in here.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:59.660
As you can see, we have even
responses coming in from Wes.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:03.790
We basically rely, for overall
support, we rely on the

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.200
overall App Engine community.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.630
Plus we have people, Google
engineers, that are monitoring

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:12.270
constantly and checking to see,
essentially, what are

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:13.650
people's issues that pop up.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:17.580
And Wes will just jump in and
help people out on the fly, on

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:18.830
certain technical issues.

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:23.655
I think with that--

00:41:23.655 --> 00:41:25.750
WESLEY CHUN: The forums
have gurus too.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.960
And gurus are basically very
experienced App Engine users

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.850
that are not Google employees.

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:34.150
So they're actually people
that make their living

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:35.550
building App Engine
apps every day.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:38.870
And they contribute
on the forums.

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:41.730
Sometimes it's better to get
another voice that doesn't

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:43.120
belong to Google.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.150
And that's why we have these
ambassadors of our forums.

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:50.910
And a couple will be here at
BootCamp as well as at I/O. So

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:51.900
feel free to say hi to them.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.690
You'll find their names
if you go to the

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:56.924
forum, the About page.

00:41:56.924 --> 00:42:00.010
CHRIS SCHALK: So I think with
wrapping up, we'd just like a

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:05.545
plug for our App Engine lab,
which is coming up at 11:45.

00:42:05.545 --> 00:42:06.640
That's pretty soon.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.130
I was thinking it was
a little bit later.

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:09.766
WESLEY CHUN: You were just
hoping it was going to be a

00:42:09.766 --> 00:42:10.000
little later.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.510
CHRIS SCHALK: So definitely, you
can bring your lunch and

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:13.180
come join us.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:16.370
And we'll be able to step
through, not only like the

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.470
Channel API, more
advanced stuff.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:20.240
But just even if you're getting
started, we'll be more

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.890
than happy to help you
get it started.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:24.515
So at this point, I think
we can open it

00:42:24.515 --> 00:42:25.080
up, if we have any--

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.880
WESLEY CHUN: Actually, before
we get into Q&amp;A, one more

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.500
thing I wanted to
say about apps.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.340
Because a lot of people come
and actually ask us this.

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.040
They go well, it's great.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.580
You have this web tool.

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.890
It's a great execution
platform.

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:39.620
But what if I don't want
to build a web app?

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.540
Can I build an app that's
not user facing?

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.310
And the answer is
absolutely yes.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:47.270
We actually have another class
of apps, where people are

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:51.190
building mobile applications,
where the frontend, that's

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:53.110
user facing, is actually
on a phone.

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:56.220
But they need some sort of
backend system, to maybe hold

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:59.290
high scores or leveling
or medals or whatever.

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:02.590
So with App Engine, all you
really need is to be able to

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:06.690
post something to us, from the
phone app, and we can,

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:09.820
effectively, help you with that
app, to give it a more

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.810
rich experience.

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:13.630
So for example, users can check
their high scores on a

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:15.560
website instead of just
on their mobile phone.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.415
Or if, for some reason, they
lost their phone or dropped it

00:43:18.415 --> 00:43:19.910
in the toilet or something.

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:21.510
When they get a new phone, they
don't want to have to

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:23.000
redo everything from scratch.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.480
So if you store all these things
with a backend system,

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:29.350
like in App Engine, then you can
provide your users a much

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:32.200
more rich experience.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.430
So the answer to that question
is, no, it doesn't have to

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:35.530
always be user facing.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.130
It doesn't have to
be a web app.

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:40.510
It's just you can have any kind
of frontend, but you can

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:42.280
use App Engine as
your backend.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.015
Because of the same reasons why
we described why you would

00:43:45.015 --> 00:43:46.940
want to build a web app,
because you want that

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.470
scalability.

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.980
You want to be able to take
advantage of all of the

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.310
infrastructure the Google has
spent many, many years

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:57.200
building out, to make
our apps scalable.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.310
So you guys can actually
get that to take

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:00.400
advantage of that.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.770
So yes, so that's just one of
the last use cases I wanted to

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:07.690
mention before we get to Q&amp;A.

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:09.610
CHRIS SCHALK: I was just putting
up the QR code here

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:10.780
really quickly.

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:13.565
Sorry, I was just going
to fix that.

00:44:13.565 --> 00:44:14.600
WESLEY CHUN: Yes, question?

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.100
AUDIENCE: App store
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.490
WESLEY CHUN: Have to is
a different word.

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:23.150
They automatically get one.

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.465
AUDIENCE: So what if
you are [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:28.706 --> 00:44:30.700
WESLEY CHUN: Yeah, you can just
create a [? C name ?]

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:31.950
to it.

00:44:34.834 --> 00:44:38.930
CHRIS SCHALK: And we did put
our Twitter handles here.

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:44.010
So we're going to try to keep
any helpful information, so

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:47.125
you're welcome to follow either
Wes or me or both of us

00:44:47.125 --> 00:44:49.430
for any updates on Twitter.

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:50.250
WESLEY CHUN: Oh, the
App Engine one.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:52.800
You should put the App Engine
one up there too.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:57.050
It's at App underscore Engine.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:00.000
You don't have to do it now.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Well, just do it now, then.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.130
CHRIS SCHALK: Now that
we started it.

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:04.380
Here we go.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.141
WESLEY CHUN: Underscore,
App underscore.

00:45:10.141 --> 00:45:13.640
No, no, no, engine, no
app, just engine.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.890
There you go.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:22.320
And that's maintained by our
entire team, except Chris.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.570
CHRIS SCHALK: Apparently.

00:45:27.582 --> 00:45:28.750
WESLEY CHUN: Anybody
have questions

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:30.806
that we can't answer?

00:45:30.806 --> 00:45:32.050
CHRIS SCHALK: I was going
to say, also--

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:32.980
WESLEY CHUN: It's all
confidential.

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:33.906
We can't tell you.

00:45:33.906 --> 00:45:34.810
CHRIS SCHALK: I was
going to say, a

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:37.790
recommendation for this afternoon.

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:40.130
Please, if you're new to App
Engine, and you want to come

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:43.030
to the BootCamp lab, please
check the website for the

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:44.300
prerequisites.

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.130
WESLEY CHUN: Make sure
you have everything

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:46.170
downloaded and installed.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:50.490
Because we don't want to spend
the first half of the lab

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:50.950
doing installation.

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:53.010
CHRIS SCHALK: Because on the
Java side, you definitely want

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:55.300
to make sure you got your JDK,
you got the Eclipse set up

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.895
before you actually
attend the lab.

00:45:57.895 --> 00:45:58.810
It'll save you time.

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:02.120
You'll have much more enjoyable
experience at the

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:02.660
BootCamp lab.

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:05.862
Same thing for Python, just make
sure you're good to go.

00:46:05.862 --> 00:46:09.662
It's typically lesson steps
for getting started.

00:46:09.662 --> 00:46:12.605
WESLEY CHUN: Really?

00:46:12.605 --> 00:46:14.220
CHRIS SCHALK: Any other
final questions as we

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.221
start to wrap up?

00:46:16.221 --> 00:46:17.330
WESLEY CHUN: Question?

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:18.073
Yes, go ahead.

00:46:18.073 --> 00:46:19.323
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.300
CHRIS SCHALK: You can.

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:24.370
WESLEY CHUN: You can.

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:27.350
There's a plug-in called PyDev,
P-Y-D-E-V. That's the

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:28.100
most popular one.

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.980
I think there's two others, but
that's the one that most

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:32.360
people use, if you're
developing

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.100
Python using Eclipse.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.210
Python has many other
IDEs as well.

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:39.540
But if you want to stay within
Eclipse, it's easier

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.553
to do it that way.

00:46:40.553 --> 00:46:41.770
CHRIS SCHALK: We got a
question back there.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:42.210
WESLEY CHUN: Question?

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:43.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:54.560
CHRIS SCHALK: So the question
is, can you install the

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.630
Android plug-in, in addition
to the Eclipse

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:58.040
plug-in for App Engine?

00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.880
As far as I know,
I believe so.

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:00.870
I've had it on my system.

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:02.660
On my current system right
now, it's different.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:03.600
But we're getting
confirmation.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.440
WESLEY CHUN: There's a lot of
people saying, yes, up here.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.230
CHRIS SCHALK: So I would
say, go for it.

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:08.330
I think it's fine.

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:10.230
I think as people are starting
to get ready for the next

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:13.260
session, we should probably go
ahead and get ready to--

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.130
a few more questions?

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:15.080
Yes, go ahead.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:22.205 --> 00:47:24.560
WESLEY CHUN: Just post?

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:26.990
Post and get.

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:29.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:31.390
WESLEY CHUN: There's
no API, right.

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.470
CHRIS SCHALK: So the question
was, basically, Android and

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:34.870
App Engine interactivity.

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:36.980
So, essentially, you
can use HTTP to get

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:37.860
posts and so forth.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:40.650
And there's no problem with
that in that sense.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:42.560
WESLEY CHUN: If you go back into
the blog and look like,

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.520
in August, there's an example.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:48.010
A post that was made by myself
and another Android developer

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:51.590
that talks about their
experiences building a backend

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:53.335
on App Engine for their
Android app.

00:47:53.335 --> 00:47:55.670
CHRIS SCHALK: So anyway, I just
wanted to thank you guys.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:56.170
Welcome.

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:57.160
Thanks.

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.910
WESLEY CHUN: Thank you.

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:01.352
Have a great BootCamp.

00:48:01.352 --> 00:48:02.730
CHRIS SCHALK: And good
luck with App Engine.
