00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now fast forward to 2012.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We built the Google Car.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We're now using multiple methods.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We use histogram methods and particle methods.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The main difference to what you've learned, so far, is two-fold.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The main difference that we've learned so far

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is the Robot Model.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The vehicle is actually modeled as a system

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
with 2 non-steerable wheels and 2 steerable wheels.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That's often called a Bicycle Model

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
because half of it--this thing over here--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
acts like a bicycle.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The big difference is the Sensor Data.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Instead of using landmarks,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we get this really elaborate road map,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and then we take a single snapshot

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and we match that snapshot into the map.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And the better the match,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the higher the score.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And then on top of it, we have additional sensors, like GPS.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We also have Inertial Sensors.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I am not going to go into those at all,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but the methods I taught you

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
are rich enough to handle these additional sensors.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So you've just learned about the gist of the method

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the method in which the Google Car is able

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to find where it is, and where other cars are.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
When you build a system, you have to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
dive into these more elaborate methods

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But I think it's very much doable.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It's very easy to replace

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the current simple motion model with the slightly

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
more sophisticated, for what's called

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
a Bicycle Model, and it's easy to write

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
a correlation function of the map data

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and computes normalized correlations

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
of measurement images in a big pixel map.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'll leave this an an exercise

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
so if you want to hack your own car

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and make it drive itself, have fun.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I just want to congratulate you.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You've actually, in these 3 classes,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
learned pretty much as much as

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
any of my Stanford student learns

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
in my Specialized AI classes on robotics, when it comes to robot perception.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In fact, you've learned pretty much what there is to know

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.221
to become a successful practitioner in robotics.
