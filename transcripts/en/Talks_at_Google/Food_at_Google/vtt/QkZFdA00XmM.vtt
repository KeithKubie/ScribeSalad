[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.404 --> 00:00:06.070
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.070
Thank you so much.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.570
All right.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.290
I'm going to start with
a question for you all.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.746
Is anybody hungry?

00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:12.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.730
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:13.600
Excellent.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.940
So Chef [? DeeDee ?]
and her team

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.050
are going to prepare some
great food for us after this.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.249
But you have to just bear
with me for a second.

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.540
We're going to get to enjoy
these breakfast sandwiches.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.665
Pretty simple breakfast
sandwich-- cheese, sausage,

00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:28.165
eggs.

00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:29.950
But first, we've just
got to do something

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.690
before you all get to eat this.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.189
Hold on.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.113
Just bear with me.

00:00:34.113 --> 00:00:34.738
[POURING WATER]

00:00:34.738 --> 00:00:35.692
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.060
OK.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.057
We're getting ready.

00:00:45.057 --> 00:00:46.640
Now, you might be
wondering why I just

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.100
dumped an entire gallon of
water down the drain, why

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.200
I would go and waste all
that water, especially

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.020
during Earth Week here on
Environment Day at Google,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.040
no less.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.010
Well, to produce just the single
egg in this breakfast sandwich

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.843
that we're going to
eat, we have to dump out

00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:01.799
not one but 53 gallons of water.

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.340
That's how much water it takes
to produce just a single egg--

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.260
53 gallons.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.540
To produce sausage,
that's another 500 gallons

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.240
of water; and cheese, that's
another 50 gallons of water.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.680
That's what it takes to
produce protein from animals.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.100
In the 15 years that I've
been researching food systems

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.810
and advocating for
a better one, I've

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.480
come to realize that the
number one most wasteful aspect

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.910
of our food system today
comes from the fact

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.950
that we use animals
as a middleman.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.410
So here's what I mean--
first, we grow crops.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.170
We don't feeds those
crops to humans.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.780
First, we feed them to
animals to fatten them up.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.680
We raise the animals.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.971
We transport them to slaughter.

00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:40.299
And the rest is history.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.840
So animals are just
kind of middlemen

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.060
between the crops we
produce to feed them

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.570
and the protein they
produce to feed us.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.820
The problem is it's
super inefficient.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.860
Even in the best
cases, a farm animal

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.530
converts only like
11% of what's called

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.009
"feed energy" into human food.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.550
That means that
calorically speaking,

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.510
89% percent of what we put
into an animal is wasted.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.570
And nearly all of these animals
in our food supply chain

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.200
are chickens.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.734
We're so knee-deep
in chickens today

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:11.210
that every 60 seconds,
every single day,

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.619
130,000 of these
animals are slaughtered.

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:14.660
If you can imagine that--

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.480
130,000 animals every minute
of every day, 24/7, 365.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.660
That's a lot of animals,
and it's taking a toll.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.500
Because it's so inefficient to
funnel crops through animals

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.070
to get to protein, we lose loads
of resources in the process--

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.810
like all that water.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.660
The meat, dairy, and egg
industries, all told,

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.360
are so wasteful,
they're so inefficient,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.610
that they now cause
more greenhouse gas

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.840
emissions than every car,
truck, plane, ship, and train

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.850
in the world combined.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.840
But the problems aren't just
global, they're local, too.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.550
I met this woman
recently named Lisa,

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.610
who lives on the eastern
shore of Maryland

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.410
on land that's been
part of her family

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.570
for like four generations.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.550
Totally normal
neighborhood in most ways.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.100
Picture any suburban
neighborhood,

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.720
split-level homes,
toys in the front yard,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.030
basketball hoop in the driveway.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.650
But Lisa and her
husband Joe, they're

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.090
being pushed off their land.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.423
They're probably going to
have to sell their house soon.

00:03:13.423 --> 00:03:15.500
They're not being pushed
out by crime or drugs

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.910
or high-rise condos.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.450
They're being pushed
out by chickens.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.440
See, having moved into
their neighborhood

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.150
are these massive
chicken warehouses

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.620
containing 10,000 birds, 20,000
birds, right in their backyard.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.570
I visited them last
year, and I was really

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.310
moved to see how
just kind of peppered

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.685
throughout their
neighborhood are

00:03:32.685 --> 00:03:34.760
these massive warehouses now.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.590
I saw the hoards of
flies in the air.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.960
I smelled the stench.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.367
I saw buzzards flying
overhead constantly,

00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:42.950
ready to pick off dead chickens
littering the side of the road

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.380
all up and down
their neighborhood.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.015
I had to see all
this on one day,

00:03:47.015 --> 00:03:48.671
but Lisa and Joe
and their neighbors,

00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:50.420
they have to live with
it every single day

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.010
right in their backyard.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.920
So we have to ask ourselves,
does this still make sense?

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.102
We've used animals
as that middleman

00:03:58.102 --> 00:03:59.810
to get to protein for
thousands of years,

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.610
but do we still have to?

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.820
In 2018, if breakfast
sandwiches didn't exist

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.250
and we wanted to build
one from the ground up,

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.080
using what we have
available today,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.630
we wouldn't look towards
chickens to produce the eggs

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.690
and we wouldn't look towards
pigs to produce the sausage.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.480
In the same way that if the
idea of watching movies at home

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.720
was somehow brand new to us in
2018, the thing we wouldn't do

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.030
is go out and build
physical video rental stores

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.370
to have to drive
to on Friday night.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.390
We use science and technology to
cut out middlemen all the time.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.480
And the same is
happening with food.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.557
And rather than
growing all these crops

00:04:33.557 --> 00:04:35.890
and funneling them through
animals, raising the animals,

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.389
slaughtering them
to get to protein,

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.240
we can just use the protein
that's already found in plants.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.010
And the food industry
is doing this.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.410
They're making chicken
without chickens.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.970
They're making
plant-based burgers

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.890
that have more protein
than beef in them.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.040
They're making pork without
pigs, and even cheese

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.440
from nuts instead of cows.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.410
These products are way
more efficient to produce.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.160
They require less water and
less land and other inputs.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.170
And they're also better for us.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.061
Plant-based proteins tend to
have less fat, less saturated

00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:06.560
fat.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.140
They have zero cholesterol,
since cholesterol only

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.290
comes from animal proteins.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.607
But what if we want real meat?

00:05:13.607 --> 00:05:15.440
I'm not talking about
meat made from plants,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.630
but actual flesh, actual tissue,
real muscle, without animals?

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.340
Impossible, right?

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.190
In 1931, Winston
Churchill was asked

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.980
to predict what the world would
look like in a half a century--

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.270
so by the '80s.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.600
And he predicted that we shall
escape the absurdity of growing

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.480
a whole chicken in order to
eat the breast or the wing

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.070
by growing those
parts separately

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.722
under a suitable medium.

00:05:38.722 --> 00:05:40.430
Well, it didn't happen
by the '80s, which

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.060
is what Churchill predicted,
but it's happening now.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.440
It's called clean meat.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.540
And like clean energy,
it's way more resource

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.220
efficient to produce.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.400
We can now take a biopsy the
size of a poppy seed from just

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.890
a single chicken feather--
just the feather--

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.570
and from that,
grow enough nuggets

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.200
to feed an army or a village.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.510
So these innovations are
shifting our relationship

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.021
with food at the cellular level.

00:06:04.021 --> 00:06:05.770
Because what we eat
is really an extension

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.960
of what it is to
be human, I believe

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.850
that fundamentally
changing our relationship

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.150
with food in this way can serve
to elevate our own humanity.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.870
I think it can lead to a
kinder more compassionate world

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.090
for everybody.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.520
We humans are an
amazing species.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.650
We're capable of really
wonderful things.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.560
We've got a spark of
imagination and creativity

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.650
that's unparalleled in the
rest of the animal kingdom.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.272
We're the only species on the
planet that can see the stars,

00:06:32.272 --> 00:06:33.730
dream about what
might be up there,

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.170
and then actually
go and find out.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.110
There's so much
about us as a species

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.210
that really is unique to us.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.720
But at the same time, we
also share so much in common

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.880
with the rest of
the animal kingdom--

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.310
joy, play, communication.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.250
Do you all know
that chickens use

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.350
complex vocalizations to
communicate with one another?

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.334
Just like we do.

00:06:55.334 --> 00:06:57.250
They have different calls
to alert one another

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.300
when a predator is approaching
by land versus by air.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.670
Fish can learn and use tools.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.740
Pigs rank higher on
intelligence tests

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.840
than three-year-old humans do.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.850
And, of course, we all
want to avoid pain.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.550
We all want to avoid suffering.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.330
Every animal wants
to avoid fear.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.740
If through our
diets we can learn

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.170
to really value these
similarities that we share

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.060
with other species
rather than just focusing

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.030
on our differences, I think it
would bring tremendous value

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.030
to how we treat one another.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.260
So a fish was born with
gills instead of lungs,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.810
so a chicken was born with
wings instead of arms,

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.170
if we can extend our
circle of compassion

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.650
to those beings even
most unlike ourselves,

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.690
how might we extend it
to our fellow humans?

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.337
To those born black
instead of white or gay

00:07:43.337 --> 00:07:44.170
instead of straight?

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.090
To those born in another
country than we were?

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.230
Can you picture a world
where we take so seriously

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.690
this idea of value
in our similarities

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.850
rather than just always
focusing on our differences

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.595
that it extends even to
the food we choose to eat?

00:07:57.595 --> 00:07:59.470
What about a world where
we're happier, where

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:00.910
we're plagued less by disease?

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.780
A world where we're healthier?

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.210
A world with a
more stable climate

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.820
where we do more with less?

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.820
My road to picturing this world
came about many years ago.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.520
When I was about 12,
my sister came home

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.404
from school a vegetarian.

00:08:14.404 --> 00:08:15.820
This was in the
early '90s, if you

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.770
couldn't guess by the clothes.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.470
And I never even heard the word
"vegetarian" before, let alone

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.770
met one.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.950
So what I do, like any
good little brother,

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.600
I made fun of her.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.580
You can imagine, with that hair,
I was the making fun of her.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.570
I'd put a piece of steak
on the end of my fork

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.970
and put it in her face
and make a mooing sound.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:38.140
My mom, fortunately, was much
more accommodating than I was.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.757
If she had a pot of beef chili
for the two of us on the stove,

00:08:40.757 --> 00:08:43.090
she'd have a pot of bean chili
next to it for my sister.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.220
If she was grilling
hamburgers in the backyard,

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.440
she'd have a veggie
burger out there, as well.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.671
And I liked food.

00:08:48.671 --> 00:08:50.170
I wasn't opposed
to trying new food.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.110
So I started to try some
of these weird, new foods.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:54.310
And I liked them.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.480
I was no vegetarian, though.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.570
If I had a black bean burger,
I would put bacon on it.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.850
If I had a bean burrito
one day for lunch,

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.600
I'd made sure to have
chicken for dinner,

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.030
just to balance it out.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.340
Eventually, I did learn
more and more and more

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.530
about the reasons for
my sister's new diet,

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.450
and I also moved
in that direction.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.100
So if you haven't
guessed by now,

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.100
our breakfast sandwich
that we're going to enjoy

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.350
isn't made from cheese
and sausage and eggs.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.320
The cheese is made from almonds.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.190
The sausage is made from
[INAUDIBLE] protein.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.260
The eggs are made
from chickpea flour.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.080
The whole thing is entirely
plant-based, without animals,

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.220
and it's delicious.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.670
So that world
where we're kinder,

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.620
where we're more
compassionate, the world

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.830
where our meals are
extensions of our morals,

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.580
that's a better
world for all of us.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.490
And I know that
all of us have it

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.165
within us to serve as
ambassadors for that world.

00:09:45.165 --> 00:09:46.540
Every time we sit
down to eat, we

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.540
can be a good example for
our friends and neighbors,

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.270
at school, at church,
at work; a good example

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.905
for our little brothers
and little sisters.

00:09:54.905 --> 00:09:57.280
And millions of people are
doing it all over the country.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.010
People are trying
Meatless Monday.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.700
They're eating smaller
portions in meat.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.700
They're moving meat from
the center of the plate

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.741
to the side of the plate.

00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:07.600
They're doing one or
two veggie meals a day.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.170
Saving the world really
can be as simple as that.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.150
And it begins with every bite.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.720
So thank you so much.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.440
And I am happy to
field any questions.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.221
I know Marty's got
a couple that we're

00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:20.470
going to kick things off with.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:21.070
SPEAKER 2: Sure thing.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:21.945
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:10:21.945 --> 00:10:23.294
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.355
SPEAKER 2: Excuse me.

00:10:27.355 --> 00:10:29.160
And thank you so much.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.540
It's kind of sobering to
see some of the statistics,

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.065
it really, truly is.

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:34.940
Would you mind taking
us through a little bit

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.940
how you got started
in the culinary arts

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.650
and what kind of led
you to this journey

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.217
to decide to publish
a book on the subject

00:10:42.217 --> 00:10:43.550
that you're so passionate about?

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.030
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.990
I always loved cooking.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.490
I always loved being
in the kitchen.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.700
It felt comfortable there.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.486
When I was really
little, I think

00:10:49.486 --> 00:10:51.110
one of my first
projects in the kitchen

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.840
was I would take all the
spices out of our spice cabinet

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.360
and organizing them to combine
all the little half jars

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.110
of cinnamon and little
half containers of pepper.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.150
When I was probably
about eight, I

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.370
started cooking
really simple meals.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.840
I would make scrambled
eggs in the microwave,

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.910
which I don't recommend.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:08.100
It's about as good--

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.410
SPEAKER 2: [LAUGH]

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:09.890
SPEAKER 1: --as it sounds
like it's going to be.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.180
SPEAKER 2: Even with one of
those cool little contraptions

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.600
off of As You Can See on TV?

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.641
SPEAKER 1: Just in a mug.

00:11:13.641 --> 00:11:14.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:14.840
Yeah.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.647
Not very good.

00:11:15.647 --> 00:11:16.980
But I just always loved cooking.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.820
And then, especially when I
became vegetarian and then

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.220
when I became vegan,
I realized that there

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.110
was like this whole
culinary world

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:25.670
out there that I
had no idea about.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.530
I'd never tried Thai food.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.854
I'd never tried Indian food.

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:30.770
I didn't even know that
these things existed--

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.710
Ethiopian food, tofu, tempeh.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.020
Just all kinds of new tastes and
textures and flavors that I'd

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.450
never even heard about before.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.365
And that started me
on my culinary path

00:11:40.365 --> 00:11:41.740
was just realizing
that there was

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.030
a whole world of
textures and flavors

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.495
out there for the taking.

00:11:45.495 --> 00:11:46.370
SPEAKER 2: Fantastic.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.040
And you mentioned
your being a vegan.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.520
And from a chef's
perspective, a lot

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.050
of times when we hear vegan--

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.120
for folks that are
non-vegans-- it's

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.710
veganism being the only answer
to dietary problems and issues

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:01.910
that we may face.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.530
Your approach is
less about being

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.370
a vegan specifically and more
about a complete plant-based

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:06.870
approach.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.369
Can you speak a
little bit about why

00:12:08.369 --> 00:12:11.660
you chose that route
versus the typical approach

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.394
that this veganism is
the only way to go?

00:12:13.394 --> 00:12:14.060
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.226
I think that there
is, literally,

00:12:16.226 --> 00:12:17.600
a seat at the
table for everybody

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.820
when it comes to
plant forward eating,

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.810
when it comes to using our
diets as a tool for good

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:24.510
in the world.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.360
Whether you're vegan, whether
you're a vegetarian, doing

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.550
Meatless Mondays, whether
you've only ever eaten

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.064
one plant-based meal
in your entire life,

00:12:31.064 --> 00:12:32.480
I just think that
there is a place

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.910
for everybody on the spectrum.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.730
A lot of people now are
doing Meatless Mondays.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.230
They're just eating
smaller portions

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.510
of meat, like I mentioned,
or just literally

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.460
moving meat from the
center of the plate

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.040
always to being more
of a luxury item

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.600
or on the side of the plate.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.440
And I think that's the
way change happens.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.500
It takes everybody.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.620
Regardless of what diet we might
adhere to or try to adhere too,

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.420
it's like all hands
and forks on deck.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.360
SPEAKER 2: Absolutely.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.920
Do you find that that approach
has yielded a better reception

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.700
from folks that maybe
are not vegetarian

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.330
or not vegan at all versus
the traditional approach

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.070
that that's been out
there in years past?

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:13.460
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.668
There's a study that came
out recently from a company

00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:17.100
called Mintel, a research group.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.690
And they found that there are
about 22 million Americans who

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:25.790
consider ourselves vegetarian,
but 113 million who

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.081
say they regularly eat
meat alternatives--

00:13:28.081 --> 00:13:30.080
so, veggie burgers and
other products like that.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.560
So there are way more people
who are eating vegetarian food

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.690
than actually are vegetarian.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:40.970
So without a doubt that's what
most people are doing nowadays.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.190
SPEAKER 2: I think
as we're starting

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.640
to learn some of the effects
that Matthew pointed out

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.780
in his presentation of
the raising of livestock

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.360
on our environment-- and
it's still a fairly new thing

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.350
that I think we're
starting to wrap

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:55.880
our heads around a
little bit, and the news

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.755
is getting out there.

00:13:56.755 --> 00:13:58.592
But I think my
question to you is

00:13:58.592 --> 00:14:00.800
given that you've been
passionate about this for such

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.550
a long time, how did you
get into that piece of this

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:08.150
and connect a vegan or
plant-forward lifestyle

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:12.110
to the environment at
such an early stage?

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.480
SPEAKER 1: I've always
been passionate, I guess,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.880
about environmental issues.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.720
I'm a child of the '80s, when
you couldn't turn on the TV

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.430
without hearing
about global warming.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.260
Does everybody remember that?

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.311
It was just everywhere.

00:14:25.311 --> 00:14:27.060
Now, we call it climate
change, of course.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.670
Back in the '80s, everybody was
talking about global warming.

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.360
And so I just started learning
about it from a young age.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:37.070
The thing that really made
me move forward with my diet,

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.200
I think, was I mentioned
how my sister came home

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.330
from school a vegetarian
and I made fun of her.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.630
I didn't really get it.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.130
But we'd always had
animals at home.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:45.070
We always had pets.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.760
We had cats; we had dogs.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.074
And I loved them.

00:14:48.074 --> 00:14:49.615
Like most people,
always kind of just

00:14:49.615 --> 00:14:51.080
shared a bond with animals.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.400
And I guess a few years after
my sister had proclaimed herself

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.880
vegetarian, I
stumbled upon a video

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.290
of what happens to animals
in the livestock sector.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.389
The way that they're--

00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:04.430
without getting too graphic,
the way that they're

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.070
confined in cages and
crates barely larger

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.710
than their own bodies,
the way they're inhumanely

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.510
treated and slaughtered.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:15.080
And it just hit me that--

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.500
my dog, Kelsey, at home, a
German shepherd; my cat teaser,

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.610
a black cat--

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.730
if I wouldn't want those
things done to those animals,

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.500
I shouldn't be
paying somebody to do

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.812
those things to other animals.

00:15:25.812 --> 00:15:27.270
And all of a sudden,
I just got it.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.160
I understood why my sister
had become vegetarian.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.410
And that was really the thing
that pushed me over the edge.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.909
After I changed my
diet, that's when

00:15:32.909 --> 00:15:35.100
I started learning
more about the impact

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.180
that my old diet had on the
environment, about water usage

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.682
and land usage
and climate change

00:15:40.682 --> 00:15:42.140
and that connection
to what we eat.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:46.130
But for me, it was just wanting
to be kinder to animals.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.800
SPEAKER 2: In terms of some
of your favorite ingredients,

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.640
what are some things that
you cannot live without,

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.430
whether it's at your home or
things in the book that you

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.070
think are a key thing for
someone to have in their pantry

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.200
as they start this journey?

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.040
SPEAKER 1: Nuts.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.998
Definitely nuts, unless
you have a nut allergy.

00:16:03.998 --> 00:16:04.740
Sorry.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.220
I don't, so I use a lot of them.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.500
Nuts are a really amazing food.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.910
We can do so much with them.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.370
We can soak cashews,
blend them up

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.080
with just a little
bit of water and salt,

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.270
and make a cheesy sauce.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.920
If you've ever had
almond milk, that's

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.890
basically what almond milk is--
soaked almonds that have been

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.280
ground up and then strained.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.050
That's essentially almond milk.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:31.190
There are just so many
creamy, cheesy, milky sauces

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:34.120
and other kinds of products
that we can make using nuts.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.430
There's a whole wide world
out there of nut-based foods.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.180
Other great ingredients--
I love a product

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.310
called nutritional yeast.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.870
SPEAKER 2: Mm-hm.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.930
SPEAKER 1: I'd never heard
of it before I became vegan.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.500
And I'm so glad
that I know about it

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.940
now because it's incredible.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.120
Whether you're vegan or
not, sprinkle it on popcorn

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.962
and your life will be changed.

00:16:52.962 --> 00:16:54.920
It's kind of got a Parmesan
cheese type flavor.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.210
It's kind of sharp and tangy.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:58.252
Really wonderful product.

00:16:58.252 --> 00:16:59.960
SPEAKER 2: My wife
and I literally put it

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.050
on pretty much everything.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.012
Whole Foods sells it.

00:17:04.012 --> 00:17:05.220
I think Safeway now sells it.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:05.720
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.390
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:07.708
Back in the--

00:17:07.708 --> 00:17:10.240
I don't even know if we
could buy it in the '80s,

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.520
but certainly in the
'90s and the early 2000s,

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.490
it was like a vegan staple.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.190
Now, more and more people
are catching on to it

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.470
and just think, wow,
this is a great food.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.589
SPEAKER 2: And on that
note, with the rise of kind

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:26.430
of processed plant
proteins, I will say--

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.680
and you eluded to a few of
them in your presentation--

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.200
I think the Impossible
Foods burger up there--

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.430
how do those fit into
your plan and how do those

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.910
fit into your vision
as to how to round out

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.224
a plant-forward diet?

00:17:40.224 --> 00:17:40.890
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:42.880
I eat processed foods.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.610
I eat those types of
convenience foods.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.570
There are all kinds of
plant-based, plant-forward,

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.570
meat-like but meat-free
products of veggie chickens

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.130
and the Impossible
Burgers and Beyond

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:57.360
Burgers that now they say
even "bleed" like meat does,

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.950
but all from
plant-based ingredients.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:59.860
I love that stuff.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:00.720
I eat it.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.270
I would say mostly my
diet, just personally,

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:07.170
consists more of like whole
plant-based food items.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.660
I like eating that stuff
on the go if I'm traveling.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.130
There are a couple of
restaurants in my neighborhood

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.380
that serve that type of stuff.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.510
I like to go there if I just
want like a juicy burger.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.280
But, by and large, I just focus
on whole plant-based foods--

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:23.010
whole grains, legumes,
nuts, beans, tofu, tempeh--

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.590
products like that.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.525
SPEAKER 2: Do you have a
favorite recipe in the book?

00:18:27.525 --> 00:18:28.775
One that really speaks to you?

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:30.941
SPEAKER 1: I can't be biased
against my own recipes.

00:18:30.941 --> 00:18:33.480
SPEAKER 2: It's like choosing
a favorite child, I suppose?

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:33.870
SPEAKER 1: That's right.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:34.200
Yeah.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.285
I tell all the recipes
I love them all equally.

00:18:36.285 --> 00:18:37.035
SPEAKER 2: [LAUGH]

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.441
SPEAKER 1: It's not true,
though, but I do say that.

00:18:41.441 --> 00:18:43.440
Actually, one of my
favorite recipes in the book

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.550
isn't even my own.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.580
It's for a basbousa cake,
which is a Middle Eastern type

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:52.362
of cake made from semolina flour
and simple syrup and coconut.

00:18:52.362 --> 00:18:54.570
I got it from a friend of
mine who is Middle Eastern.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.004
He donated the
recipe for the book.

00:18:57.004 --> 00:18:58.920
It's the only recipe in
there that isn't mine,

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.425
and I think it's my
favorite one in the book.

00:19:00.425 --> 00:19:01.111
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:02.652
SPEAKER 2: It's a
good one to choose.

00:19:02.652 --> 00:19:03.630
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.880
SPEAKER 2: My final question
before we'll turn it over

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.060
to the audience to ask a
few questions is what advice

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.860
do you have for those of us that
are meat eaters at the moment,

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.290
looking to try and get more
into a plant-based diet

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:17.484
and maybe make that switch?

00:19:17.484 --> 00:19:18.150
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:21.490
I would say just explore
foods that are out there.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:25.110
For me, aside from the ethical
component of changing my diet,

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:29.370
the thing that I really got
the most out of it in terms of

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.490
was just opening up my
culinary experience.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:33.990
Before I adopted a
plant-based diet,

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.390
I was eating pretty much
the same thing every day.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.940
I was just a meat and
potatoes kind of guy.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.090
I didn't really explore that
much when it came to food.

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.460
So I would just say there's
a whole wide world of foods

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.840
and ingredients out there
that you might find you love.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:51.040
If you eat a beef burger, try
an Impossible Burger or Beyond

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.540
Burger.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.870
Try veggie chicken.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.480
It might not taste exactly the
same as chicken or as meat,

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.940
but you might like it just
as a different food product

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.230
unto itself.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.090
Not to mention all
the different things

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:07.090
you can make kind of whole
grains and nuts and produce.

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.510
SPEAKER 2: Do we have any
questions out here-- yes, sir.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.510
AUDIENCE: I'm curious,
so almost everybody has--

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.090
SPEAKER 1: So the question
was about having our own food

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.420
for us in our yard.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.860
I've always had gardens.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.350
I love being able to just go out
and pluck food from the garden

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.830
and then come inside and eat it.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.610
I know a lot of people
are doing more of that.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.980
It's such an easy
way to get basically

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.365
free food and food that is
fresh and healthy all the time.

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:35.240
You know exactly what's
gone into growing it.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.592
So, yeah, I highly
recommend it for everybody.

00:20:37.592 --> 00:20:39.550
SPEAKER 2: Just to add
on a little bit to that,

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.820
too, for a lot of us there,
we don't have the time

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.820
to wait for a beet to grow
and then do the whole bit,

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.570
but I find even if you
have a tight little space,

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.751
just growing fresh
herbs on your patio

00:20:50.751 --> 00:20:52.000
is a great way to get started.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.647
You can throw them out there.

00:20:53.647 --> 00:20:55.230
You can start picking
them immediately

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.813
if you buy them kind
of already grown.

00:20:56.813 --> 00:21:01.235
So it's a really easy
way to start that going.

00:21:01.235 --> 00:21:03.312
AUDIENCE: So thinking
about natural farming

00:21:03.312 --> 00:21:05.310
and how animals--

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.500
SPEAKER 1: I mean, by and large,
heritage animals don't really

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.190
exist anymore.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.670
There are very few
places that produce them.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:16.210
Almost exclusively, all
the animals in our diet--

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:20.860
certainly here in the US and in
North America and in Europe--

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.810
are animals that have
been bred specifically

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.460
for the purpose of
industrial agriculture.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.579
Whether in the future we're
using animals in our diet,

00:21:28.579 --> 00:21:29.120
I'm not sure.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.120
I don't know if we use
them as much as we are now,

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.780
if we use them more than we
are now, less, or not at all.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.600
But I think the one thing that--

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.830
the point that I tried
to make in my book,

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.110
and I think the one thing that
pretty much everybody can agree

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:42.720
on now, whether
you're slaughtering

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.470
a chicken in your
backyard, whether you're

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.240
eating meat three
times a day, is

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.342
we've got to eat
less of this stuff

00:21:48.342 --> 00:21:50.300
if we want to bring about
a better food supply.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.320
There's no way that our
planet can sustain--

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.350
just in the US alone-- raising
10 billion land animals--

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.510
that doesn't even include fish--

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.340
raising 10 billion
land animals a year

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.590
under industrial
conditions, locked in cages,

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.287
locked in crates, just
totally decimating the land.

00:22:05.287 --> 00:22:07.120
Because, at the end of
the day, the animal--

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.110
even if it's a heritage bird or
if it's an industrial-produced

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.880
animal--

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.400
the same equation applies
in terms of their conversion

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.540
of plant matter into protein.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:24.790
And so regardless of the source,
we have to eat less of them.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:27.680
A heritage chicken is
still eating grain,

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.310
for the most part, that may
have been grown on land that was

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.980
once the Amazon rain forest.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:36.214
And so, yeah, I think it's
just-- it's all about less.

00:22:36.214 --> 00:22:36.880
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.300
I guess the question
is also more--

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:37.966
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:22:37.966 --> 00:22:40.000
The question was what
happens to all the animals

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.950
if we stop eating them?

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.900
These animals aren't
self propagating.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.610
They're not out there
breeding themselves

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:46.540
under natural conditions.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.710
We're breeding them
specifically for this purpose.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:52.690
So when people eat less and
less and less animal products,

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:55.700
we breed less and
less of the animals.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.270
It's just supply and demand.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:02.350
So the question was basically
the energy costs of some

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.630
of the plant-based
convenience foods--

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:08.920
like veggie burgers and veggie
chicken and products like that.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.870
I would say, from an
environmental standpoint,

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.580
by all means, the
closer we can get

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.960
to a whole, plant-based,
locally-sourced diet,

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.760
the better off we are.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.135
Ultimately, though, even
the processed foods--

00:23:21.135 --> 00:23:22.510
if they're
plant-based or better,

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.593
environmentally speaking,
because you cut out that

00:23:24.593 --> 00:23:26.010
middleman--

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.690
if you take a chicken
nugget, for example--

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.580
a real chicken nugget
made of chicken--

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.250
you have to grow all the crops,
you have to process them still

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.000
in grain mills, you
have to transport them

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.850
all over the world.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:37.390
Then, you feed
them to a chicken.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.430
You raise the chicken,
slaughter the chicken,

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.589
and then you get protein.

00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:44.380
Then, you take a
vegetarian chicken nugget,

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.855
for example, same process.

00:23:45.855 --> 00:23:47.230
You still have to
grow the crops.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:48.379
You have to process them.

00:23:48.379 --> 00:23:50.420
You just turn it directly
into the chicken nugget

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.530
rather than going through
that middleman first.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.320
Still has an
environmental footprint.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.519
It's not, by any means,
a zero-footprint food.

00:23:58.519 --> 00:24:00.310
But it's much more
efficient because you've

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.765
cut out that middleman.

00:24:01.765 --> 00:24:03.140
But, yeah, at the
end of the day,

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.681
the closer we can get to whole
plant-based foods, the better.

00:24:05.681 --> 00:24:07.760
AUDIENCE: Do you
have a sense of--

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.760
SPEAKER 1: So it totally
depends on the product.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.740
And there isn't good,
clear data on it.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.670
But we know, for example, that
a gallon of milk, I think,

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:16.560
is upwards--

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.120
it costs upwards of like
1,000 gallons of water.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:25.384
Whereas, a gallon of soy
milk is more like maybe 100.

00:24:25.384 --> 00:24:26.800
It depends on the
product, depends

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.680
on the brand and all of
that, but much more resource

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.680
efficient.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.950
I'm sure you all are
familiar with Google Trends.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.150
I hope everybody in here is.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.020
But it's really interesting.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.395
If you use Google Trends to
see what people are searching

00:24:40.395 --> 00:24:43.840
for on the internet, if you
look at the word "vegetarian"

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.310
and the word "vegan," people
searching for the term

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.060
vegetarian has sharply
declined and people

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.143
searching for the word
vegan has sharply inclined.

00:24:51.143 --> 00:24:52.390
And there's a point where--

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.473
I think it's like around
2005 or something-- where

00:24:54.473 --> 00:24:57.442
people searching for the word
"vegan" just sharply go up,

00:24:57.442 --> 00:24:58.900
while vegetarian
goes sharply down.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.599
So I don't know if there
was a branding problem.

00:25:01.599 --> 00:25:03.640
It seems like people are
really interested in it,

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.960
searching for it.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.870
We see it more on
restaurant menus.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:10.630
But I do think that
the term "plant-based"

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:13.097
or "plant-forward" resonates
a lot more with people,

00:25:13.097 --> 00:25:13.930
for whatever reason.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:17.840
Yeah.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.744
The question was
about food allergies.

00:25:20.744 --> 00:25:23.410
I would say find the brands that
work for you and stick to them.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:28.764
There are great gluten-free,
for example, vegan,

00:25:28.764 --> 00:25:30.430
plant-based convenience
foods out there.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.350
The Beyond Meat
Burger is one example.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:35.380
It's a gluten-free burger
that looks and taste

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.750
and bleeds just like beef,
but it's entirely plant-based

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:40.430
and also gluten free.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.760
The bun, that's
another question.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:47.200
But, yeah, a lot of the types
of plant-based convenience foods

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.540
do contain gluten in them.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.660
So if you're allergic to that,
that's definitely a concern.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:55.450
As far as other allergies go, I
get a lot of questions but nut

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:59.420
allergies, a lot of vegan or
plant-based dairy products now

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:00.340
are made from nuts--

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.195
almond milk, cashew milk,
cashew milk ice cream, sauces,

00:26:04.195 --> 00:26:07.000
and cheeses and stuff like that.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.080
I would say, ironically, Google
is your best friend on this.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.740
If you cook at home, if
you Google "gluten-free,

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:19.766
plant-based milk," you're
going to get 1,000 recipes.

00:26:19.766 --> 00:26:21.640
Just because of the way
your algorithm works,

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.140
the ones toward the
top are probably

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.550
going to be the best ones.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.320
But if you have
additional allergies,

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.460
it's definitely
tough for eating out,

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.001
in general, even if
you're not trying

00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:31.221
to eat a plant-based diet.

00:26:31.221 --> 00:26:31.720
Yeah.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.553
So the question was the
environmental impact

00:26:33.553 --> 00:26:35.520
of chicken compared to beef.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.790
Beef has its own
special set of problems.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:42.190
Cows are very gaseous animals,
especially when they eat grass,

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.800
because of the way
their digestion works.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.380
They emit a lot of methane,
which is a major problem.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.870
Chickens emit less
methane on the whole.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.250
But there's so
much more of them.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:52.976
There's so much more chickens.

00:26:52.976 --> 00:26:54.850
Because they're smaller,
we need more of them

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:56.090
to sustain the food supply.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:59.350
So in the US, we have about
10 billion farm animals.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:03.390
About 9.5 billion of those
animals are chickens.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.660
Nearly all of them--

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.180
more than 9 out of every
10 animals in the US

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.799
is a chicken when it
comes to our food supply.

00:27:09.799 --> 00:27:11.590
And so some of the
biggest problems related

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:13.600
to chicken farming are where
do we put all these animals?

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.400
That's why we put them into
suburban neighborhoods,

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.571
like the one I talked about.

00:27:16.571 --> 00:27:17.570
Where does the waste go?

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:18.528
It ends up in the land.

00:27:18.528 --> 00:27:21.304
It ends up in the waterways.

00:27:21.304 --> 00:27:22.720
We have so many
chickens, we don't

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.428
know what to do with
them or their waste,

00:27:24.428 --> 00:27:27.520
and it's a major
environmental catastrophe.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.810
Cows-- also not a great.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:31.150
A lot of methane
contribution from them

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.120
in terms of their
digestion process.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.620
Seafood is another issue.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.480
We're pulling so many
fish out of the ocean

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.855
now that scientists
say we're not

00:27:38.855 --> 00:27:42.940
going to have any left by 2048,
which is not that far from now.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.680
Fish farming, as well-- huge
environmental footprint.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:52.807
I would say, on the whole,
moving more away from seafood,

00:27:52.807 --> 00:27:54.640
more away from poultry,
more away from beef,

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.990
is probably the best bet.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:58.350
SPEAKER 2: All right.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.341
Well, I think now
we can get to--

00:28:00.341 --> 00:28:01.340
SPEAKER 1: Speaking of--

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.290
SPEAKER 2: We have all
these ingredients here,

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:03.670
we might as well cook
a little bit, right?

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:04.336
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:28:04.336 --> 00:28:05.751
SPEAKER 2: So let's do it.

00:28:05.751 --> 00:28:07.250
SPEAKER 3: Thank
you for being here.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.840
SPEAKER 1: Take it away.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.080
SPEAKER 3: Yeah.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:08.740
Thanks, chef.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.300
SPEAKER 2: Hey, thank you.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.660
SPEAKER 3: So we're going to
work through a vegan breakfast

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.130
sandwich today.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:20.770
Plant-based recipes and we
teach plant-based dishes

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:22.920
in Kitchen Sink every day.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.670
So super excited about this one.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:28.571
Maybe we can just keep
taking questions or just--

00:28:28.571 --> 00:28:30.070
SPEAKER 2: I'll
answer this question

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:31.153
before we get asked-- yes.

00:28:31.153 --> 00:28:32.910
We will get to taste this stuff.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.540
Everybody will get some.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.560
They're delicious.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.665
So what do we have?

00:28:36.665 --> 00:28:38.290
Talk us through some
of the ingredients

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:40.248
that we're going to be
playing with here today.

00:28:40.248 --> 00:28:45.370
SPEAKER 3: So as far as the egg
goes, we have garbanzo flour,

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:46.510
chickpea flour--

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:49.390
of course, gluten
free, high in protein--

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:53.976
nutritional yest, which you
guys spoke with earlier.

00:28:53.976 --> 00:28:55.600
Some salt and pepper
and some turmeric.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.670
So it's pretty easy.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.172
Just mix these
ingredients together.

00:29:00.172 --> 00:29:02.380
SPEAKER 2: And Matthew, you
want to talk a little bit

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:07.160
about inspiration or a thought
process behind this dish?

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.160
I know we eluded to the
environmental impact

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.118
of this dish specifically
in your presentation.

00:29:11.118 --> 00:29:13.564
But how did this come to be?

00:29:13.564 --> 00:29:14.230
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:17.410
I think chickpea flour
is a great ingredient.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.990
Like Chef [? DeeDee ?] said,
it's just high protein,

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:21.730
it's easy to work with.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:27.190
You come out with a product that
you can make egg-like products

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:28.260
out of it.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:32.860
I make potato pancakes using
chickpea flour instead of eggs.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.560
Just really good for
you and good product.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.630
And when you mix it
with water and you

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.490
let it sit for a little while,
you'll see what happens.

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:43.600
It turns into kind of a paste
that you can scramble up

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.559
a little bit like eggs.

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:46.974
Is it going to taste exactly
like eggs and look like them?

00:29:46.974 --> 00:29:47.930
Definitely not.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.410
But it's just a good
product in its own right.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.210
I like to cook with
ingredients like this

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:56.100
that are just kind of
readily available and simple.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.570
Where you think about making
an egg patty for a breakfast

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.945
sandwich, it's just chickpea
flour, a little bit of salt,

00:30:00.945 --> 00:30:03.194
pepper, turmeric, a little
bit of olive oil and water,

00:30:03.194 --> 00:30:03.910
and that's it.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:04.630
Very easy to make at home.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.330
SPEAKER 2: And minimizes the
allergens that we talked about.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:06.580
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.110
And minimizes the allergens.

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:14.209
It's a gluten-free product for
all of you Celiacs in the room.

00:30:14.209 --> 00:30:15.250
SPEAKER 2: Now, is this--

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:16.120
SPEAKER 1: That's
the English muffin

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.370
that we're going to eat it on.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.017
It's not so much gluten free.

00:30:19.017 --> 00:30:20.600
SPEAKER 2: Was this
something that you

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.840
were looking to try and
fill a void for something

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.854
that you had enjoyed prior
to your lifestyle change?

00:30:26.854 --> 00:30:27.520
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.210
I think that-- when I think
about plant-based foods that

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:33.510
kind of look and feel
and taste somewhat like,

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:37.270
or in some cases a lot like,
their meat-based counterparts,

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.440
I think back to my
diet before I became

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.712
a vegan, before I ate
a plant-based diet,

00:30:42.712 --> 00:30:43.420
I liked the food.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.230
I liked the taste of meat.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:45.400
I liked the taste of eggs.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.233
For me, it had nothing
to do with the taste.

00:30:47.233 --> 00:30:50.470
And so I still wanted
to eat those flavors,

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.240
or as close to
them as I can get.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.140
And this is a great example
of just kind of something

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.887
I always enjoyed eating when I
was a kid, something I always

00:30:58.887 --> 00:31:00.970
enjoyed eating before I
adopted a plant-based diet

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.625
and wanted to try to get
closer to as a vegan.

00:31:03.625 --> 00:31:04.500
SPEAKER 2: Fantastic.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.424
And I want to talk a little
bit about the sausage.

00:31:07.424 --> 00:31:08.090
SPEAKER 3: Yeah.

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:11.110
So in the book--

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.220
there's great vegan
sausages on the market,

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:16.210
but you also include one
that you can make at home.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:20.650
So we decided to do
that recipe, as well.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:25.150
Definitely geared towards
the more European-style

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:28.269
with some sun-dried tomatoes
and some basil and some garlic.

00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:30.560
But thinking about some other
profiles that we can do--

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.470
I mean, if you wanted
to go more kind

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:35.800
of along the Indian
spices, you could throw

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.500
in some ginger, some masala.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.000
I think you could
really play around

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.204
with this recipe to make
whatever variety you wanted.

00:31:43.204 --> 00:31:43.870
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:46.000
That's the great thing
about plant-based proteins,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.040
or at least kind of whole
plant-based proteins,

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.335
like tofu, tempeh, seitan--

00:31:50.335 --> 00:31:51.710
which is what
we're using today--

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.340
is you can really play around
with the flavor profile

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.520
quite a lot.

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.520
If you're making sausage--

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.750
pork sausage-- at home, you can
obviously do the same thing.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:05.539
But with plant-based proteins,
you just mix it right in there.

00:32:05.539 --> 00:32:08.080
When you're making seitan, it's
vital wheat gluten and water,

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.040
basically.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.610
And whatever spices and
herbs you want to use,

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.810
just throw them
right into the mix.

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:16.300
Whether you want to do
European or Italian flavoring

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:20.384
or Indian flavoring, African
spices, whatever it might be.

00:32:20.384 --> 00:32:21.550
It's a really great product.

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:25.210
So in the cookbook, the
sausage patty that's

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:27.370
used in this breakfast
sandwich recipe,

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.730
I just recommend using a
store bought brand-- whatever

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.470
brand you happen to like.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:34.504
This sausage recipe is
taken from another recipe

00:32:34.504 --> 00:32:35.670
in the book, I think, right?

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:37.170
The sun-dried tomato
basil sausages?

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:37.930
SPEAKER 3: Yes.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:39.346
SPEAKER 1: So Chef
[? DeeDee ?] is

00:32:39.346 --> 00:32:41.569
kind of doing a
little mash up for us.

00:32:41.569 --> 00:32:43.610
SPEAKER 2: A little creative
freedom there, Chef.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:44.180
SPEAKER 3: That's right.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.429
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, that's right.

00:32:45.429 --> 00:32:48.100
SPEAKER 3: So the
vital wheat gluten,

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.950
some of the dried spices,
all go in one bowl.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:54.060
And then, the paste
and all the seasonings

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.597
are going to go in here.

00:32:55.597 --> 00:32:56.430
Little bit of water.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.770
And I'm going to puree
it with a hand blender.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:01.779
But you could easily do a food
processor at home or Vitamix.

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:04.070
And then, we're going to mix
these two things together,

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.644
so pretty easy.

00:33:05.644 --> 00:33:06.810
SPEAKER 2: And with seitan--

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:07.940
for me, in particular--

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:11.370
I like to look at seitan as
a completely blank canvas.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.260
I mean, unto itself, it doesn't
really have much of a flavor,

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:18.130
but it kind of lends itself
to this exact creative freedom

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:21.820
that you can have to put
whatever you like in it.

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:25.240
There's recipes out there to
make seitan chorizo, where it's

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.080
the same flavors
of Spanish chorizo

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.520
that everybody loves in
the meat-eating world,

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.540
and some of the same texture,
but in a completely vegan

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.910
format.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:38.770
And I try to encourage
people when they're

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:42.250
cooking to have
fun and experiment,

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.049
and not be afraid to
make something that

00:33:44.049 --> 00:33:45.590
doesn't taste good
one time, and then

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.610
come back and try it again.

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:49.420
It's really, really important.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.429
And I think that's
how you get to a place

00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:53.345
where you have something
delicious like you've

00:33:53.345 --> 00:33:53.900
created here.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:54.566
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:33:54.566 --> 00:33:57.430
And I think experimentation,
for me, is key in the kitchen.

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:59.464
And this was the
same way before I

00:33:59.464 --> 00:34:02.130
adopted a plant-based diet was I
would experiment with foods all

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.546
the time, and come out with
things that were not something

00:34:04.546 --> 00:34:05.739
I would want to eat ever.

00:34:05.739 --> 00:34:07.280
I'm sure anybody
who cooks, I'm sure,

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.730
has the same experience
from time to time.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:11.260
Some recipes are just duds.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.010
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGH]

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.275
SPEAKER 1: And so I would
say with plant-based food,

00:34:14.275 --> 00:34:16.150
just try different brands
that are out there.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:17.710
Try different flavor profiles.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:20.760
Try different ways of preparing
seitan and tofu and tempeh.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.139
Some are going to be duds,
no doubt, because that always

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:24.050
is the case.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:25.570
But you'll definitely
find some, I'm

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:27.361
sure, that you love,
some that are winners,

00:34:27.361 --> 00:34:31.690
and that you stick with
all the time in your diet.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:34.020
SPEAKER 2: So in
your book, you have

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.920
some pretty big
celebrities in there that

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.434
have given you a shout out--

00:34:38.434 --> 00:34:40.100
SPEAKER 1: I should've
got you in there.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.558
SPEAKER 2: I don't
know about that.

00:34:41.558 --> 00:34:43.159
I'm not even in
that conversation.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:46.270
Why did you select the
folks that you selected

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:47.530
to be a part of the book?

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:50.549
And how have they been
advocates for your movement?

00:34:50.549 --> 00:34:52.049
SPEAKER 1: There
are a lot of great,

00:34:52.049 --> 00:34:54.340
kind of notable people
in the world who

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:57.130
have been advocating for these
types of changes in our food

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:57.750
system.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.760
So I tried to
incorporate, really,

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.787
anybody who had something
to say about it.

00:35:01.787 --> 00:35:03.370
There are a lot of
essays in the book.

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:04.300
If you flip through--

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.280
I think everybody here probably
should have gotten a copy.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.550
There are a lot
of essays in there

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:11.989
from people like Jesse
Eisenberg, the actor;

00:35:11.989 --> 00:35:14.530
from the heads of the some of
the major environmental groups;

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.440
the president of NRDC
and the Sierra Club

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.941
have essays in there.

00:35:18.941 --> 00:35:20.440
From the food world,
we've got folks

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.830
like Chef Jose Andreas has
an essay in the book called

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:26.152
Our Food Issues and How
They Impact the World.

00:35:26.152 --> 00:35:27.610
And then, in terms
of endorsements,

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:29.770
people like Wolfgang
Puck and Emeril Lagasse

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.145
and Alice Waters
and Paul McCartney.

00:35:32.145 --> 00:35:33.520
I was just very
fortunate to have

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.850
a lot of people kind of
support the project who

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:39.850
have started making the shift,
either in part or in whole

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:41.780
or at least recognize
that we've got to be

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:43.060
eating more plant-based foods.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:45.059
Somebody like Wolfgang
Puck is a great example--

00:35:45.059 --> 00:35:47.620
a very meaty chef, German chef.

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:48.335
Very meat heavy.

00:35:48.335 --> 00:35:50.960
But believes that we ought to be
eating more plant-based foods,

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.489
and so lent his
voice to the project.

00:35:53.489 --> 00:35:55.030
SPEAKER 2: And on
that front, I think

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:58.000
we've seen a shift
in recent years

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.120
to chefs having a voice in these
sort of political settings,

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.157
environmental settings.

00:36:05.157 --> 00:36:06.740
How do you think the
voice of somebody

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.872
like Wolfgang Puck
can really continue

00:36:08.872 --> 00:36:10.330
to drive this
conversation in a way

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:13.492
that we haven't had
advocates in the past?

00:36:13.492 --> 00:36:15.700
SPEAKER 1: I think that the
major shift that happened

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:19.600
is that we see people from kind
of all parts of the spectrum--

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.110
from vegans to Wolfgang
Puck and pretty much

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.539
everybody in between--

00:36:24.539 --> 00:36:26.080
who are now kind of
coalescing around

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.930
this idea of just eating more
plant-based foods and less

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:29.840
animal-based foods.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.524
Whether you go whole hog--

00:36:31.524 --> 00:36:34.190
no pun intended-- whether you go
whole hog towards a vegan diet.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.910
SPEAKER 2: Let's be
honesty, pun was intended.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:36.005
SPEAKER 1: Pun intended.

00:36:36.005 --> 00:36:36.505
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:36.505 --> 00:36:40.810
It actually wasn't, but it
should have been, though.

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:43.990
Whether you go fully in
that direction or not,

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.755
there's just--

00:36:44.755 --> 00:36:46.540
so many people have
kind of coalesced

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.026
around this idea of eating
more plants, less meat.

00:36:49.026 --> 00:36:49.972
SPEAKER 2: Fantastic.

00:36:49.972 --> 00:36:51.305
What's our next step here, chef?

00:36:51.305 --> 00:36:52.180
SPEAKER 3: All right.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.590
One more thing, to build
out this sandwich--

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:56.881
I know you talked a little
bit about the vegan cheese--

00:36:56.881 --> 00:37:00.370
but we did a cashew aioli.

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:05.560
Again, using nuts
for some great fats.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.140
And then, we have lemon,
garlic, a little bit

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:09.550
of cayenne and paprika.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:12.850
So just another idea
if you're building out

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:15.220
sandwiches at home.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.730
And then, a little gem
lettuces, little bit of avocado.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.730
So super excited to
share your recipe

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:23.320
with everybody in the room.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.354
We're going to cook
up the chickpea egg,

00:37:27.354 --> 00:37:29.020
and we're going to
sear up the sausages.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:35.330
So kind of a made for TV,
made the breakfast sausage.

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:37.670
This is what it looks like.

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:41.240
Then, we steam off the patty,
and then you can brown it.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.350
A couple of made for TV
things happening here,

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:47.654
but the recipe in the
book is fully detailed.

00:37:47.654 --> 00:37:48.320
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.870
A little bit of
TV magic in making

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:51.164
it happen so quickly, right?

00:37:51.164 --> 00:37:53.080
SPEAKER 2: And then,
seitan's a fun ingredient

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.496
because you can play with the
hydration level a little bit

00:37:55.496 --> 00:37:58.210
based on what desired
outcome you're looking for.

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:00.096
A little bit chewier,
you obviously add

00:38:00.096 --> 00:38:01.970
a little bit less water;
a little bit softer,

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:03.270
you add a little more water.

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:05.992
And so your hydration content
will yield a different product

00:38:05.992 --> 00:38:07.450
based upon what
you're looking for.

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:09.465
Was there a question here?

00:38:09.465 --> 00:38:11.340
SPEAKER 1: It be fun to
do an entire cookbook

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.429
of cooking failures.

00:38:12.429 --> 00:38:14.470
You can just call it
"Cooking Failures," like 100

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:16.574
of the worst recipes ever made.

00:38:16.574 --> 00:38:18.240
I don't know if it
would sell that well.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.780
So the question was a
plant-based mac and cheese

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.926
that was great at
the time it was

00:38:23.926 --> 00:38:25.800
being eaten for the
first time, but leftovers

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.180
got a little bit grainy.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:30.826
I would offer two
recommendations-- one,

00:38:30.826 --> 00:38:32.200
it could've been
a product of not

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.170
blending the cashews
long enough or not

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:35.430
soaking them long enough.

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:37.120
So the longer you
soak it, the creamer

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.250
it's going to be
when you blend it up.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.209
I usually soak them for at least
four hours, maybe even eight

00:38:42.209 --> 00:38:43.000
if I have the time.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:43.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:44.489
SPEAKER 1: OK, yeah.

00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:46.030
Soak them for a few
hours in advance,

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:46.690
and then blend them up.

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:48.520
And really blend the
heck out of them,

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.500
and they'll stay pretty creamy.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.180
If it gets a little bit
grainy for leftovers,

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.772
I would say a quick fix would
be mix a little bit more water

00:38:55.772 --> 00:38:57.230
and just give it
a couple of turns,

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:59.090
and then reheat it
to kind of get back

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:01.154
that creamy consistency.

00:39:01.154 --> 00:39:02.540
SPEAKER 2: Yes, sir?

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.880
AUDIENCE: The recipe--

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.880
SPEAKER 2: They're
essentially one and the same.

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.360
So by boiling it, you're putting
it in a moist environment

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.920
to continue to
hydrate the seitan.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.711
And the same thing with
the hydration level

00:39:11.711 --> 00:39:15.290
when you add your water in,
steaming it or boiling it

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:19.840
for a longer period of time
will yield a tougher or softer

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.840
product, depending on how
you want to handle it.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.710
So they are essentially
the same thing.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:26.880
It's just putting it in a moist
environment to help it "cook."

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.241
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] same
amount of time [INAUDIBLE]??

00:39:30.241 --> 00:39:31.490
SPEAKER 2: I would imagine so.

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.040
Honestly, I've never
steamed it before,

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.809
so I don't know if
it would be the same

00:39:35.809 --> 00:39:37.850
or if it would be less,
to be perfectly honestly.

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:39.620
SPEAKER 3: We also did--

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:42.110
you can also do like a
slow poach or a slow simmer

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:42.770
with it, too.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:46.460
So we have the steam oven here.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:47.079
But, yeah--

00:39:47.079 --> 00:39:48.620
SPEAKER 2: You gonna
try and flip it?

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:49.340
SPEAKER 1: You gonna
try to give it a flip?

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.540
SPEAKER 3: Go for it, chef.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:51.260
SPEAKER 2: I'm
not going to do it

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:51.950
in front of all these people.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:52.640
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, I know.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.230
SPEAKER 3: I'm
using the spatula.

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.620
SPEAKER 2: Flip it.

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:55.430
SPEAKER 1: Everybody back up.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:57.513
SPEAKER 2: We just talked
about culinary failures.

00:39:57.513 --> 00:40:00.467
What a good environment.

00:40:00.467 --> 00:40:01.550
SPEAKER 1: Oh, you got it.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:02.460
You can flip it.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.167
SPEAKER 2: Boom.

00:40:03.167 --> 00:40:03.920
SPEAKER 3: Done.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.420
Done.

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:05.545
SPEAKER 2: Don't be scared.

00:40:05.545 --> 00:40:06.260
SPEAKER 3: Done.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.010
SPEAKER 2: All right so--

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:08.330
SPEAKER 3: We're
getting close here.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:09.010
We're getting close.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.000
SPEAKER 2: So are we going
to just cut this out?

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.300
Yeah.

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:12.080
SPEAKER 3: So a couple of ways--

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.788
SPEAKER 2: So it'll
fit the size of our--

00:40:13.788 --> 00:40:17.090
SPEAKER 3: --that we thought
about the egg, you can use--

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:19.350
you can buy an egg
ring, of course,

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:23.300
so it looks perfectly round
like a scrambled egg might be.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.600
You could do it more
on this omelet style.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.612
Laura talked about
using a red bell pepper

00:40:28.612 --> 00:40:30.320
and you could cut up
slices, and then you

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:37.169
can create your own little
egg form to get it round, too.

00:40:37.169 --> 00:40:38.710
So I think there's
lots of solutions.

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:39.260
SPEAKER 2: I've never
heard of that trick.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:39.480
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.521
Basically, cut a ring out
of the red bell pepper,

00:40:41.521 --> 00:40:44.220
and then pour the batter
into the ring of the pepper.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.520
And then the pepper
cooks as the egg cooks.

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.220
SPEAKER 2: Huh.

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.650
SPEAKER 1: And you end up
with something-- you have

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:49.630
to eat the pepper at the end.

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:50.630
I guess you don't have to.

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:51.129
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:51.129 --> 00:40:54.161
Another great thing you can do
if you don't own egg rings--

00:40:54.161 --> 00:40:55.910
I may be the only vegan
on the planet that

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:57.640
owns egg rings at home--

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.480
but if you don't have
them, what you can do

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.780
is use the screw on top to a
Mason jar, just the part that's

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.280
hollow in the middle
and that screws

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.425
on, just grease that
up, put it in your pan,

00:41:06.425 --> 00:41:09.626
pour it right in there and
you get a perfect circle.

00:41:09.626 --> 00:41:10.530
SPEAKER 2: All right.

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:12.182
Yes, sir?

00:41:12.182 --> 00:41:15.086
AUDIENCE: In vegan
cooking, I've learned

00:41:15.086 --> 00:41:16.730
one of my own little
tricks to fool you

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:19.450
into thinking you're eating
something traditionally--

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:21.784
SPEAKER 1: So the question
was what are some ingredients

00:41:21.784 --> 00:41:24.116
that you can use to kind of
trick yourself into thinking

00:41:24.116 --> 00:41:25.430
it's the animal-based version.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:27.680
Honestly, I don't--

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.300
I don't try to trick
myself all that much.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.840
I try to eat foods
that I think just taste

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.220
good in their own right.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.870
Whether or not it's
a perfect analog

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.060
for a meat- or
animal-based version,

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.829
I just want it to taste good.

00:41:40.829 --> 00:41:41.870
But I know what you mean.

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:43.700
Like black salt, as
an example you gave,

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.290
has kind of a
sulfuric taste to it

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:47.960
that makes it taste a
little bit more like eggs.

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.880
Turmeric is a good example.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.629
If you're making tofu scramble
or something like that,

00:41:52.629 --> 00:41:54.920
you want to just give it a
little bit of a yellow tint,

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.090
turmeric is a great idea.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:58.910
Too much and it's going
to taste like Indian food,

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:00.390
but maybe that's a good thing.

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.890
Yeah.

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:02.723
There are all kinds of
ingredients out there

00:42:02.723 --> 00:42:04.190
that can just give
you little nods

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:06.352
toward the animal-based version.

00:42:06.352 --> 00:42:07.560
All right, Chef [? DeeDee. ?]

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:07.970
SPEAKER 3: What do you think?

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:08.380
SPEAKER 2: There we go.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:08.720
SPEAKER 1: Looks great.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.261
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:09.261 --> 00:42:10.136
SPEAKER 2: Very nice.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:13.860
All right.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.501
Well, I think that's what
we've got for you today.

00:42:16.501 --> 00:42:18.750
And we have some sandwiches
here for anybody to taste.

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.450
I'd like to thank Matthew
again for being here

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:23.457
and sharing your story
and sharing your book

00:42:23.457 --> 00:42:24.540
with all of us here today.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:24.880
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:25.470
Thanks so much.

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:25.860
SPEAKER 2: Thank you so much.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:26.130
It was a pleasure.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:26.400
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:26.690
Thank you.

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:27.280
And thank you.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:27.360
SPEAKER 3: Thank you.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.130
SPEAKER 1: I can't wait
to try your spin on it.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:29.310
SPEAKER 3: Yeah.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:29.820
Definitely.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.060
We'll be passing out
sandwiches for everybody.

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:32.170
SPEAKER 2: Fantastic.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:33.670
And thank you all
for joining us today.

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:34.990
I really appreciate
having you here.

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.615
Thanks so much.

00:42:35.615 --> 00:42:37.880
[APPLAUSE]
