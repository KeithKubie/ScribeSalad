00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.532
- [Instructor] We know that
for x in the open interval

00:00:02.532 --> 00:00:04.561
from negative 1/2 to 1/2,

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:06.449
that negative two over one minus two x

00:00:06.449 --> 00:00:08.630
is equal to this series.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.374
And it says using this
fact, find the function

00:00:11.374 --> 00:00:14.261
that corresponds to the following series.

00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:15.471
And like always, pause this video

00:00:15.471 --> 00:00:17.514
and see if you can work through it.

00:00:17.514 --> 00:00:19.532
All right, so the first
thing you might say is well

00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:23.288
how do we know that this
expression is equal to this series?

00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:26.504
And you might recognize this
series as a geometric series

00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:28.945
where the first term is negative two

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:31.867
and then the common ratio
to get each successive term,

00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:36.034
we're multiplying by two x,
we're multiplying by two x.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.316
And so for a geometric series like this,

00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:41.506
the sum is gonna be the first term,

00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:44.716
negative two over one
minus the common ratio,

00:00:44.716 --> 00:00:46.884
which is exactly what we have over there.

00:00:46.884 --> 00:00:48.269
So that's why we know that.

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:49.252
And this right over here,

00:00:49.252 --> 00:00:51.172
this gives us our radius of convergence,

00:00:51.172 --> 00:00:55.788
the x values for which this
thing will actually converge.

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:57.716
But now that we feel good
about this first statement,

00:00:57.716 --> 00:01:00.709
let's try to answer their actual question.

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:02.753
So we wanna find the function

00:01:02.753 --> 00:01:05.001
that corresponds to the following series.

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:08.858
So my instinct is to say, well
how does this series relate

00:01:08.858 --> 00:01:10.645
to the series they gave us?

00:01:10.645 --> 00:01:12.921
Let's see, this first
term is a negative two,

00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:15.402
this first term is a negative two x,

00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:18.562
this is a negative four x, this
is a negative two x squared.

00:01:18.562 --> 00:01:22.343
So the thing that might
jump out at you is that

00:01:22.343 --> 00:01:27.220
this second series they gave
us is the antiderivative

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.066
of this first one.

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.077
Or we could say this first
series is a derivative

00:01:30.077 --> 00:01:31.015
of the second one.

00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:33.645
What's the derivative of
negative two x with respect to x?

00:01:33.645 --> 00:01:35.061
Well, it's negative two.

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:36.983
What's the derivative of
negative two x squared

00:01:36.983 --> 00:01:38.310
with respect to x?

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.941
Well, it's negative four
x and so on and so forth.

00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:46.072
And so if we were to
call this, let me call,

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:48.597
let me call this thing right over here,

00:01:48.597 --> 00:01:53.439
actually, let me just say
that this is equal to g of x.

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.454
Well, the way I can take
this right hand side

00:01:55.454 --> 00:01:58.682
and get g of x is by
taking the antiderivative,

00:01:58.682 --> 00:02:00.256
taking the indefinite integral.

00:02:00.256 --> 00:02:02.559
And so what we can do, we can take

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:06.059
the indefinite integral of both sides, dx.

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:08.208
So dx.

00:02:09.267 --> 00:02:13.582
On the right-hand side
I'm gonna get g of x.

00:02:13.582 --> 00:02:17.221
And on the left-hand
side, I am going to get,

00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:20.383
actually let me write it this way.

00:02:20.383 --> 00:02:22.113
So on the left-hand side,
I'll just rewrite it,

00:02:22.113 --> 00:02:24.563
I'm gonna get the indefinite integral of,

00:02:24.563 --> 00:02:27.230
I'll write it as negative two dx

00:02:28.341 --> 00:02:30.091
over one minus two x.

00:02:31.478 --> 00:02:32.764
And that's just another way of writing

00:02:32.764 --> 00:02:34.585
what I have on the left-hand side here.

00:02:34.585 --> 00:02:37.531
This is equal to g of x, right?

00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:39.062
If I take the antiderivative of this

00:02:39.062 --> 00:02:40.601
or an antiderivative of this,

00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:44.629
is this g of x, where the
constant would've been zero.

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.212
So I'll say is equal to g of x.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.457
And so the key here is well,
what's the indefinite integral

00:02:51.457 --> 00:02:54.927
of this stuff, and you
might immediately recognize

00:02:54.927 --> 00:02:57.430
what I have here in the bottom,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.742
I have its derivative here on the top.

00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:01.905
If I consider this to be u.

00:03:01.905 --> 00:03:04.745
If I say u is equal to one minus two x,

00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:06.346
this is just u substitution,

00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:08.952
then du is equal to the derivative of this

00:03:08.952 --> 00:03:12.641
with respect to x which
is negative two dx.

00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:15.352
And so I have the du right over here.

00:03:15.352 --> 00:03:17.096
So let me rewrite all of this.

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:21.013
I can rewrite this as
the integral of du over u

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.573
is equal to g of x,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.550
and this we can rewrite as the natural log

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.749
of the absolute value of u plus c

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:37.552
is equal to g of x.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.591
And then we can undo our u substitution,

00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:45.033
and so for u I'll undo,
I will substitute back

00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:46.722
the one minus two x.

00:03:46.722 --> 00:03:49.424
So I can write the natural log of

00:03:49.424 --> 00:03:53.591
the absolute value of one
minus two x is equal to

00:03:56.212 --> 00:03:58.369
plus c, I don't wanna for get that,

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:00.536
plus c is equal to g of x.

00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:06.107
And so the next thing we wanna
do is well, what is our c?

00:04:06.107 --> 00:04:07.974
And the easiest way to figure out c is

00:04:07.974 --> 00:04:10.307
let's substitute zero for x.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.666
And so let's think
about this a little bit.

00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:17.565
So if I put a zero
here, if I put x equals,

00:04:17.565 --> 00:04:18.666
actually let me just write it again.

00:04:18.666 --> 00:04:21.805
So I have the natural
log, if I say x is zero,

00:04:21.805 --> 00:04:23.411
this is gonna be the natural log

00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:26.284
of the absolute value of one plus c

00:04:26.284 --> 00:04:28.496
is equal to g of zero.

00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:30.158
So what's g of zero?

00:04:30.158 --> 00:04:32.872
G of zero, everyone of these
terms is equal to zero.

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:35.157
G of zero is equal to zero.

00:04:35.157 --> 00:04:36.931
So is equal to zero.

00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:39.879
Well, natural log of one is just zero.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:43.474
So zero plus c is equal to
zero, c is equal to zero.

00:04:43.474 --> 00:04:44.853
So there you have it.

00:04:44.853 --> 00:04:47.032
I just took the
antiderivative of both sides

00:04:47.032 --> 00:04:48.911
of this equation right over here.

00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:51.890
I figured out, when I
substituted zero for x,

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.097
then okay, my constant
here is going to be zero,

00:04:55.097 --> 00:04:58.350
and I get that, I get that this series,

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.517
this g of x is equal to

00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:05.127
the natural log of the absolute
value of one minus two x,

00:05:05.127 --> 00:05:06.961
is equal to the natural
log of the absolute value

00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:08.895
of one minus two x.

00:05:08.895 --> 00:05:11.232
Now, if we keep this restriction

00:05:11.232 --> 00:05:12.707
that we're in this open interval,

00:05:12.707 --> 00:05:14.330
then this is always going to be positive.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.183
And we wouldn't have to
write the absolute value,

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:21.154
but we could be safe by
writing the absolute value.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.021
But there you go.

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:24.157
Using the fact above,
we found the function

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.977
that corresponds to this following series.

00:05:25.977 --> 00:05:28.238
And I guess you could
say that the trick of it

00:05:28.238 --> 00:05:30.446
was recognizing that

00:05:30.446 --> 00:05:34.113
the series up here is a derivative
of the series down here.

00:05:34.113 --> 00:05:36.775
And so this is going to be the derivative

00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:38.775
of the following series,

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.838
and so we just took the
antiderivative of both sides,

00:05:42.838 --> 00:05:45.857
or the indefinite integral of both sides.
