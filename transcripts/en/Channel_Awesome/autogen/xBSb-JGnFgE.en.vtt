with this new section of media which
personally<00:02:26.120><c> I</c><00:02:26.239><c> think</c><00:02:26.450><c> might</c><00:02:26.810><c> be</c><00:02:26.930><c> leading</c><00:02:27.110><c> up</c>

personally I think might be leading up
 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.780 align:start position:0%
personally I think might be leading up
to<00:02:27.260><c> a</c><00:02:27.380><c> streaming</c><00:02:27.739><c> service</c><00:02:28.040><c> I</c><00:02:28.370><c> don't</c><00:02:28.580><c> know</c><00:02:28.640><c> why</c>

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 align:start position:0%
to a streaming service I don't know why
 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.140 align:start position:0%
to a streaming service I don't know why
it<00:02:28.850><c> all</c><00:02:29.030><c> sounds</c><00:02:29.450><c> right</c><00:02:29.980><c> to</c><00:02:30.980><c> create</c><00:02:31.370><c> a</c><00:02:31.640><c> whole</c>

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 align:start position:0%
it all sounds right to create a whole
 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.900 align:start position:0%
it all sounds right to create a whole
new<00:02:32.440><c> section</c><00:02:33.440><c> of</c><00:02:33.530><c> entertainment</c><00:02:34.310><c> when</c><00:02:34.790><c> you</c>

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 align:start position:0%
new section of entertainment when you
 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.509 align:start position:0%
new section of entertainment when you
already<00:02:35.300><c> have</c><00:02:35.569><c> like</c><00:02:36.070><c> television</c><00:02:37.070><c> channels</c>

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 align:start position:0%
already have like television channels
 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.780 align:start position:0%
already have like television channels
and<00:02:37.940><c> other</c><00:02:38.540><c> places</c><00:02:38.959><c> toppings</c><00:02:39.680><c> already</c><00:02:39.980><c> yeah</c>

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 align:start position:0%
and other places toppings already yeah
 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.250 align:start position:0%
and other places toppings already yeah
so<00:02:41.269><c> I</c><00:02:41.300><c> think</c><00:02:41.480><c> this</c><00:02:41.720><c> is</c><00:02:41.780><c> leading</c><00:02:42.019><c> out</c><00:02:42.080><c> to</c><00:02:42.110><c> a</c>

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 align:start position:0%
so I think this is leading out to a
 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.570 align:start position:0%
so I think this is leading out to a
streaming<00:02:42.560><c> service</c><00:02:42.769><c> that's</c><00:02:43.100><c> just</c><00:02:43.340><c> my</c><00:02:43.430><c> opinion</c>

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 align:start position:0%
streaming service that's just my opinion
 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
streaming service that's just my opinion
