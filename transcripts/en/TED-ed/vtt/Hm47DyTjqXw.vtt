00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:09.912
I would talk about a younger generation that's coming up

00:00:09.912 --> 00:00:12.232
that will build a community

00:00:12.232 --> 00:00:14.493
that's not based around nation states

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:17.416
and based around limiting

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:20.149
and creating divides between people.

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:23.633
I would sort of look towards building a community

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:26.379
that's one that has a,

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:28.432
recognizes their shared future together

00:00:28.432 --> 00:00:32.816
and really can work together to build that.

00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:35.518
Whether they're from, you know,

00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:38.391
the slums of Kibera in Nairobi

00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:41.557
or from big cities like London

00:00:41.557 --> 00:00:45.026
or, you know, rural United States,

00:00:45.026 --> 00:00:47.167
you know, I think we're all one people,

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:48.232
and we can all work together,

00:00:48.232 --> 00:00:52.086
and so I would really talk about how

00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:53.570
that's what needs,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.235
that's what the world needs right now.

00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:56.769
We need to recognize

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.987
that we have far more in common

00:00:58.987 --> 00:01:02.027
than we do have differences.
