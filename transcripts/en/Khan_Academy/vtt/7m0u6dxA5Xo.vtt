00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.455
Let's draw a bunch
of parabolic mirrors.

00:00:02.455 --> 00:00:04.080
And what I want to
do in this video is,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.630
do a bunch of
examples of objects

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.140
in front of parabolic mirrors.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.800
And think about what the
images of those objects

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.530
will be based on how
far those objects are.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.010
And besides just giving
us a better understanding

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.240
of parabolic mirrors, this will
also, it 'll hopefully also

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.940
give us a sense of how do
we manipulate or how can we

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.640
conceptualize these light rays?

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.550
Which will be a
pretty useful tool

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.570
when we tackle other types
of reflective or refractive

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.509
devices like lenses.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.990
So that's a parabolic mirror.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.180
I've drawn its principal
axis right over here.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.763
And let me just copy and paste
this just so that I-- actually,

00:00:39.763 --> 00:00:41.180
let me draw the
focal point, too.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.560
So this is the focus
right over here.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.260
So let me just draw the
focus right over there.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.950
And this is the
center of curvature.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.450
It's twice the distance from
this point as the focus.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.580
So that is the-- let me make
it as close as possible.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.899
So that is the center of
curvature right over there.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.190
And let me copy and paste this.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.050
So we can reuse this
later on in the video.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.760
I don't have to keep drawing it.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.739
So copy it.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.017
So I've copied that.

00:01:06.017 --> 00:01:07.600
Now, let's put an
object-- and I think

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.920
we did this in the last video.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.660
Let's put an object beyond
the center of curvature.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.950
So let's put an object here.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.510
And the convention is to use
an upward pointing arrow.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.560
This isn't a light ray.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.910
It's used to show an object.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.290
And we use the tip of
the arrow to really show

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.450
the top of the object.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.737
And that's usually where we
trace our light rays from.

00:01:26.737 --> 00:01:28.070
But it doesn't have to be there.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.710
We could do the middle.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.740
You could do the bottom.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.760
And you could figure out what
the image of the object's

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.390
going to be.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.630
So let's do that.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.040
And when you're dealing
with parabolic mirrors,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.490
it's easiest to have to
show just two light rays.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.851
One that goes parallel
to the principal axis.

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.350
And one that goes
through the focus.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.850
Because you know what's going
to happen to each of those

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.600
when they reflect.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.550
And you don't have
to do any math there.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.960
So let's have the parallel ray.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.970
That's the parallel ray.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.280
When it reflects-- the parallel
incident ray, when it reflects,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.180
it will go through the focus.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.840
And then, let's
have an incident ray

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.200
that goes through the focus.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.805
And when it reflects,
it will be parallel.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.060
And this is the example we
actually saw in the last video.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.670
And so whatever light
is being emitted

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.020
from this point over
here in that direction,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.830
it will come back and
converge again at this point.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.720
And we could actually do it
at every point along the--

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.019
we could do it halfway.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.310
This halfway point of the
arrow, just to make it clear.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.640
This halfway point of
the arrow, same thing.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.700
You have a parallel.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.280
Something parallel will go,
will reflect a parallel incident

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.319
ray will reflect
through the focus.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.360
And I'll just do it for
this one right over here.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.191
It will reflect
through the focus.

00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:41.690
And then, if you
have something that

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.360
goes through the focus,
an incident ray that

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.840
goes through a focus, it
will reflect parallel.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.760
So this point will correspond
to this point over here.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.480
I think that makes it clearer,
that this image, the image

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.000
of this object
when it's reflected

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.660
by this parabolic mirror
will look just like that.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.830
So it will actually
form a real image.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.109
It'll form a real
image that is smaller

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.150
than this original image.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.260
It's not so clear, the
way I did it over here.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.949
But you could push this
even further back out.

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.490
And it'll be clear
that this is going

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.580
to be a smaller real image
than that right over there.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.560
Now, let's do a
couple more examples.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.860
So let me just paste my drawing.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.170
So I don't have to redraw it.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.194
Let's see what happens.

00:03:26.194 --> 00:03:26.860
Let me write it.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.070
So here the image, just so
we can keep track of things.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:39.580
Here, the image is real and
smaller than the actual object

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.110
when the actual object is
beyond the center of curvature.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.547
And actually, let me make it a
little bit clearer by drawing.

00:03:47.547 --> 00:03:49.880
Let me do another example
like that where I do something

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.900
big way out here just
to make it clear.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:00.420
So once again, we go parallel,
reflect through the focus.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.090
And then, we can go
through the focus.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.882
We go through the focus and
then reflect out like that.

00:04:06.882 --> 00:04:08.590
And there you see,
now, it's much clearer

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.010
that the image is going
to be much smaller.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.190
And, of course, inverted
relative to the actual object.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.490
Now, let's do this again.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.470
But this time, let's
place the object

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.890
at the center of curvature.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:29.090
So let's place the
object right over here.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.010
So right at that distance
that twice the distance

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.820
from the vertex of the
parabola to the focus.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.150
So we do a parallel line.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.990
These lines are the
hardest thing to do.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.957
So parallel incident ray,
parallel to the principal axis.

00:04:43.957 --> 00:04:45.540
This is the principal
axis right here.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.820
Principal axis-- that's what
this line is right over here.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.900
It's kind of the line of
symmetry of the parabola.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.300
When it reflects, it will
reflect through the focus.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.330
And then, let's take
another ray that goes,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.847
the incident ray goes
through the focus.

00:05:02.847 --> 00:05:04.805
And when it reflects, it
will reflect parallel.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.140
And my drawing isn't the
neatest drawing on the planet.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.540
And actually, let me draw it
a little bit better than that.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.850
Well, that's pretty good.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:16.800
Let me just.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.620
So that's the incident
ray that was parallel.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.860
And then, an incident
ray that goes through--

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.375
let me-- I'm having
trouble drawing these.

00:05:26.375 --> 00:05:28.570
An incident ray that
goes through the focus

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.120
will then come out and
reflect right over there.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.340
And they'll converge.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.200
And the way I've drawn it,
my drawing isn't ideal.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.219
But the way, but
the reality is, is

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:41.260
that they'll converge so
that the image will just

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.420
be in an inverted same size
version as this thing up here.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.700
Because it's symmetric.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.900
Let me see if I can
redraw this whole thing,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.020
so it comes out neater.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.770
So far, that looks good.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.450
So then, you want to
reflect like that.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.360
You got-- you're coming
through the focus.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.910
And then, you have another ray
that goes through the focus.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.451
This whole thing
should be symmetric.

00:06:03.451 --> 00:06:06.190
And then, when it reflects,
it comes back out like that.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.800
So that makes a
little bit clearer.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.270
So this is the object.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.690
And now, its image is
just an inverted version

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.430
of this object.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.370
The image comes into
focus, or the rays

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.670
converge at the same distance
from the actual mirror

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.470
as the actual object.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.110
And it's going to be the
same size, just inverted.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:35.800
So that's-- so here the image
is real and the same size

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.010
as the object.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.300
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.000
I think you get the hang of it.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And you might want
to try them out.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.374
You might want to
pause the video

00:06:43.374 --> 00:06:46.380
and try it on paper because
really nothing beats practice.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.720
So let's stick our object
between the center of curvature

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.966
and the focus and
the focal point.

00:06:53.966 --> 00:06:55.340
So if we put our
object there, we

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.000
could have a light ray that goes
parallel to the principal axis.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.020
And then, it will reflect
out through the focus.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.810
And then, you could
have another point.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.675
It goes through another ray.

00:07:06.675 --> 00:07:08.010
It goes through the focus.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.540
And then, it reflects.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.140
And then, it will reflect out.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.980
And let me draw it
better than that.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.580
Actually, this is--
I should probably

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.470
have used a more precise
tool when I did all of this.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.060
So let me draw it
right over here.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.070
So I have the parallel one.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.360
And then, it goes
through the focus

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.936
just like that when
it gets reflected.

00:07:34.936 --> 00:07:36.810
I really should have
had a line tool for this

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.690
to have neater drawings.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.840
And then, a ray that
goes through the focus

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.300
will be reflected out parallel.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.150
It would be reflected
out parallel.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.820
And at least for the light
that comes from that tip,

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.120
they will re-converge
at that tip.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.070
And if you did it for
every point on this arrow,

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.720
the image would be
an inverted arrow

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.510
that is bigger
than the original.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.620
And it is beyond.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.530
It's almost the opposite of the
first example that we showed.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.560
And so now the image is
bigger than the original.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.140
So the image is real.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.820
And it is bigger.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:17.260
And the image will,
where it converges

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.494
is going to be beyond
the center of curvature.

00:08:20.494 --> 00:08:21.410
And you could imagine.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.126
If this was the
object right here,

00:08:23.126 --> 00:08:24.750
then this would be
the image over here.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.500
If you just trace
the lines backwards.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.470
So there's a symmetry
here between this example

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.600
and the first one
we did up here.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.070
Now, let's just
do a couple more.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.580
Let's imagine if the object is
actually at the focal point.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.679
It's actually at the focus.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.190
So let's draw an object there.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.049
Let's think about
what would happen.

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:47.640
So if we're at the focus, a
ray that comes out parallel

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:53.370
will go through the focal point
and come out just like that.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.940
And then, here we're going to--
you can't-- we can't have a ray

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.820
that just goes.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.760
Well, actually we could have
a ray that goes through.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.141
Well, that-- you can't
go into the object.

00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:05.890
So here, I'll do a
slightly different ray.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:10.100
I'll do a ray that intersects
the parabolic mirror

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:10.859
right over there.

00:09:10.859 --> 00:09:12.400
And the reason why
I want to do there

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.290
is because there
the parabolic mirror

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.070
is essentially flat and
essentially vertical.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.770
So you can imagine
that the incident

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.411
ray is going to be the same
thing as the reflected ray.

00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:23.410
So you could draw a ray
that comes in like that.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.520
So this is a departure
from what we did before.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.120
And then the reflected ray
will come out like that.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.930
So what happens
when an object is

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:35.200
at the focal point is that all
of the light that's coming off

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:41.120
of this object in any
direction will all be made,

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.330
it will all be made parallel.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:44.990
And so it won't converge.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.070
So it won't converge.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.920
So it won't be able
to form a real image.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.790
And it's not, it
doesn't look like it's

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.300
diverging from some
point in the mirror.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.600
So it won't even
form a virtual image.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.060
So here, there will
actually be no image

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.780
when the object is actually
at the focal point.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.510
And then, the last case,
as you can imagine,

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.410
is if an object is closer
than the focal point.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:09.980
So let's draw that.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.770
So let's put an object
at the focal point.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.840
So right over here.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.060
And here, just for the sake
of argument, one I can draw.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.040
I can always draw a parallel.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.200
And anything that, any
light that goes parallel

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.930
will then look to come
out in a direction that

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.750
would go through
the focal point.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.470
So it would go through
the focal point.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.320
It would come out
in that direction.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.070
Although the object
itself is blocking.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.100
But it would look to
go in that direction.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.130
It would be reflected
in that direction.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.120
And then, you could
imagine a ray of light

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.240
that would have been coming
from the focal point,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.890
or would have been coming
from the same direction.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:47.510
So you could imagine coming
from the same direction

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.000
as the focal point
would be reflected

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.730
parallel, in a
parallel direction

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:52.815
to the principal axis.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.710
Now, these two light
rays are not converging.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.400
But they look like
they're diverging

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.932
from some point
behind the mirror.

00:11:03.932 --> 00:11:05.390
They'll look like
they're diverging

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.070
from some point
behind the mirror.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.930
So in this case, we are
forming a virtual image.

00:11:15.352 --> 00:11:16.810
And the virtual
image will actually

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.510
look something like this.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:24.162
And so it'll be larger than
the original virtual image.

00:11:24.162 --> 00:11:25.370
So it's kind of a magnifying.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.995
If you were to go
to-- what are called?

00:11:26.995 --> 00:11:30.717
--a fun house at the circus or
the amusement park, whatever.

00:11:30.717 --> 00:11:33.050
And if you were to get close
enough to parabolas mirror,

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:37.960
it would show a
magnified version of you.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.067
A virtual version of you.

00:11:39.067 --> 00:11:41.150
And actually, let me draw
that a little bit bigger

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.750
just because it
might not be clear.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.120
So let me draw.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.570
So if this is the mirror,
that is the focal point.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.450
This right here is
the principal axis.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.670
This is maybe you,
maybe whatever object.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.600
You could draw a ray
that goes parallel.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.130
It will reflect in the
direction of the focal point.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.180
So it'll reflect out like that.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.397
It'll be blocked by
the object, though.

00:12:04.397 --> 00:12:05.980
And then, something
that looks like it

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.521
would have come from
the focal point,

00:12:07.521 --> 00:12:09.450
from the same direction
as the focal point

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.920
would then be reflected
parallel to the principal axis.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.080
So these two rays, once
again, there are diverging.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.390
But they look like, to the
human brain, to the human eye,

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.380
they look like they came
from that point over there.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.690
And so this would
correspond to that point

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.070
on the virtual image.

00:12:28.499 --> 00:12:30.290
So hopefully, that
gives you some practice.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.040
But the most important
thing, it gives you

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.220
some practice dealing
with these arbitrary rays

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.986
that we're showing emanating
from the tip of this arrow.

00:12:36.986 --> 00:12:38.610
And we could do it
for the whole arrow.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.235
But the reason why we're picking
these rays in these directions

00:12:41.235 --> 00:12:42.760
is that they're
easy to work with.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.027
They go through the focus,
they'll come out parallel.

00:12:45.027 --> 00:12:46.610
If the incident ray
is parallel, it'll

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.860
come out through the focus.
