00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.710
Here's an example of a lookup for an A

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.990
record for gottech.edu. You can try this at your own

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.360
command line by typing, for example, dig www.gottech.edu. Now

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.990
there are some interesting things to note in this trace.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.690
Here is our query and you can see that

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.720
this is an A record query. Here's our answer. You

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.290
can see that the answer actually has a C name

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.770
in it, which basically says, well you asked for gottech.edu

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.560
but in fact what you really want to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.758
ask for is tlweb.gtm.gottech.edu. So then we issue an

00:00:31.758 --> 00:00:35.460
A record query for that name, and we ultimately

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.790
get the IP address. These numbers here indicate the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.150
time to live or the amount of time in

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.040
seconds that the entry can be stored in the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.365
cache. Here's another example of a DNS lookup from

00:00:47.365 --> 00:00:51.070
nytimes.com. The interesting thing to note here is that

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.860
in response to the A record query, we see two

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.030
IP addresses. This is typically performed when a service wants

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.870
to perform load balancing So, the client could use either

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.800
one of these. It might prefer the first one, but if

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.010
we issued the same query again, we might actually get

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.030
these IP addresses in a different order. Now, again, here you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.620
can see the TTL value which indicates how long these

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.430
A records can be scored in cache. In a subsequent example,

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.710
we'll look at other query types that have

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.420
much longer TTL values. Here's an example of a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.000
query for the NS record for gatech.edu. You

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.710
can see this output by typing dignsgatech.edu. You can

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.450
see here in the question section, now instead of an A record query we have an NS

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.840
record query. And our answer is a bunch

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.220
of NS records that are dns1, 2, and 3.gatech.edu,

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.990
any of which could answer authoritatively for sub-domains

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.680
of gatech.edu. You can see that in addition

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.990
to the answer, which return the name servers,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.510
we also need the IP addresses of those name

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.560
servers, which is returned in the additional section

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.400
of the answer. You can see here that we

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.280
received not only A records for each domain

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.880
name but also quad A or IPv6 addresses corresponding

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.970
to each authoritative name server. Here's an example

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.020
of a query for an MX record or the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.530
mail server corresponding to gatech.edu. Now here again, you

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.190
can the question is the MX record and you

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.280
can see the answer which returns two mail servers.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.820
As well as the additional section, which returns an

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.280
A record, indicating the IP address corresponding to the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.460
mail server that was returned in the MX record.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.680
In addition to the TTL, we also have some metrics

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.100
that indicate priorities, that it would allow a system administrator to

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.420
configure a primary and a backup mail server. In this case,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.700
the mail servers, just happen to have the same priority level.
