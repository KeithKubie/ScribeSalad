00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's see. This one seems to be clearly not equal to α.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is a huge angle--greater than 90 degrees.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But I do know that this angle is identical to α.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The reason I know that--well, they're opposite each other,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so that's always going to be the case that opposite angles are identical.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But let's talk about why.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If I examine this entire arc here,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I know a straight line--well, I've made half of a circle here,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
so this is 180 degrees.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This angle here is some α degrees--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I don't know what that is--which means that this angle marked in red

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
must be 180 - α.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now, since this line here is also equal to 180 degrees,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
this segment of it is 180 - α.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This segment must also be equal to α.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But that's not so interesting.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What I care more about is this angle here,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
which also happen to be equal to α.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Again, we can talk about why.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Let's extend this line and this line a little bit.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now we have these two parallel lines.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The black line here is parallel with this purple line up here.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We can go through this same sort of thinking to prove that this angle is α,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
this one here is 180 - α,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
this one has to be α, and then this one over here would be 180 - α.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But this is what we care about.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This angle here is identical to this angle here.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Now we're making some real progress.

00:01:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let me clean this up a bit so we can see what's going on.
