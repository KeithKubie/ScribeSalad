00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.682
Congratulations, you just engaged in mental rotation. This is the process of

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:10.376
imagining an object rotating in three-dimensional space. As it turns out,

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:14.660
there's actually some gender differences in performing mental rotation tasks.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.000
It appears that boys and man, perform better in these tasks. This appears to be

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.662
universal, because they found similar findings in China, Japan, Ecuador,

00:00:25.662 --> 00:00:31.240
Ireland and in the US. So how do we organize information in our environment?

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.539
Well we do so by labeling and naming things. We first do this in the most basic

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:41.330
unit of knowledge, which is called a concept. The concept is a mental group of

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.291
events, objects, or people. So, for example, the concept of an animal can

00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:51.272
include mental groups for birds and fish. And these can be broken down even

00:00:51.272 --> 00:00:56.080
further into different types of birds. For example, an eagle or sparrow. In

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.080
different types of fish for example a catfish or a koi fish. These concepts

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.402
help us in our attempt to organize and perceive the world. To that end we often

00:01:05.402 --> 00:01:09.355
engage in what's called a concept hierarchy, as you see here which is an

00:01:09.355 --> 00:01:15.442
arrangement of concepts in a particular way. Some being really general, and

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:19.207
some being more specific. And there's two last definitions we need to address

00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:25.045
here. The first is category. A category is when multiple concepts are organized

00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:30.567
around one concept that they all have in common. For example, vehicles or

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:34.464
trees. We can have all the different types of vehicles or all the different

00:01:34.464 --> 00:01:39.216
types of trees organized around this category. And these are well defined, but

00:01:39.216 --> 00:01:44.949
other categories can be kind of fuzzy. Such as good or consciousness. It can be

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:50.760
difficult to order other concepts around one of these 2 concepts. And finally

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.830
we have a prototype, which is the best fitting example of a category.
