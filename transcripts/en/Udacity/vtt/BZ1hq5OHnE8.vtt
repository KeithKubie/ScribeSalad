00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.830
We will now look at three App Engine success

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.210
stories that are representative, because they use the strengths

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.250
of App Engine. The first one is a real-time

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.310
earthquake monitoring system in japan. So in this picture, lots

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.680
of data is collected by NIED, which is an

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.810
institute in Japan. They look at the data and then

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.040
send image files to App Engine, every second. Clients

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.320
can then view these images files to see the activity.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.830
Well, as you can imagine, when there is no earthquake

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.030
activity, there are not many clients that are interested in

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.210
watching this system. But on the other hand, when there

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.610
is earthquake activity, the system needs to serve a lot of

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.690
data to many clients. And this is, of course, a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.440
great application for App Engine. Which can scale the number

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.820
of instances up and down, depending on the activity and

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.530
the number of clients accessing the system. Another great success story

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.140
of App Engine is Song Pop, an app you

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.330
may have used, which is a game where you guess

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.300
the song or an artist. Well, Song Pop grew

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.690
from zero to 10,000 queries per second in six months.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.040
And as of early 2013, it had more than

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.970
60 million users. Song Pop uses app engine, again, because

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.930
of its ability to rapidly scale up and down based

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.880
on the user load. And one that you've certainly heard

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.910
about is Rovio, the creator of Angry Birds. When Rovio developed a web

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.800
based version of Angry Birds, they used

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.460
App Engine because of its automatic scaling.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.470
But also for many of the other functions it provides. And these things

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.270
are exactly what you will learn when you take this course. So stay tuned.
