00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:02.910
- [Voiceover] In the last
video we introduced you to

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.813
the derivative property right over here

00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:06.797
that if my function is
equal to some constant

00:00:06.797 --> 00:00:09.397
that the derivative is going to be zero

00:00:09.397 --> 00:00:11.963
at any X, and we made a graphical argument

00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:14.056
and we also used the
definition of the limits

00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:15.742
to feel good about that.

00:00:15.742 --> 00:00:18.173
Now let's give a few
more of these properties

00:00:18.173 --> 00:00:19.765
and these are core properties as you

00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:22.025
throughout the rest of your calculus life

00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:24.449
your career, you will be
using some combination

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.699
of these properties to find derivatives.

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.356
So it's good to, one, know about them,

00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:30.710
and to feel good that
they're actually true.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.293
The second one is if my function F of X

00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:35.327
is equal to some constant

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:37.710
times another function G of X

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.331
well, then the derivative

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.746
of F of X is going to be equal

00:00:42.746 --> 00:00:44.510
to that same constant.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.245
Let me do it, that same constant

00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:50.029
times the derivative of the G of X.

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:52.385
And once again, maybe
we can make a actually

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.473
we could make a graphical
argument for why that is true.

00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:58.390
This is going to multiply the slope

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.206
is one way to think about it.

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:02.809
But it's easier to make
an algebraic argument

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.210
just using, frankly we can
use either one of these

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.150
definitions of the derivative.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.456
I'll use the one on the right

00:01:08.456 --> 00:01:10.049
because it feels more general

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.036
although you can say,
well this is true for A,

00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:13.460
but X could be any A.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.200
But I'll just use the one on the right.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.327
So, if we want to find F prime of X,

00:01:18.327 --> 00:01:21.440
F prime of X using this definition,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.857
we know, we know.

00:01:26.437 --> 00:01:29.069
F prime of X is going
to be equal to the limit

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.393
as X, I'm sorry, as H approaches zero.

00:01:32.393 --> 00:01:34.178
I'm using that definition.

00:01:34.178 --> 00:01:35.511
Of F of X plus H

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.313
minus F of X

00:01:38.313 --> 00:01:39.896
all of that over H.

00:01:41.615 --> 00:01:43.948
Well, what is F of X plus H?

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:46.279
This is the limit

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:47.977
as H approaches zero.

00:01:47.977 --> 00:01:49.927
F of X plus H is

00:01:49.927 --> 00:01:51.760
K times G of X plus H.

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:55.324
Minus F of X,

00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:57.415
well that's just KG of X.

00:01:57.415 --> 00:01:58.248
KG of X.

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.661
All of that over

00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:02.538
H.

00:02:02.538 --> 00:02:04.824
And then you can factor the K out.

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:07.315
This is going to be equal to the limit

00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:09.398
as H approaches zero of K

00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:12.308
times G of X plus H

00:02:15.073 --> 00:02:16.073
minus G of X

00:02:17.342 --> 00:02:19.410
all of that over H.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.310
All I did was factor that K out.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.789
And we know from our limit properties

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:24.668
that this is the same thing as K

00:02:24.668 --> 00:02:27.939
times the limit as H approaches zero

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.772
of G of X plus H minus

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:33.679
G of X, all of that over H.

00:02:34.735 --> 00:02:37.619
And of course, all of this
business right over there.

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.188
That is just G prime of X.

00:02:40.188 --> 00:02:42.409
So, this is equal to K

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.560
times G prime of X.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.672
And I know what you might be thinking.

00:02:46.672 --> 00:02:48.736
Whoa, hey this feels like it was probably

00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:51.921
going to be true, so I
just assumed it was true.

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:53.624
But you can't just assume that.

00:02:53.624 --> 00:02:54.986
I don't know, sometimes you can

00:02:54.986 --> 00:02:56.651
when you're first trying
to get your head around it

00:02:56.651 --> 00:02:58.695
you can say, oh, this seems
like a reasonable thing.

00:02:58.695 --> 00:03:01.272
But in math, we like to
really know that it is true

00:03:01.272 --> 00:03:03.757
otherwise we will build all sorts of

00:03:03.757 --> 00:03:06.349
conclusions based on unsound foundations.

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.248
This allows us to ensure
that this is something

00:03:08.248 --> 00:03:09.861
that we can do.

00:03:09.861 --> 00:03:11.952
So, this is, it's good

00:03:11.952 --> 00:03:13.735
to go through what might feel like

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:17.097
a little bit of work to
get to this conclusion.

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:19.953
Now let's do the third property.

00:03:19.953 --> 00:03:21.336
The third property

00:03:21.336 --> 00:03:22.253
is the idea

00:03:23.344 --> 00:03:25.298
that if I have some function

00:03:25.298 --> 00:03:26.751
that's the sum or the difference of

00:03:26.751 --> 00:03:27.996
two other functions,

00:03:27.996 --> 00:03:30.120
so G of X, and let's see,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.793
I'm using H a lot so,

00:03:31.793 --> 00:03:33.497
H, let's say,

00:03:33.497 --> 00:03:35.951
I don't know, J of X.

00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:39.215
J, yeah sure, why not, J of X.

00:03:39.215 --> 00:03:41.368
You don't see a lot of J of X's out there.

00:03:41.368 --> 00:03:43.118
Well then, well then,

00:03:44.214 --> 00:03:45.760
F prime of X

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.179
is going to be equal to

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:48.676
G prime of X

00:03:48.676 --> 00:03:50.176
plus J prime of X.

00:03:51.825 --> 00:03:53.094
And this would also have been true

00:03:53.094 --> 00:03:54.996
if this is, instead of
it being a positive here,

00:03:54.996 --> 00:03:57.130
if this was a negative.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.582
Instead of addition, if
this was subtraction.

00:03:59.582 --> 00:04:01.815
If the sum were a
difference of two functions

00:04:01.815 --> 00:04:03.248
then your derivative is gonna be the sum

00:04:03.248 --> 00:04:05.419
or the difference of their derivatives.

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.197
And once again, we can
just go to the definition

00:04:08.197 --> 00:04:09.530
of F prime of X.

00:04:10.534 --> 00:04:11.867
So, F prime of X

00:04:13.222 --> 00:04:15.385
is going to be equal to the limit

00:04:15.385 --> 00:04:17.440
as H approaches zero

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.498
of F of X plus H.

00:04:19.498 --> 00:04:21.366
But what is F of X plus H?

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:23.533
Well, that's G of X plus H

00:04:26.264 --> 00:04:27.847
plus J of X plus H.

00:04:29.558 --> 00:04:31.359
So that's F of X plus H

00:04:31.359 --> 00:04:33.198
minus F of X.

00:04:33.198 --> 00:04:34.865
So F of X is G of X.

00:04:36.685 --> 00:04:38.185
G of X plus J of X

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:41.008
plus J of X.

00:04:41.008 --> 00:04:43.158
Notice, this is F of X plus H

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.176
minus F of X

00:04:44.176 --> 00:04:46.893
and we're gonna put all of that over H.

00:04:46.893 --> 00:04:49.031
So we can put all of that

00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:51.393
all of that over H.

00:04:51.393 --> 00:04:52.847
Well, what is that equal to?

00:04:52.847 --> 00:04:54.776
Well, we could just rearrange what we see

00:04:54.776 --> 00:04:56.194
on top here.

00:04:56.194 --> 00:04:57.527
This is equal to

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:59.696
the limit

00:04:59.696 --> 00:05:01.924
as H approaches zero.

00:05:01.924 --> 00:05:04.484
Well let's see, all the mentions of G of X

00:05:04.484 --> 00:05:05.432
I'm gonna put up front.

00:05:05.432 --> 00:05:06.765
So G of X plus H

00:05:07.826 --> 00:05:08.909
minus G of X.

00:05:10.896 --> 00:05:12.396
Plus J of X plus H

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:16.172
minus J of X.

00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:20.200
And then all of that, I could write it

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.345
as this, all of that over H.

00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:26.198
Or, I could, that's the same thing as

00:05:26.198 --> 00:05:27.742
this over H

00:05:27.742 --> 00:05:29.758
plus that over H.

00:05:29.758 --> 00:05:31.014
And once again,

00:05:31.014 --> 00:05:33.691
we know from our limit properties

00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:36.292
that that is the exact same thing as

00:05:36.292 --> 00:05:38.875
the limit as H approaches zero,

00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:41.750
of G of X plus H

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.620
minus G of X

00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:46.452
all of that over H

00:05:46.452 --> 00:05:49.369
plus the limit as H approaches zero

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.434
of J of X plus H

00:05:54.096 --> 00:05:55.096
minus J of X

00:05:56.386 --> 00:05:57.755
all of that over H.

00:05:57.755 --> 00:05:59.085
And this, right over here,

00:05:59.085 --> 00:06:01.004
that is the definition of

00:06:01.004 --> 00:06:02.087
G prime of X.

00:06:02.997 --> 00:06:04.833
And this right over here is

00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:07.294
J prime, J prime of X

00:06:07.294 --> 00:06:08.197
and we're done.

00:06:08.197 --> 00:06:09.604
And this, instead of a positive,

00:06:09.604 --> 00:06:11.031
this was instead of addition

00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:12.599
this was subtraction.

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.572
Well then that subtraction
would carry through

00:06:14.572 --> 00:06:15.972
and then instead of addition here

00:06:15.972 --> 00:06:17.541
we would have subtraction.

00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:19.025
So hopefully this makes you feel good

00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:20.469
about these properties.

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:22.639
The properties themselves
are somewhat straightforward.

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.653
You could probably guess at them.

00:06:25.653 --> 00:06:27.747
But it's nice to use the definition

00:06:27.747 --> 00:06:30.764
of our derivatives to actually

00:06:30.764 --> 00:06:34.847
feel that they are very
good conclusions to make.
