JORDAN THOMAS: If I can
make one person's day better,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.672
then my day's infinitely better.

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:07.380
And I think that it's
part of the culture

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.260
here is, you always hear in
the service of humanity.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.860
That motto's really started to
strike home a lot more for me

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.690
and really thinking
critically about well,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.790
how can I be in the
service of humanity?

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.880
That's something I really
do take seriously now.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.750
I'm Jordan Thomas.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.280
I'm in the Class of 2018.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.690
I'm a Woodrow
Wilson School major

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.540
pursuing dual certificates in
Portuguese language and culture

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.210
and African American studies.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.250
My mother's side of
the family are actually

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.510
immigrants from Portugal.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.420
I grew up learning English and
Portuguese at the same time.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.330
So I really could just speak a
sort of household Portuguese.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.210
And so I decided that I wanted
to reach the next level.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.570
Portuguese has really come to
define my Princeton experience

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.460
in certain ways.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.340
And so I've loved it.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.140
Now, I can write essays.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.810
I spent a whole summer, part
of it in Portugal part of it

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.420
in Brazil, and it really
has been one of the better

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.445
decisions I've made.

00:00:56.445 --> 00:00:59.070
ELIZABETH ARMSTRONG: I first met
Jordan when he was a freshman.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.320
I was his freshman adviser.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.810
And from the start,
Jordan really

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.450
stood out as a special
kind of student.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.030
One of the things that I
really like about Jordan

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.920
is his humility.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.900
Jordan, in fact, is
always looking for a way

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.710
to give back rather than taking
for granted what he has here.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.610
He's engaged.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.610
He's a scholar.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.355
He's a citizen.

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:20.730
JORDAN THOMAS:
For my thesis,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.920
I'll be looking at
support services

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.840
for pregnant and
parenting teens,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.600
specifically, in the Newark
Public School District.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.010
We know now the correlation
between education and health,

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.970
education and income--

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.000
all of these other really
important later life outcomes.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.650
I feel like it's
very valuable that we

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.360
make sure that if
these girls are dealing

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.860
with unplanned
pregnancies, we still

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.776
make sure that they have
the support they need

00:01:42.776 --> 00:01:45.604
to complete their education and
get their high school diploma.

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:47.520
In the end, hopefully,
we'll have a good sense

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.190
of what support services
and programs are

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.989
in place for pregnant
and parenting teens

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:53.030
in high school in Newark.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.189
And if there's anything
that can ultimately

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.230
be done to improve the
services, hopefully, we'll

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.370
have a good sense
of that as well.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.540
So after Princeton, I would say
that my most immediate plans

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.150
are to travel to Oxford
as a Rhodes Scholar

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.130
and integrate into their
master's program for two years

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.810
there.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.450
After completing the
master's program,

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.320
I then plan to return to
the U.S. and go to law school

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.780
because my longer-term
plans down the road

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.090
are to ultimately enter
into the policy sphere

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.550
and run for public
office, whether that be

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.252
at the state or federal level.

00:02:26.252 --> 00:02:27.960
One thing that I've
really taken to heart

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.880
is never forget
where I came from

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.370
and that really Newark shaped
me in a number of ways.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.920
And I couldn't have
come here, and I

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.850
couldn't have done
the things that I've

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.770
done here without the special
impact that Newark had on me.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.620
I feel like one of
the most concerning

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.230
things about lower-income 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.600
minority-based districts and
schools is that you

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.480
see students that are really
talented and really gifted.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.190
Despite having
the qualifications

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.710
and being just as
prepared as some

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.230
of the other students in
suburban districts to apply,

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.380
they decide not to apply.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.796
And so I always go to these
students, and I let them know,

00:02:58.796 --> 00:03:00.360
no if you have the
qualifications,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.920
go ahead and submit
that application.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.420
You are qualified.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.450
You can do the work, and I
try to really lead by example

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.980
and showing them
look, I did this.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.570
Hopefully, through
the work that I've

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.250
done here and through
the work that I'll

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.490
continue doing in the future,
I'm impacting people in ways

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.610
that I've never known and
extending my reach to people

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.960
that I'll never know.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.420
And there's just something
so beautiful about that.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.170
