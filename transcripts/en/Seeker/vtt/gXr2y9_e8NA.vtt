00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.689
Salt is everywhere on our planet, but some
animals evolved to live in it while, others

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:05.870
didn't; what happened there?

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.000
What caused this split?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.360
Sup salty dogs, thanks for watching DNews,
I'm Trace.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.560
Water is everywhere and is one of the main
reasons life was able to evolve on Earth.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.770
It's pretty great.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.200
Salt is also everywhere.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.320
Salt and water together, make up most of the
water on our planet and it's a major component

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.600
of the beginning of life as we know it!

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.680
Organisms need salt to survive.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.899
Salt draws water out of cells in process called
osmosis.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.600
Osmosis is the tendency of water to flow across
a membrane to balance salinity.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.780
Essentially, nature wants to make sure there's
a balanced level of salt everywhere.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.530
This is why if you drink saltwater you can
die of dehydration -- the water-salt balance

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.800
gets out of whack and water gets pulled out
of your cells.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.069
It's pretty serious.

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:57.441
And yet, as boney fish moved from a salty
sea into freshwater (or sweetwater), they

00:00:57.441 --> 00:01:00.999
had to eat salts to maintain that salt-water
balance.

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.161
They still do this today, urinating any excess
salt -- sometimes up to a third of their body

00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:06.161
weight a day.

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:09.580
We do this too, which is why we crave (and
love) SALT.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.860
But this brings us to the big question -- if
saltwater fish are drinking saltwater constantly,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.350
how do they avoid dehydration due to osmosis?!

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.350
Well, there are two answers.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.900
One comes built in.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.810
The gills of some saltwater species, like
the flatfish: turbot, have adapted to carry

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.410
more of a special enzyme called "gill Na+/K+
ATPase."

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.000
This allows their gills to leach salt from
their bodies back into the ocean.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.270
Without this adaptation they'd die because
of that high salinity.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.710
But, some species of eel, salmon, bass, and
flounder have adaptations that let them move

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.460
between fresh and saltwater!

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.600
Species which can survive in a variety of
salinities are referred to as euryhaline;

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.910
some even actively adapt their gills or their
kidneysâ€¦

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.400
There are a lot of species osmoregulating
in a lot of different ways.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.790
This is a great example of how evolution solves
a problem along many different paths, something

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.760
scientists call convergent evolution!

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.760
SO AWESOME.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.510
So, lemme give you a couple examples: anadromous
fish, are born in freshwater and live there

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.329
for months before they make for saltwater.

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.930
In Atlantic Salmon, an enzyme called type
2 deiodinase is produced in response to the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.769
longer daylight hours in spring.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.920
Puberty ain't just weird for humans.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.549
This enzyme alters the salmon's gills, initiating
osmoregulation so they can safely swim into

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:25.769
salty water!

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.569
This is reversed when they return to rivers
and streams to breed and start the process

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.030
with thier own lil' salmons.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.069
And a 2013 study in Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics,
detailed how a DIFFERENT adaptation evolved

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.150
in tilapia.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.129
When placed into salted water gradually, the
researchers found tilapia gills adapted, producing

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.639
a specialized protein called NDRG1.

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:51.319
This let the tilapia survive in a saline environment
-- as long as they had time to slowly adapt.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.599
A lot fish evolution has happened in the last
400 million years.

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.489
Fish have spread into pretty much every water-based
environment on the planet.

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.049
After the Great Dying 250 million years ago
which wiped out 95 percent of all marine species,

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.650
evolution had to figure out how to osmoregulate
again.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.499
Through an assortment of convergent evolutionary
adaptations FRESHWATER fish repopulated the

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:16.700
oceans -- learning to deal with the super-salty
water.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.720
Eventually, they made it to land as well,
when a fish named eusthenopteron evolved into

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.400
amphibians -- and tetrapods -- like you and
me!

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:32.060
Without salt, and being able to regulate it,
life as we know it wouldn't exist.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:58.340
Evolution is 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.579
the best.
