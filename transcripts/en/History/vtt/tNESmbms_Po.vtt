00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.836
[music playing]

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:08.216
NARRATOR: Fuxian Lake,
Yunnan province, China, 1992.

00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:13.221
Expert diver Geng Wei
descends into this remote lake

00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:17.600
and discovers a
surprising phenomenon--

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.812
the bottom is littered
with hand-carved flagstones

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:21.980
and other stone relics.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:28.153
The mysterious stones lie
scattered on the bottom

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:30.530
of China's
second-deepest freshwater

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.368
lake, which covers an
area of 100 square miles

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.079
with a depth of 509 feet.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:43.793
What he saw was
quite extraordinary--

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:50.884
hand-dressed flagstones, roads,
buildings, and it's as if he

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:55.221
discovered an underwater city.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.640
The clearest evidence of
dwellings at the bottom

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.933
of a lake.

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.269
It was built when
there wasn't a lake.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.647
And that would mean that
we're talking about a time

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:08.943
before the last ice age, which
would bring the story of Fuxian

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:11.905
Lake way more into
the remote past

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:15.241
than what we're being told.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:21.080
DAVID CHILDRESS: Geng Wei made
over 35 days in Fuxian Lake,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.252
and they even took a
submarine down into this lake

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:31.090
to find stairs, and more
of these flagstones,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.302
and walls beneath this lake.

00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:35.970
So you have to wonder--

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.517
did some kind of advanced
civilization exist at one time

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:41.851
beneath Fuxian Lake?

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:49.275
NARRATOR: In 2001,
archaeologists from the Yunnan

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:52.821
Provincial Museum used
advanced sonar scanners

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:56.241
and cameras to conduct
the monumental task

00:01:56.241 --> 00:02:00.537
of surveying Fuxian Lake.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:04.332
The evidence collected
convinced Chinese archaeologists

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:08.878
they had discovered structures
of an advanced civilization,

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:14.217
including an arena-type
building and pyramids.

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:16.845
This mysterious
sunken city covers

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:21.224
more than one square mile,
but the questions remain--

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:22.475
who built it?

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.727
And why?

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:28.606
The pyramid itself is
very unusual, and it is

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:33.027
said that the pyramid is as old
as the Egyptian pyramids are,

00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:36.823
and maybe even higher
than some of them.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.449
It's an incredible discovery.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.122
DAVID CHILDRESS:
Ancient Chinese records

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:47.667
speak of a city in the area
of Fuxian Lake called Yuyuan.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:51.337
However, studies of the
underwater structures

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:55.633
at Fuxian Lake show
that it's actually much

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:59.345
older than this Yuyuan city.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:00.847
Could this be the
remains of some

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.850
ancient and advanced
society that was

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.310
destroyed in the Great Flood?

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:11.608
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that an extraterrestrial base

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.818
is located deep underwater?

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:20.116
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:24.203
and suggest USOs, or
unidentified submersible

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:26.539
objects, have been
well-chronicled

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.082
in ancient Chinese texts.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.837
NICK REDFERN: According
to "Cheng Jang Fu "Zhi,

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.048
a book written during
the reign of Emperor

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:40.094
Daoguang in the Qing
dynasty, a horse-like monster

00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:41.804
lived in the lake.

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:44.432
The animal was described as
being white with red spots

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:45.934
on its back.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.852
More intriguingly, it
was a creature that could

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:50.647
actually take to the skies.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:54.776
This suggests it may have
been part-USO, part-UFO.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:58.404
That's to say, an underwater
submersible object and also

00:03:58.404 --> 00:03:59.989
an unidentified flying object.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:08.373
NARRATOR: October 24, 1991.

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:12.460
A local fisherman named Zhang
Yuxiang was fishing on fishing

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.005
on Fuxian Lake during a
clear and tranquil day,

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:20.885
when a dense fog suddenly rolled
across the vast body of water.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:28.059
In 1991, Zhang Yuxiang, a
fisherman, was at Fuxian Lake

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.269
when he encountered a UFO.

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:34.065
Now, this strange
craft actually emerged

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:36.275
from the waters of the lake.

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:39.988
He described it
as a shining disk.

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:43.366
This UFO was so
close and so powerful

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:48.037
that it actually
tossed the boat around.

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:50.123
And then rapidly,
this craft just

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.834
disappeared up into the sky.

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:56.629
Lake Fuxian is
clearly an area where

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.630
there have been many strange
events over the years.
