CHRIS ARVIN: Hi.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.060
I'm Chris Arvin, a designer at
Mobiata, and I work on the

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.340
Expedia app.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.750
The Expedia app lets users book
travel and helps them

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.550
along with their travel.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.930
Since the Android design guide
was published, we've

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.190
completely redesigned the
Expedia app and held great

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.640
Android design as a priority
going forward.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.650
And to do that, we knew we had
to go beyond the design guide

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.370
and do a few things
really well.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.480
These included making delightful
interactions for

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.980
the user, using "Pure Android"
visuals that also fit our apps

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.390
brand, and making sure that
things that are important to

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.110
the user are available
quickly.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.840
So when a user opens our app,
they're presented with a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.170
scrolling list of hotels and
flight destinations.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.960
We use full bleed imagery and
magazine-style layout that you

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.790
see in apps like the People
app, for example.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.180
And a lot of our users come to
our app to book hotels on the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.850
same night in their current
location, so we make those

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.900
available immediately.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.400
And on that same note, if a user
has booked travel with us

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.970
before, and their travel is in
progress, we automatically

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.210
take them to their trips, where
we show them everything

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.650
upcoming that they've booked in
this card-based Google Now

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.050
style timeline.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.130
Instead of being hidden under
a drawer or a menu, the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.560
details the user will need for
their travel is available

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.890
immediately.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.240
And we love adding little
touches to our app that give

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.170
it personality and emotion.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.620
For example, when a user's
waiting for their flight

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.840
results to load, we give them
this plane window that they

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.370
can play around with by tilting
the phone or moving

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.210
the window shade.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.330
And when the flight results are
ready, we show them on top

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.650
of this large, beautiful photo
of their destination to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.470
lighten up the data-heavy nature
of flight results and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.230
get them excited about
their potential trip.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.550
And when the user's ready to
check out, we give them the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.350
rewarding interaction of sliding
to purchase, and it's

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.670
that simple.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.650
We try to make the entire screen
feel like you're still

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.260
in Android, whether it be
from the fly visuals or

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.850
the icons we use.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.360
And then we like to take it one
more step and give these

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.790
niceties, like how a user can
pull down the photo gallery to

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.530
start seeing the entire photo.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.690
Or how they can scroll and see
the parallax of the map in the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.535
background.

00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:25.030
And I think it's little touches
like that that make

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.330
the user appreciate you
on a deeper level.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.780
And what we've further found
is that our users respond

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.730
positively to the attention we
pay to design in the smallest

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.870
ways and large ways as well.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.580
Over the past year, our app has
grown from 300,000 active

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.900
installs to over two million
active installs.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.560
And we've found that making a
carefully designed Android app

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.810
really matters.
