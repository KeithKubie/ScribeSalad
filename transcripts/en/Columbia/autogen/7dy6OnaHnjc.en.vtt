00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440
think we have a city full of people that
 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.440
think we have a city full of people that
have something to offer i think what was

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.100
so wonderful about eric statements was
it really was this this belief that all

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110
it really was this this belief that all
 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.860
it really was this this belief that all
of us have something to offer all of us

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.240
have this ability in this capacity to
serve and so we think the structure that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250
serve and so we think the structure that
 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.610
serve and so we think the structure that
needs to be in places we live in a time

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620
needs to be in places we live in a time
 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.799
needs to be in places we live in a time
where people are used to being serviced

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809
