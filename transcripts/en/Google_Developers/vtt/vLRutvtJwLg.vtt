00:00:06.244 --> 00:00:07.660
JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.570
How are you all doing today?

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.100
I see some smiles, nods.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.330
Hey, thanks for responding.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.200
I like that.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.610
I can hear you.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.190
You don't have a microphone,
so that says something.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.730
All right.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.600
Hey, welcome.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.490
Welcome to I/O. This is day two.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.630
Welcome to this session.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.550
And to all of you out
there on the livestream

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.645
and watching the recording,
thank you for joining us.

00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:30.000
My name is Joel Kalmanowicz
I'm a product manager on Google

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.729
Maps APIs, and my
goal is to help

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.390
you bring your users the
world by making it your own,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.490
however works best for you.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:47.110
Now, maps may help us
understand and access the world,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.060
and they're an incredibly
important part of our lives.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.950
We all have really busy lives.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.880
So how important
are maps really?

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.690
Being part of Google, I like to
look at Search for my answers.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.020
And if we look at the
entirety of human interest

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.220
through queries on Google,
it turns out that about one

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.540
in every five searches
is location related.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.510
That's pretty significant.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.260
And on mobile, that number
is almost one in three.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.770
And mobile is growing faster.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.660
People doing
location-related searches

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.080
need a variety of
answers and services

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.750
to match their needs provided
through a whole ecosystem

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.360
of products and developers.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.020
That's where you come in.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.420
So, we actually have a very
large and diverse community

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.900
of developers with over
2 million apps and sites

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.890
using our Google
Maps APIs every week.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.437
And here you are.

00:01:46.437 --> 00:01:48.520
I'd actually like to ask
you all if you could just

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.909
raise one hand with me.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.700
You know, if you're at
I/O raise your hand.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.530
Come on, seriously, all
of you in the audience.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.100
I'm talking to you.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.810
Yeah.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.330
Go on, stick your hand up.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.830
OK.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.520
Thank you.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.980
That's almost everyone.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.860
No, no, keep it up.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.360
There we go.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.340
Keep it here.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.699
Now lower your hand if you've
never used Google Maps APIs.

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:08.990
I only see a few hands go down.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.740
That's impressive.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.130
Thank you very much for coming.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.190
I hope you learn something
new and useful today.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.156
For those of you who
didn't raise your hands,

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:17.030
the people who did are
your new best friends.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.800
Go talk to them and
ask them how you

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.810
want to use Google Maps APIs.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.360
Now, if you have
more questions, you

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.943
can come to our
office hours, as well,

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:26.630
or stick around for
the Q&amp;A after the show.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.772
So, we have a very
engaged community.

00:02:29.772 --> 00:02:30.980
All of you watching, as well.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.980
We really appreciate it.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.660
In fact, I'd like to show
you what level of engagement

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.160
we've been seeing from
all of you out there.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.330
Today I'm excited to
share that we serve over

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.080
two billion maps to
users every single day

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.900
through Google Maps APIs.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.510
That is absolutely amazing.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.460
It reinforces how,
when we work together,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.060
we can bring so much
for so many people.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.240
And for those of you
who want to join us,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.100
or all of you who
already know quite a bit

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.210
and who'd like to learn more, we
have a rich collection of APIs

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.140
that give you
solutions people trust.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.390
From Markers to Elevation,
Places to Street View,

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.590
and more, these are
all icons from our APIs

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.890
that you can build on.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.130
And we'll dig into a few of
the visual ones later on.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.030
But first, I would like
to change gears and share

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.070
something new with you.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.300
As we looked at how a
consumer and developer

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.140
communities use Google Maps
and our APIs, we saw a gap.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.720
Different developers
have different needs.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.840
And different use
cases for users

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.700
involve different
needs, as well.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.630
They have different goals.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.750
In fact, sometimes existing
Google Maps apps features

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.640
can serve users really
well, and you don't always

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.220
want to have to integrate all
of those services directly

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.390
inside of your app.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.290
So to make those moments
easier, we're now

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.490
introducing Google Maps URLs.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.020
We've heard your feedback.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.020
Mapping is sometimes not
a core part of your app,

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.860
but you need the functionality
to complete your user journey.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.126
In these cases, you don't want
to have to get an API key.

00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:16.709
You don't want to have to learn
all these different libraries.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.810
And few people like
having to duplicate

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.510
similar work across platforms.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.450
So Maps URLs offer a simple,
straightforward solution

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.020
that work for you and
your users anywhere.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.850
We've focused on a
few key use cases

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.740
that we think will
have you covered.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.500
The most common mapping needs.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.560
I'm going to take you through
a few complete code examples

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.070
across all four of these to
show you just how simple Maps

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.410
URLs really are.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.065
We'll start where everything
started at Google--

00:04:46.065 --> 00:04:48.690
with Search.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.760
To trigger a search,
we just build

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.150
a URL in this format with a
query parameter of our choice.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.390
The URL launches Google
Maps and instructs

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.410
it to perform the
search immediately.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.940
Now by including
an area to search,

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.940
you're going to show what's
around a particular place.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.075
I've gone for sushi
near our conference,

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:09.450
but you can see
how this would be

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.110
useful to find schools near a
new home that your user may be

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.080
interested in, or restaurants
near a hotel they have just

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.850
booked.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.310
You can also leave out
any reference to location

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.520
and just put sushi, for
example, to let the end user

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.800
search for places near them.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.380
And you don't have to ask
for or use the location

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.950
permission to do this.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.380
In your own app, you don't
need to worry about it.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.800
You can delegate that
work to Google Maps.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.890
And then you can direct people
to their nearest stores,

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.980
service providers,
parks, or anything else

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.420
you can think of, without having
to think about how you do it.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.880
If it's on Google
Maps, you can find it.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.000
And just like searching
in Google Maps,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.280
if your query returns one top
result, you get a little more.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.630
Here I've referred
to a venue by name,

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.140
and I've got a nice pin that's
gone on the map with a label;

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.930
a place sheet at the bottom
that shows Reviews, a Directions

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.544
button, and a Street
View thumbnail;

00:06:07.544 --> 00:06:09.460
and, of course, I can
swipe the place sheet up

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.260
to get more information.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.200
If you want to showcase
a particular store

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.080
or a particular location
or service provider,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.990
this gives users a lot of
that info that we already

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.960
have on Google Maps.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.680
And if you're handling place
IDs already from our other APIs,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.570
like an order
complete, you can also

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.079
use them to target
the place directly.

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:32.620
If you want to learn
more about this,

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.380
I really recommend checking
out our next location and maps

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.470
talk, on A Sense of Place,
tomorrow morning at 9:30

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.190
right here.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.100
And for those of
you watching online,

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.210
you can find us by
name, A Sense of Place.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.910
Another classic use case
on a map is Directions.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.130
We all need to get
where we're going.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.260
And we're here to help
your users find their way.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.450
But we've also taken
this a step further,

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.420
and we've included
waypoints that you can route

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.940
uses how ever you need to.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.440
You can also use this yourself.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.230
Say, if you work at the
nearby NASA Ames facility,

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.700
and you need to drop the kids
off at childcare, go to work,

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:14.354
grab them on the way home,
and that's one URL, actually.

00:07:14.354 --> 00:07:16.270
It's as simple as putting
in the waypoints you

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.540
need as a query parameter,
under the waypoints parameter

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.120
there, separated by a pipe.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.840
And then you're good to go by
the travel mode of your choice.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.690
Waypoints are great for anyone
with very complicated, or even

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.850
simple but just little bit extra
more routing needs than what

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.270
you would get by default. But
if you're feeling creative,

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.880
you can also use them
to draw something.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.300
Maybe a little something
that looks like I/O.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.820
Now, let's do something
more practical.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.400
Here we've kept the
directions endpoint, shown

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.710
in blue on the first
line of code there,

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.140
but we've changed
the parameters.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.710
The destination is now a
collection of Android statues.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.210
If you haven't seen
them, I recommend them.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.640
And since they're a
short bike ride away,

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.494
I've changed the
travel mode to suit.

00:08:04.494 --> 00:08:06.410
But more importantly,
I've added the parameter

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.720
to start navigation immediately.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.180
This is really handy,
especially for situations

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.910
where you want your users
to be able to get somewhere

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.080
without having to
touch their device.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.220
For example, if you're using
our Speech APIs or the Assistant

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.230
SDK.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.500
Now we've also dropped
the origin parameter,

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.510
so Maps will just start
navigating from wherever

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.150
your user is in the real world.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.860
Again, this is
another example of not

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.559
needing to worry about
location permissions.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:37.929
Wherever the user
is, we'll handle it.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:40.929
Now, the day has been
getting a little long, right?

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.720
So you might be more
concerned about local traffic

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.000
and checking out our Androids.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.890
I wouldn't blame you.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.500
So here under the
at endpoint, now

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.130
I've got a map and
a layer of my choice

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.200
at the zoom level we want.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.560
And you may notice that this
screenshot was taken before I/O

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.470
because all the traffic lines
are green, or almost all

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.540
of them.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.350
Yes.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.300
But you can leave
the center blank.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.700
And again, it'll just
focus on user location.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.130
Or, as I've done
here, you can specify

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.280
a lat/long coordinate
to focus the camera

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.600
exactly where you need it.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.360
Now, this is great
for scenarios where

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.140
you want to give users the sense
of an area around a business,

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.230
or a service provider, or
even a piece of real estate

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.750
that they might
be interested in.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.410
And we can dig a little
deeper into this use case.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.150
If we go from a
top-down view, we

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.240
can switch to our
immersive imagery.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.370
With Street View,
you can offer people

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.460
the experience of
really being there,

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.350
whether it's at
the Grand Canyon,

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:49.180
a store they've never been
to, or a potential new home.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.410
Street View is our panoramic
imagery, or pano for short.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.140
And so we've changed the
map action parameter,

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.350
on the second line
there, to match,

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.810
signaling that we want a pano
at the viewpoint location

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.600
that we've entered a
lat/long coordinate.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.935
You can also
specify the pano ID,

00:10:06.935 --> 00:10:10.270
if you already have it from
other Street View APIs,

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.030
similar to the place ID that
we called out a few slides ago.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.790
Now, I just showed
you an iOS mark

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.020
and that switched
over to iOS here,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.940
because this is all
platform-agnostic.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.940
This is available
on any platform.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.810
For example, Google Maps is
a popular mapping app on iOS,

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.440
but there are devices out there
that don't have it installed.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.260
For any device that does
not have a Google Maps

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.750
native app installed,
the URL will

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.830
be handled by Google Maps
web apps in a browser.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.942
And while not all
platforms support

00:10:44.942 --> 00:10:46.400
every bit of
functionality, there's

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.430
one specific example I
would like to call out here.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.600
Navigation doesn't
work on web maps.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.360
Sorry.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.370
What happens if you try
and start navigation

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.680
and your user's using a web map?

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.870
We simply gracefully
ignore that parameter,

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.669
show them directions,
and it works anyway.

00:11:02.669 --> 00:11:04.460
We didn't want to make
it more complicated.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.220
We wanted to be able to offer
this across every platform.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.770
So this graceful
fallback has allowed

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:15.290
us to do so and make it
available everywhere.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.340
Speaking of available.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.720
Maps URLs are actually
live right now.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.144
And you can give them a shot
right after this session.

00:11:23.144 --> 00:11:25.310
I don't see anyone looking
down at their phones yet,

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.230
so thanks for waiting.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.910
There's no setup
necessary, and we've

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.670
tried to make the
syntax so simple

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.430
that you can literally type
one of these up yourself.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.349
What you've been seeing on
the slides is all you need.

00:11:38.349 --> 00:11:39.890
Now one other
parameter that I'd like

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.556
to call out that I
haven't mentioned yet

00:11:41.556 --> 00:11:44.660
but you've been seeing, is
this first one called API.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.000
This is mandatory for
these URLs to work,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.390
and it functions as our
versioning system for the API.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.690
Today we're launching version 1.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.090
And, of course, you can
enter your own values

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.530
for all of these
other parameters.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.330
That's kind of the point.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.200
So if you want to find a dive
bar instead of a coffee place,

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.440
or if you have your own business
or a customer's business,

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.420
you can just enter
enough for an exact match

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.550
and you'll get that Places
sheet that I mentioned before.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.410
And yes, I do have
a link for you

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.380
with documentation at
the end of the session.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.570
Got one more example
for you, another one

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.070
of these navigation cases.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.130
Some of you may have to get
to the airport to go home.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.380
Again, this is
really easy, though.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.490
And since it's just a URL,
you can use any standard URL

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:33.280
constructing library to
build these and handle things

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.680
like sanitizing input
values or dealing

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.300
with escaped characters.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.370
You don't have to worry about
that, and neither do we.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.850
So let's take a step back.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.280
We've had a good look
at how Maps URLs can

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.050
work for you and
some of the things

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.000
that you can use them for.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.240
This is great for getting our
primary Google Maps consumer

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.850
use cases working for you and
your users quickly and easily.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.412
But how does this relate to
the rest of our Maps APIs?

00:13:01.412 --> 00:13:03.120
All those of you who've
raised your hands

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.328
are pretty familiar with
the other ones we've already

00:13:05.328 --> 00:13:07.180
got out there today.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.270
There's a trade-off
between the simplicity

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:14.680
of delegating to another
app all this work

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.180
and the power of building and
customizing something yourself.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.570
I'd like to help you get a sense
of how we can decide what to do

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.490
when we face this trade-off.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.340
So I'm going to walk you
through some of our deeper APIs

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.940
and what they can offer
you beyond Maps URLs.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.480
When you need that power of
flexibility, when you really

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.830
need to take it to the level of
building a map into your app,

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.230
that's when we
recommend our Maps APIs.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.110
So, you might remember
those little logos

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:46.720
I showed you at the beginning.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.510
Well, here they all are expanded
out to our range of APIs

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.990
across the four major
platforms we've got support on.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.370
We'll see how just
a few of these

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.880
can take you above and
beyond a regular map.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.680
Now let's begin with one
of the most useful things

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.280
that you can do on a map,
which is something out.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.980
You can drop markers
with Maps URLs.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.990
Using our Maps URLs, you
can just get one out there,

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.540
but it has to be a search
result of some kind.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.020
And it'll either be a
single marker or a range

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.490
of results via query.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.060
And it only will show you
existing places or just

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.260
a lat/long pin.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.290
If you want any interaction
with your data on the map

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.050
beyond just putting
a single point down,

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.390
you want to customize
the markers,

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.520
you need our Maps APIs.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.720
So, here we're looking at
Italian restaurants in Rome.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.540
I'm going to start with some
public data to keep it simple.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.880
We took the metadata
about the restaurant,

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.460
and we actually used
the rating to adjust

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.340
the contrast of the marker pin.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.900
The brighter, the
better the rating.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.080
And for the very
hottest places to eat,

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.540
we put some subtle
animating steam on top.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.440
And this is all just using our
publicly available Google Maps

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.330
APIs.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.420
But I did mention visualizing
your own data, as well.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.020
So let's have a look at
what we can do with that.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:13.490
Let's say, if you got a high
ratio of markers per area,

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.130
you can cluster them to
clean up your UI while still

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.040
showing useful
information to the user.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.589
Last time that I
moved I actually

00:15:20.589 --> 00:15:22.880
found this personally really
helpful on the real estate

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.820
site that I was using, because
at a low level of zoom I

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.700
could get a broad sense of how
many properties were available

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.002
in a given location.

00:15:30.002 --> 00:15:31.460
And when I zoomed
in higher I could

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.130
see exactly where they
were and tap on the marker

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.620
to get more information.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.390
Clustering is part
of the util library

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:43.420
that we maintain on GitHub for
our Google Maps SDK for iOS.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.470
And then we have a
similar clustering library

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.900
in the util library for
JavaScript and Android.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.740
Now speaking of Android, here
you can see another case.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.350
If you want to visualize
something more granular

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:00.730
than a place, something that's
more about the data on the map,

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.162
heat maps are a
great way to do this.

00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:05.620
So let's say, if you want to
look at something like housing

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.711
prices, or sea level
changing, or rainfall,

00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:11.710
or anything like that
that can be very granular.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.830
It's more about the
map than a place.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:16.870
These can be really
easy to generate.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.750
Just plug a data set
in, like a JSON array,

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.430
and you're good to go.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.790
We will do all the
rendering for you.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.260
Heat maps are available
in Android and JavaScript.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:34.210
Another useful feature of our
Maps API is camera animations.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.820
Now these are a
great way to show off

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.580
a particular place of
interest to your users

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.590
from different
perspectives, whether it's

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:45.990
3D buildings like we have here
or local satellite imagery.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:48.990
Those same use cases that I
mentioned before for Maps URLs,

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.410
for giving people the sense
of what an area is like,

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.570
now you could take
them on a little tour

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.650
instead of just giving
them a top-down view.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:02.520
Speaking of top
down, ground overlays

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.410
offer an unlimited
customization option for you

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.450
by covering the
base map completely.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.180
So here we see an example
of a historical map

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.069
of a modern satellite view.

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:16.470
We've got the ground overlay
and the historical map

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:20.310
as pasted straight onto
the base map there.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.514
It's attached to the base
map and will rotate with it.

00:17:23.514 --> 00:17:24.930
Now this can be
really fascinating

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:25.950
if you love history.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.610
I have some friends who like
looking at old maps of cities.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.064
Personally, I'm more of
a fan of hiking, though.

00:17:32.064 --> 00:17:33.480
So I think it would
be great to be

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.690
able to see hiking trails
like this in an app

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.840
without having to
deal with the paper.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.150
We can also look
towards the future.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.340
I recently read
about some projects

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.360
using Google Maps to visualize
sea-level rise projections.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.610
It's really important to
think about how our planet is

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.650
changing, but it
can be hard when

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.410
it's on such a large scale.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.210
Personally, being
able to see how

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.960
places that I knew would be
changing right there on the map

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.540
helped me connect with that.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.880
And additionally, for
those who have the data,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.420
they can just use
the ground overlay

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.750
to do this and just
take their visualization

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.220
and put it on maps.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.560
But I've also seen
some implementations

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.420
where they used
our Elevation API

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.840
to calculate shoreline
changes dynamically, directly

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.810
on our maps.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.010
Now coming back to the present.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:26.380
We also have ephemeral
events, things

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.620
that don't last a long time,
like this very conference.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:33.520
And a ground overlay can be
used to put localized geodata

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.620
in the form of a
venue map directly

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:40.650
on a Google Map in our app
that we've provided you.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.459
Ground overlays have
a range of use cases.

00:18:43.459 --> 00:18:45.000
But if you want to
customize the base

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.590
map itself, at scale,
that's another story.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.350
Styling lets you
choose your own color

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:56.390
scheme for the Google Maps
that you get from our APIs.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.890
And we brought this to
mobile platforms last year.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.370
It's proven to be a
popular way to customize

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:06.560
the visuals to suit your needs.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.750
You're going to
write custom JSON,

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.240
or generate your
own styles easily,

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.120
with our online WYSIWYG wizard--

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.170
say that three times fast--

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.450
and export them from there.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.600
This is a great tool to
help you quickly iterate

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.310
and get a feel for
how your style will

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.880
look right there on the map.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.890
Now however you get
your inspiration

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:33.610
for a styling scheme, the
implementation is the same.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.940
Now here I'm going to show
you a JavaScript example.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.000
I'm initializing a new
map object at the top.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.500
And then all I have
to do is provide

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.340
the style property, which is a
collection of sub-properties.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.100
And any that I specify
override the default.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.890
So first I'm going to
clear out the map a bit.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.050
I want it to be clean.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.500
I'm going to turn off labels
for points of interest,

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.290
and I'm also going to
get rid of local roads.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:01.870
Only in this map, not for real.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.140
And then I'm going to choose
a darker color for the road

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.500
strokes remaining to make some
particular things stand out

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.310
more on the map.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.610
Now it's important to note,
it's just a JSON blob,

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.880
so you can serve it from your
site or wherever you want,

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.890
and you can dynamically
restyle the map

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.900
without having to reload it.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.990
No re-initialization necessary.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:29.040
On JavaScript, it's as simple
as just calling the set options

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.870
and that's it.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.990
And, of course, this is possible
across our range of platforms.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.520
You never need to re-initialize
the map to change the style.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.800
And it's really useful to
change the style at runtime,

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.740
because it allows you to
respond to user input.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.770
To highlight different
things on your map.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.260
We, in fact, built our
WYSIWYG wizard I just

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.360
showed you doing exactly this.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.040
You play with the
sliders in the UI,

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:57.780
and the map is restyled
under the hood at runtime.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.350
Let's take a look at
what this style will do.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:02.850
Now we start with a normal map.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.150
This is what my initialization
function gave me.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.861
Any guesses what it'll look
like when I apply my style?

00:21:09.861 --> 00:21:12.570
Yeah, I know, I'm the
one with the microphone.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:13.260
Well.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.520
I'll skip to it.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.750
I've reduced it.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.870
And it's pretty barren.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:23.010
But it does really highlight the
highway on-ramps and off-ramps

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.080
in a way that can be
pretty useful if you're not

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.650
familiar with them.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.950
You know, we can take
this further, too.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:34.550
One of our most popular styles
is even more reductionist.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:38.060
Here it is exemplified in our
transport track, a demo app,

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:41.900
which you might have seen
around I/O. This map has been

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.820
simplified so much
that it's just

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.760
the backdrop for some bold
foreground colors that really

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.190
highlight the
salient information.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:52.610
But it still provides key,
useful geographical information

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:54.860
by being a map at a
level of granularity

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.461
that's useful to users.

00:21:57.461 --> 00:21:59.210
Now if you want to go
the other direction,

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:01.310
you can change the
overall theme in a way

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.110
that's a little bolder.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.402
Might catch the eye a bit more.

00:22:05.402 --> 00:22:06.860
You can play with
these base colors

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.590
to match your UI or a theme.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.510
You could do this
to match a brand

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.690
or to match a
particular time of day.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.550
Here I've gone for,
I guess you could

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:20.220
call it, a strawberry mocha
kind of theme for my coffee shop

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.400
locator, complete with
custom icons for the markers.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.400
I'm sure many of you could
come up with a better

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.230
style than this, and please do.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:30.710
I'm looking forward to
more of your creations.

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:35.090
Now we can also do
styling beyond the map.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.910
On Android, we now
support custom styles

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.580
for polygons and polylines.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.770
These are really
useful for conveying

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:47.050
custom geographic information
in a visual format.

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.930
So, say if you're building
real-world infrastructure,

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:55.340
you can use styled
polygons and polylines

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.090
to indicate rollout progress
for internal stakeholders,

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.090
or for your end users to get a
feel for when your service will

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.710
reach them.

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:07.520
And you can put custom
icons on the polyline ends

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.940
to draw arrows, as well
as better differentiate

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.320
between different kinds of lines
with dots, dashes, thickness,

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:14.820
and color.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.920
Bringing more styling
capabilities to our mobile APIs

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.290
is just the latest
example of the work

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.870
that we've been doing to give
you the same options across all

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.030
of our platforms.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.420
We want to give you the
capabilities to succeed anyway.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:38.190
So, with that, let's zoom
back out to review a little.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:41.230
I did promise you documentation.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.860
We've had a look at a few
of our Google Maps APIs

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.960
and how they can take
you beyond a regular map.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.620
Our documentation for all
of these is right there

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.432
at developers.google.com/maps.

00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:55.140
Hopefully very familiar
with those of you

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.291
who have already used it.

00:23:57.291 --> 00:24:01.110
And in any case, where you just
need a quick and easy mapping

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.690
solution to round
out your offering,

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.270
we've shown how you can just
delegate that to the Google

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.320
Maps app using our Maps URLs.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.480
And the documentation
for that is right there

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:18.900
at
developers.google.com/maps/URLs.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.550
Now, of course,
none of this would

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.160
be possible without all of you.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.990
And we're really looking forward
to hearing your feedback.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:27.720
So please, if you've got bugs,
feature requests, suggestions,

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.870
or anything, we're going
to have Q&amp;A. But also,

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:33.280
especially for those
of you watching online,

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.540
you can go to
developers.google.com/maps--

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:37.810
yes, it's a pattern--

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:41.130
/support, and you can see
our issue tracker there.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.200
We do read this,
and we look forward

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.470
to seeing what you
have to say about it.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.450
But while you're
still here, if you'd

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.590
like to learn more and
have a chat with us,

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:54.390
we do have office hours coming
up at 5:30 near the entrance.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.090
And we're going to
have them 5:30 PM today

00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:01.620
and again 8:30 AM tomorrow
for the early birds.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.540
And right after
that, in the morning

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.610
tomorrow, we're going to
have our next location

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:09.660
and maps track sessions right
here again, from 9:30 AM,

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:14.370
with my friend Fontaine, and
10:30 AM, with my friend Ankur.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.019
For all those of you
on the livestream

00:25:16.019 --> 00:25:18.060
and on the recording, you
can find these sessions

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.458
by looking for them by name.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:24.559
Now thank you all again for
coming here to join me today.

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:26.350
If you're shocked that
this is a bit short,

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.641
it's because I'm trying to
respect the fact that you're

00:25:28.641 --> 00:25:30.670
still here after five.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.320
Yeah, almost.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.640
And all of you online, as well.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.340
I hope you've
enjoyed the session

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.630
and learned something new.

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.760
And give our URLs and APIs a
try if you haven't already.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.254
Thank you.

00:25:42.254 --> 00:25:43.748
