00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.760
Are you working on
launching an app?

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.320
That's exciting.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.000
An important part
of app development

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.705
is understanding how people
are actually using your app.

00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:13.740
I'm Fontaine
Foxworth and I'm here

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.780
to show you how you
can do that by adding

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.220
Google Analytics to your app.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.190
Once you implement
Google Analytics,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.920
you will start to
see data showing up

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.690
in your analytics account.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.000
Often, one of the
first type of analysis

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.050
that developers
want to do is see

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.770
how many people are using it.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.830
So you'll want to look
at your new users report.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.350
Here, I can see that I've
gotten several dozen new users

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.560
each day.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.920
That's great.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.270
By looking at the
trends in new users,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.760
you could understand if an
article on a blog or an email

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.550
may have driven new
downloads your app.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.320
Now that people
are using your app,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.460
it's helpful to know at what
stage users leave your app.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.570
By using the Google Analytics
behavior flow report,

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.790
you can spot if too
many users are leaving

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.090
your app at a specific point.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.870
It could be a particular
screen or event.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.730
For example, you can see
here that 62% of users

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.030
are leading the app at game
over, which is probably not

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.115
surprising.

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:16.320
It makes you wonder
though is there

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.840
a way to decrease this number?

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.200
You can see that those
who didn't leave the app

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.600
have actually gone to the
main menu or to the tutorial.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.800
You might consider customizing
the game-over screen

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.870
to give people the options to
go to these areas directly.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.760
The more you drill
down into the data,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.150
the more you could find
ways to improve your app

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.730
and keep your users happy.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.860
It's important to use the data
to find actionable insights.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.250
Internationalization
is a good example

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.030
of where you might
want to make changes.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.850
Of course, it would be
nice to translate your app

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.760
into all available
language, but you

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.340
have to know which
ones to start with.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.160
With Google Analytics,
you can look

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.170
at which countries of
the world your traffic

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.130
is concentrated in.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.730
This particular app has
a heavy concentration

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.229
of users in Brazil.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.200
So you might want to
consider having a localized

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.000
version in Portuguese.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.450
Certainly, looking
at the feedback users

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.680
leave the reviews
in the app stores

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.530
can be one way to understand
how users engage with your app,

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.860
but a different type of feedback
is the actual behavior patterns

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.700
of engaged users.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.600
Is one level hard to pass?

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.870
Is one in-app purchase
not selling well?

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.040
These questions and
more are the ones

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.620
that Google Analytics
can help you

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.200
answer so you can make decisions
based on concrete data.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.720
This way you'll do the right
thing for users and your app.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.630
So make sure to get started with
Google Analytics in your app

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.200
before it launches.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.370
