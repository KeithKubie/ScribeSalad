00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.710
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.540
STEPHANIE LEOTSAKOS: I
think opera resonates

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.460
with every part
of me, and I think

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.520
it's just an art form
that embodies everything.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.840
(SINGING) My dearest child.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:25.350
(SPEAKING) It's both like
drama, but not a straight play.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.610
It has the music element.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.470
It has the most
difficult music, I think,

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.540
and performance rigor
that's necessary.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.270
And voices are so unique.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.640
And to be able to carry without
a microphone over an orchestra

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.040
or just perform in that
way is just absolutely

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.410
stunning and magnificent to me.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.700
It almost seems like a
miracle that that's possible.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.560
And so I just think so much can
be said and done and absorbed

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.370
through opera.
