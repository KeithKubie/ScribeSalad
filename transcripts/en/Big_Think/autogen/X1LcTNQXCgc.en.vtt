our group did a really interesting study

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370
our group did a really interesting study
 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.810
our group did a really interesting study
of this um we we brought people into the

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820
of this um we we brought people into the
 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.560
of this um we we brought people into the
lab and and in this experiment one

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570
lab and and in this experiment one
 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.540
lab and and in this experiment one
sample were police officers and one

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
sample were police officers and one
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.190
sample were police officers and one
sample were probation officers found the

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200
sample were probation officers found the
 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.929
sample were probation officers found the
same thing in each sample so we bring

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939
same thing in each sample so we bring
 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.970
same thing in each sample so we bring
them into the lab and we say we're gonna

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980
them into the lab and we say we're gonna
 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.680
them into the lab and we say we're gonna
ask you to read through this

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690
ask you to read through this
 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.640
ask you to read through this
hypothetical discussion of a crime and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650
hypothetical discussion of a crime and
 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.799
hypothetical discussion of a crime and
and the person is given it is going to

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809
and the person is given it is going to
 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.950
and the person is given it is going to
be given a couple paragraphs to read

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960
be given a couple paragraphs to read
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.510
be given a couple paragraphs to read
that describe a crime but don't have any

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
that describe a crime but don't have any
 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.810
that describe a crime but don't have any
information about the perpetrators race

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820
information about the perpetrators race
 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.810
information about the perpetrators race
in each case it's a juvenile now we tell

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820
in each case it's a juvenile now we tell
 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.090
in each case it's a juvenile now we tell
you that before you read this we want

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
you that before you read this we want
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.920
you that before you read this we want
you to do an exercise to kind of clear

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930
you to do an exercise to kind of clear
 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.229
you to do an exercise to kind of clear
your mind and we ask you to look at a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
your mind and we ask you to look at a
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.140
your mind and we ask you to look at a
computer and to tell us whether a point

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150
computer and to tell us whether a point
 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.759
computer and to tell us whether a point
of light that you're in see flashing is

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769
of light that you're in see flashing is
 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.530
of light that you're in see flashing is
on the right side or the left side of

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540
on the right side or the left side of
 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.439
on the right side or the left side of
the screen now in reality it's not a

the screen now in reality it's not a
 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.509
the screen now in reality it's not a
point of light it's a word but it's

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519
point of light it's a word but it's
 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.070
point of light it's a word but it's
flashed so quickly that you can't

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080
flashed so quickly that you can't
 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.920
flashed so quickly that you can't
process it it's all subliminal half the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
process it it's all subliminal half the
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.050
process it it's all subliminal half the
people in the study get a list of words

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
people in the study get a list of words
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.410
people in the study get a list of words
that we associate with African Americans

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420
that we associate with African Americans
 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.889

things like Oprah or reggae so not bad
 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.719
things like Oprah or reggae so not bad
things but things that we tend to

things but things that we tend to
 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.569
things but things that we tend to

sample gets a list of words that has no

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
sample gets a list of words that has no
 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:24.819

racial
 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.539
racial
association but that are matched for

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549
association but that are matched for
 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.730
association but that are matched for
their word length and then people are

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
their word length and then people are
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.950
their word length and then people are
given these crimes to read and they're

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960
given these crimes to read and they're
 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.289
given these crimes to read and they're
asked how guilty is the person how much

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299
asked how guilty is the person how much
 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.929
asked how guilty is the person how much
punishment does the person deserve how

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
punishment does the person deserve how
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.859
punishment does the person deserve how
likely is the person to reoffended ulta

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
likely is the person to reoffended ulta
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.539
likely is the person to reoffended ulta
is this offender and in both samples

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549
is this offender and in both samples
 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.709
is this offender and in both samples
regardless of the race of the person in

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719
regardless of the race of the person in
 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.709
regardless of the race of the person in
the experiment if you got primed to

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719
the experiment if you got primed to
 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.679
the experiment if you got primed to
think of African Americans you rated the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689
think of African Americans you rated the
 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.219
think of African Americans you rated the
person the criminal as guilty er more

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
person the criminal as guilty er more
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.349
person the criminal as guilty er more
deserving of punishment more likely to

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359
deserving of punishment more likely to
 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.239
deserving of punishment more likely to
reoffend more adult-like

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.249
reoffend more adult-like
 

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:01.779
reoffend more adult-like
alright and this happened as I said

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789
alright and this happened as I said
 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.919
alright and this happened as I said
regardless of the race of the person in

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929
regardless of the race of the person in
 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.989
regardless of the race of the person in
the experiment so so black police

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:05.999
the experiment so so black police
 

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:07.700
the experiment so so black police
officers were just as likely to do this

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
officers were just as likely to do this
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.559
officers were just as likely to do this
as white police officers black probation

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
as white police officers black probation
 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.240
as white police officers black probation
officers just as likely as white

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
officers just as likely as white
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.980
officers just as likely as white
probation officers but it gets to

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990
probation officers but it gets to
 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.300
probation officers but it gets to
something that's important about

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310
something that's important about
 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.000
something that's important about
understanding disproportionate minority

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010
understanding disproportionate minority
 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.870
understanding disproportionate minority
involvement in the system which is that

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880
involvement in the system which is that
 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.090
involvement in the system which is that
we have unconscious biases that affect

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100
we have unconscious biases that affect
 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.979
we have unconscious biases that affect
the decisions that we make

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989
 
 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.300
 
well racial disproportionality in the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310
well racial disproportionality in the
 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.000
well racial disproportionality in the
justice system is seen it at virtually

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010
justice system is seen it at virtually
 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.069
justice system is seen it at virtually
every level that you look at so it's

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079
every level that you look at so it's
 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.809
every level that you look at so it's
seen in terms of who gets arrested it's

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819
seen in terms of who gets arrested it's
 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.670

levels of involvement in the system you

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040
levels of involvement in the system you
 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.539
levels of involvement in the system you
see more black and Latino kids than you

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549
see more black and Latino kids than you
 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.059
see more black and Latino kids than you
do white kids controlling for their

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069
do white kids controlling for their
 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.270
do white kids controlling for their
criminal behavior um there isn't one

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280
criminal behavior um there isn't one
 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.089
criminal behavior um there isn't one
thing that causes this to happen it's I

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099
thing that causes this to happen it's I
 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.539
thing that causes this to happen it's I
think probably the some of many smaller

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549
think probably the some of many smaller
 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.339
think probably the some of many smaller
things but then when added up have a

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349
things but then when added up have a
 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.550
things but then when added up have a
large effect so we know that there is

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560
large effect so we know that there is
 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.129
large effect so we know that there is
racial profiling going on in terms of

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139
racial profiling going on in terms of
 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.000
racial profiling going on in terms of
how law ordains work we know that people

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010
how law ordains work we know that people
 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.210
how law ordains work we know that people
have unconscious biases against kids of

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220
have unconscious biases against kids of
 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.210
have unconscious biases against kids of
color that might lead them to to see

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220
color that might lead them to to see
 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.640
color that might lead them to to see
them as more dangerous when they may not

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650
them as more dangerous when they may not
 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.250
them as more dangerous when they may not
be you you tend to see

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260
be you you tend to see
 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.589
be you you tend to see
disproportionality the most that less

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599
disproportionality the most that less
 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.379
disproportionality the most that less
serious crime so just in in a concrete

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389
serious crime so just in in a concrete
 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.270
serious crime so just in in a concrete
way if you're talking about somebody

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280
way if you're talking about somebody
 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.589
way if you're talking about somebody
who's murdered somebody

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599
who's murdered somebody
 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.449
who's murdered somebody
it really doesn't matter for the most

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459
it really doesn't matter for the most
 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.969
it really doesn't matter for the most
part whether that criminal is black or

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:42.979
part whether that criminal is black or
 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.319
part whether that criminal is black or
white they're going to be punished for

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329
white they're going to be punished for
 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.000
white they're going to be punished for
murder but if you're talking about

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010
murder but if you're talking about
 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.500
murder but if you're talking about
somebody who's arrested for drug dealing

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510
somebody who's arrested for drug dealing
 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.409
somebody who's arrested for drug dealing
you know there's a lot of subjectivity

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419
you know there's a lot of subjectivity
 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.750
you know there's a lot of subjectivity
that goes on in how the charge is made

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760
that goes on in how the charge is made
 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.380
that goes on in how the charge is made
and in what the outcome of the charge is

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390
 
 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.110
 
um it's been it's been done in a couple
