1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,330
[inaudible] joining me today is an actor,

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,270
a standup comic,
the host of American Ninja Warrior,

3
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:13,960
and a guy whose birthday today,
Matt Iseman. Happy Birthday. Well,

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,640
thank you so much. I'm, I'm a little under
the weather. I'm a little hoarse here,

5
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:19,290
but this is a great birthday gift.

6
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:23,880
I always say one of the great choices
since I moved out to La was always want to

7
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,230
make sure I,
I perform,

8
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:29,130
I do something on my birthday because
that's what I love doing. So this is it.

9
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:32,300
This is my gift to myself.
How old are you? I'm,

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,310
I'm 40 48 40 48 which sounds so
old and yet I don't does that?

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,870
I don't know that it's
42 48 no longer now.

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,910
48 sounds old because I still in my
head see myself in my twenties yeah,

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,120
and it's hard. It's really
hard to shift that, that, that,

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,870
that thought process because I'm still
still, I'm dating a girl, but no kids,

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,080
so no commitment, none of those
responsibilities. I know you're married.

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,120
I think those are the kinds of
things that make you those little,

17
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,390
the markers in life that
might make you feel, okay,

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,650
I've matured but I've regressed
in everything I've done.

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,320
I talked about Ninjas for living.
I do stand up comedy,

20
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:16,800
so there's nothing that would make me
feel like an adult other than seeing that

21
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:21,420
48 next to my name and somehow
through it all at 48 years.

22
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:23,790
And maybe it's that you don't
have kids big smile on your face,

23
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,100
so you're doing something,
you know, I think, um,

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,330
I was a naturally enthusiastic kid. My
mom, you know, they, they called me,

25
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:35,260
they might the sunshine boy and
uh, I, I think, you know, the,

26
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,690
the word I always used,

27
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,420
if there was one adjective I would say
to describe myself who was enthusiastic,

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,260
I get excited about things.
And that's one of the,

29
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,130
one of the things I think that was
what it was a gift for me and, and to,

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,550
to have found a career where
you get rewarded for that.

31
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,550
And especially your shield
like Ninja Warrior, which
deals in hype and hyperbole,

32
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:57,330
where the more enthusiastic I am,
the better it is.

33
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:00,950
And that's become a thing onto itself.
We'll talk. It really is and it's, it's,

34
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:03,150
it's been, uh, it's,

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,640
I think also having switched careers,
uh,

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,480
midstream in life gave me
such an appreciation for
being able to do something

37
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:16,230
that I love because you look at so many
people and I always think of the song

38
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:18,740
working for the week,
everybody's working for the weekend.

39
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,100
That idea of a job is supposed to be toil.
It's supposed to be arguous.

40
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,730
It's supposed to be something you do to
provide for your family and then allow

41
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:27,870
you to have that free time.

42
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,890
We've found a way to disrupt the system
and do something we love. It's bizarre,

43
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:36,810
right? It's the best. And
it's one of those things of
if you can do it, and, and,

44
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,480
and I, I credit this to my dad deserves
the credit. Cause I, you know, I was a,

45
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,333
I was a doctor.

46
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,440
My Dad's a doctor and he was a professor
of medicine at the University of

47
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:50,190
Colorado where I was doing residency and
my dad is a world renowned physician.

48
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:53,640
He's the man I respect more than any
other person on this planet. He is,

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,670
he is the smartest, the best, the kindest,

50
00:02:56,671 --> 00:03:00,820
the wisest man I've ever known or
you type the wrong ice minutes. Dude.

51
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,980
You totally do. My Dad is, my dad is,
he's a legend. I Yo, he's iron Mike.

52
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:07,650
He is just,
and,

53
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,070
and so to be [inaudible] following
in his footsteps and to know,

54
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,590
to feel like a, obviously I think
he was, he was very proud of it.

55
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:22,591
So when I sensed that medicine wasn't
my passion and that I needed to take a

56
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:27,910
step back and reevaluate because I
couldn't in good conscience be a doctor,

57
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:31,360
knowing my heart wasn't 100% in it,
I felt like I was a fraud.

58
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,140
I felt like I was not doing a service to
my patients and certainly not to myself

59
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,600
that the scariest moment
was telling my dad.

60
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,860
And I remember when I told him the first
words, he said, we're life is short.

61
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:42,880
Do what makes you happy.

62
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,570
So I've got that very quote from your
dad right here because it's the first

63
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:49,630
thing that you say on your about page,
on your site all the time.

64
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,650
Because in a certain way it sort of
sounds cliche. Do what makes you happy.

65
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,700
It is cliche.

66
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,520
It's almost the best advice or only
advice that you could get to that one.

67
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,550
I don't at a certain
level. Yeah. You know,

68
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,690
certainly it's not a Shakespearian line,
but I thought it was just, you know,

69
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,380
particularly for him to say it
at a moment when very easily,

70
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,680
probably most parents would
be, you're crazy. There's,

71
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,160
there's a lot of money invested in
this education. This is a stable job.

72
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:18,460
You don't walk away from
it for him to instead say,

73
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,700
all we care about is you being happy.
And you know,

74
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:25,150
I've talked to them so many times about
it and marveled at that he could have

75
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,980
mustered those words. Cause, uh, my
dad's an amazing man and he's also,

76
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:32,470
he worked hard for
everything he had. And, uh,

77
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,820
I was very fortunate to have
more opportunities because
of his hard work and the

78
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:41,710
work of my mom. And,
and, uh, I, I think too,

79
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,650
you know, when, when he says, I'm like,
how can I ever repay that? He say,

80
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,710
just if you ever have kids
someday do the same for them.

81
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,570
It's that pay it forward
mentality. And it's that thing
of, I don't know, it's, uh,

82
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,530
it makes me appreciate though
the opportunity that I have.

83
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,070
I know how lucky I am to be out here
getting to do this and how lucky I am to

84
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:05,071
have tried medicine and learn so much
from it and learned so much and be given

85
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:09,250
so much perspective about what truly
is life or death and to be out here in

86
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:11,770
entertainment where we feel like
everything is life or death,

87
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:16,240
but it's just silliness. It's silliness.
And it's so much fun what we get to do.

88
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,750
Yet we still do have a chance
to make a difference. Yeah.

89
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,590
Well you can do something real. It's
still enjoyable. Yeah. But wait, so,

90
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,960
so let's back up a bit. So
your dad's a doctor. Yeah.

91
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,800
Was it just sort of a foregone conclusion
that you were going to? No, no,

92
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:33,730
he wasn't even, he never pressured
me into it. It was more I think,

93
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:35,460
lead by example.
It was either,

94
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:40,120
the funny thing was I think at eight
I kind of had a crisis during college

95
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:44,140
because I worked,
there was just in growing up,

96
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:48,400
it was you work hard, you play sports,
you go to school, you excel, you achieve,

97
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,680
and that's the path you're on.

98
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,750
But I never kind of stopped to say stuff
right there, work hard and succeed.

99
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,480
Right? But I never stopped to
think what's, what's the end?

100
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,720
Where am I headed? And so then, you know,

101
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:05,570
when I kind of poked my head up
midway through college, you go,

102
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:09,320
w where am I headed? And I looked
around and I thought, you know,

103
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:12,290
that's when I thought, okay,
I like science. I like people.

104
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,710
And I looked at my dad as someone who
I respected tremendously and saw the

105
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:19,060
satisfaction he got from
medicine. Now, I think he,

106
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,660
he was a little impression in seeing that
medicine was changing and doctors were

107
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,340
losing autonomy and that,
you know,

108
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,490
medicine today is radically
different than it was 30 years ago.

109
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,630
So I think he saw that there was probably
going to be some disruptions in the

110
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:37,130
field of medicine, but um, it
seemed on paper the perfect job.

111
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,820
But it's so interesting, you know,
that's what you realize is, you know,

112
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,810
it's like when you watch
sports or something, you know,

113
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,600
you don't play a game on paper.
You don't live your life on paper.

114
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,280
What looks like it might be perfect that
sometimes it's just that divine spark

115
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:52,220
is missing that, that whatever
it is, that intangible thing.

116
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,700
And I'm so lucky to have somehow stumbled
into performing and finding that I

117
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:02,210
love an audience.
I love being in front of the camera.

118
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:05,120
I love doing standup comedy.
I love being on Ninja Warrior.

119
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,270
I mean these are the things
where no matter how sick I am,

120
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:09,380
no matter how tired I am,

121
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:11,870
if it's like when you get
onstage and you have an audience,

122
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,950
I just feel like I feel present.
I feel alive. It's such a rush.

123
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,380
Did you have a moment when you realized
it was wrong for you? Sort of slow thing.

124
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,890
There was a loud moment. It was in
January of 1999 I was in the ICU.

125
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:29,120
It was probably three in the morning.
You know, I'd, I'd been up for 18 hours.

126
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:31,110
We were getting slammed.
I think we had seven admin.

127
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:35,950
So this super sick people
are rolling in and I'm a uh,

128
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,210
resident. I man, I'm an intern first,

129
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,840
first year out of med school and I
had a second year with me and there's,

130
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,930
there's also an attending when
he wasn't in the hospital.

131
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,440
So at this point the guy was like
the person who was overseeing me,

132
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:50,390
it was just like,
just you got to the rights of mortars,

133
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:53,210
you got to make some choices,
make some decisions for these people.

134
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:58,211
And I'm all of a sudden realizing these
people's lives now are in my hands.

135
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,100
And I just thought,
I'm sitting there going,

136
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,540
I want to be skiing or playing Nintendo
or, or I don't want to be here.

137
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,480
I didn't feel like this is the
moment I've trained for it.

138
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:11,690
It wasn't like er I jumped on top
of a Gurney and started doing CPR.

139
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,720
It was just this moment
of I felt like a fraud.

140
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:17,540
I felt like my heart,

141
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,830
you know it all this training,
all this and I loved medical school.

142
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:25,580
I loved the problem solving elements of
it but I realized, I think there was,

143
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,080
there's just something, I think there
are jobs and there are callings.

144
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:34,130
Medicine is a calling. It is not
something that you just do nine to five.

145
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:38,820
It is something that consumes you
that you are obsessed with your,

146
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,250
your patients are obsessed with being
up to date on the information and giving

147
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:46,580
them the best care possible. And if
you're, if you don't hear that calling,

148
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,540
if it's just a job for you,
that's awful because it is,

149
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,100
it is such a consuming
profession and you know,

150
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:56,760
and when you look at the opportunity cost
of somebody who goes to medical school

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,630
and is going six figures into that versus
my friends who went into finance and

152
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:04,650
or making six figures and then during
residency you're making subsistence level

153
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:06,720
wages.
As your debt continues to grow,

154
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,960
some of these people will
never get out from under that,

155
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,210
that debt and and you end up working
this career and making choices that you

156
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:19,830
might not want to or practicing the way
you would want to or given the level of

157
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:22,150
care that you would want to.
When you think I,

158
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,160
I do believe that health care in America
is going to see a radical shift in the

159
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,420
next few decades because people aren't
going to be able to afford to go into

160
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:32,400
medicine anymore or want to.

161
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,150
It's such a fascinating
thing because it's like, wow,

162
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,120
you train your whole life or something.
Okay, now you make, you have this moment,

163
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,630
right? You have to wake up moment. What
happens in the next day? So you know,

164
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,320
my mom,

165
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,980
my mom said something like there's no
wasted education and she's so right.

166
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:51,600
Like so when I came out to
la, I literally, I packed
up, I packed up a u haul,

167
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:56,601
I moved out to La September one
99 and I got the a la weekly,

168
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:59,180
I got the back pain.
This is like bad movie version of this is,

169
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:03,450
this is John's playing Mecasa and,

170
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,590
and so I just started finding open mikes
and I just started going to open mikes

171
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,380
and I'm just, honestly,
when I came out here,

172
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:13,170
it wasn't as though I said I'm
going to be a standup comedian.

173
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:16,860
Part of me thought I'm going to take
a year and I'm going to grow up.

174
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,700
I'm going to get this out of my system
and realize I'm fortunate to be a doctor

175
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:25,410
and I'll go back and adult. That's
kind of what I thought 20 years ago.

176
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:26,940
So you're late,
late twenties,

177
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:31,010
late twenties and I can't really
understand the open mic situation.

178
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,500
It's the God awful. I remember
when I was doing it. And it's like,

179
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,030
it's like a terrible, you know, couple
of years that you have to do as a comic,

180
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:42,030
as you're figuring out your shit.
But I remember there would be doctors,

181
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:44,690
they're lawyers, they're, there
would be professionals and I,

182
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,410
every time I saw one of them, I'd be
like, what in the world is wrong with you?

183
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,970
Why are you here? You're a real
person. You're a functioning person.

184
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,370
And yet they were there because they
had something in them that there's

185
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:58,230
something, there's
something, you know, I think,

186
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:01,950
I think everybody has that
we all search for purpose.

187
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:06,180
We all search for something that,
that, that ignites a fire in this.

188
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:10,980
And rare is the person that finds,
I think, the job that does that.

189
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,660
And I think we're so lucky to have found
something. And again, it even gets luck.

190
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,260
Um,
well you're okay.

191
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,490
We took the chance and
we certainly went out. I,

192
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:27,280
I still think there is a certain
amount of, of fortune or,

193
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:29,120
or circumstance or something, you know, I,

194
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,810
I'm not gonna say I'm Christopher
Columbus who boldly decided to explore the

195
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:36,540
frontiers of the job world
and walked away from medicine.

196
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,130
I was lucky in that my family supported
me. I was lucky in that when I came out,

197
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,470
you know, you meet the right people. Look,

198
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,130
luck is what prep preparation besides
whatever cliches we want to spout out.

199
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,700
Yeah. I just thought you'd have a good
one there that I, I don't, I don't know.

200
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:54,220
I mean, I'd never been called on that day.
You're very good. I, I'm not saying it.

201
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:54,670
Is it luck?

202
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,180
I do think it's partly luck her kids
made or magic of just putting the work in

203
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,220
all those things. Having said
that, you're right. I think, um,

204
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,480
that once I realized it was this,

205
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,510
that's where the medicine came in so
handy in that medicine taught me such a

206
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,860
discipline and, and such, uh,

207
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:16,360
an ability to work hard and
process information and to
just withstand a river of

208
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:20,910
shit being dumped on you
where you're like, this is,
this is easy, right? I'm not,

209
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,870
I'm not on third call for 36 hours.

210
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:26,860
You're asking me to sit here with craft
services and have someone do make up and

211
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:30,040
be pampered that fine. Yeah, fine. Great.

212
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,190
I love this can be a lot of waiting
around, which is quite cool. It is.

213
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:35,560
And you know, the, the, it's
a business. Well here's,

214
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:40,360
here's where it really helped is
Hollywood is a business of no, you,

215
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,780
you go out for a hundred things
and 99 times you're told no,

216
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:45,190
and often you're told nothing.

217
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,000
You're not given a reason why you might've
been amazing. You're never told why.

218
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,530
And if you don't have something that
provides you with that sense of self,

219
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:58,450
that sense of it's okay, I know I am
talented. If you don't have that belief,

220
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,550
then I think people really crumble.

221
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,270
And the people who succeed aren't
necessarily the most talented.

222
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,450
They're the ones who persist.
They're the ones who can slog it out.

223
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:09,490
And you know this, we, we,

224
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:14,470
we've seen it the 1520 year overnight
success where somebody pops and like,

225
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,930
oh my God, this guy came out of
nowhere. And you're like, no,

226
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,530
I've been doing it for 20 years.
And they finally,

227
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,310
they got recognized and that's why they're
so good is because they've been doing

228
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:27,100
it for 20 years. I heard Susie
Essman, you know the comedians. Yeah.

229
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,750
Curb your enthusiasm.
I heard her say that.

230
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:31,090
Everyone says she's an overnight success
and she always goes, you know what?

231
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:33,130
She's got a great piety match.
She's always like, well,

232
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:37,090
where the fuck were you for
20 years? Yeah. It's like,
yeah, there's a lot of work,

233
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,410
you know. And honestly
though it, it's a, it,

234
00:13:42,411 --> 00:13:44,950
it does two things. A, it
makes you appreciate it, but B,

235
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:49,690
it also makes you ready for it because
if I come out here and gotten a show one

236
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:51,370
weekend, you, you wouldn't
have had the chops.

237
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:52,300
You wouldn't have known how to do it.

238
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:56,060
You wouldn't have had the ability
to know right from wrong or,

239
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:57,640
or to make the right decisions.

240
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,780
And I think that's what you learn over
those 20 years of hard knocks. You know,

241
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:04,810
you, you start to see, um,

242
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,810
you get these opportunities
performing in front of four people.

243
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,230
So when you go out there and you're like,
there is nothing,

244
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,310
I hosted a live show on
the history channel, um,

245
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,590
with Travis Pastrana ray recreated
evil Knievel stunts for three hours.

246
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,090
Half the time people are just like,
just talk. And you're like, okay,

247
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,990
I can do that. I've done that. That,
that's what I've been trained for.

248
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:30,580
And so it was so great to feel like
you, you, you're ready for things.

249
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,110
I did. I was just talking
about celebrity apprentice.

250
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:36,340
So I was with Arnold
Schwarzenegger this weekend and um,

251
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,590
the show got politicized.
Nobody watched it.

252
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,670
But what was great about it was it was
so much fun for me because it called on.

253
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:44,860
I felt everything I had done
in my life to that point,

254
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,030
whether it'd been playing sports or being
a doctor or going to school or a stand

255
00:14:50,031 --> 00:14:53,100
up or hosting our w anything you,

256
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:57,860
you called on all these different seals
and it's so much fun when you feel ready,

257
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,270
when an opportunity comes and you're like,
I am ready for this opportunity.

258
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,390
There's nothing you could throw
at me that I can't handle. And,

259
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,500
and I would much rather have someone go,
where have you been?

260
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,540
Then see you too early and go, miles.
All right, but next. All right,

261
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:18,110
so we've got the beginnings of
a Nice Hollywood story here,

262
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,060
but for a content, it took
a turn for the worse. Right?

263
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,610
Then you moved to La crumbles.
No, but, but, you know,

264
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:30,460
they say the comedy comes from pain. Um,
uh, I'm not seeing like, well, you know,

265
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:35,430
I think I always say people
go into a, they, those people,
I think, I think there's,

266
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,420
um, I think people go into
comedy for one of two reasons.

267
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:42,440
They weren't hugged enough as a child
pain or they were hugged too much.

268
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,490
I was definitely the latter where I
had a mother who just showered me with

269
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,110
attention and affection and praise
and she was always Matt. Oh,

270
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:52,040
that's so funny.

271
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:57,090
Whatever I did was amazing and she
made me believe have this ridiculous

272
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:02,030
confidence this. And she was
always there. She was always there.

273
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:06,920
I had this unbelievable sense
of a safety net from my mom and,

274
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,813
and my dad.

275
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,600
And I think that that's what gave me
the confidence to think I could come out

276
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:16,601
here and take a swing and be okay and
know that I could fall flat on my face and

277
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:21,470
either go back to Madison and my parents
wouldn't disown me and, and, but,

278
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:24,290
but ultimately I believed, yeah, I,

279
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,080
what I've realized in life is nothing
is certain. And, and I look at,

280
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:31,490
I have a ton of friends
who are in finance.

281
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,450
I had a friend who was at bear
Stearns when it imploded and you know,

282
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,840
saw people lose $60 million overnight and
these guys who thought they were going

283
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:41,900
to be able to retire all of a sudden
an hour out of a job and broke.

284
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,250
And you know, you go into, you choose
some of these careers thinking, all right,

285
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:48,170
I'm going to work my ass off,
but it'll pay off in the end.

286
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:52,190
And you realize there nothing's
guaranteed. And so I think too,

287
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:57,290
what I realized is the best bet in
life you can make is to bet on yourself

288
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:02,020
because that's where you have the most
control. And so while these career I'm at,

289
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,860
we're in well is so fickle and so on
the surface fickle where, you know,

290
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:11,630
my show, they live week to week
with ratings. Oh my God, it's,

291
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:15,200
it's up a pointer. It's down a point.
And you think it could end at any moment.

292
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,450
And, and we, and we make
our peace with that.

293
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:21,470
But ultimately what I've realized
is having been out here 19 years,

294
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,890
I've worked and I,
I just have to have this confidence.

295
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,010
The only way I can sleep at
night as to say if it goes away,

296
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:30,680
something else will come,
I'll bet on myself.

297
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,570
And I think that's one of those
things in life that, um, is,

298
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,170
is hard to get to. But if you can, is a
great position to be in is when you say,

299
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:41,030
I'd rather bet on myself
than someone else,

300
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:43,160
than relying on someone else
to provide me as you have,

301
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:44,840
you've gone out on your own. Yeah. I mean,

302
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:47,480
I feel that very intimately because even
just in the last couple of months with

303
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:50,730
this patriotic thing,
the rubber met the road and I was like,

304
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,540
can I make a move here?
That's a huge risk and not,

305
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,840
and I did make the move and it, and it's
worked. And I've found that if you're,

306
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,140
if you're just present enough and aware
enough of what really is going on and

307
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:03,960
you put in the work that you
generally make the right moves,

308
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,630
you're going to do some missteps
along the way. Yeah. But,

309
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,140
but that generally speaking,
the right path, we'll kind of,

310
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,000
you've got to shoot though.
You've got to take that shot.

311
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,390
I've got to think it's a,
you know, with Ninja Warrior,

312
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:19,080
one of the things we see is
everybody falls, everybody's
going to have a misstep.

313
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:19,981
Everyone's gonna have a show,

314
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:23,700
get canceled or something and you just
get back up and you learn from it and you

315
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:27,220
keep going. Some people are devastated
by that. Some people can't handle that,

316
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,240
that failure. And you just have to
realize that it's not a failure. It's,

317
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:34,980
it's just this was one
thing that didn't work,

318
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,290
but hopefully it'll lead you
to the next thing that does.

319
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:41,010
Are you shocked at the amount of people
that are just afraid to do something

320
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:45,540
special now? They're like, I get it. I
mean, again, you know, I, I think I was,

321
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,410
I was very lucky to have parents
who were incredibly supportive.

322
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,690
So,
and I was also like,

323
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:56,550
I think to have been exposed to
enough. So even though I, you know,

324
00:18:56,551 --> 00:19:01,530
my life had always been very much
set towards, you know, sports,

325
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:03,510
school achievement, it
was set towards, you know,

326
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,720
lawyer finance doctor is something that,

327
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:10,140
there was enough exposure to think
that it was possible to have it.

328
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:10,711
Outside of that.

329
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:14,550
So for a random person who's growing up
without parents who are encouraging them,

330
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,170
I think it's hard.

331
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:22,010
I know how lucky I was to have parents
who gave me that sense of confidence and

332
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,530
that sense of anything is possible.

333
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,540
So for the average person, I, the
people who amaze me are the people I,

334
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:34,050
you know, I want that movie.
I Tonya about Tonya Harding.

335
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,770
One of the things that struck me,
there were two things that struck me.

336
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:41,790
One was how remarkable it was that this
girl from the trailer parks went into

337
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:46,380
this sport and through sheer
will and athleticism, um,

338
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,850
made it to the top.

339
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,620
But the thing I didn't like about the
movie was that while it purported to tell

340
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:53,160
her story,

341
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,430
I felt there was a little winking and
judgmental of she still white trash

342
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:58,200
trailer park.
And when you told,

343
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:01,050
when you really saw the story of how her
mom would hire people to yell at her,

344
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,960
I don't know that, you know, you
want it to be a sympathetic figure,

345
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:07,650
but at least you understood what
this woman overcome and the,

346
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,240
for the tenacious,
the ferocious to tenacity,

347
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:16,710
she had to persevere in, in this
world where she was such an outsider.

348
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,690
Those are the people who
amaze me. Yeah, I mean, I,

349
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,170
I know I was very fortunate to,

350
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,960
to have a lot of opportunities that
gave me the confidence to take my shot.

351
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:29,850
So look, any other thing was like when I
moved out here, I didn't have a family.

352
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,220
I didn't have kids,
I didn't have responsibilities.

353
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,640
So for that person who's sitting
there, those are the people, you know,

354
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,890
if you have a wife and
kids and you can say,

355
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,360
I'm going to risk our future
to take the shot, that's,

356
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,690
those are the people I think
I really salute. Right?

357
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,550
It's a little harder to the doctor or
the lawyer or the finance guy or the

358
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:50,260
janitor who is like,

359
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:53,110
I got some kids and now I'm quitting
and I'm going to do stand up comedy.

360
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,130
We've got a different situation. Yeah. And
it's, it's, it is hard and it's, it's, uh,

361
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,220
you know, one of the things I love
with American Ninja Warrior, uh,

362
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,760
to shamelessly promote,
but,

363
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,730
but it's to see these people who have
families who have jobs and still find time

364
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:09,700
to train for this ridiculous
thing because it's their passion.

365
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,980
And when you see that it's, that's what
I love about it is because I think it's,

366
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,340
it's kind of, it's sums up the
American dream of it's just bootstraps.

367
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:23,170
It's that there's no, there is
no secret formula. I'd work hard.

368
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:28,030
Have you seen people that have been to
absolutely wrapped up in that thing,

369
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:32,440
whatever that thing may be, be it, be
it comedy, be it, you know? Sure, sure.

370
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,370
Of course. Of course. You know, I think, I
think there's a, you know, there, there's,

371
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,870
there's obsession and, and a healthy
obsession. Then there's a, you know,

372
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:44,830
a consuming obsession. I think with
American Ninja Warrior for the most part,

373
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:50,030
um, there's, uh, there's the
community is, there's such a,

374
00:21:50,031 --> 00:21:54,910
a positive supportive community that
we haven't seen people, you know,

375
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,170
go off the rails. And
the good news is, look,

376
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,880
I don't think any of them are know
using pds. They're too expensive.

377
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:05,050
These guys are making a lot of money.

378
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,480
I think they really are leading a
healthy lifestyle, but more importantly,

379
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:11,590
it's a supportive lifestyle. But
certainly with comedy you've seen lots of,

380
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:11,980
you know,

381
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,940
lots of friends who've in comedy is a
very lonely existence when you're on the

382
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:16,150
road.

383
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,780
Now I'm lucky that with TV I get to do
comedy selectively and not have to be out

384
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:24,760
there 40 50 weeks a year in strange cities
where you're working two hours a day

385
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,860
and 22 hours,

386
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,600
you're in a strange city with nothing to
do and no one around. And that is, uh,

387
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,170
that is a existence that's
kind of fun when you're 20.

388
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,440
But when you get into your forties
is incredibly lonely in your fifties.

389
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,580
It's very hard.
Yeah.

390
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,880
I remember when I was maybe six
or seven years into stand up,

391
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:46,960
I was doing some of my first road gigs.
I was opening at bananas in Poughkeepsie,

392
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:50,740
New York for bobcat. Stop bragging.
Oh, bottom bobcat's great.

393
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:52,150
He was really great actually,

394
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,240
and the shows were sold out to the
and to move us out of the club.

395
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:58,660
He was in a best western, best
western in Poughkeepsie. Wow.

396
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,690
Move us out of the comedy club into a ball
room, so it's, you know, I don't know,

397
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:02,560
five,
600 people.

398
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:05,320
I think we did six shows over three
nights or something like that,

399
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,540
but I remember on the last night
that the show ends and I'm alone in

400
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:14,350
Poughkeepsie and it's freezing out
and I'm starving and the is closed and

401
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,184
there's nothing else.

402
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,240
I leave there and I remember I walk up
to the vending machine at the end of the

403
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:24,100
hallway and I got a skittles and
I laid in bed eating skittles,

404
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:27,010
you know, best what's going to be
kipsy after one of your best shows,

405
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,210
the best shows of my life. And I was
like, I'm actually depressed. Yeah.

406
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,570
That's how warp this thing,
if you have some of those moments,

407
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:37,570
I remember that I was sitting there
and yeah, same thing like in Ohio,

408
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:39,130
walking around going, what
am I, what am I doing?

409
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:43,020
Walking to Mcdonald's at two in the
morning. But, but it's, I don't know,

410
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:46,350
I thought if you did you see the
documentary comedian with Jerry Seinfeld,

411
00:23:46,351 --> 00:23:49,370
but you know the story of the band is
like walking through the snow and they see

412
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:50,930
these families celebrating Christmas.

413
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,520
What do it live like that
and I think there is, there
is just a certain, you know,

414
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:59,210
you have a certain mindset
of I have to be on stage,

415
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,080
but it does get hard and it does get
lonely and so it's nice to find something

416
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:07,220
that allows you a little more
stable lifestyle. And with,

417
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,880
with Ninja warrior, we're really
only shooting about 23 days a year.

418
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:13,760
And so the majority of the
time I can be around La, me,

419
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:18,290
around my girlfriend and we can lead
largely a normal existence and pick and

420
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,550
choose when I go out and for stand up.

421
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:24,550
And so I right now I'm in in in a very
fortunate situation but it could change

422
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:29,570
at any moment so I'm also at the same
time there's always a fire under my ass.

423
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:33,620
That thing of you always
have to be hustling to make
sure to find the next thing

424
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:37,460
because as we've seen, things can
get taken away from you very quickly.

425
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:40,140
You could say something at any
moment that could end your,

426
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,050
so this is one of this.

427
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,520
This sounds really why one of the things
that's most fascinating to me when you

428
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:48,080
make a living with words right now,

429
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,940
one of the things that amazes me is that
the artistic community and comedians in

430
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:57,941
particular haven't been more vocal
in supporting people because again,

431
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:04,060
while I am a clean comic and the shows
I do are completely family friendly and

432
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,470
and I try to be in the middle of the road,

433
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,340
I also know that those people who are
out there on the edges, guys like Doug,

434
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:16,730
Stan hope or Jim Norton,
those who are pushing those envelopes,

435
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,240
they're keeping that area
of speech protected because
once you've seen an area,

436
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,840
once it's taken away. Once we say, okay,
you don't, we can't joke about that.

437
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:30,600
You never get that back.
And to me, it's not that I,

438
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,650
where I feel the power of comedy is,

439
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:38,450
is the power to talk about very difficult,
very touchy subjects in a way,

440
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,340
in a disarming way through humor.

441
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,160
Now I've had rheumatoid
arthritis and I've had cancer,

442
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,910
and when I tell those stories,
I tell them as funny as possible.

443
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,800
Those are stories that you know aren't
necessarily the best stories to tell,

444
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:54,890
but it's amazing what you can
talk about when you use humor.

445
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,040
And when we take some of those
topics off the table for comedy,

446
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,390
I think we really lose an important
tool for us to communicate and for us to

447
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:03,410
find common ground.

448
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:07,330
And that's why it's so amazing to
me as we see this now where there's,

449
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,620
there's this almost this agreement of,
yeah,

450
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:12,980
we're agreeing certain topics now are
no longer, you can't joke about it,

451
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:16,220
or am I am, we're going to go back
and apply it. Retroactive. Yeah.

452
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,630
Well did you see just in the last
couple of weeks that the producers,

453
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,290
a family guy said that they're
not going to do gay jokes anymore.

454
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,800
It's like you guys have done gay.
Everyone has, I mean they're,

455
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:28,720
they're one of their iconic bits.
Was that musical musical.

456
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:33,060
Cotillion musicals, but which one was
it? Everyone has aids. Oh, ever. Yeah.

457
00:26:33,061 --> 00:26:35,630
David's aids. You know where
they, they just kept repeating it.

458
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,300
Seth Macfarlane and again,
it's like,

459
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,950
or every character is a ridiculous
stereotype, right? It's like which groups?

460
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,770
How do we decide which groups we are not
going to make jokes about these really

461
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,460
actually equality is that you,
everyone will make fun of everyone.

462
00:26:49,461 --> 00:26:52,160
That's what real equality. I think
South Park does that better than anyone.

463
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,050
Whether everything is fair game or
nothing is very, now having said that,

464
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,570
if you want to evolve, if
you say, you know what,

465
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,150
I no longer want to tell those jokes,
that's fine.

466
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,630
More power to you make the
choice of your own volition.

467
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,910
Whatever you find funny is great.

468
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,200
Maybe you've had some personal awakened
whatever it is. But I just think,

469
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,940
again, what I don't like is the idea of
people saying you can't joke about it.

470
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,720
Like if you choose not to, great. Again,

471
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:22,410
I choose not to joke about
a lot of things. I've just
not comfortable. You know,

472
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:24,390
I always picture my grandma
in the crowd or my mom.

473
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:27,420
I want people to be entertained. I don't
want to alienate people. That's me.

474
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:31,540
But I love listening to some of the
filthiest comics talk about things and,

475
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,320
or joke about cancer or things
that have impacted me. And,

476
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,560
and I find it hilarious and I find
it Cathartic to laugh about it.

477
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,650
And I think because someone else doesn't,
you know,

478
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:42,060
may have had a bad experience with it,

479
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:46,860
doesn't mean that someone shouldn't
be able to joke about it. Um, I,

480
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:51,870
I just think that this is
a really interesting time
because social media gives

481
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,680
voice to people and we see where one
or two people protesting can change a

482
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:00,270
network.
And that's what's,

483
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:05,150
what's remarkable is that as we really
don't see these networks saying, you know,

484
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,330
99% of people may not care.
They came to this smaller percentage.

485
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,930
And again, often it'd be nice
for them to say, okay boycott,

486
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,100
we stand behind our performers. We
stand behind this content. Yeah.

487
00:28:17,101 --> 00:28:19,250
So it's a weird time to
be a comic. I mean, so I,

488
00:28:19,251 --> 00:28:22,140
I did stand up for 12 years in New York,
then I came here, I started doing this,

489
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:24,060
I was doing something else that I liked.
I stopped doing it.

490
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:25,820
This can be even more
dangerous though day.

491
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,240
So now I started again in June and
now I'm selling out clubs all over the

492
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,700
country and I don't care that much.

493
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,700
So I'm having the most fun
I've ever had on stage.

494
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,750
I do an hour and I'm messing
around with the crowd.

495
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:39,930
And how did you have people coming out
to see you? [inaudible] is the best.

496
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:43,050
So that way, that's a game changer
because when people come out and they,

497
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:45,390
you know, they're there for you,
they know something about you,

498
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:48,840
you can do insight or stuff as opposed
to just being the eighth white guy at a

499
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:51,360
12th comics and they're like, who
the hell? That guy was hilarious.

500
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:54,630
What was the name of, you know, and
then, and then that's it. But, um,

501
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:58,530
but it's an odd time to be doing stand
up knowing that people could be in the

502
00:28:58,531 --> 00:29:02,850
crowd recording you waiting to take
you down. And they are, and you know,

503
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:05,820
and that's the workshop that that's,
you know, that's not where you're,

504
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:09,000
that's what you're learning the medicine
where you're performing the surgery.

505
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,270
It is. And, and, and no
other, you know, Jim Norton,

506
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,320
I give so much credit for,
for talking about, um,

507
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,320
how comics are held to a different
standard than any other artists.

508
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,490
So say you're an actor and you go on
Svu and you play the most reprehensible

509
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:27,660
character. Nobody believes that
you are that person. Right?

510
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:28,890
But as a comedian,

511
00:29:28,891 --> 00:29:32,510
what they don't understand is sometimes
you will say something hyperbolic.

512
00:29:32,511 --> 00:29:34,530
You will say something
ironically to make a point.

513
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,250
It's not what you actually believe,
but because it's Dave Ruben saying it,

514
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,070
they take you literally going, wait,
you missed the entire of the joke.

515
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,310
You missed the Joe Guy.
My point was the exact opposite.

516
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:47,200
But nobody will give you
the credit for the context.

517
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:51,070
And people often just see the written
words and it's, it's really unfortunate.

518
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:53,970
And, and, and again, what
people don't understand, and,

519
00:29:53,971 --> 00:29:58,000
and Jim was just talking about this with
Judd Apatow in the case of Louis C K is

520
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,860
jokes don't spring fully formed.
Jokes can take weeks, months,

521
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,410
years to be honed.
It's so hard,

522
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:10,470
especially if it's a topic that is
delicate to find the phrasing and to say,

523
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:14,730
I'm going to tackle a subject that nobody
thinks I can make funny and I'm going

524
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:15,610
to find a way to make it funny.

525
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,250
It's going to take me awhile and I'm
going to stumble through and I'm going to

526
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:21,490
get some groans and I can get
some people alienated. Not me.

527
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,880
I talk about various, you know,
ridiculous things. But yeah,

528
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,250
I appreciate those comments.
Who can go there and say,

529
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:30,280
take a subject that I would say,
I will never laugh at this.

530
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,590
You made me laugh at this.
Despite that,

531
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:35,950
then I think Doug Stanhope is one of the
best examples of someone who will take

532
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:40,951
the most taboo subjects and make you
laugh despite you might be vehemently

533
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:47,110
opposed to the way he thinks,
but he's funny. Yeah. And
when you do that, there's,

534
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:52,090
it's such a way of opening up your
mind to saying, okay, let me, let me,

535
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,220
let me rethink these things.
Or maybe it doesn't, but it,

536
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:59,710
but it just proves that I think anything
can be funny. Anything can be fair game.

537
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:04,711
And I think it's important that we allow
comedians to have this full range of

538
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:07,810
words and emotions to use because that's,

539
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,820
we're talking about the human condition.

540
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:14,590
And I think comedians really do have a
great job in that we can bring up some of

541
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:18,730
these topics in a way that, you know,
when you see it happen on Tucker Carlson,

542
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:20,020
people might go to fisticuffs,

543
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:24,250
but in the comedy club you'll laugh
about it and go, you know what? Maybe,

544
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,980
maybe my crazy uncles, not so
crazy. Maybe we can talk. Yeah,

545
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,770
well that's why it's so strange that
I'm doing this because I feel like they

546
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:32,140
dragged me into it because
I've seen a lot of comics who,

547
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:37,090
I love that if become the word police,
they've become the hysterical. Right?

548
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:41,500
Who on Twitter who are calling for books
not to be printed and all of this stuff.

549
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,590
[inaudible] I always think it's
like, man, if Karlyn was alive,

550
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,830
what would he be doing? Right, right.
He'd be making funny shit. Patrice O'neil,

551
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:51,910
same guy or, or, or would he be
demanding that people be booted off?

552
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:55,510
Platforms are silenced or otherwise and
it's like what a strange place for an

553
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:57,940
artist.
And you see eventually it consumes them.

554
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,380
Eventually it comes back to bite
them because nobody is perfect.

555
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,910
Nobody, nobody is without a
flaw. Nobody's without, you know,

556
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:11,480
having nobody has led their
lives. Like, Jesus, we,

557
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,890
we've all done something or said something
or tried to make a joke that at some

558
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:18,400
point if you went back people would say
that's wrong and you'd be like, okay,

559
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:22,750
but that was 10 years ago or any,
it is an odd time.

560
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,960
I think that that people
aren't particularly,

561
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:30,961
comedians aren't more supportive instead
are really leading this book burning

562
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:36,040
charge. Well that's why this,
this uh, family guy thing
irked me so much. It's like,

563
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,800
you guys did this for 20 years.
I'm not even mad.

564
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,650
I don't know if sets even
that in front of the,

565
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:41,840
I don't even know if he's that
much involved in the show anymore,

566
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:45,050
but like it's like you did this for 20
years and now it's like you're on the

567
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:47,810
other side of success
kind of. So like, are you,

568
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:51,110
are we a more tolerant society because
we're not going to joke about certain

569
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:53,870
people now. Does that make us
more tolerant? I like that.

570
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,150
It's interesting is odd to me.
You know, it's really, it's a,

571
00:32:57,151 --> 00:32:59,540
it's a funny thing where, and I'd love
to have him here and that's not even a,

572
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,760
it's really about a judgment on him. I
just want to deal with this shit. Right?

573
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:07,370
Why this and then what about what other
topics? Right? So it's like, okay,

574
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:10,010
so you can't make fun of gays. Like
should we get the, where's the list?

575
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,620
Where's the list loans? That
list, who owns who judges it,
who's, you know, and, and,

576
00:33:14,621 --> 00:33:18,920
and, and that list is shifting. And what's
crazy is, you see, it's not the joke,

577
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,860
it's who says it. Yeah. Because
you know the same person,

578
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,580
two people can say the same joke.
One person gets celebrated,

579
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:29,070
one person gets vilified. So it's not
the words, it's who's saying that?

580
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,640
And that's wrong. Like it should
be. Absolutely. It should be.

581
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,390
Either this is a fair game or not.

582
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:39,230
It shouldn't be based on what we're
getting to is, you know, papers please,

583
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,530
you have to have the papers to
prove that you are of this group.

584
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,000
So you can talk about this topic.

585
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,510
And it's like either the topic is fair
game where it's not either everyone can

586
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:50,450
talk about it. Uh, that's what
I believe. But again, you know,

587
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,860
I realize I'm, I'm, I'm the
white male, so I, I, you know,

588
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:59,660
I also am, oh wait, listen,
I don't know. Oh No,

589
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,110
wait, what? I've been with you this whole
time. Why should you shut up and listen,

590
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,423
I always,

591
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,140
you're doing that with a little tongue
in cheek is I always feel the need.

592
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,180
This is one of the what I hate
that. Oh, now you're doing it.

593
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,040
You're going to fill in the details,
your coffee,

594
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:19,130
you feel they need tissue caveats where
you feel the need to say I, you know,

595
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:23,480
I, I don't like, uh, homophobia,

596
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,920
but I think family guy can make
jokes who unit where it's like,

597
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:29,180
of course now you know,

598
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:32,600
where you normally would assume
that's the concession you're making.

599
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,570
Just cause you're a good person.
I think I used to do a lot of that too.

600
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:37,590
And now I'm just sort of
over. It's like, well,

601
00:34:37,591 --> 00:34:41,570
it's because you own your platform and
I see might be watching this. So, right.

602
00:34:41,571 --> 00:34:43,310
But nothing,
you've said he's homophobic.

603
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:44,980
Obviously we're talking
about the nature jokes or,

604
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,360
or that they don't want to Apu
and the Simpsons anymore. Well,

605
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,720
you see it's craziness.

606
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,490
What I don't like also was the guilt
by association where, you know,

607
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:55,640
I thought Mike Rowe said that someone
was criticizing micro for going on,

608
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,460
I don't know, rush Limbaugh and
then Rachel Maddow, you know,

609
00:34:58,461 --> 00:35:00,560
and people were complaining on both sides.
He's like,

610
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:05,270
going on a show doesn't mean I implicitly
endorse every single stance that

611
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:08,540
person has.
It means I'm talking to somebody,

612
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,660
I'm expressing my opinions.
They may have different opinions.

613
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,830
It's a discussion and I just wish we
would allow more of that because otherwise

614
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,460
all you're saying is people I approve
of talking to people I approve of.

615
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,280
So all you're hearing is
what you want to hear. Yeah.

616
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,260
I think that's what we miss is reasoned
people having reason discussions.

617
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:31,160
Unfortunately, when you turn
on the TV, we know hyperbole,

618
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:35,300
hyperbole moves the needle. I, you
know, yeah, it's an amazing run,

619
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:38,650
but at least it's not, you know,
politically and, and you see that light.

620
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:42,530
I think that's, it's a,
you know, I, I, and I,

621
00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:45,240
I told you before I give you
full credit what I love is,

622
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,800
and Joe Rogan does the same thing.

623
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:50,790
I think you guys are willing to have
people on you might disagree with and

624
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:53,340
you're not looking for a gotcha moment.
You're not looking for confrontation.

625
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:56,940
You're looking for understanding,
like, help me understand your position.

626
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,720
Let me help you understand my position.
Maybe there's agreement,

627
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:04,330
maybe there isn't. But for the listeners,
at least they're being informed. There's,

628
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,570
they're hearing different points of view.

629
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,660
Does it strike you as odd that
that seems so unique these days?

630
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:12,870
Like I've had people in here, I think
people don't seek it out. Yeah. I think,

631
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,770
you know, and I think, um, I, I, you
know, we look at the universities,

632
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:20,280
we look at places where I think
people are taught, you know,

633
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,930
diversity of thought or a
different thought that there,

634
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,120
that there is one right daughter that
you shouldn't have these discussions.

635
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:31,100
And I think that's, you know,
we've always, I mean I look at,

636
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:34,970
I look at medicine and, and it's, it's
so amazing how medicine, you know,

637
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,710
you think you deal in absolutes,
you think you deal in complete science,

638
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:41,130
black and white, but we see a
new study talked about sunscreen,

639
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:44,640
how actually sunscreen may
not be healthy because we,

640
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,830
the rally is melanoma,
which is completely devil,

641
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,640
only about 1% of skin
cancers and it is awful,

642
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,620
but people are putting
so much sunscreen on,

643
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:55,020
they're not getting any of
the beneficial vitamin D.

644
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,510
We're seeing an increase
in cardiac disease.

645
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,180
Cardiac disease is killing so
many more people than melanoma.

646
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:05,070
So now dermatologists are thinking
maybe we shouldn't be wearing as much

647
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:05,850
sunscreen.

648
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:10,850
So you see these truths that we thought
were absolute being challenged because

649
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,480
people look at the data,

650
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:15,750
they look at empirical things
when it comes to life and death.

651
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:18,540
We're able to do that when
it comes to political topics,

652
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:19,830
which are just as important.

653
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:23,400
I think it's much harder to do it because
they're so politically charged that

654
00:37:23,401 --> 00:37:24,560
people don't want to look at the data.

655
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,020
They want to look at how they feel about
them or are these emotions are what it

656
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:28,501
stirs up.

657
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:33,090
And if someone presents a counterargument
you're dismissed or debunked or d

658
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:37,740
platform. Yeah. What do you consider
yourself politically? I think I'm,

659
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:42,030
I'm a little more, you know,
I, I am Vietnam free speech.

660
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:46,530
I am vehemently, people should live their
lives the way they want to live them.

661
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,090
Um, I think I'm moderate
to right. Would, would,

662
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:54,870
would probably be it.
I don't like the government taxing us to,

663
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:57,810
and I don't think the government is great
at a lot of things like health care.

664
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,480
Um, but at the same time, you know,

665
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,350
really audio function in
Hollywood with the set of ideas.

666
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:09,351
And here's the other thing is I tend
not to talk politics because it isn't my

667
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,490
purview. Might like I'm an entertainer
and I'm the last person. They,

668
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,500
people are getting their political
opinions from the host of American Ninja

669
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,420
Warrior. I think, again, I
think for me, I what I like is,

670
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,250
you know, for me, I never
talked politics on stage.

671
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:29,520
I never, you know, I would
rather bring people together.

672
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:33,360
I'm not looking to alienate people
or, or try to be clever. It's,

673
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,930
I think that's, I leave to Lewis Black or
guys who are very good at that. That's,

674
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,640
that's her area to tackle the political
humor. That's just not my thing. Um,

675
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,840
I, I think I, again, I
just think in Hollywood,

676
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:49,840
the one thing I think
that is so important is,

677
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,030
is the exchange of ideas.

678
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,240
And that's what I think is
being compromised right now.

679
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:58,930
And that's the thing that I try to,
um,

680
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,620
the year that I really want people
to, to fight for. Because again,

681
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,850
once we see that ground, we're
not getting it back. All right,

682
00:39:06,851 --> 00:39:08,480
so let's shift to this binge.

683
00:39:08,481 --> 00:39:12,570
You're warring warrior warrior for
something they love. When you say that it,

684
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:15,720
so it started out as a joke. It
actually, and you can hear I'm hoarse. I,

685
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:20,350
I am a very loud adds a little
something. Well, so this, this was,

686
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:24,340
I was in hosting the Arlo pro strongman
world series and Santa Monica,

687
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:28,240
so it was five hours nonstop of,
Oh look at him lifting this weight.

688
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,900
And when I went into the show,
uh, so for those who don't know,

689
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,070
American American Ninja Warrior
started out, it's a, it's a,

690
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:37,720
it was a Japanese show, Saas Gay. It
was poured into America and dubbed.

691
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,190
It started doing so well on g four.

692
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:42,190
They made an American
version in the second season.

693
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:43,840
They realized they had something
and they're like, okay,

694
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,540
we're going to put some money into this
and we're bringing in the new host.

695
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:49,600
And they found me and I think
they were looking for a Joe Rogan.

696
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:51,490
There's some bigger guys,
but I don't care. You know,

697
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:54,700
it's like the lights come up at 2:00 AM
in the morning and then like the pretty

698
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:58,180
girl goes, all right, I'll go home with
you. I might've been your last choice.

699
00:39:58,181 --> 00:40:01,180
I'm just happy to be here.
Rogan's got enough stuff.

700
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:05,110
So I started doing this show and um,
you know,

701
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,920
we would be going for eight or nine hours
a day calling me runs and it's all 10

702
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:11,760
out of 10 because it was based
on the Japanese show. And so my,

703
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:16,390
my sports calling technique comes
just from years of watching sports,

704
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:19,810
watching the Japanese show and being
an enthusiastic, I am always yeah,

705
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:20,644
hyperbolic.

706
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,310
But it was really straining on the voice
since we were shooting these ins and

707
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:27,430
outs where it's coming up next on
American Ninja Warrior and I was a little

708
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:30,820
gravelly in the, and so I was kind
of making a point like, hey my,

709
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,990
my voice is kind of shot.

710
00:40:31,991 --> 00:40:35,800
So I was like American Ninja Warrior and
the petitioner was like, Oh, do that,

711
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,930
do more of that.
So this is like in the fourth year,

712
00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:41,690
if you watch the earlier seasons
I'm like, uh, next on American name.

713
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,860
I can't even do it cause I'm rally.
There was, it was none of that.

714
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:48,430
So it was just kind of born out of blowing
out my voice and now it's become like

715
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:51,540
the signature thing that I love
to do anything for your voice. I,

716
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,560
a lot of my friends who are still had
gone to a lot of voice coaches and tried

717
00:40:56,711 --> 00:41:00,310
to, obviously they really
were so effective. It's um,

718
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,870
but I mean even on the
medical side of things,

719
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:03,800
just to make sure you're not
blowing out your book, you know,

720
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,580
I see an ENT on a regular basis.
I'll do,

721
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:10,930
so we'll go to Vegas and we'll do six
out of seven days where we're shooting at

722
00:41:10,931 --> 00:41:14,320
night, but it's still a hundred
degrees in dust for, you know,

723
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,170
eight hours in a row, 10
out of 10 energy. And those,

724
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:21,040
I'll do ivs and anti inflammatories and
steroids just to try to maintain the

725
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:25,670
vocal cords in vocal rest. Um,
but I, you know, you, you, I'm,

726
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:28,180
I'm going back trying to
learn better technique. It's,

727
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:32,050
it's almost like rock singers. I look
at Brian Johnson from ACDC who was like,

728
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:32,884
you know,

729
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,430
that guy was doing it at 70
the most vocally taxing way.

730
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:39,590
So that's one of the things is,

731
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:43,940
is trying to learn how to preserve
the voice to work for that long.

732
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,300
Speaking of rock stars,

733
00:41:45,301 --> 00:41:48,690
I saw this morning that you tweeted
something about Steve Perry from journey.

734
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:53,880
Now I love journey, love, love, love you.
You're my favorite band in the world.

735
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,790
I love Steve Perry. I love the
fact that he's back now. Cause he,

736
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,430
cause he had had some voice stuff
actually. Speaking of guys. Yeah. He,

737
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,080
I mean he basically lost
his voice for a while.

738
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,510
I can't say this completely on camera.

739
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:08,930
Suffice to say he kind of lives near
here and I may remain and I know the

740
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:12,570
Mexican joint that he goes to. So, uh,

741
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,570
so today we're going
to pull people to this.

742
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,080
Not Iceland's birthday it Steve Perry's
birth. They say Terri's birthday.

743
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:23,710
So Steve Birthday and I'm not, I'm
not lying. So for my thready Edward,

744
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,560
they never met him. Yeah. For I,

745
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,280
I've been a journey fan
since I can remember. And,

746
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:34,420
and I,
for my 30th birthday at the Brown Derby,

747
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,880
the last night of the Brown Derby,
we closed it down.

748
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:40,390
I hired a journey cover band and I
had them play it and I still have this

749
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:45,160
fantasy that someday on my birthday I'm
going to be singing faithfully or don't

750
00:42:45,161 --> 00:42:45,910
stop believing in.

751
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,460
All of a sudden another guy's gonna
walk out behind me and it's going to be

752
00:42:48,461 --> 00:42:52,970
Steve Perry and we're going to do a
duet together and arm and arm to singing

753
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:56,770
like faithfully at the end.
Yeah. That's my family. Steve,

754
00:42:56,771 --> 00:43:01,240
if you're watching how your, I hope he's
a huge fan of Ninja warrior cause he,

755
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:05,960
I just listened to that voice. Yeah. I
think he had one of the most unique, yeah.

756
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,390
And Arnelle Pinatas. Remarkable
story. It's an incredible story,

757
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:15,130
but you listen to Steve and you listen
to the passion and the range and just the

758
00:43:15,131 --> 00:43:19,240
unique notes that guy would hit.
It was incredible. I, I'm just,

759
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:22,030
I love journey.
I loved their songs.

760
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:26,860
I love the eighties I love the unabashed
passion and, and, and, and glory.

761
00:43:26,861 --> 00:43:29,830
There's no cynicism in it.
It just awesome. Every,

762
00:43:29,831 --> 00:43:32,500
every time I do stand up now or when I
do like a public speaking thing and the,

763
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,240
but you know, right before you start,
they go, well, what's going on,

764
00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:35,074
do you want to go up to,

765
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:39,040
and the only thing that always pops
into my mind is separate ways by journey

766
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:40,830
that, that beginning, oh my God,

767
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,130
that video when they're playing the
keyboard on the wall, so much power,

768
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,990
so much power close chains that
by, I mean it's just, you know,

769
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,510
yeah. You don't stop believing
or any way you wanted it.

770
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,030
And they have so many great
songs that when you just hear it,

771
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:56,340
they're just toe tappers. And
I mean, granted, you know,

772
00:43:56,341 --> 00:43:58,870
if you grew up in the 80s it was
the soundtrack of our youth. So,

773
00:43:58,871 --> 00:44:03,810
so much of it takes us back to
there. But um, Steve Perry is just a,

774
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,440
he's one of, he's been one of
the, one of the great artists,

775
00:44:07,441 --> 00:44:09,690
I think what journey has done and,
and I would love,

776
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:13,890
I saw them up in San Francisco and
show Schoen was shutting him out.

777
00:44:13,891 --> 00:44:17,790
And I thought, I wonder if Steve's
going to come out on stage for the,

778
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,470
for the long of they didn't have,
yeah,

779
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:23,730
well they just got inducted to the
rock and yeah, I, it's, you know,

780
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:28,080
a lot of bad blood to I think
get over, but, but yeah. Anyway,

781
00:44:28,081 --> 00:44:32,640
that's a sidebar for a side.
Let's get back to that Ninja
thing. Um, so like what,

782
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,750
like what's some of some sort of insider
something that you can give us about

783
00:44:36,751 --> 00:44:40,560
what these guys are like that, that are
doing this of, you know, it's, it's a,

784
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:41,610
what you see is what the,

785
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,500
the amazing thing is they
really are the people you see.

786
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,220
They are these people who are incredibly
hardworking and so generous and

787
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:54,360
supportive of one another. We had, um,

788
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,800
a woman Maggie Thorn and she was,
she was open about that.

789
00:44:56,801 --> 00:45:00,270
She was going through a really tough
divorce and she has three little girls.

790
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:04,770
And uh, during that time she started
traveling around the country,

791
00:45:04,771 --> 00:45:08,340
visiting her Ninja sisters
as she called them,

792
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:12,030
people like Barclays Docket and Jessie
Flexible breadcrumb Michelle warranty.

793
00:45:12,031 --> 00:45:16,850
And she just talked about how had
she not had this community, she,

794
00:45:16,851 --> 00:45:19,650
she wasn't sure what she
would've done to get through it.

795
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:24,390
And you see it's been unlike
any other sport. I mean a,
we've only had one winner,

796
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,270
intense seasons. Like what
other show? Like I talked about,

797
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:30,330
like at the end of America's got talent,
you know, they'd come out and go,

798
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:34,140
well it turns out America doesn't
have talent there. And yet, you know,

799
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:38,160
it's a show where every single person
who's competing on the show has fallen at

800
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:41,100
one point. So it's a show that would
seem to be filled with failure.

801
00:45:41,101 --> 00:45:45,030
And yet when you watch it, you feel like
you're seeing more success than ever.

802
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:46,320
And I think we've,

803
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:51,530
we've stumbled into a formula where
you see it's these are really everyday.

804
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,230
They're truly everyday people. They're
us. They are people who have jobs,

805
00:45:58,231 --> 00:46:03,231
have families who've dealt with substance
abuse or cancer or the loss of a loved

806
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:07,350
one, whatever it is, loss of a job
and yet are trying to work through it.

807
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,580
And you see the obstacle courses,

808
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:12,440
just a metaphor for the obstacles
they've overcome in life. And you know,

809
00:46:12,441 --> 00:46:14,430
we tell the,
the thing we do,

810
00:46:14,431 --> 00:46:18,300
I think better than most shows is in
90 seconds we give you a reason to care

811
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:20,160
about these people and then we show you,

812
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:24,600
we let you cheer for them and it's
the Olympic formula of, I don't give,

813
00:46:24,601 --> 00:46:27,930
I don't care about curling,
but you told me this guy works at ups.

814
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,840
He's got a new baby on the way and
it's like a Bruce Springsteen song.

815
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:33,400
Then when he's up there breast
and I'm like, Ooh, go buddy.

816
00:46:33,401 --> 00:46:36,710
You Go Flynn's Jurgen
from Norway where you,

817
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,240
you just find yourself cheering
for him and I think it's this,

818
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,960
it's this thing of one of the
things I love, I love doing the,

819
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:46,260
like the strong man competition or
Ninja or I work with Travis Pastrana,

820
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,094
this evil thing.

821
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,480
I love watching people push the envelope
or do things they didn't think they

822
00:46:51,481 --> 00:46:55,190
could do. I love people seeing people
have their moment because they,

823
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:58,740
one of the things in life
that helps define you,

824
00:46:58,741 --> 00:47:02,400
that helps give you the confidence
is to have a Superbowl moment,

825
00:47:02,401 --> 00:47:06,630
to have to have a moment where you, you,
when you're victorious in something,

826
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:09,780
whether it's you get a job or you
get a promotion or you, you know,

827
00:47:09,781 --> 00:47:12,120
you literally win a
game or whatever it is.

828
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,430
When you have a moment
where you've worked so hard,

829
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:18,630
you overcame the obstacles and you've
got that moment where you're, you're,

830
00:47:18,631 --> 00:47:21,660
you get the trophy,
you get that feeling of wow,

831
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,270
the hard work pays off
and to have those moments,

832
00:47:24,271 --> 00:47:27,330
and I think Ninja Warrior is filled
with that and for so many of the people,

833
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:29,530
it's not about getting to the
end and winning the money.

834
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,860
It's getting on the course for,
we had a girl, Daniela Bright,

835
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:37,720
I think it was season six, I was live
tweeting the show and she said, you know,

836
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,390
if I ever get out of bed, I'd love to be
on the show. I'm like, why are you in bed?

837
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:40,691
She's like,
well,

838
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:44,740
I have stage three breast cancer and
I'm not sure how it's gonna turn out.

839
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,470
And so I sent her a tee shirt and I said,
well,

840
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:52,450
we'll be here waiting for you the
next year. Wow. She's on the course.

841
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:56,140
She goes out on the first obstacle and
comes out with the biggest smile on her

842
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:59,980
face. And, and you know, our sideline
reporter was like, how are you feeling?

843
00:47:59,981 --> 00:48:03,760
She goes, I won. Yeah, I'm here.

844
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:08,470
I feel amazing. And to see
that, to see someone, you know,

845
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:12,910
what a perspective on life when we so
often get caught up and I did the Patriots

846
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:14,110
win, or who cares, you know,

847
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:17,770
those are real battles that these people
are having that we're all gonna face.

848
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:21,040
They're all going to be touched
by. And to remember that, you know,

849
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:24,310
in the face of those you can still
struggle and overcome and find your little

850
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:24,940
victories.

851
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:28,030
I think that's the message of Ninja
where and why the show's resonated.

852
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:32,140
What do you make of the fact that Ninja
Warrior or what Rogan's doing with MMA,

853
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:37,090
like people doing physical things
seems to be actually like cool. Again,

854
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,780
I think it's, it's, it's, you know, it's a
primitive part of us. It's the gladiators.

855
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:42,980
It's, it's, it's also, you know,

856
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:46,510
particularly as we get more and more
static as we sit around on our phones,

857
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:51,520
we miss that. You miss that as a kid. You
miss playing. You miss that feeling of,

858
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:55,630
one of the things that I know rheumatoid
arthritis took away from me was my

859
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:57,100
sense of physical wellbeing.

860
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,520
That ability to spring out of bed and
feel like you could run around and run for

861
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:03,280
hours and, and it's, it's,

862
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:08,790
it's that idea of to see people achieving
something physically at a high level

863
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:13,540
inspires you and makes you feel motivated.
I think that that is possible.

864
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:16,060
Especially, you know, MMA or NFL,

865
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:21,550
we love watching exceptional performances
with Ninja. What I think the appeal is,

866
00:49:21,551 --> 00:49:23,080
is the idea of that could be me,

867
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:27,930
maybe I have a chance
to turn this around and,

868
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,170
and get back in shape one last time and
do something amazing. And I think that's,

869
00:49:32,171 --> 00:49:35,080
you know, we're, we're looking for
inspiration. We're looking for hope.

870
00:49:35,081 --> 00:49:39,250
I think that's part of humanity is
we want to, we want to be inspired.

871
00:49:39,251 --> 00:49:40,990
We want to find that spark and,

872
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,660
and wake up and feel like
there's hope in the world.

873
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:48,070
And that's why I love doing what I do.
I love, you know, with Ninja Warrior,

874
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:51,910
with my comedy, I want to, I want people
to leave feeling better. Um, uh, you know,

875
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:55,030
again, Love Stan, hope,
love, Arusha, fair love.

876
00:49:55,031 --> 00:49:59,740
Those guys who can tear a crowd
apart. Love it. I can't do it.

877
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:03,940
I suck out. I've tried doing roasts,
I bombed, I'm so bad. I was just like,

878
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,400
I'm sorry. I don't know how to
install you to your face or a socket.

879
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,700
This make fun of me. And you
know, it's, it's just, it's,

880
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:15,750
I think that's part of kind of finding
authentically where you are and what,

881
00:50:15,851 --> 00:50:17,770
what resonates with you and
where you're comfortable.

882
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:21,580
And that's one of the things know we
talk about people hear this in comedy,

883
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:24,640
finding your voice, who you are
and what you're comfortable with.

884
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:28,280
And that is one of the hardest things
to do because so often we emulate those,

885
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:32,090
we respect, but that's not us. You
really have to dig inside and say,

886
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:35,870
where do I live? What's my sense of
humor? And Gary Gulman right now,

887
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:40,220
if you're a comedian or even if
you're just interested in expression,

888
00:50:40,221 --> 00:50:44,090
Gary Gulman is putting on a clinic since
January 1st he's been putting out a

889
00:50:44,091 --> 00:50:46,820
writing tip every day
and they'd been gold.

890
00:50:46,821 --> 00:50:51,770
And one of the best was he put out Ralph
Waldo Emerson's essay on self reliance

891
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,240
and it talked about,

892
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,930
so often we see our thoughts reflected
in someone else and think they're genius.

893
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,200
But when it comes through us,
we dismissed them because it's ours.

894
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:04,400
We think it's common and it's like
trust yourself, trust that your enough.

895
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,140
It's you know,
then paraphrasing here.

896
00:51:06,141 --> 00:51:08,630
But I thought it was just such a
good for someone who's creative.

897
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:10,160
So often you think of something like,
oh,

898
00:51:10,161 --> 00:51:13,460
that's not as funny as what Patrice
would've said if George Carlin would have

899
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:14,480
said.
But it's like no,

900
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:18,620
trust your way and you're on the
path and just keep developing it.

901
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,690
So before we wrap up,
you mentioned,

902
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:23,650
so you mentioned that you had cancer
and you have rheumatoid. Yeah,

903
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:27,410
that's the thing. You can't really, right.
It's no cure yet. You control basically.

904
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,880
Um, no. Let's just talk a little bit about
dealing with some serious health stuff.

905
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:33,930
Cause someone, yeah, the
average person watching this,

906
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:37,760
looking at you like you're jack than
you and you look healthy and all those

907
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,910
things, but you've, you've lived through,
it's about it and you talk about it. Yeah.

908
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:42,950
Well, you know, and that was
one of the things. So, you know,

909
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:47,860
having been a doctor or as my dad points
are, you're still a doctor champ. Um,

910
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:50,840
[inaudible] when I was diagnosed
with rheumatoid arthritis,

911
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,730
I found out what it's
like to be a patient.

912
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,360
And you go online and you look things up,

913
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,220
you see the worst case scenario because
that's the textbook they show you,

914
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:01,551
you know,

915
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:06,500
the typically deformed joints and you
think this is my future and it gives you

916
00:52:06,501 --> 00:52:07,430
this sinking feeling.

917
00:52:07,431 --> 00:52:11,270
And I realized that's why I was so
important for me to be out there,

918
00:52:11,271 --> 00:52:14,720
visible telling my story. Um,
so that people would see there,

919
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,230
there there's alternatives.
You know,

920
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:21,260
not everyone living with the
disease is destroyed by it.

921
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:22,670
We have incredible new treatments.

922
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:28,180
And just the other day I got a call from
someone who I'd been baseball with in

923
00:52:28,371 --> 00:52:32,570
college, a new, and, uh, he
thought he had ra and he was just,

924
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:35,450
he was petrified and it was so,
and he's like,

925
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:40,340
I was just googling it and I found out,
he's like, I didn't know you had it.

926
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:43,310
I just googled it and found you had
it because you'd talked about it.

927
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:45,350
And I thought, Oh, you
know, that's why I tell it.

928
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:48,650
So that this person who called me up
and I could tell my story and say, look,

929
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:51,860
there's hope. There's treatments.
Don't worry about this. You know,

930
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:54,530
whatever it is you're facing.
They're incredible treatments out there.

931
00:52:54,531 --> 00:52:57,440
And that's why I went on celebrity
apprentice. That was my charity.

932
00:52:57,441 --> 00:53:00,020
We raised $1 million
to help with research.

933
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:04,010
And so it's, um, look, I,

934
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,490
I would much prefer not to
have rheumatoid arthritis.

935
00:53:07,491 --> 00:53:11,000
And what level of pain are you going
through when you realized? So it started,

936
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:15,950
it started with pain in my hand. And um,
it just, it's for those who don't know,

937
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:20,720
Ra essentially is an autoimmune disease
where my body attacks my joints and the

938
00:53:20,721 --> 00:53:24,710
immune system erodes the joints and
causes joint destruction, inflammation,

939
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:29,250
and can impact the Oregons, the stiffness
in the back and neck. And, and, uh,

940
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:31,530
so I went from, you know, being,

941
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:36,870
working out five or six days a week
to not working out at all. I had, um,

942
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:41,400
my feet were in pain where I was wearing
clogs and limping. I couldn't sleep.

943
00:53:41,401 --> 00:53:45,480
I was sleeping like 14 hours, but I was
always exhausted. I gained 55 pounds.

944
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:50,190
I felt like a shell of a man.
I, I, I was physically ruined.

945
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:54,120
And then it took 18 months to get the
diagnosis and I was going to doctors.

946
00:53:54,121 --> 00:53:57,750
I was having blood work. It just took
that long for the blood work to convert.

947
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:01,320
And when I started the treatment,
I got my life back. Um,

948
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:05,460
and I didn't realize how sick
I was and not just physically,

949
00:54:05,461 --> 00:54:08,400
but emotionally how drained I was.

950
00:54:08,401 --> 00:54:12,420
And the thing that kept me going
was comedy, was that, you know,

951
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,250
the thing that I would get out of bed for,

952
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:18,390
the thing that would motivate me was to
go out and laugh and to realize Norman

953
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:21,780
cousins was right. Like the
Catharsis of laughter and how, how,

954
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,890
how good those endorphins
are, how important it is. Um,

955
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:29,430
I can't overstate it and that's one of
the things I've talked about is, you know,

956
00:54:29,431 --> 00:54:33,810
for people who are sick is taught telling
your story because so often people

957
00:54:33,811 --> 00:54:37,350
with the disease field defined by their
disease and one of the things I've done

958
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:41,220
is tried to make my stories what I talk
about, rheumatoid arthritis or cancer.

959
00:54:41,221 --> 00:54:42,090
I want people to laugh.

960
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,380
I'm going to move me to laugh
about it because if they do,

961
00:54:46,381 --> 00:54:50,130
they know I'm okay with it and I am
okay with it. Like cancer, I'm 10 years,

962
00:54:50,131 --> 00:54:52,470
I'm cured in the Ra, I've
made my peace with it. I'm,

963
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:57,180
I'm doing well on my medications and
I'm living the best life I can with it.

964
00:54:57,181 --> 00:54:59,760
So people take their cues from you.

00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:02,700
So teaching people how to tell
their story because so many people,

966
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,740
when they tell a story of illness,

967
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:08,910
they feel they can see PT and people's
eyes and that they may not want that.

968
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:10,400
But it's hard to,

969
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,290
to learn how to tell your story in
a way that says I'm okay with it.

970
00:55:13,291 --> 00:55:15,720
And that's one of the things I've been
working on is trying to figure out how to

971
00:55:15,721 --> 00:55:17,250
help people take,

972
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:21,450
take charge over their disease by doing
what you can control is how you tell

973
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:25,450
your story and trying to use, for me
it's humor, but for whatever they're,

974
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:30,270
there are so many tools, uh, for people
who are dealing with chronic illness,

975
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:33,540
um, to try to make it, you know,

976
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:38,240
don't let it define your life because
it's very easy and it's very easy to,

977
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:43,290
to fall into the victim, you know,
and feeling sad for yourself.

978
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:44,790
That'd be a shame if you did that.

979
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:48,810
Wilford Brimley you might have diabetes
feel sorry for yourself. You don't,

980
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,100
all right, so do what makes you happy.
That's how we started this thing.

981
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:56,150
Live the best life that you can.
That's how we're going to do,

982
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:59,010
and I think you're doing it today,
so I appreciate you having me on.

983
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,140
Right on that. It's been a pleasure
chatting with you. Thank you.

984
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:03,810
