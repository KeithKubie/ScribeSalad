00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.400
There are some crazy ideas for spacecraft
propulsion out there, but tops among them

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.790
must be the idea to power an interstellar
craft with a black hole.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.940
Wait it gets crazier.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.990
The black hole is made of light.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.929
Yes, that’s right, a black hole, which is
a region in space where the gravity is so

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:23.169
strong that, all together now: “not even
light can escape,” very good, can itself

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:24.669
be made from light.

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.279
Theoretically, of course.

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.539
The black holes you’re probably used to
are made of matter, and lots of it.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.150
Stellar mass black holes usually form after
giant stars go supernova and leave a core

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.150
behind.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.860
If that core is more than about three times
as massive as our entire sun, give or take

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.000
half a sun, its own gravity will crush the
entire thing down to a single point, forming

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.070
a black hole.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.770
However, because of Einstein’s equation
E=mc2 we know that mass and energy are related.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.820
It’s right there; energy equals mass times
the speed of light squared.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.930
So you could use energy to bend space into
a black hole the same way nature uses mass.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.710
You would just need an insane amount of energy
to get the equivalent of enough mass, since

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.939
the speed of light is a huge number, nearly
300,000 km/s, and the equation calls for you

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.630
to square it.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.040
Light carries energy, so if you managed to
cram enough into a tiny space you would create

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.819
what’s called a kugelblitz, which is German
for “Ball Lightning.”

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:31.479
The good news is if we wanted to make a kugelblitz
we wouldn’t necessarily have to use the

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.170
equivalent of about three solar masses like
nature needs for a stellar black hole.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.860
We could make them much smaller, say one with
the equivalent mass of two empire state buildings.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.969
Then we would “only” need as much energy
as our entire sun puts out in 1/10th of a

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:47.969
second.

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.649
We could use a laser to create this low mass
kugelblitz, most likely one that shoots gamma

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.770
rays instead of visible light, since gamma
rays are the most energetic electromagnetic

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.770
waves and we’re trying to be efficient in
our ridiculousness.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.890
If we managed to create this absurdly powerful
laser, focused it at some point in space,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.670
and pulled the trigger, we could create a
tiny black hole, one with a radius smaller

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.670
than a proton.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.310
A black hole this size would decay over the
course of about five years, giving off hawking

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.350
radiation as it decays, and it might be possible
to use that radiation to power a spacecraft.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.220
I know, you’ve followed me pretty far down
the rabbit hole already, but I promise it’s

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.220
just a little farther.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.720
A 2015 paper proposed that if we could create
a dyson sphere around our little kugelblitz

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.670
and harness the energy to propel a spacecraft,
it could accelerate up to 72% the speed of

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.130
light before the black hole sputters out.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.840
That is of course assuming the dyson sphere
isn’t melted by the hawking radiation.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.600
Or that the extreme heat generated from packing
an insane amount of energy into a tiny space

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.220
doesn’t cause something unpredictable to
happen.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.030
A kugelblitz would be so hot that the math
we use the predict the laws of physics doesn’t

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.650
apply, so we can’t accurately say how it
would behave.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.040
So black holes made from light and spacecraft
that could harness them are still purely based

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.040
in theory.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.900
Hypothetically they could exist, but I wouldn’t
pin your dreams of interstellar travel on

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.170
them just yet.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.220
Though, you can pin your dreams on a new cell
provider.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.030
Visible is the new way to think about phone
service.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.030
No stores.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.030
No annual contracts.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.030
No hidden fees.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.250
Just 40 bucks a month for unlimited messages,
minutes, and data at speeds up to 5 megabits

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.250
per second.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.250
All on Verizon’s 4G LTE Network.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.250
When you think the future of phone service,
think Visible.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.250
Visible is the new way to think about phone
service.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.250
$40/mo phone service that's actually $40/mo.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.250
Unlimited everything (including data at speeds
up to 5 Mbps).

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.250
All on Verizon's 4G LTE Network.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.250
No hidden fees.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.250
Ever.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.250
When you think the future of phone service,
think Visible.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.340

episode of Space Crafts!

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.480
And one last thing.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.920
There is another phenomenon called ball lightning,
which is totally unrelated to a kugelblitz.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.010
I bet that’s only confusing if you’re
german.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.210
Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you next
time on Seeker.
