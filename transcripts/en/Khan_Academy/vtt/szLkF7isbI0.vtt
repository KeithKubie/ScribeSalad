00:00:00.764 --> 00:00:01.673
- [Voiceover] In the last couple videos

00:00:01.673 --> 00:00:03.877
I've been talking about
curl where if we have

00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:05.702
a two dimensional vector field V

00:00:05.702 --> 00:00:08.224
defined with component functions P and Q,

00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:11.014
I've said that the 2D
curl of that function V

00:00:11.014 --> 00:00:14.453
gives you a new function that
also takes in x and y's inputs

00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:16.834
and it's formula is the
partial derivative of Q

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:18.075
with respect to x

00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:21.101
minus the partial derivative
of P with respect to y.

00:00:21.101 --> 00:00:23.316
And my hope is that this
is more than just a formula

00:00:23.316 --> 00:00:24.507
and that you can understand

00:00:24.507 --> 00:00:28.237
how this represents fluid
rotation in two dimensions

00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:29.429
but what I want to do here is show

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.811
how the original intuition
I gave for this formula

00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:33.493
might be a little oversimplified

00:00:33.493 --> 00:00:35.207
because for example, if we look at this,

00:00:35.207 --> 00:00:38.140
the partial Q, partial x component,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.220
I said that you can imagine
that Q at some point

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.884
starting off a little bit
negative so the y component

00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:44.483
of the output is a little negative,

00:00:44.483 --> 00:00:46.740
then as you move positively
in the x direction,

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.548
it goes to being zero

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:50.648
and then it goes to being
a little bit positive,

00:00:50.648 --> 00:00:52.006
and with this particular picture,

00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:53.887
it's hopefully a little bit
clear why this can correspond

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.479
to counter-clockwise
rotation in the fluid,

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.621
but this is only a very
specific circumstance

00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:00.734
for what partial Q,
partial x being positive

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:01.567
could look like.

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:05.099
It might also look like Q's
starting a little bit positive

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.907
and then as you move in the x direction,

00:01:06.907 --> 00:01:10.428
it becomes even more positive
and then even more positive.

00:01:10.428 --> 00:01:12.654
And according to the formula,
this should contribute

00:01:12.654 --> 00:01:14.461
as much to positive curl

00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:17.867
as this very clear-cut whirlpool example,

00:01:17.867 --> 00:01:19.769
and to illustrate what
this might look like,

00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:22.266
if we take a look at
this vector field here,

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.782
if we look at the center, this is kinda

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:28.379
the clear-cut whirlpool
counter-clockwise rotation example.

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.929
And if we play the fluid
flow, the fluid does indeed

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:33.175
rotate counter-clockwise in the region.

00:01:33.175 --> 00:01:36.467
But contrast that with what
goes on over here on the right.

00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:40.051
This doesn't look like
rotation in that sense at all.

00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:42.009
Instead the fluid
particles are just kind of

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.157
rushing up through it.

00:01:44.157 --> 00:01:47.049
But in fact, the curl in
this region is going to be

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.838
just as strong as it is over here,

00:01:48.838 --> 00:01:50.071
and I'll show that with a formula

00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:51.952
and kind of computing it
through in just a moment,

00:01:51.952 --> 00:01:54.293
but the image that you
might have in your mind

00:01:54.293 --> 00:01:55.891
is to imagine a paddle wheel of sorts

00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:58.138
where let's say it's got
arms kind of like that

00:01:58.138 --> 00:02:01.544
and then you hold down with
your thumb that middle portion,

00:02:01.544 --> 00:02:03.477
so even though the paddle
wheel left to its own devices

00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:05.417
would just fly up, I want to say,

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:07.135
let's say you're holding
that down with your thumb

00:02:07.135 --> 00:02:08.733
but it's free to rotate.

00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:11.732
Then the vectors on its
left are pointing up

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:14.156
but less strongly than
the vectors on its right

00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:17.072
which are even greater, so
if you imagine that setup

00:02:17.072 --> 00:02:18.994
and you have your paddle wheel there,

00:02:18.994 --> 00:02:21.042
then when you play the fluid rotation,

00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:22.192
holding your thumb down

00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:24.900
but letting the paddle
wheel rotate freely,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.716
it's also going to rotate just as it would

00:02:26.716 --> 00:02:30.799
over here in the easier
to see whirlpool example.

00:02:32.546 --> 00:02:34.312
And in terms of the formula,

00:02:34.312 --> 00:02:37.269
this is because a situation
like this one here,

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.328
where Q goes from being
negative to zero to positive,

00:02:40.328 --> 00:02:42.776
should be treated just the
same as a situation like this

00:02:42.776 --> 00:02:44.709
as far as 2d curls is concerned,

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.342
because this term in the 2d curl formula

00:02:47.342 --> 00:02:50.550
is going to come out the
same for either one of these.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.897
And it's worth pointing out, by the way,

00:02:51.897 --> 00:02:54.238
curl isn't something that
mathematicians and physicists

00:02:54.238 --> 00:02:57.028
came across trying to
understand fluid flow.

00:02:57.028 --> 00:03:00.445
Instead, they found this
term as being significant

00:03:00.445 --> 00:03:02.545
and various other
formulas and circumstances

00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:04.653
and I think electromagnetism
might be where

00:03:04.653 --> 00:03:06.651
it originally came about.

00:03:06.651 --> 00:03:08.801
But then in trying to
understand this formula,

00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:11.392
they realized that you can give
a fluid flow interpretation

00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:13.858
that gives a very deep
understanding of what's going on

00:03:13.858 --> 00:03:15.959
beyond just the symbols themselves.

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.176
So let me go ahead and
walk through this example

00:03:19.176 --> 00:03:22.008
in terms of the formula
representing the vector field.

00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:26.175
It's a relatively
straightforward formula actually.

00:03:27.724 --> 00:03:28.641
So P and Q,

00:03:30.614 --> 00:03:33.582
that x component is going to be negative y

00:03:33.582 --> 00:03:37.072
and the y component, Q, is equal to x.

00:03:37.072 --> 00:03:38.869
So when we apply our 2d curl formula

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:41.335
and apply the partial Q with respect to x,

00:03:41.335 --> 00:03:43.968
so partial of this second
component with respect to x

00:03:43.968 --> 00:03:44.968
is just one,

00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:49.767
and then we subtract off the
partial of P with respect to y

00:03:49.767 --> 00:03:51.491
which up here is negative one

00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:54.730
because P is just equal to negative y.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.422
So the 2d curl is equal to two

00:03:57.422 --> 00:03:59.512
and in particular, it's a constant two

00:03:59.512 --> 00:04:02.561
that doesn't depend on x and
y, which is pretty unusual,

00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:04.977
most times that you apply
2d curl to a vector field

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:07.181
you're going to get some
kind of function of x and y.

00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:08.780
But the fact that this is constant,

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.162
tells us that when we look
over at this fluid flow,

00:04:11.162 --> 00:04:14.652
the sense in which curl,
the formula for curl

00:04:14.652 --> 00:04:17.202
wants to say that rotation
happens around the center

00:04:17.202 --> 00:04:19.344
is just as strong as
it's supposed to happen

00:04:19.344 --> 00:04:20.984
over here on the right,

00:04:20.984 --> 00:04:22.834
or anywhere on the plane for that matter.

00:04:22.834 --> 00:04:23.667
So if we're playing this

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:25.948
and if you imagine you have
the paddle wheel in the center,

00:04:25.948 --> 00:04:28.257
evidently it would be
rotating just as quickly

00:04:28.257 --> 00:04:30.260
as the paddle on the right
even though it might,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.041
I don't know, to me, that
feels a little unintuitive

00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:33.524
cause the one on the right I'm thinking,

00:04:33.524 --> 00:04:36.186
okay, you know, maybe there's
a little bit more torque

00:04:36.186 --> 00:04:38.066
on the right side than
there is on the left

00:04:38.066 --> 00:04:39.832
and that's kind of a
counter-balancing act,

00:04:39.832 --> 00:04:41.823
but the idea that that's actually the same

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:45.182
as the very clear-cut, I see
the counter-clockwise rotation

00:04:45.182 --> 00:04:47.466
with my eyes, example in the center,

00:04:47.466 --> 00:04:49.483
does seem a little unusual.

00:04:49.483 --> 00:04:51.636
But I think it's important to understand

00:04:51.636 --> 00:04:53.402
what else two dimensional
curl can look like

00:04:53.402 --> 00:04:57.069
and what else this formula
might be representing.

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:59.440
So with that, I'll see you next video.
