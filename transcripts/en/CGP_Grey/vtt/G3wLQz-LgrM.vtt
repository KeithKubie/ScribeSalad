00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
Hello, internet.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.620
Let's talk about this map,
this argument,

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.680
and the Electoral College in general.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.780
In my “Trouble With The Electoral College”
video from 2011,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.160
I was wrong to use the city limits
for that part of the argument,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.820
rather than the more expansive metro area.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.660
The lawyerish nerd inside of me still wants to argue
“technically correct” on that one.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.700
I used the city boundaries because
the metro areas are often vague and absurdly large:

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.120
the New York City metro area is
6700+ mi² over four states, and

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.160
from where I partly grew up,
it seemed that a lot of that area

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.640
had nothing to do with 
New York City proper.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.820
So, at the time,
I disregarded the metro boundaries.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.200
But using the strict city boundaries in that video
was the wrong decision in retrospect.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.860
In addition to being a bad argument to make,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.540
it also doesn't address
the concerns this map expresses.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.900
And this is correct! Half the population
does live in the grey counties.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.420
And more than that, the map gets at a fundamental
division in the United States and other countries

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.000
that leads partly to the politics we see:

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.980
the difference between the rural and the urban.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.680
If trends continue, a higher and higher percentage
of the country will live in urban areas.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.980
In another eight or sixteen years,
this map will be even more extreme:

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.460
the metro areas even denser.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.960
Which, if you're in favour of the Electoral College,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.880
will seem like even more of a reason to keep it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.460
Now this is where we must discuss the idea
that the Electoral College

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.480
ensures the president is elected by the states.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.540
It doesn't.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.820
A candidate can win the Electoral College
with just the eleven biggest states

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.860
This collection may seem unlikely, but as urbanization
and the politics it creates continues,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.060
it becomes increasingly likely.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.800
The Electoral College doesn't ensure
the president wins with a lot of states,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.100
or even geographically diverse states.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.500
Now, "Should the president represent the people,
or should the president represent the states?"

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.880
is a question without an answer.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.340
This is about preference in style of governance.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.300
One moves power up to the federal level,
and the other moves power down to the states.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.900
And given the vastness of the country
and the difference in her geographies,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.980
it's reasonable to believe that
states with greater power is the better,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.420
less divisive solution
to the problem of governance.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.940
But the Electoral College
does nothing to help that.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.100
It happens to be that recent wins
have been geographically spread,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.680
but the Electoral College
doesn't ensure that outcome.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.300
Cram everyone into California,
leaving one person in each state,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.700
and the Electoral College says:
“California alone, she decides.”

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.240
We could have a system where
the president must win a majority of the states,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.340
which is what some think
the Electoral College is... but it isn't.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.020
The election only happens
to make it look that way.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.080
The protection of the Electoral College
is only an illusion.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.440
Even if you still like the Electoral College,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.900
though it doesn't actually
protect the small states,

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.300
the Electoral College still comes with
the most bitter of anti-republic pills.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.520
For even if you win
the election in November,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.660
your victory can be taken away
from you in December.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.740
The Electoral College votes your state gets
aren't really votes,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.820
but are individual members
of the political parties,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.540
who perform the real vote for president in December.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.520
No citizen voted for these electors
to cast a vote on their behalf,

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.520
and many of the electors
are free to vote for whoever they want.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.520
Their election in December is the real election.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.460
The Electoral College was designed to be able
to overwrite the will of the people,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.840
or its own election process,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.880
any time enough of a small number of
unknown, unelected political party insiders

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.260
don't like the result they got.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.380
If you're in favor of the Electoral College,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.380
you have to accept that,
by its own rules,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.260
it can take away your victory,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.860
under the guise of
protecting you from yourself.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.800
This has never happened in American history,
nor should it.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.120
But it is crazy to leave in place
for future elections

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.200
a system that benefits no citizens

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.080
and protects no states.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.800
It's time to get rid of the Electoral College
and have a real discussion about

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.580
what a modern government and election system
should look like.
