Female Commentator: So from Breathless
to the team of the work of champions,

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:13.933
from a classical music singer to
a contemporary music composer

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:20.100
today we have him here in new shoes
of an entrepreneur and a music teacher.

IGN proudly presents Shankar Mahadevan.

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:31.967
[applause and cheering]

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.033
Shankar: Good evening everybody.

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:41.133
There's not a single day that goes by
without remembering you all -- [laughter]

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:45.033
because I can't believe that
I am at THE Google office.

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:46.967
Thank you very much
for making this happen.

00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:49.200
[applause and cheering]
Really.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.833
It's truly a new experience
and an honor for me

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:56.033
and it's so lovely to meet you all, all of you here.

00:00:56.033 --> 00:01:02.367
I think before I start talking
why don't I just sing a song for you?

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:03.100
What do you think?

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.100
[cheering and applause] 

00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:14.900
Shankar Mahadevan: [unintelligible]
[laughter]

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.267
Aren't you, haven't you heard
that every day during the match?

00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:20.833
Okay I'll sing for that later.

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:22.467
I'll definitely sing that for you.

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:23.200
Yeah?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.900
Okay, right now I'll just 
since it's such an auspicious beginning

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.967
I'll just do a little prayer for you, okay?

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:54.200

Thank you very much.

00:04:52.367 --> 00:04:56.600
[applause]

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.467
This is a new venture,

00:04:59.467 --> 00:05:06.833
a new front which I had along
with a few friends of mine.

00:05:06.833 --> 00:05:10.567
I finished my engineering, 

00:05:10.567 --> 00:05:13.933
I was also became an engineer
but it was [unintelligible].

00:05:13.933 --> 00:05:19.900
And an engineering college mate
of mine Sridhar Ranganathan

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.300
we met after 15 years.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.033
He was here in the Bay Area
for 15 years,

00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:27.867
hated it but he formed his company,
he sold it, he's made his money.

00:05:27.867 --> 00:05:30.400
And I did my little bit in music,
composing, singing,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.833
whatever you'll have heard
some of the stuff that I've done.

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:34.400
After 15 years we met 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.167
because I always wanted
to do something in teaching;

00:05:38.167 --> 00:05:42.900
teaching Indian music
to people all over the world.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.333
And Sridhar was even thinking
of developing something,

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:49.033
a platform for education.

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:51.800
So we thought of something,
we came together,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.933
and we formed this Shankar Mahadevan
Academy online 

00:05:54.933 --> 00:05:59.233
so that we can teach music
to all of you,

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.967
at your pace, at your convenience,
in your house.

00:06:01.967 --> 00:06:04.600
So I'd like to welcome
my friend and my partner,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.700
the CEO of Shankar Mahadevan Academy,
Sridhar Ranganathan.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.067
[applause]

00:06:13.067 --> 00:06:14.767
Sridhar Ranganathan: Hello, yeah.

00:06:14.767 --> 00:06:17.067
Thanks Shankar.

00:06:17.067 --> 00:06:21.500
I lived here almost 13 and a
half 14 years and I was at Yahoo,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.367
pre-Google days, I'd like
to qualify that. [laughter]

00:06:25.367 --> 00:06:29.533
Because the buzz and excitement that
you guys have here it was the same thing

00:06:29.533 --> 00:06:32.667
but nine years I've been doing Yahoo.

00:06:32.667 --> 00:06:36.300
I went to Bangalore to set
up the Yahoo R &amp; D Center.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.100
What I found there was a lot of
educated people coming through,

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.800
but we had to to through like a 110,
115 resumes and I see a friend here,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.167
[inaudible], was with me there;
100, 110 resumes to get one person.

00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:56.567
What I found was that
education system goes one way,

00:06:56.567 --> 00:06:57.933
you learn somewhere else, 

00:06:57.933 --> 00:07:02.167
and then we all make a career of it in
spite of education system sometimes.

00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:04.567
And then that's one of the things
that really stayed with me.

00:07:04.567 --> 00:07:08.933
I wanted to find a way to
make it happen differently.

00:07:08.933 --> 00:07:13.533
With the advent of Flash, video, audio,
and all, YouTube, whatever right.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:17.867
And you have so much content and you
guys know this better in a lot of ways

00:07:17.867 --> 00:07:21.167
is searching for that needle
in the haystack that hits you

00:07:21.167 --> 00:07:24.200
and that's what you guys try to do.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.433
The whole idea about how do you
find that needle in the haystack

00:07:27.433 --> 00:07:29.567
to help you understand

00:07:29.567 --> 00:07:32.033
and then how we find that
related needle in the haystack

00:07:32.033 --> 00:07:34.967
and those are some of the algorithms
that you guys are working probably.

00:07:34.967 --> 00:07:40.600
What we did was we tried to overlay
a pedagogic template on top of it.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.167
What kind of a learner are you?

00:07:42.167 --> 00:07:45.733
Are you a visual learner,
as you a auditory learner,

00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:48.133
as you a kinesthetic learner,
and all these different things.

00:07:48.133 --> 00:07:50.433
And kind of overlay a template on it 

00:07:50.433 --> 00:07:53.133
and see how we can create
a content management system

00:07:53.133 --> 00:07:55.967
that would help you as a student learn;

00:07:55.967 --> 00:08:00.733
help a teacher to teach a class.

00:08:00.733 --> 00:08:03.900
So as we're along this journey
and then Shankar was thinking that,

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.300
"Okay I want to create a music academy
in the suburbs of Bombay,

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.300
build a building

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:13.400
and then as soon as in the first
five minutes of when we met

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.267
academy online platform
breaking the boundaries,

00:08:17.267 --> 00:08:22.700
all these things started
just coming up for it.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.667
We jammed for a bit,
there you go,

00:08:24.667 --> 00:08:27.600
within about six months we had
to actually launched academy online

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.933
on 3rd of March which happens
to be Shankar's birthday.

00:08:30.933 --> 00:08:34.567
And in the last month,
five weeks we have 100 plus students.

00:08:34.567 --> 00:08:38.433
So it just, all of those things
just happened, click.

00:08:38.433 --> 00:08:41.167
So what I wanna talk to you
today about is what it is,

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:43.767
how to you learn, what is so new,
what is so unique,

00:08:43.767 --> 00:08:47.367
what is different about this.

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:56.067
So we have three fundamental things

00:08:56.067 --> 00:08:59.967
and Shankar will talk more about that in
terms of the curriculum of Indian music.

00:08:59.967 --> 00:09:04.067
If you go to good western music
you start with sheet music,

00:09:04.067 --> 00:09:05.500
you have prerequisite,

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.433
you have course one,
course two, course three,

00:09:07.433 --> 00:09:09.033
you know what your journey is,

00:09:09.033 --> 00:09:11.700
how you progress in
your career to learn music.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.833
In Indian classical music usually
it's up to the teacher to decide,

00:09:15.833 --> 00:09:17.933
it's up to you how to learn,

00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:22.200
there is no specific course work and
there's no specific assessments.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.600
You can't really take advantage
of technology that is there today

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.967
that we can use.

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:31.267
The second part is so we actually structured
the curriculum and the course work.

00:09:31.267 --> 00:09:34.933
So you have 16 courses, 
four beginners, 16 intermediate,

00:09:34.933 --> 00:09:37.967
sorry, four beginners,
six intermediate,

00:09:37.967 --> 00:09:40.500
six advanced where you get
a diploma or a degree.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.600
We are working with reputed colleges
to even make it available as a credit

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.967
when you go to colleges and such.

00:09:47.967 --> 00:09:51.833
The second part is a online
music book and short poem book

00:09:51.833 --> 00:09:56.067
where we tried to capture the content
in all the multimedia facets:

00:09:56.067 --> 00:09:59.067
video, audio, and such and
also integrate tools in it.

00:09:59.067 --> 00:10:06.867
For example, if Shankar is playing music
on the iTanpura app on the his iPhone.

00:10:06.867 --> 00:10:09.800
We actually integrate that
we'll plan to integrate in there.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.133
We have a recorder where you
actually practice and sing

00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:14.433
and submit your assignment
in the audio

00:10:14.433 --> 00:10:16.267
and the teacher gives you feedback
in audio again.

00:10:16.267 --> 00:10:18.833
So we'll demonstrate that and pixel it.

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:21.467
And then you can save a recording,
you can share it with your friends,

00:10:21.467 --> 00:10:24.867
you can [inaudible ] with your family,
you can do a lot of those kind of things.

00:10:24.867 --> 00:10:27.167
And trying of see
how you can push the envelope

00:10:27.167 --> 00:10:31.333
in terms of learning, enjoying it,
making it fun for everybody.

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:34.500
The third part is real simple and I don't
want to reinvent technology there

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.500
we just integrated WebEx on the back.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.433
One click you're in a class,
one teacher to five students.

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:45.800
We keep the class small
and teach and learn.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.400
With that I'll introduce
one of our students,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.400
[inaudible].

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.167
She's been in the Academy
for the last five weeks

00:10:53.167 --> 00:10:57.833
and she'll demonstrate to you
how she learns from the online music.

00:11:05.633 --> 00:11:07.833
Sridhar Ranganathan: I think
you should speak here. Yep.

00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:11.333
Sridhar Ranganathan: You want this?

00:11:13.067 --> 00:11:16.000
Female Student: Good evening everyone,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.867
So my name is [inaudible].

00:11:17.867 --> 00:11:20.533
I'm an engineer like most of you.

00:11:20.533 --> 00:11:24.933
I've been with Intel for many,
many years and I took today off,

00:11:24.933 --> 00:11:27.333
I'm not bunking and --
[laughter] favor

00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:30.400
because I wanted to really
help out this wonderful team

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.867
and share with you my
experience at the Academy.

00:11:32.867 --> 00:11:36.767
I'm very fortunate I found
about it on day one

00:11:36.767 --> 00:11:40.167
or maybe a few days before
and I signed up right away.

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:43.233
And it's been a wonderful experience.

00:11:43.233 --> 00:11:48.000
Before I introduce you to the different
tools that I use as a student

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.900
I would like to just share
with you a quick background.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.267
I've always been drawn to music

00:11:54.267 --> 00:12:00.633
and throughout my life I've tried
taking classes off and on.

00:12:00.633 --> 00:12:05.867
My first memory of taking Hindustani
classical was when I was in fifth grade,

00:12:05.867 --> 00:12:08.433
and of course it was not
my idea but my mom's idea.

00:12:08.433 --> 00:12:11.267
She thought it was a good idea
to put me in school

00:12:11.267 --> 00:12:15.567
so in Lucknow she put me
in one of the best schools in India

00:12:15.567 --> 00:12:19.233
and here as a fifth grader all I wanted
to do was sing fun songs right

00:12:19.233 --> 00:12:22.267
because nobody wants to listen to sarigama.

00:12:22.267 --> 00:12:27.400
And I go to this class where I'm the
youngest children and for six months,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.667
five days a week 

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:30.867
all I was taught was Sarigama,

00:12:30.867 --> 00:12:33.233
Sarigama Padanisa, Sarigama Padanisa.

00:12:33.233 --> 00:12:35.633
The assumption was one size fits all.

00:12:35.633 --> 00:12:38.300
They take six months
for everybody to learn that

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.167
and that's what's they're going to teach you.

00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:42.700
So you can imagine how exciting that was.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.000
Not quite.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.533
And the second part was you could not
discuss Bollywood music with your teachers

00:12:49.533 --> 00:12:53.167
because these teachers were old schoolers

00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:56.467
and Bollywood music was
considered as very light.

00:12:56.467 --> 00:13:02.567
So then not surprising year dropped out .

00:13:02.567 --> 00:13:07.300
So I took lessons off and on and then
my last experience was in Bay Area

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:12.933
actually I would drive 40 minutes for a class
and I won't like to name the school.

00:13:12.933 --> 00:13:17.567
I mean the teachers are excellent
except that I was the only woman in the class

00:13:17.567 --> 00:13:20.800
and some of you might know
that men have a different scale,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.433
women have a different scale,

00:13:22.433 --> 00:13:26.167
and the whole class was singing
at the scale of these men.

00:13:26.167 --> 00:13:32.767
So I could never quite keep up because it's
almost like you're asking [speaks Hindi].

00:13:32.767 --> 00:13:35.900
And every time I would
bring it up with my teacher

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.700
she was really catering to the other students

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.033
so it was extremely demotivating
for me, right?

00:13:42.033 --> 00:13:46.467
All these years I thought I was
an okay singer of this film music

00:13:46.467 --> 00:13:49.233
and here I was unable to
even keep up with the class.

00:13:49.233 --> 00:13:51.400
So I again dropped out.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.633
The day I found out about this Academy,

00:13:53.633 --> 00:13:57.267
I mean, that very evening I signed up.

00:13:57.267 --> 00:13:57.833
And why?

00:13:57.833 --> 00:14:01.933
Let me be honest with you,
that it had Shankar's name in it.

00:14:01.933 --> 00:14:05.733
I'm one of his biggest fans and like
I have experienced taking classes,

00:14:05.733 --> 00:14:06.367
dropping out.

00:14:06.367 --> 00:14:07.367
How bad can it be?

00:14:07.367 --> 00:14:11.867
And Shankar has his name in
the Academy like we just joined.

00:14:11.867 --> 00:14:13.967
And it's been a wonderful
experience for me

00:14:13.967 --> 00:14:18.400
and hopefully you'll see some
of the process that I go through.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:25.100
So when I log into the Academy
these are the options I see.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.267
So there's a virtual class I think
Sridhar talked about once every week

00:14:29.267 --> 00:14:31.100
on Thursday for half an hour.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:36.433
All I have to do is click on join class
and it opens this WebEx conference.

00:14:36.433 --> 00:14:41.700
I can see the other four students and the
teacher and it's a very interactive class.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.033
The teacher actually introduces
you to a new concept,

00:14:45.033 --> 00:14:46.533
it's very structured.

00:14:46.533 --> 00:14:49.133
He tells you what is expected, 

00:14:49.133 --> 00:14:51.700
what assignments are
expected for next week,

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.400
and what he's going to be
covering next week, okay?

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:59.167
So then the last five minutes
of the class time [inaudible]

00:14:59.167 --> 00:15:02.467
you spend discussing about
all the Bollywood songs

00:15:02.467 --> 00:15:06.900
that are based on that particular
Ragg or similar [inaudible]

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.933
which is actually always been
interesting to me

00:15:09.933 --> 00:15:14.233
because it gives you a different
level of music appreciation.

00:15:14.233 --> 00:15:17.600
When you listen to a song
automatically then you start thinking,

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.767
"Oh my God," the more you learn
it's very gratifying.

00:15:22.767 --> 00:15:25.667
So then also you have recorded class 

00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:27.933
so if for some reason
you've missed a class

00:15:27.933 --> 00:15:32.067
you can actually every class is recorded
you can go back and listen to it.

00:15:32.067 --> 00:15:33.300
Even if you haven't missed, 

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.733
listening to yourself actually highlights
all kinds of problems

00:15:36.733 --> 00:15:39.033
that you might be totally unaware of.

00:15:39.033 --> 00:15:44.167
And then the last is the OM Book which
is actually the most valuable resource

00:15:44.167 --> 00:15:45.967
that is available to you.

00:15:45.967 --> 00:15:50.400
[pause] 

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:55.067
This is a book which has
very rich audio video content.

00:15:55.067 --> 00:16:00.600
So I'm sure here most of you must
have heard about this Alcon Academy,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.000
all the learning happens offline 

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.333
and then through the interaction
you actually are discussing,

00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:10.833
the concepts are getting reinforced.

00:16:10.833 --> 00:16:17.500
So here there are these online videos,
short videos where you learn.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.733
I mean you listen to it as many time
as it takes to understand

00:16:21.733 --> 00:16:24.600
because it's available to you
for four hours a day.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:30.433
And when you feel that you're ready
then there is a little tool right there

00:16:30.433 --> 00:16:34.933
I can press record, I can sing,
and then I stop and play back;

00:16:34.933 --> 00:16:38.133
if I'm satisfied I save it and I submit.

00:16:38.133 --> 00:16:43.200
And that's my assignment submitted at one
goal and the teacher provides feedback

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.367
if I sang great or not.

00:16:45.367 --> 00:16:48.933
So in the OM Book
there are teacher's notes,

00:16:48.933 --> 00:16:50.133
very detailed notes,

00:16:50.133 --> 00:16:53.633
there's no excuse to say I forgot
that there's an assignment due

00:16:53.633 --> 00:16:55.533
because it's all captured here, 

00:16:55.533 --> 00:16:58.900
what assignments are due
after what class.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:05.900
And then also the chapters if you see like I
think Shankar mentioned it's very structured.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.700
I know that once I get out
of this course 12 weeks later

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.000
I will know a small Bandish
and Raag Yaman.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.767
And that chapter in Raag Yaman actually
also has several Bollywood compositions

00:17:18.767 --> 00:17:20.267
that are based on Raag Yaman

00:17:20.267 --> 00:17:24.467
so I'll have a little more in depth
knowledge of Raag Yaman.

00:17:24.467 --> 00:17:29.867
So let me demonstrate this is one
of the Alankars that we learned.

00:17:29.867 --> 00:17:33.267
There's a very famous singer,
[inaudible] who's singing

00:17:33.267 --> 00:17:38.667
but this is what I would on an evening I
would listen to this Alankar for example.

00:17:38.667 --> 00:18:22.733
[woman singing in Hindi]

00:18:22.733 --> 00:18:25.033
Okay so this is one of the first
few Alankars you learn.

00:18:25.033 --> 00:18:30.267
So I have an iPhone app which I connect
to my amplifier and at my scale

00:18:30.267 --> 00:18:31.133
and go to that.

00:18:31.133 --> 00:18:32.733
Everybody sings at their own scales,

00:18:32.733 --> 00:18:35.500
you don't have to sing 
at somebody else's scale.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:41.233
I sing the same Alankar and I submit
and I'll give you a quick demonstration.

00:18:41.233 --> 00:18:43.233
I submitted this assignment.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.133
So look at how many assignments
I have been submitted in four weeks,

00:18:48.133 --> 00:18:51.567
you'll be impressed.
[laughter]

00:18:51.567 --> 00:18:53.433
This is only one page.

00:18:53.433 --> 00:18:54.000
male in audience: That's a lot.

00:18:58.667 --> 00:19:01.967
Well, these are assignments recordings
is what I want to do.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.567
These are the number of recordings
I have submitted.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:48.033
[female singing] 

00:19:49.767 --> 00:19:51.767
This is right here and the
teacher provides feedback.

00:19:54.033 --> 00:19:57.667
Male Teacher: [inaudible] sung
once again you have a really bold

00:19:57.667 --> 00:19:59.067
and open voice -- 

00:19:59.067 --> 00:20:02.333
Female Speaker: He spotted
something else bold and open voice.

00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:04.967
Male Teacher: it was also fine
and it was very relaxing,

00:20:04.967 --> 00:20:11.000
and it was sung in a very comfortable
pace and [inaudible].

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.233
Good job.

00:20:16.033 --> 00:20:17.667
female student: So I picked one
that was good. [laughter]

00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:21.833
There is also ones that I got [inaudible]

00:20:21.833 --> 00:20:25.167
in that case he sings it and says,
"This is where you made a mistake."

00:20:25.167 --> 00:20:28.967
Sings it wrong like you did and then say,
"No that should be done this way."

00:20:28.967 --> 00:20:31.100
So very customized and
detailed feedback.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.533
So again just two minutes on
what I like about the Academy.

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:37.433
First of all you sing at your own scale.

00:20:37.433 --> 00:20:39.333
I think I made that point again and again

00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:44.700
because I think that itself keeps a lot
of us from taking such classes.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.433
Second ,its self-paced.

00:20:46.433 --> 00:20:50.867
So if a certain concept is difficult
you can listen to it more,

00:20:50.867 --> 00:20:56.600
number of times and you don't
have to follow it and it's customized.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.800
So the teacher really knows where each
student is at even for the same Alankar

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.867
the students can be challenged
very differently.

00:21:04.867 --> 00:21:07.433
I mean the teachers are so great
that after the second class

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:10.133
the teacher understands
where everybody is at.

00:21:10.133 --> 00:21:12.867
So everybody's getting
challenged from differently.

00:21:12.867 --> 00:21:16.633
If you're traveling like I am,
this week I'm going to be in Oregon,

00:21:16.633 --> 00:21:18.633
I can join the class from
where ever I am

00:21:18.633 --> 00:21:22.467
or if you're not traveling too
so that of course goes without saying.

00:21:22.467 --> 00:21:25.567
And last but not the least

00:21:25.567 --> 00:21:30.000
which has been a complete unexpected
positive development that I've seen.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.200
I have two boys 11 and 13,
they've been learning the piano,

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.567
they've been learning guitar
and drums for many, many years.

00:21:37.567 --> 00:21:41.200
I know they are somewhat musical
by now after all these years.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.467
If I ask them to take classical music,

00:21:43.467 --> 00:21:45.600
I mean Hindustani music I mean
they wouldn't do it.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.567
They're, you have to catch them young
so we missed that window of opportunity.

00:21:50.567 --> 00:21:55.500
But every evening when I am practicing,
it's in the living room,

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.300
they're sitting on their laptops

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:03.500
and very often I've heard my oldest son sing
the same Alankars and he's perfectly in tune.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.267
So he doesn't even know that he's singing,
he'll be humming

00:22:06.267 --> 00:22:10.433
and of course I'll be as quiet as possible
because the moment I point out he'd stop.

00:22:10.433 --> 00:22:14.133
So just knowing that these kids
are getting exposed to something

00:22:14.133 --> 00:22:17.500
that matters so much to me
is so gratifying,

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.467
and I think it will help him
become a better musician

00:22:21.467 --> 00:22:25.200
even if it's a Western one if he wants to.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.100
But that's my story.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.267
[applause] 

00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:33.467
Shankar Mahadevan: So to sum it up,

00:22:33.467 --> 00:22:36.467
basically, what we've tried to do is

00:22:36.467 --> 00:22:38.800
whether we would learn anything
in any institute

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:44.667
anything that you're learning you receive
your knowledge through two sources:

00:22:44.667 --> 00:22:49.133
one is your book, your textbook
or whatever book that is there.

00:22:49.133 --> 00:22:50.867
That is available to you 24/7, 

00:22:50.867 --> 00:22:52.767
you can refer to the book
anytime you want.

00:22:52.767 --> 00:22:57.533
That's why we have created
a digital textbook for,

00:22:57.533 --> 00:23:01.067
you can look at that and
you can practice with it.

00:23:01.067 --> 00:23:06.067
It's a self-learning tool because the way
we have shot the videos it's in great detail

00:23:06.067 --> 00:23:11.167
and there are rotations that you can just
take a print out of the references,

00:23:11.167 --> 00:23:12.567
there are YouTube links, 

00:23:12.567 --> 00:23:16.567
there are so many things available
in that one textbook

00:23:16.567 --> 00:23:19.567
and there's a lot of theory over there.

00:23:19.567 --> 00:23:21.700
Especially for children, 

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.033
for small children we are having very
interesting things like animation

00:23:25.033 --> 00:23:26.600
and little games for them

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:32.167
so that identification of the [inaudible]
they can do using these games.

00:23:32.167 --> 00:23:35.567
There's one little beep that comes out
and you are to identify what note that is

00:23:35.567 --> 00:23:37.600
and you burst that particular thing.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:42.967
So they get what is called a sarva
or we teach them simple things,

00:23:42.967 --> 00:23:45.533
simple songs that they've already
heard in their lives like

00:23:45.533 --> 00:23:50.533
[singing in Hindi to the tune of
Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star].

00:23:50.533 --> 00:23:52.733
So they relate it to the tune
that they've heard

00:23:52.733 --> 00:23:55.867
and somehow subconsciously
they learn Sarvagan.

00:23:55.867 --> 00:24:00.467
So that is using the OM Book,
that is the online music book,

00:24:00.467 --> 00:24:02.200
we've got the name OM Book for that.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.367
And of course the teacher that is
available in any institute similarly

00:24:06.367 --> 00:24:09.700
we have a live teacher over there
and he works with the class

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.200
but that is at a specified time,

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.800
you have to be there, log on,

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.367
and you learn your
whatever you're learning.

00:24:15.367 --> 00:24:18.233
So that's it basically.

00:24:18.233 --> 00:24:19.800
Sridhar Ranganathan: So there's
a teacher here

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.700
and she's gonna conduct
a class with you guys.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.833
Shankar Mahadevan: Yeah and I want
all of you to sing with us okay?

00:24:23.833 --> 00:24:24.767
Sridhar Ranganathan: Are you ready?

00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:25.400
I thought I heard you.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.333
Shankar Mahadevan: Come
on Google are you ready?

00:24:27.333 --> 00:24:28.500
audience in unison: Yes.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.733
Shankar Mahadevan: Superb.

00:24:30.733 --> 00:24:32.433
Padma is, go ahead.

00:24:32.433 --> 00:24:33.533
Padma Shankar: Hi.

00:24:33.533 --> 00:24:34.833
Shankar Mahadevan: This Padma
Shankar from Chennai.

00:24:34.833 --> 00:24:35.367
Okay -- 

00:24:35.367 --> 00:24:37.733
Sridhar Ranganathan: Let's have a loud round
of applause for Padma Shakar because --

00:24:37.733 --> 00:24:41.000
[applause]

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
she's right now, right now
in Chennai and firstly

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.133
because it 4:30 in the morning --
[laughter] and she's up.

00:24:48.133 --> 00:24:49.433
Thank you very much Padma for that.

00:24:49.433 --> 00:24:53.400
And also she's been with us
from the conceptualization stage

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.867
from the time we had our free pilot,
we got her for a free pilot,

00:24:56.867 --> 00:25:00.967
then we did a pilot
and we did a paid pilot.

00:25:00.967 --> 00:25:05.167
All this time she was there with us
and a couple of people like her.

00:25:05.167 --> 00:25:06.767
So thank you very much Padma.

00:25:06.767 --> 00:25:09.967
And what are you going to make us sing?

00:25:09.967 --> 00:25:13.433
I think you should, I think looking at the crowd
they should do a Bollywood song.

00:25:13.433 --> 00:25:14.967
What do you think?
Okay.

00:25:14.967 --> 00:25:17.000
members of audience
shouting out: Yeah, yeah,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.433
Shankar Mahadevan: I read their minds.
[laughter]

00:25:21.433 --> 00:25:24.967
Padma Shankar: Since [inaudible] achieved
our status I'm in India

00:25:24.967 --> 00:25:28.033
and I'm with all these Google guys there.

00:25:28.033 --> 00:25:29.800
I will be teaching you a [inaudible].

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.067
Are you ready to sing with me?

00:25:31.067 --> 00:25:32.433
Shankar Mahadevan: Yes, yes, yes.

00:25:38.867 --> 00:25:43.200
Padma Shankar: [singing in Hindi]

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.533
Shankar Mahadevan: Three, four.

00:25:44.533 --> 00:25:51.900
audience: [singing in Hindi] 

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.500
Padma Shankar: [singing in Hindi]

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:04.300
audience: [singing in Hindi] 

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:09.433
Padma Shankar: [singing in Hindi]

00:26:09.433 --> 00:26:15.767
audience: [singing in Hindi] 

00:26:15.767 --> 00:26:20.300
Padma Shankar: [singing in Hindi]

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:26.833
audience: [singing in Hindi]

00:26:26.833 --> 00:26:30.267
Padma Shankar: [singing in Hindi] 

00:26:30.267 --> 00:26:31.967
Shankar Mahadevan: Can you make it
a little bit louder?

00:26:31.967 --> 00:26:38.467
audience: [singing in Hindi]

00:26:38.467 --> 00:26:43.600
Padma Shankar: [singing in Hindi]

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:49.933
audience: [singing in Hindi] 

00:26:49.933 --> 00:26:55.167
Padma Shankar: [singing in Hindi]

00:26:55.167 --> 00:27:01.633
audience: [singing in Hindi]

00:27:01.633 --> 00:27:06.400
Padma Shankar: [singing in Hindi]

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:11.167
audience: [singing in Hindi]

00:27:11.167 --> 00:27:12.867
Padma Shankar: Now together with me.

00:27:12.867 --> 00:27:33.533
Padma Shankar and audience: [singing in Hindi]

00:27:33.533 --> 00:27:34.200
Shankar Mahadevan: Fantastic!

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.700
Thank you very much Padma!

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.600
[applause]

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.967
This is not Google, this is surreal a Google.
[laughter]

00:27:39.967 --> 00:27:41.467
Fantastic Padma.

00:27:41.467 --> 00:27:42.467
Thanks Padma.

00:27:46.067 --> 00:27:49.800
Shankar Mahadevan: So what
we did was not only,

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.367
not everybody wants to wear
a coat and tie and put a shawl

00:27:53.367 --> 00:27:57.100
and become a pundit and
do a classical music concert.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.600
So there are many, many, many of us 

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.633
who just want to experience
the joy of singing

00:28:03.633 --> 00:28:13.067
and just enjoy singing simple songs
that I always [speaking in Hindi].

00:28:13.067 --> 00:28:17.100
So we designed these hobby
singing courses for people

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.433
who just want to learn simple songs.

00:28:19.433 --> 00:28:23.800
So we went and we put a poll and
we got a lot of feedback saying

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.367
that we would like to learn
this song that song

00:28:25.367 --> 00:28:31.467
so we are in a continuous process of developing
these OM Books for every single song,

00:28:31.467 --> 00:28:33.933
different songs sung by artists

00:28:33.933 --> 00:28:44.900
like you may wanna learn [inaudible], you
may wanna learn [inaudible], whatever.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.333
So we're designing these
OM Books for simple,

00:28:47.333 --> 00:28:50.567
I think those are short courses
they're not intense courses

00:28:50.567 --> 00:28:52.767
like in Hindustani and Carnatic music.

00:28:52.767 --> 00:28:55.200
They'll be lasting for just
four weeks, a month.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.633
In a month you learn the song completely
and those OM Books have detailed,

00:28:59.633 --> 00:29:03.933
they've got lyrics,
they've got [inaudible],

00:29:03.933 --> 00:29:06.700
the way you sing it,
the tune, the inflections,

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.300
everything is explained by the teacher.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:13.667
Sridhar Ranganathan: And is example
of Shankar teaching one of his songs --

00:29:13.667 --> 00:29:14.600
Shankar Mahadevan: I'm
not using all the songs,

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.833
this song I'm teaching -- 

00:29:17.833 --> 00:29:19.767
Sridhar Ranganathan: we're launching
this song on May 8th

00:29:19.767 --> 00:29:23.067
which happens to be the Mother's Day
and the song was aptly named Maa.

00:29:23.067 --> 00:29:24.367
Sridhar Ranganathan: So
I'll show you a small?

00:29:24.367 --> 00:29:25.633
audience: Oooh.

00:29:25.633 --> 00:29:32.467
I'll show you a small sample of how
he teaches the [inaudible] One and --

00:29:32.467 --> 00:29:35.033
Sridhar Ranganathan: Now when you
arrive at the [inaudible] bridge

00:29:35.033 --> 00:29:36.900
as we can call it for this song

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:41.433
that is when your singing has to be very--

00:29:41.433 --> 00:29:43.200
as you can see not bold, 

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.733
that is volume wise

00:29:44.733 --> 00:29:48.500
it has to be the loudest in your entire
rendition of your song.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.133
Because that is the part
when you're actually,

00:29:52.133 --> 00:29:57.600
you're discussing something
that you have visualized before

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.200
and something you should happen to you
and how you used to look at--

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.667
look for your mother's help.

00:30:02.667 --> 00:30:09.800
So it's a little bit of an anxiety
kind of a feeling in this bridge.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.933
So I just demonstrate
how you do it.

00:30:11.933 --> 00:30:12.867
[Indian music in background] 

00:30:12.867 --> 00:30:16.033
And that is where if you know
in the song the drums also kick in

00:30:16.033 --> 00:30:18.433
and the guitar chords now come in

00:30:18.433 --> 00:30:23.133
so that's where the song as such
becomes slightly louder than your [inaudible].

00:30:23.133 --> 00:30:26.467
The vocal is very silent and
just the guitar and the piano.

00:30:26.467 --> 00:30:27.067
So.

00:30:27.067 --> 00:30:29.067
Um.

00:30:29.067 --> 00:30:48.200
[singing in Hindi]

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.933
We'll do it to here.

00:30:49.933 --> 00:30:54.000
So there's a particular graph to this,
the notes of this are: da,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.067
da, da, da.

00:30:57.067 --> 00:30:58.500
But it's a move.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.267
Da, da, da, da.

00:31:01.267 --> 00:31:02.233
One step up.

00:31:02.233 --> 00:31:03.633
Then I go one step down.

00:31:03.633 --> 00:31:08.000
Da, da, da, da.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:17.133
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

00:31:17.133 --> 00:31:21.700
I want you to be very careful while singing
this melody is the pitching of the notes.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:25.167
Where are the notes, there are notes
that you sing very straight

00:31:25.167 --> 00:31:28.667
and you repeat it very straight
so your pitch them very carefully.

00:31:28.667 --> 00:31:33.767
So, so ♪ da, da, da, da. ♪

00:31:33.767 --> 00:31:36.433
♪ Da, da, da, da. ♪

00:31:36.433 --> 00:31:40.567
So first time it is straight, 
♪ da, da, da. ♪

00:31:40.567 --> 00:31:42.533
Second of there's a little slur,

00:31:42.533 --> 00:31:45.233
♪ da, da, da, da. ♪

00:31:45.233 --> 00:31:53.000
[singing in Hindi] 

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.033
A slight
slur leading to that note.

00:31:55.033 --> 00:32:07.833
[singing in Hindi] 

00:32:07.833 --> 00:32:11.200
This maa has to be almost
be like the volume button

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.267
that you have in your television set

00:32:14.267 --> 00:32:17.233
just because da, da, da and
it ends at a particular part.

00:32:17.233 --> 00:32:21.300
♪ Maa. ♪

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:25.100
But this is not a cut thing like
how you [speaking in Hindi].

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.333
This has to sustain and also fade out.

00:32:27.333 --> 00:32:32.733
Maa.

00:32:32.733 --> 00:32:34.467
[singing in Hindi]

00:32:34.467 --> 00:32:38.567
After reaching that volume you have to
come down to a softer volume again.

00:32:38.567 --> 00:32:45.400
[singing in Hindi]

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.133
Now this [speaking in Hindi] has
to be a little bit of a desperation;

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:50.533
a looking out for somebody.

00:32:50.533 --> 00:32:56.567
It can't be [singing in Hindi].

00:32:56.567 --> 00:32:58.033
You're searching for somebody.

00:32:58.033 --> 00:33:01.233
[singing in Hindi]

00:33:01.233 --> 00:33:02.367
So coming back 

00:33:02.367 --> 00:33:06.433
[singing in Hindi]. 

00:33:06.433 --> 00:33:07.700
Sridar
Ranganathan: That's a sample of this.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:12.667
So here this is like video number 20
and things so there's a lot of things

00:33:12.667 --> 00:33:15.833
that go before that and like he breaks
it down to small, small pieces.

00:33:15.833 --> 00:33:20.867
The idea is to make it enjoyable,
fun, and learn it.

00:33:20.867 --> 00:33:22.467
Maybe you can ask him
to sing the whole song.

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:32.133
[audience cheering and clapping] 

00:33:36.667 --> 00:33:38.800
Shankar Mahadevan: That was
a Goggeling a Google.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.067
[laughter] 

00:33:49.367 --> 00:36:48.733
[singing in Hindi]

00:36:48.733 --> 00:36:49.833
[applause]

00:36:49.833 --> 00:36:50.633
Thank you so much.

00:36:50.633 --> 00:36:51.567
Thank you, thank you.

00:36:51.567 --> 00:36:55.200
[applause] 

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.933
Once again thank you
for having us over here.

00:36:57.933 --> 00:37:01.500
I hope you all enjoyed 
what we presented to you

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:07.867
and I hope some of you'll be in part of this
journey that we have started together.

00:37:07.867 --> 00:37:12.500
Sridhar Ranganathan: Okay,
so we can tell [inaudible].

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.033
The idea is to create
something that is fun,

00:37:15.033 --> 00:37:18.733
enjoyable for everybody and that's
really what we're trying to do here.

00:37:18.733 --> 00:37:22.467
We can take some questions if you
have about the Academy and such and--

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.833
Yeah?

00:37:25.833 --> 00:37:30.900
male #1: So this schedule
that [inaudible].

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.767
Shankar Mahadevan: [inaudible] 

00:37:32.767 --> 00:37:37.533
male #1: Can you tell the pitch [inaudible]

00:37:37.533 --> 00:37:38.433
Shankar: It's all there.

00:37:38.433 --> 00:37:43.033
All the pitch and everything that he gives
on the page the śruti because that it,

00:37:43.033 --> 00:37:44.933
you just saw a part of the video isn't it

00:37:44.933 --> 00:37:48.533
so she explains the page
what śruti she's using

00:37:48.533 --> 00:37:53.333
and you can learn in turn in your pitch.

00:37:53.333 --> 00:37:58.100
male #1: [inaudible]

00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.267
Shankar Mahadevan: Yes.

00:37:59.267 --> 00:38:02.267
male #1: [inaudible]

00:38:02.267 --> 00:38:05.167
Shankar Mahadevan: She'll be able to
explain better how she managed it.

00:38:05.167 --> 00:38:08.367
female student So the teacher has
[inaudible] but when he comes to me

00:38:08.367 --> 00:38:12.800
he actually remembers what my scale is
so he brings it down,

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.533
I sing, and he moves on to the next one,
he remembers what that person's pitch is.

00:38:16.533 --> 00:38:18.933
[Inaudible] don't need to tune, right?

00:38:18.933 --> 00:38:21.100
So people are singing at their own pitch.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.367
male #1: [Inaudible ]

00:38:23.367 --> 00:38:27.700
female student: Yes.
Five students are never singing together.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.333
Shankar Mahadevan: They're all there,
they're hearing the other students sing,

00:38:30.333 --> 00:38:31.833
but they never sing together.

00:38:31.833 --> 00:38:35.167
So each one can sing in their own
pitch and while the other students,

00:38:35.167 --> 00:38:39.033
my teacher used to tell me that
it's much better to learn in a group

00:38:39.033 --> 00:38:40.333
but not in a group of twenty.

00:38:40.333 --> 00:38:42.233
It's always better to learn
in a group of four or five

00:38:42.233 --> 00:38:44.900
because if you're learning alone

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.867
you start feeling that you have
arrived very soon.

00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:50.667
When you hear other students sing
you know [laughter] where you stand.

00:38:50.667 --> 00:38:54.033
So when you're in a class of four
or five you hear the other students,

00:38:54.033 --> 00:38:55.200
they inspire you.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.233
Not only that if student number
one, two, three, four,

00:38:58.233 --> 00:39:00.433
you're the first student automatically

00:39:00.433 --> 00:39:03.167
there's a kind of a [Hindi word]
that happens five times.

00:39:03.167 --> 00:39:06.167
Then you shuffle the metering
the one, two, three

00:39:06.167 --> 00:39:08.367
and then five, four, three, two, one
then three, two, five, four, one.

00:39:08.367 --> 00:39:11.700
So you just juggle the order
and you're learning already.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.667
And when it comes to you 

00:39:12.667 --> 00:39:16.400
if you're uncomfortable
in the normal class of the pitch,

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.167
pitch of the class you bring the pitch
down to your particular pitch

00:39:19.167 --> 00:39:20.500
and you practice in that.

00:39:24.833 --> 00:39:28.600
female #1: Could you say like how
your [inaudible] issues

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.667
when I go to a class it that [unintelligible]
so much more experienced right?

00:39:32.667 --> 00:39:43.100
[inaudible] How do you sort of find a fit
for the students and the teacher and --

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.367
Sridar Ranganathan: So let me answer
that wonderful questions in there.

00:39:45.367 --> 00:39:50.700
So the first thing is when you enroll
you'll see there's a age bracket

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:54.233
and then there's a gender bracket.

00:39:54.233 --> 00:40:01.600
So we try to group people who can
sing and based on age and gender.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.867
The second part is the quarters
are structured 101, 102, 103, 104

00:40:05.867 --> 00:40:09.600
and then it goes 201 to 206,
and 301 to 306,

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.067
which means you have
a diagnostic assessment.

00:40:12.067 --> 00:40:16.633
If you think you'll learn something earlier
and then you want to see where you belong

00:40:16.633 --> 00:40:18.800
you submit assessment
and the teacher says,

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:22.733
"Okay you belong in 103 or 104 or
102 or you actually start from 101

00:40:22.733 --> 00:40:25.333
because what you've learned is wrong,"
or whatever it is.

00:40:25.333 --> 00:40:30.000
And then most of the people that we are
seeing now actually start in 101, right?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.467
And then there the grouping's already done

00:40:32.467 --> 00:40:36.133
and then during the class again
like I've talked about earlier

00:40:36.133 --> 00:40:38.933
where we are trying to make this
as personal as is possible,

00:40:38.933 --> 00:40:42.467
give enough materials
personal to you to learn.

00:40:42.467 --> 00:40:45.700
We also try to group students
into okay these guys are okay,

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.733
these guys are better,
and these guys are the best.

00:40:48.733 --> 00:40:52.700
And then we try to give materials how to
move the okay into better and the best.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.567
So are particular ways of looking at this.

00:40:54.567 --> 00:40:57.333
Did I answer your question?
Yeah, okay, good.

00:40:58.467 --> 00:41:03.200
female #2: So what is like the starting age
that you recommend for kids?

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.733
Shankar Mahadevan: See kids are
damn fast in grasping things

00:41:06.733 --> 00:41:11.400
whether they understand it or don't understand
it they just learn stuff really fast.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:19.100
So I think the minute you find out that
your kid has an inclination towards music

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.867
or he reacts to music, 

00:41:20.867 --> 00:41:23.500
I think you can start playing some music
in your house already,

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.567
something that you feel that will
be comfortable in your environment

00:41:27.567 --> 00:41:30.667
and if it's a South Indian environment
people like to listen to Carnatic music

00:41:30.667 --> 00:41:32.567
or whatever or [inaudible] or whatever.

00:41:32.567 --> 00:41:36.233
And they keep on listening to it
subconsciously a lot of it goes in to it.

00:41:36.233 --> 00:41:37.500
That's my experience.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.333
My father used to do a Pooja
at four or five in the morning

00:41:41.333 --> 00:41:45.467
and all the slokars I remembered suddenly now
when I was doing some project I said,

00:41:45.467 --> 00:41:46.700
"How do I know this slokars?"

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:49.600
And I remembered that those are
the slokars which my father used to do

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.633
when I was a very small kid.

00:41:51.633 --> 00:41:54.733
So they can start at a very early age.

00:41:54.733 --> 00:41:58.833
I mean basic learning five, five and
a half, four, four and a, whatever.

00:41:58.833 --> 00:42:03.300
Some kids are really sharp so
they can start at a very early age.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:08.733
Sridar Ranganathan: Also the language
part so at three and four and five

00:42:08.733 --> 00:42:11.533
they actually pick up the language
through the music much faster

00:42:11.533 --> 00:42:14.200
because they don't really distinguish
a different language as much.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:17.900
So it's much easier to different
languages at that point in time.

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:22.300
Shankar Madadevan: And currently we just
we have students who are also about 70?

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:22.833
Sridar Ranganathan: Three.

00:42:22.833 --> 00:42:28.033
Shankar Madadevan: 73 year old
also so that is the range,

00:42:28.033 --> 00:42:33.733
bandwidth.
[laughter]

00:42:33.733 --> 00:42:35.067
Yeah.

00:42:35.067 --> 00:42:36.333
male #2: Thanks for coming to Google --

00:42:36.333 --> 00:42:36.700
Shankar Madadevan: Thanks.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:42.933
male #2: it's good to have you here.
[inaudible]

00:42:42.933 --> 00:42:44.100
Shankar Madadevan: You wanna answer that?

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:48.500
Sridar Ranganathan: Yeah, so we started we
actually started our pre-pilot with the violin

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:52.867
and then we, so the only music
book part is easy right

00:42:52.867 --> 00:42:57.367
but when it comes to WebEx what happens
is you have the bow and the fingers,

00:42:57.367 --> 00:42:58.900
finger movement, 

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.267
there is a couple of challenges there.

00:43:01.267 --> 00:43:05.667
You probably need two cameras or
if you go take a tabla two cameras.

00:43:05.667 --> 00:43:10.733
Actually the worst is, the most extreme
is like a [inaudible] or a dohl right,

00:43:10.733 --> 00:43:11.400
two hands.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.800
Now if you put the camera in the front
you can't see either, right?

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.033
You have to put two cameras.

00:43:15.033 --> 00:43:18.533
So we're experimenting it, we really
are working on the curricular part of it.

00:43:18.533 --> 00:43:23.033
But then how do you give the method of
instruction in a live class is working on.

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:25.000
So the answer is yes
it's coming [inaudible].

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.100
Even the piano, for example, is broad.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:30.200
Now how to you have multiple cameras
for that, and things like that?

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:35.533
male #2: [inaudible] [laughter]

00:43:35.533 --> 00:43:38.267
Shankar Madadevan: You know a friend
of mine is already a sitar hero in India

00:43:38.267 --> 00:43:40.100
and his name is Niladri Kumar.
Have you heard him?

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:44.133
He's truly a sitar hero,
he plays the distortion sitar.

00:43:44.133 --> 00:43:45.533
He's a rock star, yeah.

00:43:45.533 --> 00:43:49.333
Yeah but definitely the thing is
we always believe in crawl, walk,

00:43:49.333 --> 00:43:50.767
and run kind of thing.

00:43:50.767 --> 00:43:52.433
So we wanted to do it properly, 

00:43:52.433 --> 00:43:54.800
we wanted to establish this platform nicely

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.933
so that we know that the formula
is there and that the OM Book,

00:43:57.933 --> 00:44:02.567
the virtual class, the curriculum,
everything it flows one after the other.

00:44:02.567 --> 00:44:04.367
We tried for the pre-pilot,
then the pilot,

00:44:04.367 --> 00:44:05.433
then the paid pilot.

00:44:05.433 --> 00:44:06.700
So it worked very smoothly.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:11.067
So for vocal we just started for vocal,
Carnatic, Hindustani,

00:44:11.067 --> 00:44:13.433
hobby singing, devotional, chanting,

00:44:13.433 --> 00:44:14.933
all these things are starting up now.

00:44:14.933 --> 00:44:17.667
But definitely all the instruments
are coming up.

00:44:17.667 --> 00:44:21.067
But whenever we do that
we will again do a pre-pilot,

00:44:21.067 --> 00:44:22.433
a pilot, and the paid pilot, 

00:44:22.433 --> 00:44:25.533
and then you wanna follow that
so that we are doubly sure

00:44:25.533 --> 00:44:28.033
that when we launch so we don't
have complaints coming in.

00:44:28.033 --> 00:44:32.167
Sridar Ranganathan: Yeah it's like
that Carnatic music [speaking Hindi]

00:44:32.167 --> 00:44:35.567
and then the popular [speaking Hindi].

00:44:35.567 --> 00:44:37.833
So we kind of follow 
the same concept: quality first,

00:44:37.833 --> 00:44:39.933
his name is on the Academy
you wanna make sure

00:44:39.933 --> 00:44:42.633
what you do is right and proper.

00:44:45.833 --> 00:44:49.300
female #3: So I'm [inaudible]

00:44:49.300 --> 00:45:09.433
but my friend says that for me [inaudible].

00:45:09.433 --> 00:45:11.333
Sridar Ranganathan: So we
try to make the best fit.

00:45:11.333 --> 00:45:15.167
So here's the thing right, if as a consumer
if you try to choose

00:45:15.167 --> 00:45:18.200
when you actually don't know
what it is,

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:22.333
it gets harder to manage that
from even a scaling perspective.

00:45:22.333 --> 00:45:25.533
So we try to make sure that
you have the right teacher.

00:45:25.533 --> 00:45:28.333
And we also not only assess
at the end of 12 weeks

00:45:28.333 --> 00:45:31.633
we also assess continuously
how they progress.

00:45:31.633 --> 00:45:33.467
Like I said we give more materials.

00:45:33.467 --> 00:45:36.000
So teacher is a part of that
more material resources

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.967
in terms of making sure
you have the right teacher.

00:45:37.967 --> 00:45:40.200
So we manage it on the back and
we don't give you a choice

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.933
because you won't know anyway.

00:45:41.933 --> 00:45:44.933
You just have a name,
you already know names.

00:45:44.933 --> 00:45:45.700
Any other questions?

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.367
female #4: How many of the classes
is Shankar teaching?

00:45:48.367 --> 00:45:52.033
Shankar Mahadevan: Well I don't come
into any of the classes and teach myself,

00:45:52.033 --> 00:45:53.967
I come in as visiting faculty.

00:45:53.967 --> 00:46:02.233
And not only me I have spoken to many,
many, many big artists Mahagurus of India

00:46:02.233 --> 00:46:04.067
and they've all consented to come in.

00:46:04.067 --> 00:46:10.133
So suddenly you'll see Rashid Khan coming in
or suddenly you'll see [inaudible] coming in

00:46:10.133 --> 00:46:12.500
or suddenly you'll see
[inaudible] coming in

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.100
and giving a speech on his experiences.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.900
So it's gonna be extremely motivating.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.500
So we're gonna have a whole
range of people coming in

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:23.167
'cause you can't expect me to get up
every day morning at four o'clock

00:46:23.167 --> 00:46:24.533
and teach 'til ten o'clock.

00:46:24.533 --> 00:46:29.933
That's why we have chosen teachers, all
the teachers are chosen by my consent.

00:46:29.933 --> 00:46:34.000
I have personally looked into
the selection process

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.567
so these teachers are extremely competent 

00:46:36.567 --> 00:46:41.800
and my thing is choosing all these things
and coming in once in a while.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.500
Sridhar Ranganathan: And the teachers have
to go through a teacher's certification program.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.267
Not only do they have to be good in music

00:46:46.267 --> 00:46:48.733
they also have to have good
communication skills

00:46:48.733 --> 00:46:51.400
given the market that
we are going after.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.700
So it's very well choreographed
and planned.

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:55.100
Question?

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.333
Female Commentator: We can probably
take two more questions.

00:46:57.333 --> 00:46:58.367
Sridhar Ranganathan: Okay.

00:46:58.367 --> 00:46:59.600
Shankar Mahadevan: You are the boss.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.133
[laughter] 

00:47:02.133 --> 00:47:04.833
male #3: A big welcome to you at Google
and thank you for your [inaudible].

00:47:04.833 --> 00:47:06.767
Shankar Mahdevan: Thank you.

00:47:06.767 --> 00:47:11.233
male #3: For kids and even for adults
who want to join the class

00:47:11.233 --> 00:47:15.533
are there anything like camps where they
can sometimes meet the teacher in person

00:47:15.533 --> 00:47:17.767
also like maybe the teacher
is visiting here

00:47:17.767 --> 00:47:21.333
or I go to Chennai I meet the teacher there.

00:47:21.333 --> 00:47:23.900
Are there any plans [inaudible] like that?

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:24.567
Sridhar Ranganthan: It's an Academy

00:47:24.567 --> 00:47:28.267
we'll have annual programs,
contests, competitions.

00:47:28.267 --> 00:47:29.867
Like I said we just started in March.

00:47:29.867 --> 00:47:32.667
Shankar Mahadevan: It's just a month old,
we just started March 3rd but we have --

00:47:32.667 --> 00:47:33.300
Sridhar Ranganathan: Absolutely.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.167
Shankar Mahadevan: exciting plans.

00:47:34.167 --> 00:47:38.267
Actually we have a student over here
who visited she is here?

00:47:38.267 --> 00:47:39.000
commentator: Yeah, she just left.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.633
Shankar Mahadevan: She just left, okay.

00:47:40.633 --> 00:47:44.567
She got bored.
[laughter]

00:47:44.567 --> 00:47:48.433
So definitely we want to connect
with the students

00:47:48.433 --> 00:47:52.167
and if there is a spark in somebody
who's brilliant,

00:47:52.167 --> 00:47:55.300
who shows brilliance there is
an upcoming music director

00:47:55.300 --> 00:48:01.067
and he visiting so we can
definitely work with. [laughter]

00:48:01.067 --> 00:48:06.500
Sridhar Ranganathan: Two more questions.

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.467
male in audience: She had her hand up.

00:48:08.467 --> 00:48:13.700
female #6: While you are teaching
[inaudible] do you also have [inaudible] --

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:17.033
Shankar Mahadevan: Oh yeah how
can you not have,

00:48:17.033 --> 00:48:21.800
it's like the four wheels of a car
they have to be of the correct pressure,

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:22.867
tire pressure, it's like that.

00:48:22.867 --> 00:48:25.967
So taal as important as your
raag or śruti or anything.

00:48:25.967 --> 00:48:28.933
So everything that is required
along with your śruti

00:48:28.933 --> 00:48:31.033
especially when you learn Carnatic
music from the word go

00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:36.867
they start doing this [speaking in Hindi]
every week corresponds to a note.

00:48:36.867 --> 00:48:41.600
So it's done the proper way and
taal is as important as your śruti.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:46.300
They say that [speaking in Hindi]
you can even start singing in [inaudible]

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:49.300
but if you're taal is really weak
from the time you're born

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:56.200
so might as well try agriculture or fishing -- [laughter] yeah.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.233
Sridar Ranganathan: Or technology.
[laughter]

00:48:57.233 --> 00:49:01.567
Shankar Mahadevan: Ah.
[laughter]

00:49:01.567 --> 00:49:03.033
Sridar Ranganthan: Yeah.

00:49:03.033 --> 00:49:07.433
male #4: So one of the long
term plans for the academy?

00:49:07.433 --> 00:49:14.100
I see that there's a technology
aspect to [inaudible] --

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:14.900
Sridar Ranganthan: A what?

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:20.133
male #4: --a cost
so there's a cost

00:49:20.133 --> 00:49:25.500
and most of the people outside of
here are I think would be okay that.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:30.933
But for India do you
have some different plans?

00:49:30.933 --> 00:49:34.633
Sridar Ranganthan: Yeah,
so in the two-pronged plans:

00:49:34.633 --> 00:49:38.667
one is how do we work
with corporations and schools

00:49:38.667 --> 00:49:43.200
in getting offline Shankar Mahadevan Academy
centers with probably our own centers.

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:46.600
So those are things like I said
by the time we build-- get a land,

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.233
build a building, do this that
and it takes a long time.

00:49:49.233 --> 00:49:51.267
So but we will get definitely
online first,

00:49:51.267 --> 00:49:52.633
but we have those plans.

00:49:52.633 --> 00:49:58.100
In the online space of it it's key
that it's priced differently

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:02.300
so those are things that
we are working on for India.

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.367
Shankar Mahadevan: And soon we'll
be opening up to the rest of the world

00:50:04.367 --> 00:50:09.200
so we'll be, just manage
the virtual class bit,

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.100
the timings and everything,
match accordingly,

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.833
we already have something called

00:50:13.833 --> 00:50:17.833
they are acoustically designed boards
as we call it in Bangalore right now

00:50:17.833 --> 00:50:21.100
where the teachers come and they sit
there and they have high speed Internet,

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:22.500
there's a camera, 
there's a light everything.

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.433
So it's all organized right now.

00:50:24.433 --> 00:50:26.033
But that is for the U.S.A.

00:50:26.033 --> 00:50:30.200
So similarly there are logistics planned
it's a matter of just applying ourselves.

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.100
Sridar Ranganathan: There is a acoustic part

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.867
where you don't hear dogs barking
or crows -- [laughter]

00:50:33.867 --> 00:50:37.000
Shankar Mahadevan: Traffic in Bombay's
is great now so. [laughter]

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.967
Sridar Ranganathan: We get one more question.
Last question.

00:50:38.967 --> 00:50:40.400
Yeah.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.867
female #7: [unintelligible]

00:50:42.867 --> 00:50:45.800
This is amazing and I want to
thank you so much for being here.

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.433
Shankar Mahadevan: Thanks.
Sridar Ranganathan: Thanks.

00:50:47.433 --> 00:50:51.833
female #7: What I especially liked [inaudible] entire demo

00:50:51.833 --> 00:50:54.933
and you kind of [inaudible] everybody
and teach them.

00:50:54.933 --> 00:50:59.067
It's kind of like the little like expressions
that you talk about,

00:50:59.067 --> 00:51:03.167
the anxiety or just in general feeling
that you go deeper into a song

00:51:03.167 --> 00:51:10.733
and so I was just really happy to see that
also being conveyed the electronic quality.

00:51:10.733 --> 00:51:14.633
Shankar Madadevan: Okay boss [inaudible].
[laughter]

00:51:14.633 --> 00:51:17.100
Sridar Ranganathan: Actually that is
an important point that you bring up.

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:20.167
See the thing is now you can buy a CD,
you can go to YouTube,

00:51:20.167 --> 00:51:23.567
you can do so many places
where you can get the song.

00:51:23.567 --> 00:51:27.267
What is the value,
why do you even do this?

00:51:27.267 --> 00:51:30.933
We went through a lot of that sort
of thinking about it making sure

00:51:30.933 --> 00:51:36.433
there is huge value for you
in learning the song.

00:51:36.433 --> 00:51:37.467
This was started by Shankar 

00:51:37.467 --> 00:51:41.300
but then the same thing is done
for each song by different artists

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.300
who can actually help you
pick up the nuances,

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:48.433
the expressions, the emotions
that you connect and all that.

00:51:48.433 --> 00:51:48.933
Thank you.

00:51:48.933 --> 00:51:49.733
Shankar Mahadevan: Thank you very much.

00:51:49.733 --> 00:51:50.333
Thank you.

00:51:50.333 --> 00:51:51.400
Sridar Ranganathan: Thank you guys.

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:56.600
[applause] 

00:51:58.267 --> 00:51:59.833
commentator: If you wanna sign up
for the Academy

00:51:59.833 --> 00:52:03.200
I guess [inaudible] so you can just-- 

00:52:18.333 --> 00:52:19.033
Shankar Mahadevan: Hello.

00:52:19.033 --> 00:52:20.333
I'll sing probably you sing with me.

00:52:20.333 --> 00:52:20.933

00:52:20.933 --> 00:52:23.933
in unison: Yeah.

00:52:23.933 --> 00:52:28.833
Shankar Mahadevan: I'll sing one line you're
allowed to sing [inaudible]. [laughter]

00:52:28.833 --> 00:52:31.000
Okay I need the rhythm because I don't
have any instruments over here

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.300
so you're beat will be my rhythm.

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.833
Okay, one, two, three.

00:52:35.833 --> 00:52:38.067

00:52:38.067 --> 00:53:25.667

00:53:25.667 --> 00:53:27.933
[applause and cheering]

00:53:27.933 --> 00:53:29.333
That was for India.

00:53:29.333 --> 00:53:31.767
So let's hear it for [speaking in Hindi].

00:53:31.767 --> 00:53:33.133
audience: Yea!
00:53:33.133,00:00:00.000
