00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.420
Now, Helen, you're going
to do an experiment here.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:03.900
There's your sample of blood.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:04.410
That.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.595
Your sample of blood there.

00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:07.720
And it's got a mixture of
different sorts of cells.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.300
You'll get hold of that, right?

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.980
Now, you're going
to pour it in here.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.160
Pour it in there.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.830
All the way in.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.015
All the way in.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.140
And let's see what happens.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.765
All the way in.

00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:18.130
Let's see what happens.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.300
You see what happens?

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.640
The white cells, those,
they stay up above.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.500
And the red cells, they've
gone to the bottom.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.000
We've got a salt
solution in there

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.299
that's just right to
separate the white cells

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.470
from the red cells.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.027
Thank you very much, Helen.

00:00:35.027 --> 00:00:37.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.440
So that's the way we do it
with a real sample of blood.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.260
And let's show you
how that works.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.560
We've got a solution here that's
just like that salt solution.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.380
And here's our sample
of blood, and Cynthia's

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.460
going to hold it for
me so I can show you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.030
that the first thing that we
do is we're going to layer

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.025
that blood on this solution.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.240
So I'm going to layer
this slowly onto this--

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.200
onto the solution,
and you'll see

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.670
what happens, that if I do
it carefully and slowly,

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.470
it'll just sit there on top.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.510
Because the density
is such that that's

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.280
where it sits to start with.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.640
Thank you very much.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.280
So you see it sitting there.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.100
Now, we've got a
sample that we did

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.730
just that with some time ago.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.000
Let me show you what's happened
in the time since we did it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.660
You see?

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.850
There's the sample
to which we did that.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.670
And already you can see that
just sitting in the stand,

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.265
a lot of the red cells
have started to sediment.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.760
And you're beginning to see
something accumulating there.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.880
Now, if we help that
process by spinning

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.540
that tube in a centrifuge to
let things settle out quickly,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.300
then we get the following
result.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.320
This is what we get.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.840
The final process.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.460
Now, can you see that?

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.270
The red cells all at the
bottom, the clean remainder

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.470
of the blood there.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.370
And there's our layer in the
middle of the lymphocytes,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.530
just like we showed you
in that model experiment.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.340
So that's how we can
separate the lymphocytes

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.500
from the rest of the
blood and recover

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.820
them to work with, to
establish what their types are.
