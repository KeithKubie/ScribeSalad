00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.830
- [Instructor] When my father told me

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.400
that I was a bad driver,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.860
I responded with only when
your sitting next to me.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.620
All right, so let's think about this.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.750
We have your underlined, so
what are we trying to say?

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.440
Only when your sitting next to me.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.760
So it sounds okay, but
really when we're saying

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.900
your sitting next to me,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.510
we're trying to say you're as short for

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.970
you are sitting next to me,

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.310
only when you are sitting next to me,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.980
and that wouldn't be this your.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.130
That would be the contraction

00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:35.920
Y-O-U apostrophe R-E.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.140
This is you are.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.970
This is a contraction for you are,

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.900
so this is what we would want here.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.800
We wouldn't want this.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.210
They sound the same, that's your.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.080
You pronounce this your as well.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.000
Only when you're, you
are, sitting next to me.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.710
We don't want Y-O-U-R.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.337
Y-O-U-R, this is second
person referring to you,

00:00:58.395 --> 00:01:00.307
but it's something you have, your,

00:01:00.307 --> 00:01:02.052
so it's second-person possessive,

00:01:02.052 --> 00:01:05.219
so this is a second-person possessive.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.980
This is if we're talking
about something that you had

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.700
or I responded with if they're
talking to their father,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.160
something that their father
only when, I don't know,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.197
your watch is on or something.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.500
It's indicating some type of possession,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.900
so this is second-person
possessive right over here

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.300
which we do not want over there.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.850
This is one of those mistakes
that I know I've done

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.240
even though I know it if
someone points it to me

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.410
or even if I look carefully, of course.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.050
This is you are, while this is possessive,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.480
but sometimes when you're
typing emails really fast,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.550
this is a very easy mistake to do

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.490
because sometimes you
just type as things sound,

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.770
but this, we definitely
want to go with you are.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.263
We want to go with you're,
the contraction for you are.
