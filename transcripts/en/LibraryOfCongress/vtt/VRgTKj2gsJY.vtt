00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.440
All right, everybody comfy?

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.170
Everybody happy?

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.470
Everybody ready for an
international Women's Day treat?

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.520
I am just going to introduce myself
because I want to maximize the time

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.430
that I have with all of you.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.100
I could not be more honored and
delighted to have the opportunity

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.880
to speak in the Library of Congress
about my area of specialization

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.020
on Women's Day, in Women's History
month at a moment when women

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.950
in Congress are on
strike and marching out.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.640
It's just a great day to
celebrate feminist voices raised.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.960
And I am going to tell you just
a little bit about who I am

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.170
and what I do, about
the exhibit that I have

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.390
in the Jefferson Building, thanks
to Meg Metcalf who has assisted me

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.910
in bringing so much to
display and exhibit.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.050
And then I am going to play
you a bunch of little samples

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.050 position:56%
with this ancient item that's called
a tape player from the 20th century.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.670
And I'll explain what all the
ephemera is that I schlepped

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.020
up to Capitol Hill
bewildering people on Metro.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.330
So I am a women's history
professor and I am part time at GW,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.230
part time at Georgetown
for 22 years.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.860
And my area of interest in women's
history is the women's music

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.860
movement of the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.000
And this is a much
misunderstood phenomenon

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.340
which is now just old enough to
start being archived and made

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.280
into a sort of serious
topic of study.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.210
And it's a very awkward moment

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.630
because there's been critical
backlash against, what are for me,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.780
very beloved institutions like the
Michigan Womyn's Music Festival

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.090
and a lot of interrogation of
how inclusive women's music was.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.310
It always has been and we
are also in Washington,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.860
DC very much connected to
local institutions, people,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.670
artists that made women's
music the success it is.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.630
Olivia records was founded
just a few miles from here.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.840
DC is the base of Sweet
Honey and the Rock,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.300
which just lost its premier sign
language interpreter Mama Shirley

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.330 position:56%
so we are very sad about her passing
and I dedicate today's talk to her.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.040
We're located near one of
the best one day festivals

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.670
that was ever organized and
that was SisterFire produced

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.080
by Amy Horowitz and Roadwork.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.000
Boden Sandstrom started the
first woman sound company here.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.350
This is a really rich region
for looking at people,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.750
places and things in women's music.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.680
And what I want to do is try
to make this a more visible

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.720
and serious topic of scholarly
inquiry and popular appreciation.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.680
And I have been introducing
sound tracks in my lectures

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.940
for a really long time
and travelling

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.000
around the country doing
readings from articles I've done,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.410
interviews with artists, histories

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.170
of different women's
production companies.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.090
And what I have is only a tiny inch
of what is in my house right now.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.400
I have one of the best archives

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.910
in the United States
of this whole subject.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.260
And beginning at the end of January
I was permitted to have a display

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.750
in the Great North Hall of a couple
of glass cases showing a little bit

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.320
of the timeline of
feminist music and sound.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.170
And I am going to try
and expand on that.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.680
I brought a few more
things from my house.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.030
But, at your leisure, you can go
over there and look at what kind

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.010 position:56%
of begins with suffrage protest
music and goes right through to punk

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.210
and there's fantastic items

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.600
from of course the Library
of Congress collection.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.010
And they include the sheet music
to Loretta Lynn's, The Pill,

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:44.180
as well as some of the original
albums by Alex Dobkin and some

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.510
of the zines that were
the only media

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.490
to promote women's music,
Hot Wire, Paid My Dues.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.630
And we also have on display some
recordings by the group Betty,

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.020
a DC based trio of dynamic women.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.280
So, I am going to just start
a little bit, oh my gosh,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.100
with the origins of women's
music and what I have

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.170
out on the table is
pretty self-explanatory,

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.920
but I will explain anyway.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.120
Ah, we really begin with drumming.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.800
Drumming is one of the
most ancient of the ways

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.710
that women created sound, very much
like the heartbeat and the baby

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.920
that lies in the womb, but
also often off limits to women

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.540
who were not permitted to
join male only rituals,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.720
celebrations, and drum training.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.580
And that remains a very
frustrating issue for many women

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.400
in different tribes globally
from the South Pacific to Africa.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.600
And in the spaces around
band instrumental training,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.110
we find women turning to the
obvious lullabies and passing along

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.870
to their babies both soothing
sounds and whispered information,

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.960
whispered information you know
that was often in a secret language

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.230
where women even were not permitted
the regular language of the men.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.610
That was very true in my personal
heritage, Jewish tradition

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.500
where in Eastern Europe men
spoke of serious things in Hebrew

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.590
and women said rude things
about guys in Yiddish.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.930 position:56%
And the Yiddish lullabies are filled
with despair about the unreliability

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.750
of men and that was considered a
women's language or the mamalotion,

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.350
and I will give you a little
sample of that in a minute.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.150
By the time we get
to the Middle Ages,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.500
what we have is a curious issue

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.300
where women are composing sacred
music and it's very beautiful.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.020
As nuns, they can go to
a convent or a sisterhood

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.970
of living, different kinds.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.520
The baekings are a
different kind of convent.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.870
They were allowed to own
property and eventually leave.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.690
But all of these women were
forbidden to sing in front of men

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:08.160
and by really pretty early
in history there's a ban

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.210
on men listening to
women's voices with the idea

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.250
that it could turn them, arouse
them, you know, what have you.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.940
One of the few contemporary
artifacts about this,

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.290
this is from a Hasidic community
that I studied in grad school,

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.180
Rabbinic Advisory, Woman Singing.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.930
Okay, so this would be on an
album warning young religious men,

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.920
don't buy this album, there
are women on it, you know.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:44.970
Okay, yeah I know, so we have
let's say compositions by someone

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.150
like Hildegard of Bingen.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:55.080
And her recordings are available
to us now, if I can find them.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.730
Ah, here we go.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.990
And this is a, she's obviously
not really available to us

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:07.500
at you know DAR Constitution Hall
right now, but she's reminded,

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.290
ah we have access to her
recordings through compilations.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:17.560 position:56%
This is called Joan of Arc and it is
all music that was dedicated to Mary

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.180 position:56%
from the Middle Ages and it includes
some of Hildegard's compositions

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.290
and other songs about the
hardship of being a female.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:32.220
By the time we get to the Middle
Ages and a little bit after,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.890
we also have well-known songs
that are passed woman to woman

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:43.020
that are very much about the
trauma of an unplanned pregnancy.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.750
So many women were burned as
witches, so many women were charged

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.660
with deviant, sinful behavior
and burned at the stake.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:57.590 position:56%
And one of my colleagues and
friends in grad school, Deb Symonds,

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:01.180
did her dissertation
on Scotts Ballads

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.090
about illegitimate
birth and infanticide.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.120
And that is the book on the table
that's called "Weep Not for Me."

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.870 position:56%
Those songs were very much trickling
down into contemporary folk tunes

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.550 position:56%
and that's something that's familiar
to many of you from Mary Hamilton.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:24.380
Mary Hamilton's Birth the
Babe and the queen says,

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.070
"Get up Mary Hamilton, get
up and follow me for I'm gone

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.330
to Edinbro Town and
I'm gonna tell the King

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.370
and Queen about your situation."

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.080
That is all over England and
Ireland so it's indication

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.280
that women were singing about
their situations to each other.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.040
It was just rarely written down and
it was a warning to younger women.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.440
So we have you know sort of
proto feminist music that's

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.850
about the reality of the body and
the reality of living conditions,

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.240
in particular, all over the world.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.520 position:56%
Where there is constant warfare,
there are absent men that women pine

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.920
for and then there are
men who come in and invade

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.730
and they invade physically.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.110
And those realities
are captured in song.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.010
And obviously in the
American version,

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:17.120
what we have in the early
America are slave songs and songs

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.850 position:56%
of survival and struggle and escape.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.840
And the people who have studied
slave songs and work songs

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.440
of course have done
enormous, meticulous research

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.670
on what was the music
that was actually a map

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.300
to the underground
railroad and how to navigate

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.310
to freedom by looking at the stars.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.090
And the most famous example there
is, follow the drinking gourd,

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.830 position:56%
and of course that's the Big Dipper.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.840
I always get chills when
I write, speak about that.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.380
That's such an important
piece of our musical history.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:55.930
So by the time we get to
the Era of Immigration,

00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.770
we start to get scratchy
recorded music, a little bit,

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:07.370
and there's one group, Libana
that has done a sort of recreation

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:12.850
of sweatshop songs by women
more than a hundred years ago

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.490
and these are in Yiddish and
I'll just play you a tiny sample.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.670 position:56%
A woman is singing I am so
exhausted, when am I going to sleep?

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:20.970
This is never ending.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:24.220
I am always going to
be you know a tailor.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:53.030
[Music plays] Okay sorry I can't
do more than just a little bit.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:12:10.940
I have so much stuff.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:17.260
But I can talk about anything that
you hear today that interests you.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.450
I will be happy to go
on for quite a while.

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:25.500
When we get to the era of
suffrage, we actually have

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:31.590
down in the other exhibit some
sheet music from suffrage songs

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.370
which are just fantastic.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.880
And World War I is a great
time to study opinionated women

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.130
because there were women who were
for the war, against the war,

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.150
women who said I don't even
want to talk about the war.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.710
Let's get the vote first before
I lift a finger for Wilson.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.520
And one of my favorite songs
is Who Dares to Put a Musket

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.530
on His Shoulder which was a women's
complaint that without the vote

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:58.310
or any political input, she was
having to sacrifice her sons.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.630
Mothers were very hostile
to the Great War

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:06.430
because it introduced three
horrifying new weapons of warfare.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.330
No one had ever seen
before the machine gun,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.540
mustard gas which was the
beginning of chemical warfare,

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.920
and then the U boat, the
undersea boat that could

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.140
of course sink pleasure
ships like the Lusitania.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.840
And so suffrage songs are the first
sort of recorded feminist music

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.810
in terms of how we
see the first wave

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.010
and the second wave, and so forth.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.930
But a lot of that is specific
to a kind of community

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.390
of activists of white women.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:42.720
Over here we also have
eventually the Harlem Renaissance

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.850
which is going to record
very outspoken Blues

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:53.230
and living outside the
law, songs of survival

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:58.210
from African American women, a lot
of gay women, and people meeting

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.110
in speakeasies where
they could speak easy.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.550
So the interesting thing about
prohibition is it brought black

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.970
and white, straight
and gay together.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.710
Because everyone was a criminal
as soon as you wanted to drink,

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.920
and that was a great equalizer.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:16.110
So one of the most marvelous
things that I found is an example

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:22.770 position:56%
of a party mix tape that someone put
together and I bought from a catalog

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.850
when I was fifteen and
it's called Reefer Songs.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:32.750
Trixie Smith saying I'm so high.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.320
A little contrast to
Yiddish suffering,

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.750
if we could just get
them together, you know.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:40.090
[Music plays] I'm so high,
I'm so high [Music plays].

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.730
All right, kinda fun.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:52.720
This is from Smithsonian
Folkway, no Rosetta Records, okay.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:59.950
This is Jailhouse Blues and
this is an amazing compilation

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:30.740
from the Mississippi Department
of Archives and History.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:43.680
It's from 1936 and this would
be a woman's penitentiary

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:51.810
where the women were put at hard
labor and a lot of the songs are

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:56.710 position:56%
about relationships, people who sold
them out and then there are songs

00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:03.690
that are original, composed behind
bars, and then there are work songs

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.700
that allow women to, like men
on a chain gang or on railroad,

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.430
use rhythm and chanting to
focus on repetitive tasks

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:12.730
that you can't say no to.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:14.340
[Music plays] Alright,
I really like that one.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:19.680
There's a lot on here that's
referential to prostitution

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.860
and the inevitability of when
a woman had nothing else,

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.760 position:56%
having to sell herself and so forth.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.320
That's called, Does Anyone
Here Want to Buy Some Cabbage?

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:51.200
And that's a song that could
be disguised as a market song

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:58.240
but it's about something else.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.240
Thanks for your patience.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:20.110
I'm trying not to walk away
from that mic too much.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:30.690
This is just the beginning
of a really rich literature.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:34.800
Angela Davis of course is the one
who produced that amazing text

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.800
of which I teach, Blues
Legacy and Black Feminism.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:47.930
And of course a lot of the
material reminds us that very early

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:53.300
in the twenties, we have
singing about loving other women.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:58.190
And it's been a wonderful thing in
the better climate of LGBT rights

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:04.770
for people to be able to do
research on the earliest songs

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.860
about women in relationships.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:12.480
Some of them are very sly
and slash overtly sexual,

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.070
shocking to us today.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:18.470
A very popular inner war tune

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:22.780
which Lillean Faderman rediscovered
was called the Boy in the Boat,

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:30.250
a euphemism for love making and it
warned men who went off to the wars

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:34.840
that while you are away,
the women are swimmin, okay?

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.370
And then we have the very famous
Prove it On Me Blues, Bessie Smith

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:46.040
and various other women who
sang this which not only talks

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:52.290
about cross dressing, but the
fact unless you're caught,

00:18:52.290 --> 00:19:05.320
nobody could prove you were gay and
get you into trouble with the law.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:13.880
This is not the original, this is
the cover version by Faith Nolan

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:19.660 position:56%
who became a big, popular
Afro-Canadian star of women's music.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:26.080
Whoops, play, have to
do it upside down too.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.380
[Music plays...Must have been
women because I don't like men.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.680
It' true I wear a collar and a tie.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.980
I like to watch the women
when they walk ...] Okay,

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.200
sorry you know this
is a tape of a tape

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:44.680
of a tape and this is what we do.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:52.370
Everything else is
more or less original

00:19:52.370 --> 00:20:00.700
and of course people
also send me stuff

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:07.320
because they know I'm interested.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:16.710
Okay, this is great.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:27.010
The era of the twenties series,
we have women really speaking out.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:33.570
They are talking about being in
love with women, they are dealing

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:45.820
with abuse from men,
they are fighting back,

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:52.510
how do you earn a living, how
do you live outside the lie,

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.700
how do you deal with segregation?

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.900
We are all familiar with the song
Strange Fruit about lynching.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.920 position:56%
But despite the inevitability of
separating women under Jim Crow Law,

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.650
we actually have another moment

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:10.520
of very positive integration
beyond drinking and illegal clubs.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.420
That is World War II
when the men go away,

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.570
so do many of the big band players

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:21.200
and they are drafted
and women substitute.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.680
And one of the greatest
stories, of course,

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:32.130
is the International Sweethearts of
Rhythm which was a mixed race band,

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:40.980 position:56%
very daring, very difficult for them
to find places to stay on the road.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:45.950
They included a very famous
trumpet player, Tiny Davis,

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:51.160
who was very in love
with her partner,

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:59.050 position:56%
Ruby and there's a whole video about
their lives called, Tiny and Ruby,

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.390
Hell Divin' Women and
they are just fabulous.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:06.560
That is the subject of quite a
number of films and commentary,

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.380
but I'll give you a little bit
of their coolness [Music plays].

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.120
Let's get a little bit
more of the whole band.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.090
[Music plays] This is an all-female
orchestra and that's Tiny Davis.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:59.060 position:56%
Okay, so you can see that we have
not a straight line, but a wavy line

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:12.570
of female empowerment
leading right up to

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:32.000
where people think women's
music begins which is

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.280
with the folk protest
songs of the 1950s.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:45.390
And on the table I have a
tribute to some other blues women.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:49.970
But I also have the memoir by the
recently deceased Ronnie Gilbert

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.830
who performed with the
Weavers, great lady

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:57.160 position:56%
and of course they were black-listed
and investigated actually

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.870
by the House on American
Activities Committee.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:04.570
That was the beginning of a
folk revival where many people

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.310
because of the investigation

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:11.240
of our government became alerted
folk concerts were a great place

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:16.040
to meet other progressives or
to dare to mix interracially.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.960
There was not very much

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.520
of an effective gay rights
movement at that point.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.560
There was the beginnings though
of a Civil Rights protest movement

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.530
that would bring people
out of the house

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.690
to see difference as
less frightening.

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:35.510
And in this era we have a couple
of women who really emerge

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:41.400
as recognizable figures and that
would include Malvina Reynolds,

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.530
Little Boxes, and she did a song
called We Don't Need the Men

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:50.860
and a whole lot of commentary
on what she saw as conformity

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:54.760
in the era and the need
for people to rise.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.380
And after that, the cat is
out of the bag so to speak.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:04.430
So where I sort of come into this
history would be the beginning

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.700
of the 1960s with peace
marching parents

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.480
who never stopped playing
Joan Baez albums.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.800
And through the voices
of women in the house,

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:22.130
I came to recognize union songs,
anti-war music, music about women

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:28.330
who had lost men to
war, draft resistance.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:33.030
Eventually Judy Collins, much
later on, recorded a song

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.390
about having an abortion.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:39.110
That was not something I
heard as a kid but a lot

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:44.950
of those vocalizations made it
possible for me to naturally

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:49.360
to respond to women's music when
it sort of begins in the 70s.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.910
So, what do we call women's music?

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:58.030
Women's music revives in the
early 70s as a kind of response

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:01.490
to the belittlement of
women in rock and roll

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:05.410
where many women were treated
as groupies, as sex objects,

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:10.800
there were a lot of otherwise, you
know, radical and hip male bands

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.120
that sang about women in
sexually demeaning ways.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:18.540
A really good example, the beloved
Rolling Stones, Under My Thumb,

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:19.870
yes there is a problem with that.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:24.300
And even my beloved, beloved
Led Zepplin, way down inside,

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.920
I'm going to give you
every inch of my love.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.260
Really? Okay.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:33.970
So anyhow, the response to that was
that women began to compose songs

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.400 position:56%
about their lives that were original

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.430
and that investigated
the issues of the day.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:44.490
And one of the first
was Mountain Moving Day

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:46.050
and that album is out there.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:51.240
That was 1972 and that
was the New Haven

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.180
and Chicago Women's
Liberation Rock Bands.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:27:00.060
And those are a combination of
songs about sexual harassment,

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:04.980
contraception, abuse in the
home, talking back to patriarchy.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.450
It's just thrilling.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.130
And the title is symbolic,
the mountain is awake

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.380
and women are on the move.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:18.670
That followed a commercially
successful all women's band, Fanny,

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.110
with June Millington who now owns
a rock and roll camp for girls

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.290
in Massachusetts, as a top 40 hit.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:29.790
But the feminist music
begins in '72,

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:33.930
and then in '73 we get Olivia
Records and that is the great,

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:39.800
great story that has
brought me into activism.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.510
The story of Olivia is that
a collective of women living

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:45.700
in the Furies House here in DC

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:51.790 position:56%
who were radical lesbian separatists
interviewed a visiting performer,

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:57.460
Cris Williamson on Georgetown's
Radio Free Woman Program.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:02.310 position:56%
And during that interview, Cris
Williamson sort of turned the tables

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:06.100
on the woman interviewing
her and said what do you do?

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.450
And the Furies said
everything we do is about women.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:12.960
We create institutions, we want
women to be able to do things

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.190
on their own without relying
on men, and on the air,

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:19.780
Cris said why don't you start
a women's recording company?

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.190
And they did the next day.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:26.620
So that was Olivia Records
which was the beginning

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.790 position:56%
of a woman-owned production company.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:34.370 position:56%
It is now Olivia Travel and Olivia
Cruises where I often guest lecture.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:38.860
And that was very much under
the leadership of Judy Dlugacz

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:43.600
who is still the head of Olivia
and their interest was in trying

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:48.390 position:56%
to have concerts for women only that
would be uplifting and supportive,

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:53.260 position:56%
but also which would name the ways
that women were beginning to be open

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.950
about loving one another.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:58.950
And it was a very dramatic change
from what existed at the time.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:03.070
You had to find women to do sound
and do lighting and production

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.670
and all of those skills had
been off limits to women.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:11.670 position:56%
And eventually Boden Sandstrom Women
Sound Company which she cofounded

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:14.240
with Casey Culver and
another woman began

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.530
to do the sound for these events.

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:20.100
And Olivia's first album,
well actually I have some

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.740
of the original forty-five
singles there,

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.590
it's the rarest thing on the bench.

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:29.230
They recorded Meg Christian's,
I Know You Know,

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:33.060
which is a really fantastic album.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.740
And it was followed by Cris
Williamson's, The Changer

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.470
and the Changed, which to this day
is the best-selling women's music

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.240
album of all time.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.070
This was great, but where are
these women going to perform?

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:50.860
And who's going to review
them and distribute the music?

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.170
There was no coverage
in the mainstream

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:54.850
of this movement in the 70s.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.700
There was no real way to promote
it without putting women at risk

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:02.250
as soon as it was identified
as something gay.

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:07.440
You could lose your job, your
custody, your standing in church,

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:11.210
your role in a school,
everything if you just showed

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.460
up at a Holly Near concert.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:17.700
So a lot of this history
has a very slim paper trail

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.560
which is very frustrating
to me as a historian.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.770
As things digitize, all

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:25.800
that a researcher will find
is what has been digitized

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.830
so far, not the complete story.

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:31.820
And the complete story of these
recordings is women playing

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:35.380
in other women's living
rooms with the shades drawn.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.150
And it's in women's scrapbooks.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:41.700
It's in photos, it's in
memories, it is in oral tradition

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.230
which we have to get now.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:46.400
So I'm adamant about interviewing
women who went to concerts

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.290
and their lives were changed.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.990 position:56%
And it didn't necessarily have to be

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.500
about the intimacy
of a relationship.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.760
A lot of what women will
say "saved their lives" was

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.720
that the women's music concert
phenomena was an alternative

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.070
to the bars.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:07.630
So it was before Facebook, a space
for the underage and the sober.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:11.040
The music on stage openly
named everything that radio

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.650
and news would not talk about
whether it be domestic violence

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:20.740
or incest, or the lack
of fair wages for women,

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:25.620
things we're still dealing
with now, being an athlete,

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:32.670
being a mom who comes after her
kids, being somebody who is poor,

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:37.580
learning to understand
a person who's ethnicity

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.890 position:56%
and race is different from your own,

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.610
being able to consider
running for office.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.840
This doesn't really sound
like you could dance to it,

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:49.240
but actually you could,
you really could, okay?

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:55.060
And a little bit of
our local beloved,

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.440
and now missing an interpreter
group, Sweet Honey in the Rock.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:03.810
Here's an example of naming that
stuff in a way you could move to.

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:15.890 position:56%
Hang on, by the time this is over, I
will figure out what button to push!

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:17.190
There we go.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:22.960
So this is Sweet Honey in
the Rock [Music plays].

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.890
Alright, that's a song
for something.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:31.220
Wow, so what's up with WPFW?

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:47.350
Well this is a great little rare
thing from the Washington Blade.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:55.220
Radio Free Women was kicked off
of Georgetown because they talked

00:32:55.220 --> 00:33:02.620
about contraception on the air
and eventually that was not comfy

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:08.780
at a Jesuit Institution,
one where I now teach.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:15.430
But anyhow the radio station had to
change so the women moved to WPFW

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:17.730
and that became Sophie's Parlor

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:22.240
which is stlll a women's
music show today.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:29.070
So that's really a wonderful
tribute, again thanks to the power

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:33.420
of local organizing in
facilitating the growth

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:39.180
of the women's music movement.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:48.960
So on the bench, what I have are a
whole bunch of the albums that came

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:53.900
out of the 70s, some of
which were speech albums.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:58.410
And the rare ones include
Olivia Records made an album

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:02.610
that was poetry by Judy
Grahn and Pat Parker,

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:05.850
Where Would I Be Without You?

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.400
So we have a black and a
white poet reading their work

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.700
on the Olivia label.

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:18.640 position:56%
There was also a March on Washington
in 1979 and '87 and '93 and 2000

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:24.330
and there's a recorded album
from the '79 March for Gay Rights

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:29.550
which is really the
first of its kind.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:33.680
There was also the first
recording of a festival

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.130
and that was the SisterFire Album.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:43.900
But, in 1977, Olivia also
put out a very famous album

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:50.100
with an orange juice can on
the cover, Lesbian Concentrate.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:54.710
And that was in response
to Anita Hill's campaign

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:56.430 position:56%
to roll back gay rights protections.

00:34:56.430 --> 00:35:00.520 position:56%
And that was a wonderful compilation

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.690
of all the Olivia artists
at the time.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:09.660
That's a real collector's item now
and a really fun album to play.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:13.090
So who was covering all this?

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:16.970
Hardly anyone in the press, except
for two different zines one,

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:21.380
Paid My Dues and then that was
followed by Hot Wire, and Hot Wire,

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:27.040
under the direction of my friend
and mentor, Toni Armstrong Jr.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.130
That I have to go and get.

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:33.790
So what we have in the display case

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.930
over in the Jefferson
Building is this issue.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:37.690
This is my friend Sherry
Hicks on the cover

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:40.900
who is a sign language interpreter.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:49.740
And each issue of Hot Wire came
with a sampler so you could hear 3

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:55.470
or 4 cuts, this is presuming
everyone had a record player.

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:58.580
And you could be introduced
to the music

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:15.550
and this would cover what was going
on, uh oh there's a photo of me

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.860
and my mom at a women's
music festival.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:24.640
This is an article I wrote, I
Brought Mom to the Festival.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:35.490
Women's music festivals which began
in 1974 with National in Illinois

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:45.740
and then Michigan in 1976 were able
to bring all these artists together

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:53.270
and offer you, you know, a
slate of performances that went

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:58.310
over a whole weekend and
then eventually a week.

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:06.810
And you could hear as many
concerts as came with your ticket,

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:13.250
relax on a blanket with your
loved one, go to workshops

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:18.980
on fighting patriarchy or how
to learn karate or compost.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:28.120
There were many more, but those
are kind of the archetypes.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:34.430
I led quite a few on topics
ranging from Jewish Women's History

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.680
to you know journal keeping.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:44.020
But at festivals, many women
also shared production, touring,

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:46.660
how do you launch a career

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.820
as a controversial
person without much help.

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:52.120
Even if you are one of the
best artists of your time,

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.210 position:56%
the mainstream will not promote you.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:58.780
And these conversations
happened for years.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:02.770
Of all the people that
performed in festival culture,

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:07.410
four became household names and
those would be the Indigo Girls,

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.850 position:56%
Melissa Etheridge and Tracy Chapman.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:15.040
And then others had become
better known depending

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:21.780 position:56%
if you are a Canadian or in England,
Jill Sobule is a good example.

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:26.310
But the problem of course was
that rock media was not interested

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:30.640
in women's music, which was
considered too soft a sound

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.660
or man hating or what have you.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:37.260
And even our own Ms.
Magazine shocked,

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:43.150
shocked to say did not put Cris
Williamson on the cover until 1980

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:46.660
with this concept, The New
Stars of Women's Music.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:53.310
Yes, she had a best-selling album
in 1974, a little bit late, okay.

00:38:53.310 --> 00:39:01.540
Most horrifying we get something
like this Spin, The Girl Issue,

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.860
which includes some of, I know,
which includes some of the women

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.590
who were performing then,
all over the country,

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:10.390
really articulating
issues of womanhood.

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:14.180
But they were always
reduced to being as fragile

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:17.170 position:56%
or feminine or whatever as possible.

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:23.300
And then you get something
that's even more obscuring, TIME,

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.150
Macho Music is Out, Empathy is In

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:28.380
and the All-Female Lilith
Festival is Taking Rocks New Sound

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:29.680
on the Road.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.770
So this new sound comes 22 years

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:36.540
after everybody else
has started a movement.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:40.610
Jewel never performed in Michigan,
Lilith is not the first festival.

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:46.590
Everything about this is forgive
me, alternative facts, okay.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:49.490
And I'm sorry to say we
just see no end of it.

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:53.180 position:56%
Every couple of years, somebody says
the new sound of feminist music,

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:58.110
even my beloved Washington
Post, okay.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:02.160
Ouch, A Street Harassment,
right, This Band has Songs

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.800
for All of That, 2016, okay.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.140
So there's very little
historic research.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.810
There's a lot of laziness.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:18.110
I finally got an article Hey Forty
Years of the Women's Music Movement

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:22.380
and Hey Women's Music, You're
Turning 40 in Ms. Magazine,

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:25.860
the soundtrack of lesbian feminism.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:29.130
So I'm very proud of that and
that only took them 100 years.

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:33.670
And what's surprising is that
you will find terrific advocates

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:35.290
in the strangest places.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:40.100
And indeed some of them are
sympathetic men and it is great,

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:44.370
so Parade, that little thing that
comes in your little newspaper,

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:46.620 position:56%
you don't think of that as a hot bed

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.290
of radical insight
but groove on this.

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:55.470
Somebody wrote in to Walter Scott's
Parade, "Why are the Runaways

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:59.530
of recent movie fame presented as
the first all-female rock group?

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.480
Wasn't that Fanny?

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.700
This is a really smart
writer who knows about Fanny.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.380
And listen to the response.

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.750 position:56%
Oh yeah, but even before Fanny there
was Goldie and the Gingerbreads,

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:12.740
the first all women rock band
signed to a major record label,

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.360
Decca in 1963 and then he goes

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.030
on to give the complete
history like I just gave you.

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:23.310
So Walter Scott, who
knew, long may he live.

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:26.960
And likewise in recent
years students have begun

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.310
to write dissertations
on this movement

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:32.450
and it's gotten a little
bit more, more attention.

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:38.670
Okay, just a few more things and
then I'll let you ask questions.

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:41.410
While festival culture
begins to burgeon,

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:42.930
it's not enough to have two.

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:48.170 position:56%
We start having festivals in every
state so that local women don't have

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:51.440
to pay the expense of flying
to Michigan or Illinois.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.910
So, we had by the late 80s,

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:59.120
festivals in almost every state
including Alaska and Hawaii.

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:04.210
That included Camp Fest, the New
England Women's Music Festival,

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:08.730
the Maine Music Festival,
Lonestar Women's Music Festival

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:12.320
in Texas, WomenFest in New Mexico.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.550
Robin Tyler had two
festivals, the West Coast

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:19.100
and the Southern Women's
Comedy and Music Fest.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.230
There was one in Mississippi
that was attacked by locals

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:24.060
and they were threatened violently.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:27.630
I worked there for ten
years, Camp Sister Spirit.

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:38.890
A festival in Iowa, one in the
SisterSpace, Pocono Weekend

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:44.080 position:56%
in Pennsylvania...I'm leaving things
out and I'm going to be killed,

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.520
one in the Pacific Northwest.

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:52.020
All of them were completely run
by women with lighting and sound

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:55.060
and one of the most beautiful
artifacts I own is one

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:59.950
of Casey Cohen's light plots
for how to light women on stage

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:03.800 position:56%
for the Michigan Festival and
that's down at the end of the table.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:08.350
So, by 1999, I published the
first book on women's music

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:11.040
and festival culture
and I wanted to ask,

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.530
Why is this important
to the audience?

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:16.730
I wanted to highlight the
performers and the producers.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:20.410
I wanted to give credit, but
I was primarily interested

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:24.080
in what the music meant to the
women whose lives had changed.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:28.990
And starting from the mid-80s, I
would go to festivals, take notes,

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:34.150
tape record everybody's comments
at the mic, take photographs,

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:36.060
and I also passed around
a blank book.

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.890
What does this culture mean to you?

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:40.190
Why are you listening?

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:41.490
Why are you here?

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:42.790
How has it changed you?

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:44.090
What will you remember?

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:51.400 position:56%
And I will show you just an example.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:59.550
I filled up about five
of these, just passing it

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:03.250
around in a night stage audience
with complete trust, saying,

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:06.670
"Write what you want to say and
just bring it back to my towel

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:08.370
at the end of the concert.

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:12.030
And you know other women were
like partying and making out

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:15.620
and having ice cream and I'm
doing homework in the dark.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.940
But, I'm really glad I did.

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:24.450
And on this one occasion,
the very last page ended up,

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:29.110
"I loved everything about
Michigan," Alice Walker,

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:32.740
sitting behind me,
and I had no idea.

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:37.730
So yeah, careful with
that one, right?

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:42.810
Okay, there is so much music that
I could choose to play for you

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:46.180 position:56%
and what I wanna do is just point
out a few things and then I am going

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:49.660
to play two more samples then
I will let you ask questions.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.370
One of the things that's
happened with women's music is

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:55.040
that it has really
expanded internationally,

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.920
meaning that we have
a feminist movement

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:00.060
with women vocalizing
their concerns now

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:01.770
that we have do it
yourself recording.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:05.790
So, I have music from
the Sami people who used

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:12.250 position:56%
to be called Laplanders, indigenous
to Scandinavia; a very famous album,

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:17.910
Stop Excision by women in
Malawi about the problem

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:24.090
of female mutilation; and then
a really important recording.

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:35.200
This is the Irish band, Zrazy

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:42.650
and I will tell you what you
are hearing [Music plays].

00:45:42.650 --> 00:46:42.840
67947 double 0, 67947 double 0,
it's a phone number [Music plays].

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:55.400
Okay, that is a disco
hit of the phone number

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.730 position:56%
for abortion information in Ireland.

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:04.890 position:56%
It was illegal to publish that phone
number in print, so they made a song

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:09.060
that every woman would remember.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.620
That is one of the most
brilliant contemporary returns

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:16.150
to the oral tradition of the past,
can't print the number anywhere

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:21.800
in a paper, illegal to
share, hum it, 6794700, okay.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:26.660
Likewise, a really rad band that I
love, Girls in the Nose, responded.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:32.740
In one particular year, there was
a real series of beloved women

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:36.040
at the Michigan Festival who
passed due to breast cancer,

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.670
so a really rad band
led by Kate Turner

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:45.020
who is a folklorist made
a rock hit out of how

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.610
to give yourself a breast exam.

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:52.270
And we will just wrap
it up with this.

00:47:52.270 --> 00:48:01.400
I love that I am playing this
in Federal space [Music plays].

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:19.540 position:56%
Okay so she was giving instructions
on how to make a breast exam erotic.

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:39.680
Now you are not going to find this
on you know public television.

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:53.540
Okay, well I have so much more
but I am really mindful that some

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:57.290
of you might have questions.

00:48:57.290 --> 00:49:03.240
And I want to explain a little
bit about the handout everyone got

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.550
and offer a final fun thing.

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:13.330
I tried to type up a little take
away, but I also wanted folks

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:17.500
to have this cartoon
by Allison Beckdell

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:22.900
who of course now has
a hit, Fun Home,

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:26.320 position:56%
at National Theatre and on Broadway.

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:30.250
In... I'm sorry I have a few more.

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:33.710
In this panel, we see the
awakening of the young woman,

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:41.500
what is necessary to the young
woman coming out in college

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:45.560
at Beckdell's age, and she
and I are the same age.

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:51.000
When you have to be reading
gynecology by Mary Daily,

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.700
and you are listening
to Alex Dobkin,

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.900
The Woman in Your Life,
on the turn table.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:04.560 position:56%
So it's a really terrific expression
of how the cultural material

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:10.230
of the time cannot be separated
from the awakening experience.

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:20.730
And I am so sorry, pass that back
to those who did not get one.

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:25.610
And what I would like to offer
is, before you leave today,

00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:29.980
I have this tiny rare
thing, a stamp I bought

00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:34.980
at my very first Michigan Festival,
Harmony Through Women's Music.

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:40.590
And I can stamp your
little program, if you want.

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:45.460
And that is something that's not
being manufactured much anymore.

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.870
So where does it go from here?

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:50.560
I've donated quite a few items,

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:54.790
in particular Woody Simmons Oregon
Mountains which is so great,

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:59.370
Maxine's Feldman's Closet Sale,
some back issues of Hot Wire,

00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:03.340
one of Casey's light plots,
the Ladyslipper Catalog

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:06.960
which distributed through
secret mail all this music,

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.070
donated a whole lot of that
to the Library of Congress.

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:11.370
But, my whole collection is willed

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:13.580
to the Schlesinger
Library at Radcliff.

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:16.920
And they came to me, which is
really nice and they are now

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.750
in the business of beginning
to digitize the three hundred

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:24.350
and eighty recordings all of
which are on cassettes that I made

00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:27.990
over the past thirty
years interviewing artists

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:30.690
and taping sounds at festivals.

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:36.270 position:56%
So, plenty of work ahead and I will
pause there and thank you very much.

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:37.570
[Applause] Oh, yes.

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:46.930
Who has a question?

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:54.590
Nobody? Let me put on my
professorial looking glasses.

00:51:54.590 --> 00:52:00.550
Yes, hi. And where do you
see women's music today?

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:05.020
Yeah, well um, the
problem is as I see it,

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:11.190
is that before we can properly
credit and praise the women

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:14.840
who created all this, we
are in an overlap moment

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:18.490
where the focus is very
much on trans rights.

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:20.130
And there is a big backlash

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:23.710
with if you google different
aspects of women's music.

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:26.220
Younger women are sort
of interrogating it

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:28.390
as it's not inclusionary.

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:32.230
So, there is a kind of
generational dismissal.

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:34.910
And I think in another ten years
people are going to come back

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:37.380
and go, Oh my God, I wish I
could have gone to Michigan.

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.120
We are going to be like uh huh.

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:43.820
But, the thing about people
who are now second generation,

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:47.420
Kathleen Hanna and LeTigre
are still doing concerts.

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:50.210
They have like a little
women's history spin.

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:54.260
Then we have women you know
who are very proud to identify

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:56.700
as feminists on the airwaves.

00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:00.370
We have very different
versions of all of this

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:02.270
with different new artists.

00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:05.020
And thank you for coming.

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:09.260
We have lots of different
movements in different countries

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:11.580
that are just beginning
to dare to record.

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:14.640
So some of the stuff I put out
there, All Female Orchestra

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:18.990
in Afghanistan Dares to
Defy the Taliban, okay.

00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:26.650
So women are finding a way to
pass along statements of change

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:31.950
in different means across cultures.

00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:34.420
So there is going to be much more.

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:38.410
Obviously I have this ancient
kind of tech so I can listen

00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:41.890
to all my old tapes
and albums and my CDs.

00:53:41.890 --> 00:53:44.830
I don't even own an ipod.

00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:49.220
I'm really 20th century
but I'm also mindful

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:52.460
that many women are
beginning to pass.

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:57.590
We've lost Kay Gardner, Ronnie
Gilbert, etc. so my job is to run

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:03.010
around the country as energetically
as possible and archive everybody

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:07.970
and I'm hoping next to do a book on
women who did feminist radio shows.

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:11.560
And I have been invited
by Pacifica Radio Archives

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.470
to do a book based
on their material.

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:17.290
So I'm going to California
in May and I am going

00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:18.890
to live there for a while.

00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:25.020
And I'm actually being interviewed
on KPFK in LA Saturday night.

00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.330
This is Wednesday, right?

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:29.510
Next question?

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:38.430
Yeah, hi. Women's music
festivals often had controversies.

00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:41.000
Can you talk about that?

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Sure, all of them always did.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.310
In the beginning it was should
men be allowed, then boy children,

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:53.460
then what about smoking, then
what about, you know, leather

00:54:53.460 --> 00:55:02.650
and etcetera, what about the
problem of racism, what about women

00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:06.140
who couldn't afford to
attend who tried to sneak in,

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:09.090
then what about keeping
it safe for children

00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:11.320
as more mommies brought babies

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:15.530
and other women were still
desperately trying to party,

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:23.250
then the question of, you know, do
you openly encourage trans women

00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:25.390
or do you have, in
the case of Michigan,

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:28.780
a primarily clothing optional
festival that a lot of women went

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:31.750
to heal from sexual
assault and didn't want

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:34.730
to see anyone with male genitalia.

00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:40.570
That was written up in
cyberspace in really brutal ways

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:42.650 position:56%
which were not fair to the festival.

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:46.970
Other festivals always had men
attending or were open to anybody

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:51.650
because they were primarily clothed
or in a dorm or a university space.

00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:53.790
My Dad went to SisterFire.

00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:56.510
He took his shirt off
and got yelled at

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:59.270
and was told hey, we
can't, so you can't.

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:01.580
And boy, he learned that day.

00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:05.030
My Mom went to nine
different festivals with me.

00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:08.440
That's how I ended up writing an
article about mothers at festivals.

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:09.920
Ah, she is a very beautiful woman.

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:11.940
She was hit on and
she had to just walk

00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:15.270
around with her wedding
ring out like this.

00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:19.840 position:56%
She went to Michigan, two nationals,
two Camp Fests, two Virginias,

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:24.970
one SisterFire and she was able
to meet Ronnie Gilbert who was one

00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:28.660
of the few artists of her
generation or older and they spoke

00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:32.620
to each other in Yiddish
which was so cool.

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:36.530 position:56%
As fast as I can write the Wikipedia
page for the Michigan Festival,

00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:38.870
someone comes in and
rewrites it negatively,

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:40.920
so it's a constant struggle.

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:45.650
And my argument in the my
latest book, The Disappearing L,

00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:50.840
is that it's difficult to keep
up the pace when at the touch

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:55.850
of a button someone can vilify a
culture and send it to millions

00:56:55.850 --> 00:57:00.540
as opposed to the limited archives
that we are trying to get online

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:05.550 position:56%
that are really accurate which have
to be vetted by people who are still

00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:08.340
at risk of losing their
jobs if they come out.

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:12.520
And the photos within festival
culture often included nudity,

00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:15.160
how do you get everyone's
permission, what about children

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:18.640
of moms who are dragged to
festivals against their will

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.190
and are now conservative.

00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:23.350
I mean it's really a
sort of historian's,

00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:25.430
I don't want to say
nightmare because I love it,

00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:28.240
but it's a challenge,
it's a workout.

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:34.540
And being fair to everyone is
a constant moral test for me.

00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:37.260
That's a great question.

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:44.240
Yeah, hi. Hi, can you
name some of the top bands

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:50.940
that you feel are important in the
history and also how do you feel

00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:55.730
that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
in Cleveland treats this subject.

00:57:55.730 --> 00:58:00.400
Oh my God, it's so
frustrating, very frustrating.

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.030
I'm glad you asked about punk.

00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:04.130
We put punk in the display.

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:05.980
Pretty in Punk is a
book I have taught.

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:07.280
That's there.

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:18.330
Punk bands, my golly, everything
from, okay, Team Dresh, Tribe 8,

00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:28.430
LeTigre, hang on a second, uh, they
are in that film about Seattle.

00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:31.100
O boy, I don't have this
written down in front

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:34.460
of me, Seven Year Bitch, okay.

00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:36.530
A lot of them have playful names.

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:39.560
And you have to really go into the
Lady Slipper Catalog to see some

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:47.050
of the rare ones, the
Yeastie Girls, Brat Attack.

00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:50.970
There's a quite a few
compilations that I have.

00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:53.250
They are amazing, but
that was controversial.

00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:55.280
That was seen as scary
to a lot of women

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:58.640
who really wanted women's
music to be gentle and sweet.

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:02.260
And Lynn Breedlove who was
the lead singer in Tribe 8

00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:06.550
and the title is a
sly play on trabidism,

00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:10.350
ancient Greek term for
Lesbian lovemaking.

00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:16.820
Tribe 8 had a spokeswoman who
said, you know we may offend

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:19.630
because we're loud and angry,
but we're all rape survivors

00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:22.550
and when we jump around on stage
and yell a lot, we feel better

00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:25.550
and that's their presentation.

00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:28.620
Their presentation allowed
a lot of other women to get

00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:32.440
up a do a mosh pit which then
had to be constructed at Michigan

00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:36.960 position:56%
and that was controversial because
what about the women in wheel chairs

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:39.530
who are right down front
and they could not mosh

00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:43.900
and the dust was getting...I
mean how is everyone included?

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:47.120
What if you wanted to
dive, do a stage dive,

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:50.330
and you know you were paraplegic?

00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:52.240
We accommodate that, okay?

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.510
Um, how is everyone included?

00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:59.240
Yeah. And the first time I dove off
the stage and you know was carried

00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.900
around on everyone's
shoulders screaming and yelling

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.050
in my plaid flannel shirt,
it was just heaven on earth.

01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:08.620
The next time I landed on my head
because people were distracted

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.940
and I realized yeah
this could not be good.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:15.020
But that was part of making
sure at Michigan in particular,

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.950
which is really the gold standard,

01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:21.660
every genre of music you
would have salsa and big bands

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:28.500
and instrumental, you had comedy,
you had blues, and latina and jazz

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:34.030 position:56%
and you had in particular
international groups, everyone from,

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:39.460
representing Maori, New
Zealand to China, Hawaii.

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:49.880
One of my favorite experiences
was a native American band Ulali

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:55.380
and they are just one of
quite a few that played there.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:59.160
So having everybody,
but punk definitely.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:05.100 position:56%
And the latest years that would have
included well a kind of combination

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:09.150
of rap, I would say more rap
than punk, Goddess and She,

01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:12.120
Krudas Cubensi which is from Cuba,

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:18.010
and then really astounding
impresario performers.

01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:24.190
Anyway, it's a great
question and I have much more.

01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:26.960
I just have to do a
little looking up of facts.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:32.420
Yes. Just as sort of a followup, I
was thinking of asking about genre.

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:35.480
When you mentioned Holly
Near, I mean she sort

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:42.970
of to most people embodies the
idea of what women's music is,

01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:45.510
but my question is, and
as you have implied,

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:46.970 position:56%
that is probably largely constructed

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:50.430
by the mainstream audience
in certain ways.

01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:53.320
To what extent was there any sense

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.690
of a musical taste
or sound within this?

01:01:57.690 --> 01:01:59.820
What an awesome question.

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:03.160
So here I have on the
table Kay Gardner's,

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.260
Sounding the Inner Landscape.

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:10.360
And Kay was a performer, played
the flute, was very popular,

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:14.920
also played on Alex Dobkin's
album Lavender Jane Loves Women.

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.330
Kay argues as, you
know, a musicologist

01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:21.900
that there is a specific
female sound and a kind

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:26.630
of circular sound structure
in women's performance.

01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:31.880
And she gets very academic with
how if you look at ancient culture,

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:35.790
the sound for what is holy is both
the first sounds we are capable

01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:43.450
to make as infants and how the
sacred Hebrew for God, Yahweh,

01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:49.350
is just AIOU, Yahweh, right,
and many other theories.

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:51.740
That is a certain kind of sound.

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:57.630
Women who were looking for
something more physically akin

01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:02.700
to a drumbeat often complained
that you know women's music was not

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:06.340
for them, but then they
created and added in.

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:10.220
And one of my favorite performers,
Sue Fink, very famously said,

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.240
"I don't think we have
women's music,

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.070
we have a women's music audience."

01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:18.860
So that women would show up,
the same women would show

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:23.800
up for very different styles once
they were, you know, available.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.940
And I think that's still true.

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:30.510
And the interesting thing about
Holly's music, Holly records a lot

01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:34.430
of songs about you know
Nicaragua and so forth

01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:35.920
that maybe you're not going

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.030
to play while you are
relaxing in the bathtub.

01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:40.430
Because you know they have
the intention of anthems,

01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:43.280
get up and join a work
brigade you know

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:48.160
and in other music the performer
would not be as political on stage

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:54.610
but also might be less verbose and
more a different kind of sound.

01:03:54.610 --> 01:03:58.740
And I eventually became
friends with all these people

01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:02.500
and became you know a
biographer of my heroines,

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:06.270
which is a really great job,
but a big responsibility.

01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:08.810
So how everybody wants
to be remembered,

01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:11.830
they all want to be
remembered as broader

01:04:11.830 --> 01:04:15.050
in range than their stereotypes.

01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:16.440
Yeah, Philip, hi.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:20.500 position:56%
I am not going to get real specific,
but what was it about The Changer

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.640
and the Change that made it such
a breakout hit or that made it

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.930
such a big album during its time?

01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:30.730
Well it had all of these anthems,
Sweet Woman, Rising Inside,

01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:33.780
I mean various explicit songs
about women in love with each other

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.660
and then, you know,
Song of the Soul,

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:39.940
where everybody is singing
together, we will sing this song,

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:43.720
stuff that made everyone
both the particular,

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.770
I am in love with someone
specific, and the movement,

01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:49.700
there's a whole lot
of women like me.

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:57.020
That I think, both the individual
feeling of awakening and somebody

01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:02.480
who was again trained as a
composer and a classical pianist

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:08.170
who had amazing skill
and still is performing.

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:14.250
She has got a new album out now
and that was also sort of an event,

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:19.630
like you would then wait to go
to this concert and what happened

01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:21.270
in the audience was
just as important

01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:23.760
as what was going on onstage.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.290
And it was like that for me.

01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:29.060
I saw my first concert at the Bayou
under the bridge in Georgetown,

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:32.730
it's an ice cream parlor now.

01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:36.830 position:56%
And you know, even in my first
concert, I was writing in my journal

01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:39.330
and in my latest book
I talk about that.

01:05:39.330 --> 01:05:42.390
It's rude to write through
an artist's performance,

01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:44.660
but I wanted to describe
everything because what

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:47.030
if it stopped at any moment.

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:51.000
Nobody was writing about it, no
one was publishing that I knew.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.490
It could disappear at any moment,

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:55.540
and I write that I just
wanted to bottle it like wine.

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:58.480
How many other people
were feeling like me?

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.580
And everyone in the audience was,

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:07.380
so that kind of shared experience
was very well captured in the sort

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:12.620
of harmonies that Cris
created and all of the people

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.450
on that album are just stellar.

01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:19.870
And then the critique that it
was a very white band and some

01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:24.310
of the main performers were as well
was answered by Olivia which put

01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:27.980
on a tour in '75, The
Varied Voices of Black Women

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:32.090
which took Linda Tillery and
Mary Watkins and Pat Parker

01:06:32.090 --> 01:06:38.540
and Gwen Avery and others on tour
around the Bay area and beyond.

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:41.490
Some of that is in
the other exhibit too.

01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:49.050
So the appeal of Changer and the
Change I think is a combination

01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:54.410
of artistry and that the lyrics
speak to anybody who is coming

01:06:54.410 --> 01:07:00.110 position:56%
into what was unspeakable, following
in love with another woman.

01:07:00.110 --> 01:07:03.300
Yes, out of time.

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:05.550
I am out of time, what can I do?

01:07:05.550 --> 01:07:09.800
I can stand here, thank you,
and take questions personally.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:12.220
Okay, thank you all.

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:14.750
This was a wonderful experience.

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:20.030
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the library of congress.
