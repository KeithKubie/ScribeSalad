[APPLAUSE]

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.680
SAMORN SELIM: Thank
you, Nealeigh.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.060
Raise your hand if you
wake up feeling every day,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.916
I can't wait to be my
awesome self at work.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.010
I hear a lot of chuckle.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.880
Now, raise your hand if you
want to wake up feeling,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.524
I can't wait to be my
awesome self at work.

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:31.730
Awesome.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.390
I've got everybody on there.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.590
Welcome to Authentically
You-- Taking

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.530
Charge of your Personal Brand.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.130
And before we dive
into the program,

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.410
I want to take a moment
to thank a few people who

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.980
made this happen--
Nealeigh Mitchell, Kelsey

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.440
Buncher, and Emily Swarts
for making this happen.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.624
I know you guys are
really busy, and the fact

00:01:49.624 --> 00:01:51.540
that you're taking this
initiative to put this

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.630
together means a lot.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.777
So if you guys can stand
up, and if we can just

00:01:54.777 --> 00:01:56.860
give them a round of
applause for their hard work.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.690
And then, I also want to thank
Google for providing this.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.590
I think it's amazing
that a company as great

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.259
as Google, that's known to be
one of the greatest employers,

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.740
is still continuing to
invest in its employees

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.080
by providing the space and the
resources to make this happen.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.720
So if we can just give Uncle
Google a big round of applause,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.219
too.

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.496
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:23.870
And I also want
to take this time

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.010
to acknowledge each
and every one of you

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.540
for coming live and also
connecting via live stream.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.540
I know all of you
are incredibly busy.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.750
I was just hearing about your
long commutes for some of you.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.590
And you could be out there
taking pictures with the iBOT

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.910
or going to the gym.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.820
And the fact that you're
here says a lot about you

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.550
and your commitment
to your career.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.140
So a big round of
applause for you.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.672
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:52.130
And I want to take
this opportunity

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.080
to do something that, I think,
we often don't do, especially

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.484
for people who are high
performers like yourselves.

00:02:57.484 --> 00:02:59.650
That's the reason why you're
at a great organization

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.200
like Google.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.699
So I want you to
trust me with this.

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:03.615
If you can raise your
hands really wide--

00:03:03.615 --> 00:03:05.240
and while you're at
it, try not to talk

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.800
to the person on the
right or the left--

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.007
and just to give yourself a big
hug and say, I'm so awesome.

00:03:12.007 --> 00:03:12.840
I couldn't hear you.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.548
Let's do it together
again one more time.

00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:18.640
1, 2, 3-- I'm so awesome.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.420
Yeah, and that's just a
great reminder for yourself.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.840
I love seeing the smiles.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.080
Just that can give
you so much energy.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.230
I think sometimes when we're in
the busy of doing and getting

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.450
things done, you forget to
acknowledge how amazing you are

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.640
and how far you've come.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.000
So if you just have this
practice once a day,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.610
maybe first thing in the
morning, that will really help

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.450
jump-start your day.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.290
So when I started my career--
I struggled very much

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.950
in my career.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.560
I had this mentality that I have
to put my head down and work

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.920
really hard and
be humble and not

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.920
bother anybody because
everybody is really busy.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.100
Who can relate to this?

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.610
It's everybody in the room.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.190
Everybody is really busy.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.246
And I was the first in my
family to go to college

00:04:00.246 --> 00:04:01.620
and to go to
professional school.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.840
So I didn't really have anybody
I could talk to, to say hey,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.190
I'm running into this issue.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.550
How can I solve that?

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.730
So I became known for being
really reliable, really

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.720
dependable.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.610
And that was great because
I got a lot of good work.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.089
How many can relate to that--
that the reward of good work

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.231
is more work?

00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:20.980
It's everybody in this room.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.320
They're like,
yeah, that happens.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.210
But on the flip
side what was not

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.110
so great about having that
reputation was that on Fridays

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.260
at 9:00 PM, when there
was an urgent project,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.020
guess who got a call?

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.520
Me.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.190
And I'm assuming a lot of
you are also in that shoes,

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.690
as well.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.650
Right-- where you're the ones
who are known to be reliable

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.850
and so you're getting this call?

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.100
And so what happens is it
creates a really frustrating

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.510
environment where you're
feeling tired and overworked

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.600
and underappreciated
because people are so busy,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.900
they forget to thank you or
to really acknowledge you

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.492
for your contributions.

00:04:50.492 --> 00:04:51.950
And at the same
time, what I saw is

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.290
that when it came time
for raises and promotions,

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.880
I wasn't necessarily getting the
best raises or best promotions.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.250
And a big part of that was
because I kept my head down.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.833
I didn't talk to anybody, and I
didn't want to bother anybody.

00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:05.920
So nobody knew that
I was doing anything,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.420
other than that I
was getting things

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.326
done when they needed it done.

00:05:09.326 --> 00:05:11.450
And so I found myself in
a place where I was really

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.180
frustrated and exhausted and
just really wondering what

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.810
I was going to do in my career.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.336
How many of you at some point in
your career can relate to that?

00:05:20.336 --> 00:05:23.230
It's almost everybody in here.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.780
And it wasn't until I worked
with a leadership coach

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.220
where she helped me to question
my assumptions and my values

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.240
and what it meant to be humble,
what it meant to be authentic,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.100
and what it meant
to be a hard worker

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.620
and then to devise some
key strategies where I made

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.410
some small changes
in the way I interact

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.910
with people that had
a huge impact-- that I

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.070
was able to see my life
and my career transform.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.760
And I was so
inspired by the work

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.160
that she was able to do with me.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.730
And that inspired me
to become a coach.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.580
And now, I have the
privilege of being

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.590
able to help my clients go
from being stuck or frustrated

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.750
or waking up with
dread or maybe feeling

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.490
a little bored at work-- to
go from that space to being

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.250
at a place where they're getting
that dream job that they want,

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.314
to go into that space where they
wake up excited to go to work.

00:06:06.314 --> 00:06:07.730
And they're getting
the promotions

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.060
and raises that they so worked
hard for and deserve, and most

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.245
importantly, to be happy.

00:06:13.245 --> 00:06:14.620
And I'm really
excited to be here

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.250
to share those
strategies with you.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.500
We have a short, now, 45
minutes together because I

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.240
know we started a little late.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.160
So I'm going to give
you my best stuff,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.800
but I also know that we won't
be able to cover everything.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.550
I will try to reserve
a little bit of time

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.200
afterwards for questions.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.700
And we'll hang out
afterwards if you

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.510
have questions that you don't
want to ask in the audience

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.080
and want to ask privately.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.160
And if you have
questions beyond that,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.210
feel free to always email me at
samorn@samornselimcoaching.com.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.510
I do read every email
that comes through.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.810
So what we're going
to cover today

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.950
is what is your personal brand.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.970
Why does your
personal brand matter?

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.510
How does authenticity fit
with your personal brand?

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.280
And then, with all
that information,

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.425
what do you want to do
with that personal brand?

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.780
So what is the personal brand?

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.277
Anybody recognize who that is?

00:07:03.277 --> 00:07:03.860
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.720
SAMORN SELIM: Yeah?

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.810
Yeah, somebody raise their hand.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:06.310
Awesome.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.346
Who is that person?

00:07:07.346 --> 00:07:08.340
AUDIENCE: Oprah.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.320
SAMORN SELIM: Oprah.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.030
Yes, everybody recognizes Oprah.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.380
So when you see
Oprah-- her picture--

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.370
or hear her name, what
are some words that you

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.630
associate with her?

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.950
AUDIENCE: Success.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.490
SAMORN SELIM: Success.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.337
What else?

00:07:22.337 --> 00:07:23.170
AUDIENCE: Confident.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.360
SAMORN SELIM: Confident.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.425
AUDIENCE: She's loved.

00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:26.591
SAMORN SELIM: What was that?

00:07:26.591 --> 00:07:27.473
AUDIENCE: She's loved
by other people.

00:07:27.473 --> 00:07:28.477
People like her.

00:07:28.477 --> 00:07:29.810
SAMORN SELIM: Yeah, she's loved.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.150
Yeah, she's loved.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.300
So what is the consistent
theme that you're

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.591
hearing in the words that
are being described to Oprah?

00:07:35.591 --> 00:07:38.579
Would you say it's positive,
negative, or neutral?

00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:39.370
AUDIENCE: Positive.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.350
SAMORN SELIM: Positive.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.690
Oprah has a very
strong personal brand.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.420
And if you know
her backstory, she

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.630
started from very
humble beginnings.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.580
But she had a strong
vision about who she was

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.880
and what she stands for.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.420
And now, she's been able to
build this amazing empire

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.530
where, in a moment's notice,
she can put you on her book club

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.500
list and go from an unknown
author to being a "New York

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.620
Times" bestseller overnight.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.330
Now, some of you might
say, well, that's cool,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.750
but that's Oprah.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.400
What does that
have to do with me?

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.650
Similarly, in your
own career, if you

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.370
have a strong
personal brand, you

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.050
can really have the ability
to make things happen

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:15.830
and to help accelerate
your career.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.830
Or if you have a negative
association with your brand,

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.480
guess what?

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.470
That could also prevent you
from being able to be promoted

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.480
or being able to get to work
on projects that you might want

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.100
to have or even being able
to have good relationships

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.190
with your coworkers.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.030
So that's the value of a brand.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.720
And I want to bring
up an example of one

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.258
of my recent clients.

00:08:35.258 --> 00:08:37.049
One of my recent clients
that I worked with

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.400
is an attorney who
works at a tech company.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.960
How many attorneys
are in the room?

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.049
I think one person in the back.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:46.325
Any engineers in the room?

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:47.460
We've got all engineers.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:47.959
I love it.

00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:50.360
It's going to be like the
fight battle between engineers

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.370
and lawyers.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.090
So a common story that I hear
from my engineering clients

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.750
is I really hate talking
to those lawyers.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.312
Who can relate to that?

00:08:58.312 --> 00:08:59.910
I think everybody, right?

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.313
They're roadblockers.

00:09:01.313 --> 00:09:02.854
They don't understand
the technology.

00:09:02.854 --> 00:09:05.190
And it's really a waste of time.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.440
So that's a common response
I hear from my engineering

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.206
clients.

00:09:08.206 --> 00:09:09.580
And then, on the
other hand, what

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.920
I hear from my lawyer
clients is those engineers,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.120
they're really smart.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.100
They're so brilliant.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.800
They make amazing
products, but they

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.820
have no clue how they're
screwing our company

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.570
for millions and
gazillions of dollars

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.250
because they won't ever
talk to us when they're

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.460
doing these licensing deals.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.240
Or they won't patent
these projects.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.487
And so this is a common
conversation that goes on

00:09:29.487 --> 00:09:30.570
between these two clients.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.153
It's funny because I get to sit
behind closed doors with them,

00:09:33.153 --> 00:09:35.880
and I'm like, wow, this comes
up almost every single instance.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.690
And so what happens is there's
a cat and mouse game where

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.780
an issue comes up,
lawyer calls engineer,

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.830
engineer avoids lawyer, and that
loop kind of goes on-- creates

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.540
a very frustrating situation.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.060
And we have basically
zero productivity,

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.634
and in fact, what I argue
is negative productivity

00:09:51.634 --> 00:09:53.300
because who would be
frustrated in that?

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.454
How many of you would
be frustrated with that?

00:09:55.454 --> 00:09:56.120
I see everybody.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.328
Almost everybody's hand's up.

00:09:57.328 --> 00:09:58.840
Yes, it's a
frustrating situation.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.862
So what you end
up with is energy

00:10:00.862 --> 00:10:02.320
where you're spending
a lot of time

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.490
being frustrated with each
other and not a lot gets done.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.170
And then, something
big might go wrong

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.544
because you're
not communicating.

00:10:08.544 --> 00:10:10.050
There is a
communication breakdown.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.240
So this particular
client went in knowing

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.740
that this is something
that typically happens.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.130
And so what we devised in
terms of a strategy for him

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.670
was instead of approaching
the engineers only

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.540
when there was a problem with
the legal issues to actually go

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.860
and get to know the engineers.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.374
So this lawyer went to a
lot of the brainstorms.

00:10:28.374 --> 00:10:30.040
Sometimes he understood
what's going on,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.081
sometimes he was like, I
don't know what this is.

00:10:32.081 --> 00:10:33.940
But he made friends
when he was there.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.500
And what he would do is
invite these engineers

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.560
to go to coffees or
to go to lunches.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.360
And through this
process, what he

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.880
was able to do is ask
them about their lives

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.290
actually care about them as a
human being-- how about that,

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:50.290
right-- and then ask them,
what are you working on?

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.730
What's going on there?

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.560
And point blank say, what can I,
as a lawyer, and our legal team

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.520
do to support you and
to better communicate

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.811
with you because we're really
here to partner with you.

00:10:59.811 --> 00:11:01.215
And we really want to help you.

00:11:01.215 --> 00:11:03.890
And through that process and
through consistent-- and this

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.770
is the key-- consistent
interactions in this way,

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.760
he was able to develop a really
strong relationship with them.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.690
And so instead now, when
he calls the engineers,

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.390
they actually pick
up his phone call.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.720
And instead of being
seen as a roadblocker,

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.980
he's actually seen
as a true partner.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.470
And what's also really
interesting is that now when

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.840
the engineers have problems,
they actually call him and say,

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.820
hey, we're running
into this issue.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.550
Do you think you
can give us a hand?

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.020
And so through those
positive associations

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.360
with his personal brand,
he was able to transform it

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.860
from a negative
association of being

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.690
a negative roadblocker to
being somebody who's positive

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.570
and a true partnership.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.630
And so he's able to,
in his day-to-day life,

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.540
decrease frustration and
increase productivity

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.070
and have more time to be able
to revel in the successes

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.180
that he has.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.180
And how does that
benefit his career?

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.430
His supervisors now
know him as somebody

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.350
who is a problem solver,
who can connect with others.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.459
And so he becomes
a go-to person when

00:11:59.459 --> 00:12:01.750
the legal team needs to work
with the engineering team.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.340
And you can see that it's
a win-win for everybody.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:09.580
So that's pretty amazing-- the
power of your personal brand.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.170
So what I'd love for us to do
right now is to do an exercise.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.290
And in this exercise, often what
people forget to think about

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.210
is how our perceptions of
what's going on actually

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.270
impacts our interaction.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.936
So what I want you
to do is to trust me,

00:12:23.936 --> 00:12:25.020
is to close your eyes.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.730
Make sure nobody pokes
you from the side.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.910
And if somebody does, I'll
go and hit their hand.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.250
And so to think
of some colleagues

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.500
that you have that you work
with, either in your group

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.270
or outside of your
group, and then

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.040
to pick one person in mind.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.410
And if that person
had to describe

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.230
you using three adjectives, what
are the three adjectives that's

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.630
coming to mind?

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:51.320
And I want you to sit with those
adjectives for the next 5 to 10

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.337
seconds-- a little
uncomfortable--

00:12:53.337 --> 00:12:54.920
but I want you to
feel what that feels

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.128
like when you hear those
adjectives about yourselves.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.920
Now, I want you
to open your eyes.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.500
And on your handout, write down
what those three adjectives

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.640
are in the section that's
What is Your Personal Brand.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.200
So what we're going to do
now is partner activity.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.390
I want you to find a partner A,
and-- find a partner, hopefully

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:31.950
somebody you don't
talk to regularly

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.890
because the purpose of
these types of conversations

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.520
is really to meet
somebody else, as well.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.070
So find a partner.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.010
Go ahead.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:40.860
Pair up.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.412
If you're on the right
side-- my right side,

00:13:43.412 --> 00:13:45.120
you'll be partner A.
If you're partner A,

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.100
can you raise your hand?

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.980
And then, if you're
on the left side,

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.550
you'll be partner B. And if
you're doing front and back,

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.758
the person in front will be
A, and the person in back

00:13:53.758 --> 00:13:54.460
will be B.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.530
So if you're A's, can
you raise your hand?

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.820
OK, so A's, in this exercise,
what we're going to do

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.290
is you're going to get a chance
to tell your partner what

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.460
the three adjectives
are and what

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.850
feelings came up for
you as you were thinking

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:08.840
about these adjectives.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.370
And B, what you're going to do
is practice active listening.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.519
What that means is
you don't get to talk.

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:15.810
You don't get to ask questions.

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.310
You actually don't
even get to make noise.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.810
You can nod your head, but
the idea is to really listen.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.630
And if there is an
awkward silence,

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.310
sit in that awkwardness.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.280
But allow A to really describe
what's going on for them.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.910
OK, so your two
minutes starts now.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.375
[CHATTER]

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.720
So I felt a lot of
energy and positivity

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.950
and saw a lot of smiles.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.180
So that's good.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.400
So now, B, you did such an
awesome job being a listener.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.240
Guess what?

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.250
It's your turn to get to share.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.370
And A, likewise,
please sit in silence

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.680
and let the other person
just express their feelings.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.670
And if there's awkwardness
in the silence, it's OK.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.110
Just let them keep going.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.608
So your two minutes,
B, starts now.

00:15:24.608 --> 00:15:28.094
[CHATTER]

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.410
Wow.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:58.060
So it sounds like there was a
lot of energy and enthusiasm

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.910
and sharing.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.200
And what I'd love to hear
is what came up for you?

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.250
What were some of
the adjectives?

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:08.110
How did it feel to
actually share what

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.389
those adjectives made you feel?

00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:12.430
And what was it like to
be on the listening side?

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.346
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.474
SAMORN SELIM: Do you mind
sharing what those two are?

00:16:20.474 --> 00:16:22.784
AUDIENCE: The plus--
taking initiative

00:16:22.784 --> 00:16:24.432
and being very helpful.

00:16:24.432 --> 00:16:25.890
SAMORN SELIM: OK,
taking initiative

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.490
and being very helpful-- so
very positive associations.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.790
And when you thought
about that about yourself,

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.540
how did that make you feel?

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.420
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.980
SAMORN SELIM: All right?

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.270
He's like, meh.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:38.900
And that's actually
a common experience

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.900
that I get is a lot of
people often don't take time

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.720
to really think
about the assumptions

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.370
that they make
about other people

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.304
and how those people
are perceiving them.

00:16:47.304 --> 00:16:48.720
And often, the
assumptions that we

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.511
think that other people
are making about us

00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:53.180
often are not as positive as
what those other people might

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.480
be thinking because we tend
to be our worst critics.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.637
I'd love to hear a
couple more shares.

00:16:59.637 --> 00:17:01.104
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
I think I had

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:05.505
much more positive association
as far as what my [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:05.505 --> 00:17:10.231
about myself versus my
partner had a little bit more

00:17:10.231 --> 00:17:12.351
of a negative
assumption of himself.

00:17:12.351 --> 00:17:15.332
So that's also [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:15.332 --> 00:17:16.040
SAMORN SELIM: OK.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.415
So you thought it
was interesting

00:17:17.415 --> 00:17:19.680
that you had a more positive
association of yourself

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.829
and your partner had a
more negative association.

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:25.180
AUDIENCE: Maybe it's more
self-aware or critical.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.510
SAMORN SELIM: More
self-aware, more critical.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.662
What was it that you found
interesting about it?

00:17:29.662 --> 00:17:32.320
AUDIENCE: That [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.260
SAMORN SELIM: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.210
And you know here's why
these associations are

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.160
really important--
it's that if you have

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.870
a positive perception that
somebody else thinks you're

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.660
a good person or easy to work
with, when you see that person,

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.180
are you more likely to
engage with that person?

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:50.930
Thumbs up, yeah.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.282
Thumbs down, no.

00:17:52.282 --> 00:17:52.990
Mostly thumbs up.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.060
Yes.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.930
Now, on the flip side, if
your partner might think,

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.090
I don't think that
person really likes me,

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.600
or it's difficult to
work with that person.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.990
When you see that
person, are you

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.190
going to want to
engage with them?

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.190
No.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.560
So this is the
power of perception

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.844
about your own personal brand.

00:18:10.844 --> 00:18:12.260
And this is often
a critical piece

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.450
that people don't think about is
what are the assumptions that's

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:19.530
underlying that is impacting
our interactions with others?

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.732
And I'll share a really--
a good example of this

00:18:23.732 --> 00:18:25.440
is one of my clients--
I worked with her,

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.850
and she's really amazing.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.630
Across the board with her
peers and her subordinates,

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.660
she's seen as somebody who's
really amazing, wonderful

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:33.300
to work with.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.796
How many of you know amazing
colleagues like that?

00:18:35.796 --> 00:18:36.581
It's everybody.

00:18:36.581 --> 00:18:38.330
It's Google-- of course
you've got to know

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.321
at least one person like that.

00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:42.820
But the thing is that she was
being passed up for promotions

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:43.920
and raises all the time.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.590
We're like, huh?

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:46.232
That's odd.

00:18:46.232 --> 00:18:47.940
Why are you being
passed up all the time?

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:48.648
I don't get this.

00:18:48.648 --> 00:18:49.850
You're really fantastic.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:53.414
And what we uncovered was that
she never talked to her boss.

00:18:53.414 --> 00:18:55.080
And the only time she
talked to her boss

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.000
was when there was a
crisis or something urgent.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.800
Does that sound
familiar to everybody?

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.620
Any hands?

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.530
Yeah, a lot of head
nods like, yeah.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.830
So now, I want you to
imagine if you were her boss

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.656
and you saw her trotting
down the hallway-- hey, boss.

00:19:08.656 --> 00:19:10.610
Are you going to
want to talk to her?

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:14.140
No, because she's basically
the crisis problem person.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:14.790
Right?

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.452
So you've just had this very
negative association with her.

00:19:17.452 --> 00:19:19.410
And she also has this
very negative association

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.470
with her boss-- he's
always frustrated with me.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.759
So when she goes in, she's not
her awesome, authentic self

00:19:24.759 --> 00:19:27.300
because her awesome, authentic
self is somebody who's social,

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.540
who gets along with people,
who wants to be helper.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.289
But when she goes to
her boss, because she

00:19:31.289 --> 00:19:33.620
has this association that
he finds her annoying

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.920
or she's disrupting
him or bother him,

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.790
she just freezes up.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:37.940
And the only thing
she goes to him

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.398
is like, hey, we
have this problem.

00:19:39.398 --> 00:19:40.360
Can we solve it?

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.580
It's not making for a
really good relationship.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.060
I see a lot of laughs out there.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.536
People are like,
yeah, that happens.

00:19:46.536 --> 00:19:48.160
And it's easy to
imagine that happening

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.370
because we're all so busy.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.000
So what I would
challenge you to do,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.170
and what we did
with our client was,

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.470
hey, when you're having
your one-on-one meetings

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.780
with your boss, which happened
every two weeks for her,

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.154
is to not only go
in and be like,

00:20:01.154 --> 00:20:02.520
hey, here are the five problems.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.950
What are we going to do?

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.070
That doesn't set up a
very good relationship.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.090
And some of you may
want to write this down,

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.650
but the key steps that we put
in place that really helped her

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.470
transform her relationship was
how about we start with, hey,

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.250
how's it going?

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.210
Pretty normal, right?

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.710
And that's actually something
she does with all of her peers

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:20.550
as well as the people
that she supervises.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.670
It's a 10 second
interaction where

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.409
you can humanize yourself.

00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:25.950
And then, the second
step that we did

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.600
was to also share what were the
things that were going well.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.620
I cannot imagine that in your
workspace that only the sky is

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.390
falling, and you're
only having problems.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.220
There are things
that are going well,

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.250
but we often forget to mention
the things that are going well

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.916
because it's not
urgent on our mind.

00:20:42.916 --> 00:20:45.540
But it's still really important
to mention those amazing things

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.670
that are going on because, by
doing so, your supervisor can

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.060
know that you're actually
getting these things done.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.950
And you're also
reminding them, hey, I'm

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.884
doing a really good job
here because we're busy.

00:20:55.884 --> 00:20:57.550
And so if you don't
remind them of that,

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:58.340
they're going to forget.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.173
Or they're not going
to be aware that you're

00:21:00.173 --> 00:21:01.010
doing that good job.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.590
And then, after you present
those positive things and say,

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:06.200
I think we should keep doing
these things because it's

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.412
working, then go
into the challenges.

00:21:09.412 --> 00:21:10.870
So what you've done
there is you've

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.800
set up a positive association.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.020
So every time that you're
going into the office,

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.603
he's not going to
be like, let me duck

00:21:16.603 --> 00:21:19.940
and hide because all you're
coming to me with is problems.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.620
And here's the key thing when
you go to your supervisor

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.130
with challenges-- come
up with a few solutions.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.489
Maybe the solution isn't
I have the answer that's

00:21:27.489 --> 00:21:28.530
going to fix all of this.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:31.269
But at least have, here are
some two or three things

00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:32.560
that I think we could research.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.976
Or here are some
people I think we

00:21:33.976 --> 00:21:35.610
could talk to help solve this.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.620
So then, what you do is
you change the association

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.430
that your supervisor has
as you're the problem,

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.570
big crisis person
to you're the person

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.070
who's going to come and share
some good news that I can also

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.942
then share with my supervisors
as well because I love to share

00:21:48.942 --> 00:21:51.400
how well our department is
doing and how well my people are

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.310
doing.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.970
And if you come to
me with problems,

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.990
I know that you're also
being very proactive.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.710
And like you, over
there, you're somebody

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:00.050
who's taking initiative.

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:03.090
So you can see how your own
biases about what people

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:04.960
are thinking about
you can impact

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.820
your interaction with them
and impact your career.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.360
Now, on the flip side,
what I want to then go into

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.920
is why does your
personal brand matter?

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.030
Anybody know who that is?

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.080
Yeah, who's that?

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.080
I get a lot of laughter.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.550
Does everybody know what
"Game of Thrones" is?

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.230
It's only half the room?

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.160
I can't believe this--
unfathomable to me

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.580
that you don't know.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.340
So I'm a geek.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.030
I'm a nerd.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.837
And I love reading about dragons
and all these other things.

00:22:35.837 --> 00:22:38.170
But just to give high-level
overview-- "Game of Thrones"

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.970
is a book fantasy
series that has

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.310
been turned into an HBO series.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:46.700
And this is one of my favorite
characters, Tyrion Lannister.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.390
Tyrion is born into this
very powerful Lannister

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:53.420
family, which is
fortunate and unfortunate.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.390
His father really hates
him and so does his sister.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:58.580
But we won't get into
this particular story.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.620
So Tyrion, in the middle
of the book series,

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.130
finds himself in this
really interesting position

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.760
where he's been asked by his
father to be the king's hand.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.400
And he has to advise the king,
his nephew, on strategies

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.470
on how to keep the
country growing.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.444
And as many of you know who've
been following the series,

00:23:15.444 --> 00:23:17.860
there are all these wars that
are breaking out everywhere.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.000
Everybody is trying
to be the king.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.970
So Tyrion finds
himself in a place

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.740
where King's Landing is
confronted with a battle,

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.690
and they are about to lose
this battle to the enemy.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.830
But because Tyrion is
so smart and so witty,

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.790
he comes up with an ingenious
plan and, with courage,

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.750
tries to fight to the death.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:40.110
And what we find is
that he actually helps

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:43.100
saves the country
from being taken over.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.810
So now you think, oh, well,
if he's done that of course

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.820
he's going to get all
these accolades, right?

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.660
No.

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.560
What happens is his
father-- because his father

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.870
has this perception that Tyrion
is basically not reliable,

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.340
is somebody who drinks
too much, and somebody

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.460
who gets under his skin and is
the cause of his wife's death

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.990
and has all these negative
associations about Tyrion.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.730
What he does, in fact, is he
actually takes all the power

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:15.020
away from Tyrion, dismisses him,
and, to add salt to the wound,

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.060
takes his lover.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:18.560
I know.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.330
It's very tragic.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.580
And this is what can happen
if you're not paying attention

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.670
to your brand.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.935
So we know how your own
perception of your association

00:24:28.935 --> 00:24:30.560
to your brand, how
others perceive you,

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.939
might impact your interaction.

00:24:31.939 --> 00:24:33.730
Now, the other piece
of your personal brand

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.740
is how other people
actually see you.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:40.010
And so if the person who
is in charge of your career

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.450
giving you raises or promotion
or giving you projects--

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.851
or even if they're not, but
they're supposed to help you

00:24:44.851 --> 00:24:47.350
as a colleague to get things
done, if they don't have a very

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:51.780
positive association with you,
no matter how hard you work,

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.090
no matter how long
the hours you put in,

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.350
no matter how great
your accomplishments,

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.780
you could end up like Tyrion
where you're not going

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.540
to be acknowledged for that.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:06.660
And that's a tragedy
because obviously somebody

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.130
who is saving the country from
being taken over by the enemy

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:11.640
should really get that accolade.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.700
And we don't want that
to have happen to you,

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.400
but we see this
time and time again.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.060
How many of you can relate
to that where you're like,

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.380
why is that person
getting a promotion?

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.963
I don't understand
what they're doing.

00:25:19.963 --> 00:25:21.380
A lot of head nods.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.920
A lot of laughter here.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.960
Or I've been here until
midnight every day.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.720
Anybody know that I'm alive?

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.690
Why are you supplying
stuff to me?

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.490
Lots of hands that
can relate to that.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.560
And so that's the reason
why is that when--

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.960
if somebody who is in
charge or who is there

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.024
to collaborate with
you-- if they don't have

00:25:39.024 --> 00:25:41.190
a strong sense of your
brand, they're also not going

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:43.730
to be there to promote you.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.190
And so now you
recognize how important

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:50.350
it is to have a
strong personal brand

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.650
and to manage it because
you can see that it

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.630
could impact your career.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.310
But why is there
resistance to it?

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:59.920
There is often a resistance
to it because people--

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.270
the most common response I get
is I don't want to be fake.

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:05.067
How many of you have
that natural aversion

00:26:05.067 --> 00:26:07.692
to think about your brand and be
like, I don't want to be fake?

00:26:07.692 --> 00:26:09.380
I think some of you.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.880
And what I would
encourage you to do

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.430
is think about
Oprah's lesson where

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.330
she says, "I can be a
much better Oprah than I

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:17.510
could be a pretend Barbara."

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.080
And the reference is to this--
when Oprah started her career

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.050
as an anchorwoman,
the person she admired

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:23.660
most was Barbara Walters.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.170
And what she would do
would study Barbara and try

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.430
to mimic her when she's on TV.

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.160
And that was really exhausting.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.450
And it wasn't until
there was a moment where

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:35.110
she screwed something up and
just kind of laughed and let

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.520
out a sigh of relief
that it hit her.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.540
And there was a moment
where a light bulb went off,

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.960
and she said, you know what?

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.220
It's much better to be me
than to be a pretend Barbara.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.880
And that was when
her career took off.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.670
So what I would
encourage you to do

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.510
in thinking about
your personal brand

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:55.860
is really not about making
this where you have to be fake

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.550
or you have to kiss up or
you have to change yourself

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.440
so drastically so that you
don't remember who you are

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.210
because that would
be really exhausting

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.290
to wear a mask every day.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:09.315
What I am encouraging you to do
is to take a look and say, hey,

00:27:09.315 --> 00:27:10.940
what is going on with
my personal brand

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.440
about my own assumptions?

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.529
And how are other people
really perceiving me,

00:27:15.529 --> 00:27:17.070
and is that something
I'm happy with?

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.670
And if that's not, what
are some small things

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:23.270
that I can do to make
some big changes?

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:27.890
So you know I've worked with
a lot of introverts and people

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:29.210
who are humble and shy.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:33.020
How many of you relate to being
an introvert, humble, or shy?

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.770
3/4 of the room-- OK, almost
everybody in the room.

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.740
And often when I talk
to them about this,

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.630
there's this I just
feel like it's too much

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.224
or I just can't do
it right or I just

00:27:45.224 --> 00:27:46.390
don't want to change myself.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.091
And what I would
encourage you to do

00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:49.340
is to not make this huge leap.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.010
I'm not asking you to
go from this person who

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:54.860
is more shy and reserved to
being like, hey, everybody.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.490
I'm the life of the
party, but to really take

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.880
some small steps that
can actually make

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.460
a big impact on your career.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.050
And here's an
example of where you

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.650
can make that big difference.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:07.500
I was working with a client
where he's really bright.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.650
He's really great
at what he does,

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:13.697
but he's not-- but when you
ask who he is in the company,

00:28:13.697 --> 00:28:15.280
everybody is kind
of like, who's that?

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.900
And it's because
he's keeping himself

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.885
really small and really quiet.

00:28:18.885 --> 00:28:20.260
And so some of
the things that we

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:24.420
did for him to help him change
his own perception of himself,

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.011
but also to help others
see that his brand is

00:28:27.011 --> 00:28:29.260
something that is strong and
something that's positive

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:33.200
that should be associated with,
is to make some minor changes.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.710
So for example, when he goes
to the cafeteria to get water

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.830
or goes to a meeting to
just actually say, hey,

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:43.070
how's it going to the
person standing around him.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:46.090
It's a little awkward at first,
but it's just that initial step

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:48.440
because everybody's
feeling a little awkward.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.560
And so that's one thing.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.790
So just by doing
that, he was actually

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.250
able to get to know people
and people knew his name.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.434
So that was an
amazing feat for him.

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:58.850
So after a month of doing that
and feeling more confidence

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:00.860
because he's like, hey,
I didn't die from that.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.151
People actually said, hi, back.

00:29:02.151 --> 00:29:03.050
It was amazing.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:04.920
What we then did
was say, OK, what

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.870
can we do now to up your
game just a little bit more?

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:10.660
So his interaction with people
are, hey, how's it going?

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.406
Good.

00:29:11.406 --> 00:29:12.030
How's it going?

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:12.630
Good.

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.240
OK, that was good
as initial step,

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.330
but it didn't really
allow room for rapport.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.770
So the next thing that we added
to his assignment was to say,

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:21.940
what's one thing you
can say about the work

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.360
that you're doing that you
can share with somebody else

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.730
that you love
because when you're

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.740
positive and excited
and being authentically

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.240
sharing about what you love,
it spreads joy to everybody.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.960
So we added to
his assignment was

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.000
to come up with one thing every
week that he wanted to share.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.130
So the interaction became,
hey, how's it going?

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:43.560
Good-- been working
on this feature,

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.320
and I'm super excited to
hear the feedback on it.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.237
The reception to that
was a lot more positive,

00:29:49.237 --> 00:29:51.278
and it actually opened
the space to have a longer

00:29:51.278 --> 00:29:53.490
conversation, which was,
what's the feature about,

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:54.550
blah, blah, blah.

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:58.160
And so it really allowed him to
go more into what he was doing

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.440
and to share that passion.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.970
And over time, by
consistently doing that,

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:05.230
people in his company were
actually able to know his name

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.200
and also know what he
brought to the table

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.200
and, more importantly, have a
positive association with him

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.700
because he was actually
excited about the work

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.345
that he was doing as opposed
to being known as the guy who

00:30:16.345 --> 00:30:18.720
never talked to anybody, who
didn't care, and didn't seem

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.219
like he was invested
in the company.

00:30:20.219 --> 00:30:23.470
Can you see the big difference
that that small thing can make?

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:25.810
I see a lot of head nods.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:26.620
Yes.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.020
And so that's what we're
hoping that you can do today

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.910
is to find the things that are
authentically true to you--

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:35.610
that you're excited about,
that you're happy about,

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:37.610
the things that you're
working on that are good,

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:41.400
and to share in a way that
honors your contributions

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.470
but also uplifts
everybody around you.

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:45.715
It doesn't have to be this
experience that's negative

00:30:45.715 --> 00:30:47.380
or that is fake.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.260
And by doing so-- the
good thing about that

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.080
is that when there's
an issue involving

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.706
that particular project or
that particular assignment,

00:30:55.706 --> 00:30:57.080
the first person
they might think

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.100
about calling to help
solve that problem,

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.830
if that issue comes up, is you.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:03.260
And so what we're doing
is creating value for you,

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.810
but we're also creating
value for other team members

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:08.335
and then overall productivity
for the organization.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.722
So now, you know what
a personal brand is.

00:31:14.722 --> 00:31:16.430
It's an immediate
association that people

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.490
have about you when they
think of you or hear

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.520
of you, similar to
what we saw with Oprah.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.047
You see the positive
consequences

00:31:22.047 --> 00:31:24.630
it can have in your career, like
the lawyer that I was talking

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.650
about, or the really
negative consequences it

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.230
can have in your career, like
my favorite character, Tyrion

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:30.380
Lannister.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.210
And you see that you can be
authentic in your own way

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.762
and still manage
your personal brand.

00:31:36.762 --> 00:31:38.220
So the next question
is, well, what

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.910
do you want to do with that?

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.870
What I find is that a lot of
times people go back and say,

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:46.040
well, I'm inspired
for a day, and I'm

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.910
going to do something and
then kind of drop off.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:53.320
What I would encourage you to do
is to be consistent about this.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.050
So three things that
I would recommend

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.070
that you do that can make
a big change is, one,

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.160
go back and do the exercise
we did earlier, which

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.326
is to think about the people
that you're interacting

00:32:01.326 --> 00:32:03.840
with on a regular
basis and ask yourself,

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.880
what do you think they're
thinking about you?

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.004
And how does that impact
your interactions with them?

00:32:09.004 --> 00:32:10.920
The second thing is to
actually go out and ask

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.356
a few coworkers about that.

00:32:13.356 --> 00:32:14.730
What are the three
key adjectives

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:17.370
that comes to mind
when you think of me?

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:19.170
What do you think
are my strengths?

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.370
And what would you
like to see more of?

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:24.620
This can be scary because you're
being vulnerable and putting

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.615
out yourself out
there, but this is also

00:32:26.615 --> 00:32:28.610
a moment of
transformation because

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:30.490
without that information,
it's really hard

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.115
to assess where you
are and whether you

00:32:32.115 --> 00:32:33.400
want to make changes.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.680
And then, the last
piece is this--

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.131
with that information, what
are you going to do about it?

00:32:38.131 --> 00:32:40.130
Are you going to go home
and say, you know what?

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.460
That's cool, but I'm not
interested in making changes.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:46.430
Or you can make that decision
to put things in your calendar.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:48.380
And all it really takes
is 15 minutes a week

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.520
to make these changes
so that you can better

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.920
manage your personal brand.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.550
And I know that with
change it's always scary,

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.400
even if it's good for you.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.930
And it reminds me
of a story of myself

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:04.890
when I was in college--
that was a long time ago.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.020
And I was in my senior
year of college.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.570
I got an interview at this
tech company that, at the time,

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:12.300
was really up-and-coming.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.740
And I was so excited.

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.895
I was researching the company.

00:33:15.895 --> 00:33:17.750
I was practicing my pitch.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:19.690
I made a list of 10
questions so that I

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:21.410
wouldn't be stumped at the end.

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.868
I crossed the T's
and dotted the I's.

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:25.743
And I was like, I'm
ready for this interview.

00:33:25.743 --> 00:33:28.090
So I'm jotting
into the interview,

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:29.361
and I was super excited.

00:33:29.361 --> 00:33:31.860
So the guy says, hi, and we
kind of chit-chat a little bit--

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.420
a little talk.

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:39.330
He goes into the spiel about
his company over the next 15

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:40.030
minutes.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:43.520
He answers every single
question that's on my list.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.990
And then, he says, what do
you want to know about us?

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:49.830
I could not come
up with anything.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:50.930
I was completely stumped.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:53.550
So the question I asked-- and
I'm still embarrassed about

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:58.598
it-- is, is it true that your
company offers good free food?

00:33:58.598 --> 00:34:02.860
Take a guess at what that
company was-- Google.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.710
Yeah, and I was mortified.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.950
It stayed with me for a
while-- like, oh my god.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:11.270
They must think I'm the
most awful interview ever.

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.050
And it's not a great question.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.650
And it was embarrassing.

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:17.800
And it was hard to
actually share it out loud.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.954
And I share this story because I
think that that situation could

00:34:20.954 --> 00:34:23.370
have stayed with me and derailed
me and kept me in a place

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:24.828
where I'm like,
oh, I'm never going

00:34:24.828 --> 00:34:26.540
to talk to Googlers ever again.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.360
I'm never going to do
anything here again.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.060
And fast forward
years later-- I'm

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.889
now being invited to come back
and give this presentation

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:37.080
to you and to have
this honor of being

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.850
able to share, through
my own personal trials

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:42.300
and tribulations and through
the trainings that I've got

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.800
and through the
experiences I've had

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.010
in helping over 1,000 clients,
to now be able to give you

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:48.230
these strategies.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.320
And I share that story because
I can assure you, all of you

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.409
have jobs at Google.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:55.480
So you're definitely
10 steps ahead of me.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.180
You at least got through
the screening round, got

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.721
through the callbacks-- and I
know the interview process here

00:34:59.721 --> 00:35:00.420
is really long.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.890
And you're way ahead
of me when I started.

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.390
So if I can go from that
place to being where I am now,

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:09.700
I am more than confident
that, with consistent work

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.060
with these strategies,
that you will

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.740
be able to have a really
amazing, successful career

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:18.060
and that, at this point, if
you make that choice to choose

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.830
to change your personal brand
in a positive direction,

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:23.280
you can definitely
make that happen.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.570
So it was with great
honor to be here,

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:28.420
and I just really want
to humbly thank you

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.760
for spending this time together.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.440
And I'll take
questions after this.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.163
Thank you.

00:35:33.163 --> 00:35:36.973
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.130
AUDIENCE: So what if
your personal perception

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:47.262
of yourself and other
coworkers are different?

00:35:47.262 --> 00:35:49.220
SAMORN SELIM: So that
depends-- great question.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:53.140
So let's dig a
little bit into that.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.140
Do you feel your personal
perception of yourself

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.589
is positive or negative?

00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:57.380
AUDIENCE: Positive.

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:58.270
SAMORN SELIM: OK,
and then, do you

00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:59.894
think your coworkers'
perception of you

00:35:59.894 --> 00:36:02.790
is positive,
negative, or neutral?

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.810
AUDIENCE: Still positive,
but just different stuff.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:08.974
SAMORN SELIM: OK, and so what
I would say with that is it

00:36:08.974 --> 00:36:10.390
sounds like you're
in a good place

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:12.000
because you're feeling
pretty good about yourself,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.090
which is the first step.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.450
And your coworkers are
feeling pretty good about you.

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.080
And so if what you
want to do is to have

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.860
them see more of the stuff
that you're feeling good about,

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.585
then the recommendation
would be,

00:36:23.585 --> 00:36:25.710
depending on the interactions
you have with people,

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.400
to discuss those things more--
to find ways in highlighting

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.379
those things more.

00:36:29.379 --> 00:36:31.420
So give me a specific
example because it's harder

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.152
to answer in the abstract.

00:36:34.152 --> 00:36:36.360
So what's a positive
association of yourself that you

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.910
want others to know about you?

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:41.720
AUDIENCE: To give
more initiative.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.710
SAMORN SELIM: OK, so if you want
to show that you're somebody

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:48.930
who is taking more
initiative, one of the ways

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:51.916
you can do that is if
you're at a team meeting,

00:36:51.916 --> 00:36:54.540
instead of just sitting quiet--
and I'm not saying that's you--

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.350
but for the sake of
time, what I would say

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:58.940
is that at every meeting
you should at least make

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.930
one comment if you're not making
a comment and asking questions.

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:03.920
And the other thing that you
can do to really show initiative

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.010
is if there is something
that's being assigned

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:09.020
or projects that
are coming up, you

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.370
would be the person who
would volunteer for it.

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:14.000
And that's showing
initiative right there.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.930
The key thing then,
though, is to follow up,

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:17.680
that when you're working
on these projects

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.160
to let people on your team
and let your supervisors

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.245
know that, as well.

00:37:21.245 --> 00:37:23.520
AUDIENCE: So there is
one school of thought

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.100
where they say you keep
doing the good work

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.100
and things will fall in place.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.810
And now, there's this
concept of personal brand

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:35.680
where you have to proactively
influence or change

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.020
the perception of other people.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.387
You see any conflict?

00:37:39.387 --> 00:37:40.470
SAMORN SELIM: No, I don't.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:41.139
I don't at all.

00:37:41.139 --> 00:37:42.930
And I think that's a
really great question.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:48.070
I think the basis is you
have to do good work.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:50.694
If you're doing bad work and
you're expecting everybody else

00:37:50.694 --> 00:37:53.110
to think good about you, that's
a really hard place to be.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.735
And that would not be something
I would advocate for any client

00:37:55.735 --> 00:37:58.320
because I'm really about
having integrity, honesty,

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.340
and authenticity.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:02.370
So you do need to do
consistent good work.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:05.200
And some things will
fall into place.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.950
So you get a job at Google.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:08.650
That's things
falling into place.

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:10.450
And Google is an
amazing place to work.

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:12.570
Now, if you want to
elevate yourself and get

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.190
to that next stage where
you're going into management

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:18.180
and leadership, there
has to be some changes

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.340
in your strategies.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.760
So the foundation
of doing good work

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.190
is still a core
foundation of who

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:27.900
you are, but that
extra step of sharing

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:31.190
the good work that you're doing
doesn't take away from that.

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:32.625
It only adds to that.

00:38:32.625 --> 00:38:34.250
NEALEIGH MITCHELL:
Thank you very much.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:35.020
SAMORN SELIM: Thank you, guys.

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:35.560
Thank you.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.610
[APPLAUSE]
