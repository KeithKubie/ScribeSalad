00:00:05.652 --> 00:00:08.230
KAREN MAY: So thank you
so much for joining us.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.820
Kelsey is here today, not
only the author of this book,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.770
but the founder of Help Each
Other Out, her organization.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.230
And she works at UC Berkeley
as well as Cal State University

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.870
and has been featured on NPR,
and "The Washington Post,"

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.970
and a number of
other media outlets.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.470
And we're lucky
to have her today,

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.690
and I appreciate you
coming to join us.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.820
So we're going to hear
a bit from Kelsey,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.850
and then we'll have some
time for Q&amp;A. I have a couple

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.710
questions teed up,
but primarily, we'll

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.730
make space for your questions.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.610
There is a Dory in
the calendar invite.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.080
So if you're
watching live stream

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.780
and you'd like to put a question
in, or if you're watching live

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.030
and you'd like to put a
question in, please feel free,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.290
and we'll make time for those.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.742
Thanks.

00:00:49.742 --> 00:00:53.214
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.770
KELSEY CROWE: Hi,
good afternoon.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.770
It's really good to
be here with you all.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.650
I live in San Francisco,
Bernal Heights neighborhood,

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.100
which is a bedroom
community to Google,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.850
and it's actually been with
the help of a lot of Googlers

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.440
that Help Each Other
Out got started,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.090
whether attending
our launch event,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.610
or donating to our
Indiegogo campaign,

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.620
participating in workshops.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.630
So to be here in your company,
literally and figuratively,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.350
is just a real treat.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.480
And Karen and I did
connect when her mom was

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.680
dying and since then, and
we have a friendship now.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.600
And I think that that
speaks to the bounty

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.170
of learning how to connect
in times of vulnerability.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.380
When we might want
to run away, there

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.780
are some true benefits when
we actually do connect,

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.590
and that's what we're
here to talk about.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.409
My talk will focus mostly on
the notion of trust, that when

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.950
being there with
others in their time

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.290
of suffering, how can
we trust ourselves.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.770
And then Karen and
I will be going

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.750
into some Q&amp;A with
some practical tips

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.240
too, around communication,
because we all want

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.449
to stay out of the dog house.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.650
So I don't know how
many of you here

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.380
know somebody who might have
asked you, why the heck would

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.090
you take some time
out of your day

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.180
to hear a talk about suffering?

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.650
Because I doubt
you're a masochist.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.810
I do suspect,
however, that you may

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.290
have had some brush
with suffering,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.590
enough to know that what we're
really here to talk about

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.460
is meaning.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.530
Meaning comes from
work and relationships.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.770
And the relationships
that matter in our lives--

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.610
the ones that sustain us through
the emotional ups and downs,

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.360
the depression, the breakups,
the professional screwups,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.440
the losses--

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.750
these relationships are
ones we don't make them

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.620
when we're on top of the world.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.300
We forge them when
we're at our bottom.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.790
And I hate to tell
you this guys,

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.800
but when you hit
your 40s, oh my god,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.480
everybody's hitting
some kind of bottom.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.410
[AUDIENCE MURMURS]

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.949
And then the bottom is falling
out from under the bottom.

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:20.990
So I'm glad you're getting
started on this young.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.360
I founded Help Each Other
Out to make it easier

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.510
for us to build these
relationships, because as

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.030
important as they are,
it can be hard to do.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.090
So we offer empathy
boot camp workshops,

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.210
which I developed with
the help of people

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.760
in medicine, and in
business, and in therapy.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.430
And we also do
public art exhibits

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.390
on being there, which are these
neighborhood-wide installations

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.910
that we've done in several
San Francisco neighborhoods

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.000
and in New York that feature
kind gestures that got people

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.370
through a difficult time.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.744
And then there is the book--

00:03:57.744 --> 00:03:59.160
"There Is No Good
Card for This"--

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.534
that I wrote with
Emily McDowell,

00:04:00.534 --> 00:04:02.970
who is a wonderful
writer and illustrator.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.370
And that book is based
on a lot of research

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.890
that I did in this area.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.650
This is a lot of work
to do, to figure out

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.350
if I should leave my
bereaved colleague

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.620
a donut on their desk.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.690
Why do I do it?

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.610
And I have two answers to that.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.330
The first is because
I'm actually not

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.440
by nature very good at this.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.400
There are some people who just
seem really comfortable being

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.680
around people's pain,
having emotionally

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.170
vulnerable conversations.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.810
That wasn't me.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.470
I am a Sagittarius
from Brooklyn.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.130
Anybody who knows
our species knows

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.120
we are not the most empathic
creatures on the planet.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.820
We're far more quick to tell you
what we think about something

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.010
than we are to listen to
somebody else's perspective,

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.820
and that can make for really
lively dinner conversation.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.270
It could make for a really
engaging team meeting,

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.010
but it really doesn't
work when you're

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.468
trying to connect
to somebody who's

00:05:03.468 --> 00:05:06.180
feeling emotionally vulnerable.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.120
Time and time and time
again, I would let down

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.000
my friends who were going
through something hard--

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.030
a loss, a miscarriage,
a breakup.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.520
I was that person
that would shy away,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.230
not because I didn't care, but
because like so many of us,

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.260
when you don't know
what to do or say,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.140
you might say nothing at all.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.804
I reached a wall
with this behavior

00:05:32.804 --> 00:05:34.220
when a friend from
graduate school

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.980
was diagnosed with
breast cancer.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.170
I don't know why I reached
that wall then, but I did.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.300
And I recognized that
my reticence was not

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.100
a gift to her.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.117
I wasn't sparing
her my awkwardness.

00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:51.200
I was just being a coward.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.720
I wanted to be more responsible.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.756
I wanted to align my caring
intentions with my actions,

00:06:01.756 --> 00:06:05.240
but I did not know how.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.940
I never did reach
out to my friend,

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.660
but I did do what any
good social science

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.310
researcher would do.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.160
I researched the problem.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.252
I developed an online survey
of open-ended questions

00:06:19.252 --> 00:06:21.710
that basically asked what worked
and what didn't to get you

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.280
through your difficult time.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.350
That got legs.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.660
I got 900 responses,
supplemented that

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.870
with a bunch of interviews, and
that's the basis of this book.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.810
But still, it's a
lot to do, right,

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.790
to just figure out how to be
there in times of suffering.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.030
Why did it matter to me so much?

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.500
Because I am sure if I were to
ask for hands, every one of you

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.490
have had that moment of
regret for saying something

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:55.400
that just landed wrong or for
not saying anything at all.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.220
But you move on.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.050
I couldn't move on, and that
leads to the second, deeper

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.870
reason that I started this work.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.990
You see, my failure
to connect with people

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.850
in their times of
vulnerability was not because I

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.660
didn't know suffering.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.420
I wasn't green to grief.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.250
I did know suffering.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.260
It didn't equip me
to know what to do,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.350
but it did teach
me that it matters.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.440
So my story around that is this.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.830
I grew up knowing only my mom.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.030
I didn't know my dad.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.150
I had no aunts, no uncles.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.200
My grandparents had passed
away a long time ago.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.580
It was just she and I, and
we were really, really close.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.860
She also had schizophrenia,
and she managed that illness

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.220
until she no longer could.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.710
When I was 19,
she stopped taking

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.800
her psychotropic medication.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.550
When I was 23, her
paranoia got so

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:05.807
consuming that she changed
her number, changed the locks,

00:08:05.807 --> 00:08:07.390
and put out a
restraining order on me.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.790
There were some very
humiliating attempts

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.160
to try to connect with her
again, but I never did.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.130
And she did pass away.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:26.660
That loss, that
loss of the mind,

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.160
has no ritual for mourning.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.250
At that young age,
people weren't

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.480
thinking about what to do.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.780
They were focused on their
careers and their friends.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.700
Save for a handful of
people, the loss of my small

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.400
but entire family
went unmentioned.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:55.320
In response to that, of course,
I had some needs to belong,

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.060
and they would really creep up
at the time of the holidays.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.640
Where was I going to eat?

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.060
When I had an overnight
stay in the hospital,

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.710
who was going to pick
me up the next day?

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.420
When I went to the Peace Corps
for three years in Africa,

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.160
where was I going home to?

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.030
Did I ever express these needs?

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.520
No.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.540
Because far more keenly
than that desire to belong

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:33.000
was feeling shame for
having any needs at all.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.616
And I know I'm
not alone in this.

00:09:35.616 --> 00:09:38.040
In my workshops, I
ask people, what's

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.170
hard about asking for help?

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:46.800
Responses they give me,
verbatim, are like these--

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.130
fear of being a
burden, feeling like I

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.910
should be able to
tolerate the situation,

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.770
fear that I will be seen
only for my affliction

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:04.980
and not as me, and the kicker,
always throughout, shame.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.780
It's this person-- this
person who's at the bottom

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.730
of their well--

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:18.440
maybe we reach out and
offer them a self-help book,

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.800
if we reach out at all.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.970
Maybe we ask them, let me know
if there's anything I can do.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:30.680
I can guarantee you
most times they won't.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.950
And that self-help book, "How
You Can Manage Adversity,"

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.305
F you.

00:10:37.305 --> 00:10:39.245
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.060
What if we flipped the script?

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.650
What if instead of buying
a book for that person,

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.824
we bought something
like my book,

00:10:50.824 --> 00:10:53.860
a book about how we
can connect to others

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.440
in their time of pain?

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.710
What if in the ways
that we prioritize

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:04.180
our goals and our practices to
cultivate our emotional health

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.280
and our own physical health--

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:12.000
what if we applied that
to our relational health?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.400
How much saner
would our world be?

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.130
How much more meaningful
would our lives become?

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.100
People who experience
pain very often

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:29.490
experience a second kind of
pain of isolation, of shame.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.460
They're surrounded by care,
and they don't even know it.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:41.560
I didn't want to be a part
of that problem anymore.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.870
That is the second,
deeper reason why

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.080
I started Help Each Other Out.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.870
But even if we know that
it's really, really important

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.670
to connect in times
of difficulty,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.890
it can be super hard to do.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.210
I identify three
empathy roadblocks.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:02.680
One is fear of saying or
doing the wrong thing.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.480
We don't want to make
the situation worse.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.750
Second, the time, the
emotional bandwidth-- our lives

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.129
are crazy.

00:12:13.129 --> 00:12:14.670
Our own lives could
be falling apart.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:18.030
It's so hard to see how you can
fit in somebody else's needs

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.610
into your schedule.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.760
And sometimes, it can seem that
when you acknowledge somebody's

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.260
needs, you've opened up a
Pandora's box of problems

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.810
that you then become responsible
for till the end of time.

00:12:33.576 --> 00:12:35.700
And then the third reason
that we may not reach out

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.385
is because we don't want to pry.

00:12:37.385 --> 00:12:39.135
We don't want someone
to feel like they're

00:12:39.135 --> 00:12:41.190
a source of gossip.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:45.150
We don't want to make
them uncomfortable.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:48.240
I have some really good news.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.835
These fears are totally normal.

00:12:52.978 --> 00:12:55.770
The even better
news is that they're

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:59.850
making it way too complicated.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.790
And I learned this from
my daughter, Georgia.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.180
She was five at the
time that she asked me

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.430
from the backseat of our car--

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.810
I'm driving over
the Bay Bridge--

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:14.600
"Mom, what do you
do for a living?"

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.160
"Well," I said, "I
try to help friends

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.730
be there for each other
when they're sad."

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.010
"Oh," she said, "that's easy."

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.450
So she should not be in charge
of promotion for this book.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.510
"It is?"

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:31.360
I said.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.440
"Well, what would you
say to help a friend?"

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.480
And she actually came up
with a pretty good list,

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.480
and I'm going to
share it with you.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.220
You gave some ideas of what
friends can do for each other

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.030
when they're sad.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.830
GEORGIA: Friends
can say I'm sorry.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.640
KELSEY CROWE: Mm-hmm.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.058
GEORGIA: Do you want
to play with me?

00:13:53.058 --> 00:13:55.036
Want to sit down with me?

00:13:55.036 --> 00:13:56.410
KELSEY CROWE
(VOICEOVER): Mm-hmm.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:03.577
GEORGIA: Also, do you
want to take a break?

00:14:03.577 --> 00:14:07.409
Do you want to
have a little hug?

00:14:11.589 --> 00:14:13.380
KELSEY CROWE: I'm seeing
some head nodding.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.590
It works, right?

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.430
It's not a bad list.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.150
So we're done.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.428
I think I can go home now.

00:14:23.428 --> 00:14:25.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.870
Beat the traffic.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.660
It sounds so simple, doesn't it?

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:36.180
But the saying goes,
simple is not always easy.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.110
Something happens between
then-- her age-- and now.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.250
We enter into more domains
where we expect competence,

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.580
productivity, fixing things.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:52.020
We've made mistakes, learned
not to trust ourselves.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.480
By the time we're
adults, we become

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.930
so self-conscious about
how to just be there

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.930
with somebody we care about.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:07.680
We imagine that there is some
Herculean gesture, some phrase,

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.840
that could heal this
person's situation.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.522
It's just eluding me right
now, but when it comes to me,

00:15:13.522 --> 00:15:14.730
that's when I'll offer it up.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.930
But the real news is there is
no perfect thing you can say,

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.790
there is no perfect
thing that you can

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.030
do, to fix someone's situation.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:34.000
And honestly, that
perfect person,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.810
when your life is falling
apart, is the last person

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:38.500
you want to see.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.410
So let's unpack it a bit.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.060
What is behind connecting
in times of suffering?

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.480
What does it actually take?

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.880
In my workshops, I have what
are called gesture cards.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.570
They provide prompts that ask
people, what got you through?

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:06.020
And, what got you through with
a colleague, or a neighbor,

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.390
or a best friend,
or a family member?

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.340
And I have hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of these.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.790
So I'm going to
share some with you,

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.790
and it's a highly representative
sample of what I see.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.190
What colleagues did
that touched me--

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.990
"I had a miscarriage,
and my colleagues

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.540
sent me a beautiful
bouquet of flowers

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:33.070
with a lovely, heartfelt
message attached."

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.220
A friend I hadn't
heard from in years--

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:43.140
"emailed/called to say 'I'm
sorry.'" Take note guys--

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.870
"my son came by and did all
the dishes and laundry."

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.160
"Listened to me."

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:59.680
"Brought me and my family meals
every night for over a month"--

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.380
strangers.

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:06.384
"My sister came to my house
after a terrible break

00:17:06.384 --> 00:17:08.990
up and made me something to eat.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.504
She doesn't normally come over.

00:17:11.504 --> 00:17:12.170
It meant a lot."

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:19.829
"Donated clothes when we
couldn't go home after 9/11."

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:20.950
This was in New York City.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.760
How many of these gestures
require a significant grasp

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.198
of human psychology?

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:38.610
How many of them
take a lot of time?

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:43.870
What's really amazing-- and this
surprised the heck out of me--

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.530
is you don't even need to
have an intimate knowledge

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:50.220
of a person's situation or
have a strong relationship

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.885
with them.

00:17:51.885 --> 00:17:54.600
A couple of things that I
learned from these gesture

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.600
cards and from my data--

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:03.310
first, if you care,
your care belongs.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.460
So remember, when I
started this work,

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:11.710
I had a matrix where you had the
gesture and the relationship.

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:15.390
And I imagined that there
was the appropriate gesture

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.170
for the appropriate
relationship,

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:20.610
and I was going to
unlock this science.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.070
Well, that was
completely foolhardy.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.500
Gestures from
colleagues and neighbors

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.119
can be just as meaningful
and can look very much

00:18:29.119 --> 00:18:31.410
like the gesture that you
get from a friend or a family

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.240
member.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.450
They can mean even more when
you don't have gestures coming

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:39.640
from friends or family members.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.316
So if you care,
your care belongs.

00:18:43.316 --> 00:18:46.780
The second thing that I noticed
about the data and about

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.220
these gesture cards--

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:52.330
people don't describe
appreciation for favors.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.180
They don't say, I asked
my brother to pick me up

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.490
to go to chemo, and he did.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:06.040
A favor comes with some amount
of indebtedness, obligation.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.960
We don't feel totally
thankful for that.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.270
We are thankful for
unexpected offers.

00:19:15.216 --> 00:19:16.590
So that leads to
the second thing

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:20.760
I noticed about this
data, which is reach out

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.230
and do not wait to be asked.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.970
Let's say you're
ready to reach out.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.400
OK, you guys, you're ready.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.369
What do I do?

00:19:33.369 --> 00:19:34.910
If they don't tell
me what they need,

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.980
how do I know how to respond?

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.980
I get this concern.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.830
And I would say
the answer in that

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:47.380
lies in trust, to
trust yourself,

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.920
and I have two tips for that.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:55.370
The first is to trust
what you know how to do.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:20:00.570
In fact, what you like to do.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:04.565
So for example, if you--

00:20:04.565 --> 00:20:07.850
I learned this the
hard way, actually,

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.850
as I learn too many things.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:15.107
I learned at some point that
people cook for somebody

00:20:15.107 --> 00:20:16.190
who's in a difficult time.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:20.350
Maybe they're bereaved, they've
just had a baby, they're sick.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.640
Some people make dishes,
and they bring those over.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.890
OK, that's what I'll do.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.560
Except I hate to cook.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.290
So when I would cook, it
would be with a lot of stress.

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.770
I mean, it's like putting
out an all-point bulletin--

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.780
I'm cooking.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.100
Handle me with kid gloves.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.990
I'm stressed.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.660
And I would go through
all of this work.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.480
I would often arrive
late and offer this dish

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.840
with a ton of caveats
about why it tasted so bad.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.790
Nobody wants that dish.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:58.240
If, however, you
do like to cook,

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.940
do not worry about the
other 20 casseroles that

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.510
are in the refrigerator,
because chances are 80% of them

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:05.800
are from people like me.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.760
If you like to listen,
trust that just

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.150
by asking, "how are you today?"

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.690
and really wanting
to know, that that

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.360
is a very meaningful gesture.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.300
Trust that if you
like getting donuts

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.540
and you know your
colleague's favorite food,

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.000
bring them their favorite donut.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.610
Trust what you know how to do,
what you like to do, and just

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:37.120
offer it.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.570
The second tip for
building trust--

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:47.050
trust that is that bridge
between your intention

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.380
and your action.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:52.660
The second tip is to
trust what you know

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.230
and trust what you know deeply.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.437
It can be very,
very intimidating

00:21:59.437 --> 00:22:01.270
when somebody is going
through an experience

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.120
that you haven't
gone through before.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.840
You may know
somebody, for example,

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.950
who's had a very significant
loss or a divorce,

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.510
and you've never
been through that.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:14.140
So you doubt that
you have the capacity

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.600
to connect with them
over this situation.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.130
But the reality is
no one has shared

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.440
the exact same
experience with somebody

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.820
else down to the
molecular level.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.740
And the other truth is
underlying suffering

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.490
are just a few
components that actually

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:40.930
run across all kinds of
experiences with pain.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.260
So for example, if
you've never lost

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.710
somebody very,
very close to you,

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:51.110
take a moment to look inside.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:57.700
You may know what it is
to feel lonely and lost.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.560
You may have never lost a job.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.450
You may have never been fired.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:05.660
But take a moment
to look inside.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:09.050
You may know what it is to
have your confidence broken.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.860
You may not be a member
of the widows' club,

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.380
but you are a member of the
frail and messy human club.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.600
So in conclusion,
I would say this.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:34.130
When it comes to connecting
in times of difficulty, trust.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:38.000
Trust what you know how to do.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.740
Trust what you already know.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.490
You can be rest
assured that even

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:53.040
if your gesture or your phrase
was not needed at that time

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:58.370
that you offered it, that the
meaning and human connection,

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:02.100
that kindness that
compelled you to try,

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.395
that most certainly was.

00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:08.200
Trust that.

00:24:12.628 --> 00:24:13.612
That's it.

00:24:13.612 --> 00:24:14.596
Thank you.

00:24:14.596 --> 00:24:18.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:19.495 --> 00:24:20.370
KAREN MAY: Thank you.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:21.245
KELSEY CROWE: Mm-hmm.

00:24:23.759 --> 00:24:25.050
KAREN MAY: So we have time now.

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:26.490
Kelsey said, I'm going
to keep this short.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.530
So we'll answer the
questions that are really

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.420
top of mind for folks.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.855
And so Jordan's going to
share questions on the Dory.

00:24:33.855 --> 00:24:36.270
If you want to put a
question into the Dory,

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:39.990
whether you're sitting here
or on live stream, feel free.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:41.640
And we'll get to
that, and we also

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.660
have a mic that we'll hand
around for live questions.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.210
And while people are
forming their questions,

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:53.700
Kelsey, I wanted to go
again to the practical tips,

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:57.840
because literally knowing
what to do can be a barrier.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.950
And I know--

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.440
I mean, I'm embarrassed to say
even having read your book,

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.750
I have two sympathy
cards sitting in my bag

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.820
that I should have
sent weeks ago.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:10.380
And sometimes it just gets hard.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.930
So some practical
tips on how do we

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:16.200
get ourselves to show up for the
people who need us in the way

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.812
that they need us to.

00:25:17.812 --> 00:25:19.770
KELSEY CROWE: Well, first
even, a practical tip

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.478
around those sympathy
cards, which we all

00:25:21.478 --> 00:25:22.950
know that experience--

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.330
oh, I can't find the stamp.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.210
How do I get their
physical address?

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.270
There's no expiration
date on condolences.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.780
So you said that
it's way too late.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.350
This is where it is a gift
to be a procrastinator,

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:41.160
because very often, that person
who's grieving has heard a lot

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.690
of condolences in the initial
aftermath-- and you know this--

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:47.820
and then there are crickets.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.560
And you are actually
still sitting

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:55.680
with this pretty deeply, if not
even more deeply, months later,

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.340
and you don't even know if
it's appropriate to bring up

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.840
the fact that you're
still grieving.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.010
So getting a card later in
that process is a total gift.

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:08.382
So you could just pretend
that you meant it that way.

00:26:08.382 --> 00:26:10.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.170
Or, of course, to send an email.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.770
Something that I do
as a practical tip,

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:18.620
if somebody is going
through something--

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.220
and even a positive thing--

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.160
I put a little note
in my calendar,

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.750
just a little
reminder-- don't forget

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:28.200
to send the card that
day, something like that.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.080
And they keep toggling
you until you do it.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:35.940
But there really is very
rarely an expiration date

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.720
on giving comfort.

00:26:39.912 --> 00:26:40.620
KAREN MAY: Great.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:41.290
KELSEY CROWE: Is that enough?

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:41.550
Does that help?

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:41.850
KAREN MAY: Thank you.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.320
Yes, we may come
back to a few more.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.140
KELSEY CROWE: I may email you
to see if you sent those cards.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.190
[LAUGHS]

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.790
KAREN MAY: Jordan,
anything in Dory?

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.636
AUDIENCE: The question I had--

00:26:53.636 --> 00:26:56.135
during the situation in what's
going on in Houston right now

00:26:56.135 --> 00:26:59.030
and in Florida, have
you seen some acts

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:00.620
of kindness and
gratitude that really

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.230
have stood out in your mind?

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:05.030
KELSEY CROWE: Yes, well,
I think everyone in Texas

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:11.870
is talking about how disaster
is bringing us back to humanity,

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:15.350
and the normal categories
of political party or what

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:18.110
have you are really
starting to disappear.

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.530
So seeing people
jump in and help,

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:24.410
providing their time,
donating when you can,

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:31.100
which is actually a huge
source of help, it's ongoing.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.320
I mean, even in
my own community,

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:37.760
people looking for housing
for people and lending a room.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.690
If you are at all amenable
to hosting, for example,

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.600
and you have an extra room,
and you're in the area,

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.490
to just make that available.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:49.630
It really, really counts.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:51.770
AUDIENCE: First Dory
question-- how much variety

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.380
is there in how different people
with different personalities

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.230
benefit from different
types of empathy?

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.492
KELSEY CROWE: No, that's a
very analytical question,

00:27:59.492 --> 00:28:00.950
and that's kind of
where I started.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:02.650
[LAUGHS]

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:08.330
And the key-- what happens when
you begin with that question is

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.060
then you get tripped up in
making this the right gesture

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.512
for the right person.

00:28:12.512 --> 00:28:13.970
And until you think
that it's going

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:18.040
to lay out the way you
hope it's going to lay out,

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.240
and until you figure that
out, you don't do anything.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.960
So I would recommend
stepping back and thinking,

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.260
what do I actually like to do?

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.560
So for example, I
like to buy flowers.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:35.240
It's super cliche, but if I
can get some me time and put

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.230
together a bouquet--

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:39.620
which I wouldn't do for myself,
but I would very happily

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.065
do that for somebody else--

00:28:41.065 --> 00:28:42.440
then that's what
I'm going to do.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:46.560
And I no longer worry if this
person wanted flowers or not.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.110
I just think about what
I was able to give.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:56.570
And some of that then also
is the flip side of giving,

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.840
which is being able to receive.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.120
It's a pretty ungracious
person who says, well,

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.090
I don't like daisies.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:06.335
Why did they give me daisies?

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.970
So that's not on you.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.520
If you make a gesture
that you know how to give,

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.400
then just offer it up.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.550
If you like music, put
together a playlist

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.290
of your favorite songs.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:24.440
Maybe this person never
expressed an interest in music.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.940
Knowing that you gave
something that gives you joy

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:32.000
is so much better to receive
than receiving something

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.830
that someone has
a feeling caused

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:38.630
you a lot of torture to do.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:40.790
That's really, really
where I would start and not

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:45.271
even worry too much about
somebody else's personality

00:29:45.271 --> 00:29:45.770
type.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.570
AUDIENCE: Is there different
advice based upon the context,

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.555
like compared to at work
or in personal life?

00:29:54.555 --> 00:29:57.180
Because I know there's different
barriers involved and whatnot.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:01.230
KELSEY CROWE: Yes, when
people come to my workshops,

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.590
very often they're coming in
with the question about how

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.170
to support a colleague.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:10.020
They wind up leaving
having the work infuse

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:14.700
their entire social system
because it impacts everything.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.370
But that question of what
to do for a colleague

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.940
is particular vexing because
we have certain boundaries

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:24.970
around professional,
private, public,

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:27.870
and we want to honor
those for reasons

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:33.840
of being respectful and
creating a healthy environment

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.550
for accountability.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:38.370
So there's a lot of reasons
why we don't dive too deeply

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.740
into somebody's personal life.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:45.330
That all said, increasingly
over the generations,

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:48.180
we are becoming
more public, and I

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.730
think this is such a
good thing when we're

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.430
going through something
difficult. More and more,

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.740
people are just
aware that something

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.330
is happening to your colleague.

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.700
It's not a big secret.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:03.330
And so what winds up seeming
like respectful distance

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:07.200
when not doing something
can actually feel very cold

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.900
and callous.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.500
So I would recommend
in the work context

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.680
to still reach out if you care.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.850
This is really important.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:21.450
This is not to give you some
to-do list or marching orders

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:25.740
to start giving bouquets
to every single person that

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:26.760
crosses your path.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.920
But if there's a colleague
that you care about--

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.720
and you don't have
to be that close--

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.130
you can send an email.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:34.110
You can write a card.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:37.410
One woman, she talked
about a colleague who

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:41.250
she wasn't that close with,
and she had casually mentioned,

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:44.970
tomorrow would have
been my due date.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.790
And that colleague left her a
bouquet of flowers on her desk

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:50.690
the next day.

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:52.190
So in the workplace,
often there are

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.230
gestures that you can
do that don't require

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:58.520
a lot of in-depth conversation,
but that show I notice,

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.020
and I care.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.290
By the same token, if you
actually do have a number

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:07.850
of conversations-- you complain
about management together,

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:12.300
you talk about the sports, or
Project Runway, or whatever--

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.140
it's OK when you have a
private moment or to even nab

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:20.250
someone in the hallway and say,
hey, I just want to check in.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:21.990
I just want to know
how you're doing.

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:23.952
How are you doing today?

00:32:23.952 --> 00:32:25.410
That person will
say, oh, I'm fine.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.696
I'm fine.

00:32:26.696 --> 00:32:29.380
And you say, OK.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.370
I just want to know.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:34.480
I mean, I'm here if
you want to tell me.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.110
And then that person may offer
a more authentic response,

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.750
or they may say, nope, I'm OK.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:42.250
They're likely not going to go
home to their spouse and say,

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:44.400
I can't believe that she
asked me how I was doing.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.220
It was so obnoxious.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.620
What I can guarantee you
is if nobody reaches out

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.020
at the office, they are
going to be going home

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:52.840
talking about that.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.660
AUDIENCE: When you
started your talk

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.590
about what you went through
with your mother and everything,

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:03.240
and you mentioned
shame, what were

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.860
some strategies you used to
neutralize the shame that you

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.200
felt?

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.500
KELSEY CROWE: I'm not
a good shame overcomer.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:14.670
So if I write a book
about resilience,

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:16.230
it would be about
how hard it is.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.800
I know the research behind
shame says you just have

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.870
to face your issue head-on.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.690
And certainly by
my doing this work,

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:30.750
I have lost a lot
of shame, and that

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:35.220
comes from engaging deeply
in the source of what

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.880
I experienced, dialoguing
with others, even

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.660
people who I thought weren't
there for me so much,

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:46.830
having some of those
difficult conversations.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.630
That helped me to
get over the shame.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:50.130
But now I have other
kinds of shame.

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:55.530
AUDIENCE: Another
Dory question--

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:58.230
when I'm trying to support
a friend, oftentimes

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:01.200
one of the first things I
do is ask, how can I help?

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.870
When I started asking this, I
was sure this would be helpful,

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:07.650
but 90% of the time, the answer
is something like, nothing.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:09.719
Is there any better
way you would recommend

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:11.392
to discern their needs?

00:34:11.392 --> 00:34:12.600
KELSEY CROWE: Am I surprised?

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:17.243
The best way to handle
this situation--

00:34:17.243 --> 00:34:18.659
if you know that
a friend is going

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:22.080
through something difficult,
just offer something.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.380
So for example, hey, I want
to come by next Tuesday

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:26.100
with pizza.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.515
My only question is, is
it pepperoni or cheese?

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:33.480
You just offer it.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.840
Make it very easy to accept by
saying, I'm going to the store.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.400
I'm going to go get some things.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.290
Do you need anything?

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:45.179
Or, if you love music like I've
said, put together a playlist.

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:46.110
Just do it.

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:47.310
Just offer it.

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:49.719
Maybe that person wasn't
saying, god, I really,

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:52.800
really hope somebody
sends me a playlist today.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.790
That's not going to happen.

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:58.200
But they're going to appreciate
your offer, your kindness

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.570
that's backed by
action, and they

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:04.890
will be more receptive to asking
you for help in the future.

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:08.020
But just saying, how can I help?

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:09.990
It's a very hard
question for somebody

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:13.990
who's suffering to hear and
respond to for a few reasons.

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:15.940
First, because of the shame.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.790
Second, you often
don't quite know

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:22.020
what you need when you're in
a moment of crisis or grief.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:25.110
You can't say, what I
really need today is

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:29.340
somebody to ask me, how am I?

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.400
What I really need
today is somebody--

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.185
well, I do I do this--
to do my laundry.

00:35:34.185 --> 00:35:36.240
[LAUGHS]

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:41.640
But very often, if you're in the
initial aftermath of a crisis,

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.160
so much around you
is falling apart--

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.300
the garden, the trash,
the dishes, keeping up

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:53.790
with the bills, getting the
kid to daycare, let alone all

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.520
the depression and the sadness--

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.340
you could name a thousand
different things that you need

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.470
and not find one for a response.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:03.930
So just offer up that--

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:06.915
what you know how to do.

00:36:06.915 --> 00:36:09.690
AUDIENCE: Now, do you
think the issues we

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.910
have here in this country
regarding reaching out

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:13.500
to people, asking
if they need help

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:17.029
is due to a cultural aspect
or is there something

00:36:17.029 --> 00:36:17.820
else deeply rooted?

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.880
Because I've noticed that when
I've gone to other developing

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.620
countries, the cultural bonds
seem to be much stronger,

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.240
and people seem to be more
open about their personal lives

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:27.800
and whatnot.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.250
KELSEY CROWE: Mm-hmm, yes.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.430
It's very true.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:34.800
I mean, Americans have just
this history of pull yourself up

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.820
by your bootstraps
and the individualism,

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:42.150
and it certainly, certainly
is reflected in our inability

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.160
to ask for help.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.170
And I lived in Africa, and I've
also lived in South America

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.000
and in Europe.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.910
And it is certainly
true that we can

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:54.540
be a lot more hesitant
to offer help and also,

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.084
frankly, to receive it.

00:36:57.084 --> 00:36:59.250
We're very, very likely
here to say, "oh, that's OK.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:04.480
I'm fine," because we feel
shame around receiving help.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.940
So there are differences.

00:37:09.606 --> 00:37:11.530
And even around
communication techniques

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:13.650
there can be some differences.

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:17.610
The idea of giving
advice, it's not really

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.510
recommended for people
in difficult times

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.970
here who are American,
but advice giving

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.610
can be seen a little
bit differently

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.850
in some different cultures.

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:33.120
AUDIENCE: My question is
around is there a not-do list?

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.680
Did you ask that
before I came in?

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.610
KAREN MAY: No.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.800
We've talked about it.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.280
I'm smiling because we've
talked about the not-do list,

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.280
and it's also in the book.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.030
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.360
KAREN MAY: So great question.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.440
KELSEY CROWE: Yes.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.030
And we all want
that not-do list.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:49.361
[LAUGHS]

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:53.244
So in the book,
Emily, my co-author,

00:37:53.244 --> 00:37:54.660
came up with a
great title for it,

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:58.670
which was "Please Help
Me Not Be a Disaster."

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:02.040
So the not-do list, I have a
couple of examples of those,

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.880
but I'm just going to say
what underlies pretty much

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:11.580
every not-to-do is our tendency
to fix someone's problem.

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:15.600
And again, Karen would
be the first to say,

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.442
we don't pay people at Google to
just sit around and be present.

00:38:19.442 --> 00:38:20.400
KAREN MAY: That's true.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.580
KELSEY CROWE: We are
paying you to fix things.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.620
And we feel a lot
of satisfaction

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.280
when we can fix things.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:33.960
So our culture of productivity,
problem-solving, it's awesome.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.220
Not around these times of
emotional vulnerability.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:44.280
Problem-solving, fixing, it
just shuts the whole thing down.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.950
Anybody have any
experience with this?

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:50.800
And some examples of trying
to fix someone's problem--

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.100
top on the list, giving advice.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:06.830
Someone tells you, oh, I just
can't get over feeling so sad.

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:09.620
I lost my dad two months
ago, and I'm still--

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.610
I just think about
him every day.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:18.550
The response "have
you tried running?"

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.080
is not helpful.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.810
Or, "well, maybe if you
thought about--" not helpful.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:26.600
"You know what you should
do or what you could do--"

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.910
these are all signs that
you're giving advice.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:32.540
"Have you thought about--"
"you know what you could do--"

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:39.220
"you know what you should do--"
instead, just say, "I'm sorry.

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:42.310
I imagine that's really
hard," and be present.

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:43.720
That's what's needed.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.270
So no fixing, no advice.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:49.060
And in the book I also then
talk about some non-listening

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.550
styles, which are
a lot of don'ts.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:53.720
And everyone in this
room, including myself,

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:57.640
including Karen, we all have
our non-listening go-tos.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:01.910
It could, for example,
be the eternal optimist.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:06.490
So somebody who's always seeing
the bright side of a situation.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:11.560
It can be from, "oh god, I
ran out of gas on the bridge,

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.170
and I had to wait three
hours for a toll truck."

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:18.340
"At least a toll truck
came," down to the deepest

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:20.290
forms of suffering.

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:25.390
Or somebody is told to
see a silver lining.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:29.620
Gratitude, sure, it's very, very
helpful for helping you cope.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.740
Finding meaning in tragedy,
it's been scientifically

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.440
proven it helps us.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.410
But that meaning that we
find, that gratitude that we

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:42.460
experience, it can never
be handed from outside.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:45.230
It only gets
cultivated from within.

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:49.570
So never try to offer somebody
an optimistic perspective.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:53.710
I, as a non-listening
style, am a doomsayer.

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:56.530
Someone may say
something really tragic,

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:59.166
and I say, oh my
god, that's horrible!

00:40:59.166 --> 00:41:00.790
And then they wind
up responding to me,

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:03.980
no, no, no, it's not that bad.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.670
And they wound up not feeling
like they can actually

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:08.830
share what they're
feeling because then they

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:10.090
feel they have to protect--

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:12.280
deflect my alarm.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.740
So of course the doomsayer
hates the optimist.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:18.180
And those two often marry
each other, so pay attention.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.911
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.600
But so either reacting
with strong alarm

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:28.120
to somebody's situation
or severe positivity

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.990
can be really, really a don't,
as well as giving advice.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.450
I have several more
examples, but it all

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:39.490
comes down to trying to
adjust how a person is viewing

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:41.870
or handling their situation.

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:45.460
And so often what winds up
happening when you do that with

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:50.440
any of those don'ts is you make
that person feel more ashamed,

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.900
as if they should be
having it together.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:01.240
Rarely is that our call to
make under normal grieving

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.050
circumstances.

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:04.030
Of course, there are
times when somebody

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:06.670
is heading into a dangerous
zone, and that's different.

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:11.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:11.670
Oops.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:14.170
Is it on?

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:15.330
OK.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:18.470
I have a followup question to
that because I have a friend

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:21.039
that I've been
supporting for years.

00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:22.705
KELSEY CROWE: Say
that again, I'm sorry.

00:42:22.705 --> 00:42:25.940
AUDIENCE: I have a
friend, and she's

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.730
been having issues with her
family for many, many years.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:33.710
And I've been there to
support her, listen to her,

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.590
and this has been going
on for maybe 10 years.

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:39.410
And I'm at the point where I
really want to give advice.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.997
I try to give
advice, but she's not

00:42:42.997 --> 00:42:44.580
interested in listening
to the advice.

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.570
But I can clearly see
that some of the issues

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:49.730
that she's having
with her family is

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:52.380
because of her actions
and her response.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:55.610
It's really not the
family that much.

00:42:55.610 --> 00:43:00.160
And I discovered
that, but when I

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.110
try to tell her that she
might have a role in this,

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.120
she just shuts me down.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.150
So now I'm at the point I
don't know what to do anymore

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:11.870
because I want to be there for
her, i want to support her,

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:17.350
but I also want her to realize
that it takes two to tango.

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:20.780
And I don't know
how to move forward.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.510
KELSEY CROWE: That's
a real, real problem,

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:25.820
and I talk about
it in my book too.

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.450
So there are problems
sometimes that consume us

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:36.080
so much and for so long,
and the people around us

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.780
who care about us don't
even feel like they

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:41.610
know who we are anymore.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:44.870
So as a friend who's
seeing somebody

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:49.520
consumed by their problem
two, three, four years out,

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:53.180
that's reached a whole other
threshold of difficulty.

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.730
And the way to begin
that conversation

00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:57.440
is not with, advice
even though you

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:02.330
see so many other avenues
this person could take,

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:04.730
so many books they
should read, so many ways

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.910
to handle this situation--
it's so clear in front of you,

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:08.910
and she's not seeing it.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:11.630
And you just want to do
a PowerPoint for her,

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:13.850
walk her through it.

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:16.970
It's not going to
work, as you know.

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:19.280
The place to begin
in that conversation

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:23.900
is not with advice, it's
where you are vulnerable,

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.530
and that means talking about
your relationship to her.

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.930
You've lost your
friend, I'm sure,

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:35.620
on some level because she is
so caught up in this dialogue.

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:39.270
And you probably feel that you
can't talk on neutral ground

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:41.850
with things that are
going on for you.

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:45.280
It's hard to trust
somebody who's

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:49.130
so easily consumed
by this obsession

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:53.030
and so easily
pulled apart by it.

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:57.000
And so where it's vulnerable
for you is to say,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.960
I have to say I can't hang
with where this is right now.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.190
I can't feel safe.

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:09.720
I don't feel that I can
be around this problem

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.570
that you have and not
because I don't love you.

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:16.710
I've loved you for years,
but you are changing.

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:18.240
Does that make sense?

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:22.170
You are not the person
who I knew 10 years ago.

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:24.060
Or if she is the
person and you've

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:29.430
changed, where you no longer
want to just entertain

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:33.240
stories of failure,
about people's failures,

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.330
then that's part of
the dialogue too.

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:40.080
Always emphasizing that
you love and care for her,

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.660
but that you don't
know what to do

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.240
with this problem, which
isn't that she's not

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.200
taking your advice.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:51.050
The problem is that you aren't
connecting with her anymore.

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:52.410
Does that makes sense?

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:55.110
That's a far more
vulnerable place

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:58.080
to be in the conversation
than offering advice,

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.960
but it's the only way that
she's going to change.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.970
When people realize that their
obsessions with their problems

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:10.190
are having consequences
on their relationships,

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:15.240
then it's in their hands to
make some choices around it.

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.090
Does that help?

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:18.890
AUDIENCE: Kind of,
but it also opens up

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:21.000
a lot of other questions.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.430
How do I phrase that?

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:23.390
How do I word that?

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:24.680
How do I even--

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:25.440
yes, it's tough.

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.094
KELSEY CROWE: I think you
can even say, first of all,

00:46:28.094 --> 00:46:29.760
I clearly care about
this because you've

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.449
brought this up to me.

00:46:32.449 --> 00:46:33.740
I really care about this issue.

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.750
I've been thinking about
how to deal with this.

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:38.390
Just showing your
concern, just being you.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:39.530
There is no perfect phrase.

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.720
There's nothing perfect
that you can say or do.

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.642
This conversation
is going to suck.

00:46:43.642 --> 00:46:45.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:46.852 --> 00:46:49.310
Just show how much you care
and all the thought that you've

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:51.768
been putting up into this moment
of talking to her and say,

00:46:51.768 --> 00:46:54.200
"and I don't know how to
make this conversation

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:57.790
happen going forward, but
this is what I'm feeling.

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:01.130
I want you to know I don't want
to be the friend that runs away

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:08.270
from you, and I want to
feel more connected to you.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:11.120
And I need some more
positivity from you,"

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.040
or whatever it is, whatever
the particularities are.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.360
It is going to be a hard,
difficult conversation,

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:21.380
and that really gets
around authenticity.

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:26.100
And some of our friendships
are more authentic than others.

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.780
And it's you doing your own
inventory-- how authentic do

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:32.240
I want this relationship to be?

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.300
And you may decide, I don't
want it to be that authentic,

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.562
but then you do not
open yourself up

00:47:37.562 --> 00:47:39.020
for hearing all of
these complaints

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:41.410
because that's only a
drain on your energy.

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:42.580
Does that make sense?

00:47:45.371 --> 00:47:47.120
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to ask when you're

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:50.810
speaking to a friend, a
friend in that situation,

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:54.380
and can brainstorm
action items that they

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:58.280
want to do, how do you hold them
accountable in a way that's not

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:03.800
really all in their
face, but you just

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:08.510
want them to do what
they say they'll do?

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:11.830
KELSEY CROWE: You tell
them to hire a coach.

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:13.340
AUDIENCE: OK, so
how do you do that?

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:16.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:19.610
For instance, I have
a friend who admits,

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:21.440
I have a lot going
on, and I think

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:26.600
it's more than my friends can
handle or my family can handle.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.310
And I think I should
talk to someone.

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:30.370
But then it won't happen.

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:32.560
It hasn't happened, forever.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.050
And so how do you hold them
accountable for talking

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:40.046
to someone, or getting a
coach, or whatever it is?

00:48:40.046 --> 00:48:42.170
KELSEY CROWE: I mean, the
thing about friendships--

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:44.044
and that's where they
are different from work

00:48:44.044 --> 00:48:45.550
relationships--

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:49.710
is we don't often hold each
other accountable for things.

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:53.420
In fact, what you find bringing
is less accountability and more

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:58.070
patience, so having patience
for your friend that is just

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:00.320
struggling with moving on.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:03.830
If it's not deriding from the
quality of your relationship--

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:05.270
does this make sense?

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:07.460
If in fact you have
a great relationship,

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:10.250
your friend just
has this one area

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:18.050
where they want to improve,
meet certain milestones,

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:23.210
listen to them, be disappointed
that they failed themselves.

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:24.950
But you are not, as
a friend, the person

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:27.140
to hold them
accountable for that.

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.060
Where you can hold
someone accountable

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:32.420
is if they're behaving
in a way that's affecting

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:34.540
your relationship to them.

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:40.940
And that, if you don't
see improvement over time,

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:43.700
that's on them.

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:47.120
It is never our job
as friends to expect

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:51.720
to keep people accountable
for how they behave.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.780
And so sometimes in
both of these cases,

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:59.520
you just reach your own
reckoning around that.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.870
Something that you
learn as you get older

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:06.650
is the value of
patience, that no one

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:10.760
does everything they
say they're going to do,

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:13.430
and then also secondly,
the value of our time

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:19.780
and energy in that we can't
invest our heart into everybody

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:22.970
that we thought we could.

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:25.070
So figuring out that balance.

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:27.570
KAREN MAY: It looks like we
have time for one more question.

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:29.420
Jordan, I'll ask if there's
something on the Dory

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.336
that you want to read.

00:50:30.336 --> 00:50:31.640
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.620
It can be just as difficult
to ask for support

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:34.940
as it can be to give it.

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:36.410
Do you have any
thoughts on asking

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:38.807
for help in difficult times?

00:50:38.807 --> 00:50:41.390
KELSEY CROWE: Anyone who's even
thinking about asking for help

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:44.360
is in such a good place,
so kudos to whoever

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.300
asked that question.

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.020
It's great.

00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:50.990
I think you want to
ask people for help

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:53.720
in areas where they're strong.

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.690
So if your friend is
always late, for example--

00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:00.950
and we all know that person--

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:05.542
do not ask them to drive
you to court, to drive you

00:51:05.542 --> 00:51:06.500
to your chemo session--

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:07.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:15.140
--to meet with your doctor, none
of the life-altering matters.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.360
Don't put them
under that pressure.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.760
But if, in fact, they're
a really great listener--

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:23.960
it's not uncommon for that open
kind of person who's fluid with

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:27.910
time is also good in
the emotional realm--

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:31.730
say, can you just
come over tonight?

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:33.680
I just need some company.

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:37.580
Or you have a friend who's
pretty light and bubbly who

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:40.490
may not be very comfortable
with awkward, emotionally

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:46.850
fraught conversations, but is
really good for just escapism.

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:49.050
Say, would you watch
reality TV with me?

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:50.280
Let's go to a movie.

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:54.470
Play to people's strengths,
as aware of them as you are,

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:56.120
so that you give
them an opportunity

00:51:56.120 --> 00:52:00.080
to give what they
know how to give.

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.730
And don't ask them
to give something

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:03.170
that's really hard to give.

00:52:07.862 --> 00:52:08.570
KAREN MAY: Great.

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:10.970
Well, terrific questions
and great advice

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:12.860
to all of us to think about--

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:15.560
what we have to give and
what others have to give us.

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.900
And thank you for
writing your book

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:19.500
and for joining us here today.

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:19.880
KELSEY CROWE: Thank you.

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:20.340
KAREN MAY: Thank you.

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:21.798
KELSEY CROWE: Thanks
for having me.

00:52:21.798 --> 00:52:24.550
