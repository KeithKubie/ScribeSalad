00:00:06.646 --> 00:00:08.226
&gt;&gt;Ready to hold your invention?

00:00:08.796 --> 00:00:08.946
Yep.

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:12.266
&gt;&gt;Narrator: You see it everywhere,
on the walls in the hallway,

00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:16.256
in classrooms, and on the lab
coats teachers wear every day:

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:19.706
the distinctive branding
of the National Aeronautics

00:00:19.706 --> 00:00:21.016
and Space Administration.

00:00:21.106 --> 00:00:22.466
&gt;&gt;Good Morning, Forest Lake.

00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:23.216
Good morning.

00:00:24.696 --> 00:00:29.196
&gt;&gt;Forrest Lake Elementary was one
of 150 schools across the country

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:32.776
to be selected for the NASA
Explorer Schools Program.

00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:36.666
Designed to spark interest and
achievement in math, science,

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:40.866
and technology, the program
provided grants for technology tools,

00:00:41.246 --> 00:00:44.086
summer teacher workshops,
curriculum materials,

00:00:44.206 --> 00:00:46.446
and ongoing professional development.

00:00:46.756 --> 00:00:49.046
&gt;&gt;Our focus is on twenty-first
century learners.

00:00:49.536 --> 00:00:53.176
We know that for our
students to be prepared,

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:57.286
they need all that we can provide
in science, technology, engineering,

00:00:57.286 --> 00:01:02.246
mathematics and NASA
seemed like a perfect fit.

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:03.976
&gt;&gt;We thank you.

00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:06.906
&gt;&gt;It's no accident that the
school's TV studio looks a little

00:01:06.906 --> 00:01:07.906
like Cape Canaveral.

00:01:08.446 --> 00:01:12.186
And this morning's broadcast featured
a first grade team of inventors

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:14.066
who came up with a new twist

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:18.216
on the old drinking fountain
just in time for flu season.

00:01:18.816 --> 00:01:23.856
&gt;&gt;Well the Sani-Sipper, there's a
tube that hooks up to this nozzle

00:01:23.856 --> 00:01:30.506
and it has a detector causing the
sanitizer to clean it at every use.

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.496
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Beyond the curriculum
materials and grant money,

00:01:33.786 --> 00:01:37.796
the association with NASA helps the
school build a sense of purpose.

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:41.976
&gt;&gt;We are very proud to be a NASA
Explorer School and so a lot

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:45.306
of things that a lot of teachers
use as really good practices

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:48.126
in their classroom to create a
classroom community I've just tried

00:01:48.126 --> 00:01:49.206
to give a NASA spin.

00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:51.786
So the copilot's responsibilities
are to assist me.

00:01:52.106 --> 00:01:54.306
Anything that I need done, they do.

00:01:54.536 --> 00:01:57.776
I've got a communications officer
and she's responsible for passing

00:01:57.776 --> 00:01:59.856
out papers and taking
papers back in again.

00:01:59.856 --> 00:02:03.196
An environmental officer maintains
the cleanliness of the classroom

00:02:03.296 --> 00:02:05.646
so it creates a bond
in the community.

00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:11.456
&gt;&gt;We are using videoconference
equipment to connect to NASA Langley.

00:02:11.876 --> 00:02:12.406
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students

00:02:12.406 --> 00:02:16.396
in an after-school program have
direct access to NASA personnel

00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:19.676
in Langley, Virginia
via a videoconference.

00:02:19.676 --> 00:02:23.206
&gt;&gt;Our mission is the
superabsorbent polymers.

00:02:23.636 --> 00:02:26.206
&gt;&gt;Today they are sharing
findings of their experiments

00:02:26.206 --> 00:02:28.956
with a polymer used
to keep diapers dry.

00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:32.016
&gt;&gt;The first step was I put
them in different cups.

00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:35.326
One was polymer, one what
they did with the Dr. Pepper,

00:02:35.626 --> 00:02:37.236
one they did with the
cranberry juice,

00:02:37.236 --> 00:02:39.056
and the other they did
with the low-fat milk.

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:43.506
&gt;&gt;I wanted to think of something
that they could maybe have

00:02:43.506 --> 00:02:46.956
in their everyday life but
had never thought too much

00:02:46.956 --> 00:02:48.756
about the science behind it.

00:02:49.176 --> 00:02:52.976
&gt;&gt;What attracted you to do
this type of experiment?

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:56.366
&gt;&gt;Tammy: It just sort of happened
that all girls came together.

00:02:56.456 --> 00:03:00.176
I know that there's been
some research and some talk

00:03:00.176 --> 00:03:04.756
about how girls and science,
they kind of fall behind

00:03:04.756 --> 00:03:06.946
and let the boys sort of take over.

00:03:07.236 --> 00:03:12.076
And with it being an all-girls
group some of them have stepped

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:13.896
up a little more than they would have

00:03:14.326 --> 00:03:17.976
if we were mixed in
here with the boys.

00:03:17.976 --> 00:03:22.076
&gt;&gt;Like when you think of a girl
you think oh yeah, oh nails.

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:25.286
But like in this we can be ourselves

00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:28.406
and like we can get
down and get messy.

00:03:28.646 --> 00:03:35.046
&gt;&gt;It's really cool to me to be
able to work with real people

00:03:35.456 --> 00:03:41.596
that are actually experienced and I
kind of want to be an engineer there

00:03:41.656 --> 00:03:44.876
because my grandfather
was an engineer with NASA.

00:03:45.286 --> 00:03:51.346
&gt;&gt;It's really exciting working with
NASA and all my friends working

00:03:51.346 --> 00:03:53.526
with NASA, it's really fun.

00:03:54.016 --> 00:03:57.656
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Like many institutions,
NASA has been forced to make cuts

00:03:57.706 --> 00:04:01.026
in its Explorer Schools
Program, but it continues

00:04:01.026 --> 00:04:04.706
to offer free curriculum
materials on its website helping

00:04:04.736 --> 00:04:07.606
to fuel a passion for
science and service.

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:12.526
&gt;&gt;I always wanted to help people
and be a surgeon or a doctor,

00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:16.016
and so I'm like I really like NASA
and so I'm thinking about being,

00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:17.096
I want to be a doctor there.

00:04:18.816 --> 00:04:20.676
