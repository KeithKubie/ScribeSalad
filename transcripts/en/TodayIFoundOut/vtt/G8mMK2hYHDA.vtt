00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:10.450
The Victorian Moustache Cup

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.070
Beyond being a staple of any self-respecting
peace officer, thanks to the popularity of

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.330
things like Movember, the humble moustache
has made a glorious, bristly return to the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.000
faces of men all over the world in recent
years.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.800
As a result, there is an almost endless supply
of moustache related products one can buy,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.180
which means it’s only a matter of time until
the moustache cup once again becomes relatively

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.180
commonplace.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.750
“What’s a moustache cup”, you say?

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.940
The moustache cup is a cup designed with a
small lip on the inside intended to protect

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.590
the drinker’s face fuzz from whatever beverage
they happen to be drinking.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.949
Despite sounding like the kind of joke gift
you’d get a moustachioed co-worker for secret

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.430
Santa because you don’t know them that well,
the moustache cup was something people took

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.920
very seriously once upon a time and it’s
noted that pretty much every self-respecting

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.440
gentlemen in the mid-to-late Victorian England
with a mouthbrow owned at least one.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.930
If you’ve ever taken a glance at portraits
from the 19th century, you’re probably aware

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.300
that huge moustaches were very popular with
gentlemen of the era.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.870
In fact, from 1860-1916, the British military
actually required all of its soldiers to sport

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.680
a moustache for the authority it imparted
to the moustachioed man.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.890
Not surprisingly from this, gentlemen ultimately
came up with a number of ways to make sure

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.069
that their lip warmers were as gloriously
trimmed and maintained as possible.

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:38.930
One of the more popular ways to style a moustache
during this time was to use wax, some men

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.880
also liked to dye their moustache to give
it a more vibrant appearance.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.780
The problem with both of these methods of
moustache maintenance was that neither held

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.369
up well to hot liquid- dye would run and wax
would invariably melt and cause unsightly

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.250
moustache droopage the second it came into
contact with something like hot tea or coffee.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.640
Enter the moustache cup which is generally
thought to have been invented by an English

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.619
potter named Harvey Adams sometime between
1850 and 1860.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.540
The moustache cup allowed a magnificently
moustachioed man to safely sip on a cup of

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.430
steaming tea without it getting wet or contaminating
his tea.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.160
So when Adams first introduced the moustache
cup in Staffordshire, they proved to be a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.960
hit with the social elite, causing a wave
of copycat products to hit the market.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.150
Although moustache cups are also known to
have been very popular across the pond, finding

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.890
a surviving specimen with a “made in America”
mark on it is incredibly rare.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.320
This is not so much a reflection on their
popularity in America, but because early American

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.470
manufacturers would commonly falsely claim
that the cups they produced had been made

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.920
in England due to the high demand for English
ceramics in the states at the time.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.190
Surviving left-handed moustache cups are also
noted to be very hard to find and even when

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.450
the popularity of the cup was at its peak,
left-handed individuals usually had to make

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.100
do with a portable moustache guard that could
be fitted onto either side of an ordinary

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.100
cup.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.190
By the turn of the 20th century, the invention
of the safety razor led to a change in grooming

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.510
habits that made moustache cups obsolete for
the vast majority of men.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.310
As a result, production and sales of moustache
cups slowly dried up.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:34.590
By 1930, this formerly commonplace item was
almost unheard of.
