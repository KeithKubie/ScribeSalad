We're so glad you're here,

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.530
and the first thing I think we
should do is thank the Fresno State

our Poet Laureate this afternoon

and what a wonderful start to
our evening, and as I speak,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.780

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.510

I love Fresno and I
wish I was there.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.870
Each year we close the
library's literally season

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.450
with an event honoring our Poet
Laureate consultant in poetry.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.370
Tonight we celebrate our
amazing 21st Poet Laureate

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.610
as he concludes his
second and final term.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.310
Juan Filipe Herrera has
been one of the most popular

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.510
and successful Poet Laureates ever.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:07:02.110
[ Applause ]

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.650 position:56%
From the moment he was appointed, he
has tirelessly championed the power

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.170 position:56%
of poetry to connect us and
empower audiences across the country

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:16.070
by telling everyone "You
have a beautiful voice."

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.180
He has put his own beautiful voice
to work for all of us as well.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.000
As Laureate, Juan Filipe
has written poems

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.370
that address pressing
social issues and poems

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.990
that capture the sublime
in everyday life.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.030
He even wrote an inspiring
poem each focuses a story

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.780
for his first meeting with
Carla Hayden our 14th Librarian

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.080
of Congress.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.960
But he doesn't just
wheeled a skilled pen,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.070
Juan Filipe has been one of the
most active Poet Laureates ever.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.610
In his first term, he
launched the online initiative

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.290
"La Casa de Colores;
The House of Colors."

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.980
It includes the epic crowd
source poem "La Familia"

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.970
which echoed the diverse
voices of America.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:06.560
He also produced the
video series "El Jardin;

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.170
The Garden" in which he
walked viewers through some

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.910
of the library's surprising
treasures.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:18.550
For his second term, Juan Filipe

He also launched "Wordstreet
Champions

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.010
and Brave Builders of the Dream."

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.050
A yearlong project with
Chicago public libraries

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:47.670
and the Poetry Foundation, which
excuse me, Chicago public schools,

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:51.410
Chicago public libraries,
and the Poetry Foundation

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:55.250
which gave educators new
strategies for teaching poetry.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:59.050
For his final project,
Juan Filipe created the

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:04.250
"Laureate Lab-Visual Wordist
Studio", and innovative space

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:09.790
in the library of California State
University in Fresno; his hometown.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.120
Here, Juan Filipe mixed
poetry, song,

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.470
and art in wonderfully dynamic
programs for his local community.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.370
That's for one Filipe
dreamed up today's celebration

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:28.180
which he has named "Speak the
People/the Spark/el Poema."

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.300
We begin this evening with the
discussion of Latino culture

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.800
and its contributions to
our national heritage.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.780
Joining Juan Filipe here on
stage will be Martha Gonzalez,

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.950

as well as a singer,
songwriter, and percussionist

Hugo Morales, the founder and
director of Radio Bilingue,

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:05.210

network and content producer

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.010
for the nation's broadcasting
system,

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:16.090
and MacArthur "Genius" Fellow,
and Louis Pererra; excuse me,

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:19.200
Louie Perez, the songwriter,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.760
and guitarist for the
multi-Grammy Award winning band,

Los Lobos which he
cofounded in 1973.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:32.010
Their discussion titled "Let
Us Gather in a Flourishing Way"

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.770
after Juan Filipe's seminal
poem will be moderated

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:40.530
by Rafael Perez-Torres who
is a distinguished author,

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.890
literary critic, and
English Professor at UCLA.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.510
Following the discussion and after
a short break, we are delighted

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.420
to welcome Martha and other members
of Quetzal to the stage for one

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.050
of their amazing performances.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.280
I have to confess to
you, that I did a lot

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.790
of practice of the Spanish names.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:09.390
I was a French major in college,
so when I got to El Jardin,

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.720
I wanted to say [foreign
word spoken].

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.960
But I have to say that I
was able to get through this

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.940
because of the wonderful Maria
Rona [assumed spelling] who is here

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.540
with the Library of Congress.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:27.090
Marie, thank you for getting
me through, for coaching me.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.510
I'm going to need a
lot more in the future.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:35.590
In my last two minutes I'm going
to go off script just a moment.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:41.690
Several weeks ago the
library received the archive

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.510
of a wonderful photo
journalist, Bob Adelman.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:52.180
Bob sadly died over a year ago
and his archive has come here.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.280
He was an extremely
interesting photo journalist.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.710
He was a confidant of Martin
Luther King and Andy Warhol.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.260
How's that for a range?

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.800
But he took wonderful photos

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.070
and my dream is one day we'll
have an exhibit of his works here.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:15.100
When we received the gift, we
had a celebration of Bob's life

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:22.290
and Juan Filipe composed a poem
in his honor, and it was so moving

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:27.870
and so inspiring, and
captured Bob so beautifully.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:36.200 position:56%
So, I became really I guess inspired
by Juan Filipe's his ability

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.420
to write this, this
wonderful poem and I decided

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.470
that I would write
a poem in his honor.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:48.150
Now, I know that takes
a lot of chutzpa.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:53.490
I've never written a poem in
my life, but what can I say?

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.400
Juan Filipe inspired me.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:01.510
So my poem consists
of fifty stanzas, no.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:05.640
[ Laughter ]

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.680
I promise I can read it
to you in under a minute,

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.580
but I have to say I
really enjoyed writing it.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:19.810
Juan Filipe's tenure here has just
been so joyful and has enriched me

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:25.030
so much and just opened me up to
the whole potential of poetry,

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:29.430
but I wanted to do something to
thank him and really honor him.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.230
So here it goes.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.710
My poem is titled, "JFH."

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:42.530
J; Juan, a journey full of wonder
and surprise revealed as poet,

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:49.570
performer, writer, cartoonist,
anthropologist, teacher, activist,

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:55.560
poet laureate, yet a son of
migrants whom never forgets.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:01.390
F; Filipe, Allen Ginsberg
revealed from time to time,

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:07.820 position:56%
through landscapes and language, a
panoramic vision always reminding us

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:15.730
of risk, of children, of suffering,
of family, of anguish, and time.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:24.110
H; Herrera, humble yet full of
the devil and full of Bob Dylan,

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:28.610
and Woody Guthrie, and
Spalding Gray, and Frida Kahlo,

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:35.660
and Cat Stevens, and Rosa Parks,
and farmers, and sorrow, and loss.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:40.460
JFH, Poet Laureate, poet for life.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.510
The end.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:55.290
[ Applause ]

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.410
Well, thank you for flattering
me with that applause.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.360
I feel a little better and
nobody threw anything at me.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.270
So, without further ado, may
I present our Poet Laureate,

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.050
Juan Filipe Herrera and
our distinguished guests.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.510
Thank you so much.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.470
[ Applause ]

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:15.980
&gt;&gt; Juan Filipe Herrera:
Thank you so much.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.280
That was great.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.190
That was beautiful.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.490
Thank you.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.290
Thank you so much.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:40.410
[ Applause ]

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.630
&gt;&gt; Rafael Perez-Torres: Well, thank
you all for coming out tonight.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.140
We very much appreciate
it and I think we're

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:49.710
in for a very special
evening of stories and music,

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:52.110
and I'd just like to say it's
my great honor to be here,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:56.500
it's my great privilege to be here
and to welcome you all this evening

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.670
at the closing ceremonies
recognizing

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.160
and celebrating the tenure
of Juan Filipe Herrera

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.510
as our Poet Laureate
of the United States.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:18.780
[ Applause ]

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:22.040
I just, I think his
poetry is significant to us

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.180
because it sings to our hearts.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.160
It touches each one of us, but
it also speaks of the earth.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.360
It speaks of history.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.830
It speaks of time.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:36.750
It connects us profoundly
to felt sense of place,

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:41.600
both in terms of being in a
specific geography, but also living

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.710
in history and being connected
to an extensive history.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.320
He makes us feel located
in a continuum

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.230
of belonging whether it be our
roots as Americans indigenous

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:58.260
to the continent or be it as
the result of our ancestors

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:04.830
or us individually flying or
walking or swimming, however we got

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:09.080
to the United States to become a
part of this union, and this union

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:14.480
that Juan Filipe as U.S.
Poet Laureate represents.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.510
We're here to recognize Juan
Filipe's voice as has contributed

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.510
to our sense of belonging in the
world; our sense of connection

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:26.650
to each other and our
sense of recognition

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.600
of ourselves through his poetry.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.560
So, I'd like to invite Juan
Filipe to read first off a poem,

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.070
"Let Us Come Together
in a Flourishing Way"

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:40.820
which our evening is dedicated
to and then to talk may be

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.390
for a few minutes about
his experiences

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.450
with the Flor y Canto
Movement in the 1970s,

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.380
the Chicano Poetry
Movement that brought arts

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:54.220
and social activism together
and brought them together

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:58.120
in a collective dedicated
to transforming the world

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.750
in which they lived and the world

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.880
in which them thought
we would be living in.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.620
So, Juan Filipe please I invite
you to share your words with us.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.370
&gt;&gt; Juan Filipe Herrera: You want me

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.590
to share some words
about those times?

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.890
&gt;&gt; Rafael Perez-Torres:
About those times,

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.190
but if you would read the poem.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:15.750
If you would read the poem for us.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.050
&gt;&gt; Juan Filipe Herrera: Okay,
I just didn't know which words.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:18.390
&gt;&gt; Rafael Perez-Torres:
Yeah, that would be perfect.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:23.460
&gt;&gt; Juan Filipe Herrera: Yes
this is 1971 and I was walking

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:28.450
down Campbell Hall in
UCLA and out of nowhere I,

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:33.000
the phrase "Let us gather in a
flourishing way" just came to me,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.670
and I really enjoyed that phrase.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:39.170
I said, "That's something
that I want to write about."

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.730
Let us gather in a flourishing way

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:45.760
with sunluz grains abriendo los
cantos que cargamos cada día.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:52.760
En el young pasto nuestro cuerpo
para regalar y dar feliz perlas

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:57.770
pearls of corn flowing árboles
de vida en las cuatro esquinas.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:02.830
Let us gather in a flourishing
way contentos llenos de fuerza

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:08.650
to vida giving us strength, for
life, giving us nacimientos,

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.900
giving birth, giving new beginnings

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:18.900
to fragrant ríos dulces frescos
verdes turquoise strong carne de

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.370
nuestros hijos rainbows.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:26.600
Let us gather in a flourishing
way en la luz, in the light,

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:32.480
y en la carne, in the flesh of our
heart to toil tranquilos in fields

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:39.580
of blossoms juntos to stretch los
brazos together tranquilos in peace

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.940
with the rain en la
mañana temprana Estrella,

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:48.410
early morning daybreak star on
our forehead cielo de calor,

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:55.740
heaven of heat and wisdom to meet
us where we toil siempre always

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.790
in the garden of our
struggle and joy.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:02.770
Let us offer our hearts a saludar,

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:09.820
to greet our águila rising freedom
a celebrar woven brazos branches

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:14.940
ramas, stones and piedras nopales
and plumas and feathers piercing

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:20.470
and bursting figs and aguacates,
and avocados ripe mariposa,

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:25.830
butterfly fields and mares claros
and clear oceans and clear seas

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:31.770
of our face to breathe todos,
all of us en el camino,

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:34.830
on the road, on this road.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:40.990
Blessing seeds to give
to grow maiztlán,

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:46.510
the secret city en las
manos de nuestro amor.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:21:01.310
[ Applause ]

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.480
&gt;&gt; Rafael Perez-Torres: Can you
tell us a little about that period

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.630
and then the period that
came just after that?

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:06.930
&gt;&gt; Juan Filipe Herrera: Okay.

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.850
It's kind of indescribable.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.850
You know, you put, you put let's
see you put [foreign word spoken],

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.970
you put affirmative action,
you put [foreign word spoken],

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.790
you put [foreign name
spoken], you Jimmy Hendrix,

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:24.240
you put [foreign word spoken], you
put Chicanas [foreign name spoken],

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.540
[foreign name spoken], you
put [foreign name spoken],

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.740
you put the Chicano
Moratorium, you put leaving home

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:36.970
for the first time ever; first
time, first generation wild to go

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.630
to that place called, I
don't know is it UCLA?

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:45.020
Is it a new time, a
new epic, a new world?

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:51.080
I was so used to being to live
with my mother and my father

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:55.200
in little tents, in little trailers
and then in apartments and so forth

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.960
and that day came when that
big envelope from UCLA came.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:05.430
[Foreign name spoken], who I had
met in 1962 when we were both

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:11.730
in middle school who became one
of our pioneer in Chicano poets

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.810
who started cracking
the anthropology books

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:18.990
and one day he says, "Juan Filipe."

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:20.880
I go, "Yes."

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.310
"Today I'm a Chicano."

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.360
I said, "Well, what
were you yesterday?"

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.870
[Laughter] And so it
was like that, you know,

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:29.060
I was playing in the
last coffee houses

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:33.320 position:56%
that were still alive in the mid60s.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.890
One of them was in La Mesa,
California and was called,

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:39.240
it was called Bifrost Bridge.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.150
So we would go there and [foreign
name spoken] and I and we'd jump in

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.920
and he'd play congas and he
borrowed congas and I get up there

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.340
with harmonica that
that I didn't know how

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.640 position:56%
to play while there was a guitarists
playing blues while people

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.550
in the audience would
be drinking cider,

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.110 position:56%
hot cider with cinnamon sticks in it

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:59.520
and the folks song movement
was you know flourishing

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.550
and I'd be off key while the people
were singing "I've been a pauper,

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:08.550
a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a
king you know something like that.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.300
And so you put all
that stuff together

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:17.280
and then you put the explosion of
the Farm Workers' Union Movement

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.310 position:56%
and the pilgrimages from all the way

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:26.180 position:56%
to Sacramento [foreign language
spoken] and you put trips to Mexico,

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:33.870
trips to Cuba, and trips back
and living on rice and water.

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:40.740 position:56%
One of our fabulous ideas was living
on rice and water in San Diego

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:45.980
and San Francisco, and getting
very excited about the fact

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.880
that we actually had a voice
and that we wanted to cast it

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.210
in as many ways as possible and we
soon we started to work in groups

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.900
and form groups, form theater
groups, political theater groups,

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.430
student groups, collectives
and work with other collectives

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:02.840
in San Francisco for sure.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:08.200
And the women began to gathering
cottages and they rented cottages

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.850
as a collective and all of a
sudden they were like living

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:15.830
in their own world and woman
world and asserting their world

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:19.660 position:56%
in their own terms, and the [foreign
word spoken] were going up in L.A.,

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:24.630 position:56%
East L.A., and San Diego and all
across California, and the Southwest

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.640
and Texas, and San Antonio.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:31.500
So all that is taking place while
this poem is beginning to cook

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.990
and to be recited because all

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.290
of a sudden it was
really not about rioting.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.590
It wasn't about being a poet.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:46.600
It was about standing up and
speaking and for our communities

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:53.020
and to open up and break open
those vaults that had been there,

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.690
had been buried that had our
stories, our words, our symbols

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:00.080
and signs, and in many ways
our people and we wanted

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:06.520
to break open those vaults and step
into freedom and words and poems

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:11.800
and songs and music were a part
of that effort and project,

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.780
and I'm so happy that we're
here today echoing these things

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.890
and actually recreating and staring
a new with our great panel today

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:25.510
and everyone that's here in
our chamber seniors once again.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:34.050
[ Applause ]

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:37.580
&gt;&gt; Rafael Perez-Torres: And the
idea of voice and sharing voice

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.930
and collecting voices is one
of the things that we want

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.470
to talk about today as a panel.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:47.760
In order to get to some
sense of both the legacy

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:52.080
that Juan Filipe has left us
collectively as Poet Laureate,

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.370
but also how he's working
within a tradition

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.550
of Latino literary cultural
tradition that brings many

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:02.070
of us together and that
carries with us certain values

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:05.370
that have transformed
the national culture

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:10.190
and that have productively
contributed to the national culture

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:14.340
and so I'd like to introduce the
rest of the panel to you and I'd

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.840
like each of them in turn to
maybe just talk a little bit

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.140
about how they came to the
idea, the realization of voice,

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.340
having a voice, wanting to
share a voice and wanting

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:28.200
to share their voice with
others to form new collectives

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:34.920
and to both think in terms of the
social world that they inherited

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.510
and that we have inherited and
that we envision transforming,

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.560
but also the esthetic world, the
cultural world, the artistic world,

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.890
that these artists have worked
very hard as well to transform

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:53.230 position:56%
and transform the media that each of
these individuals has used in order

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.940
to challenge the nature
of that media

00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.260
as that media challenges the
nature of our social order

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.390
and our social hierarchies.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.650
So, Martha if you don't
mind I'd like to introduce

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:09.990
to you Martha Gonzalez, my friend
and Chicana activista, artist,

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:16.180 position:56%
and artivista as she calls herself a
musician, a feminist music theorist,

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.070
assistant professor at the
Intercollegiate Department

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:23.060
of Chicana/Chicano/Latina/Latino
Studies at Scripps College

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.720
in Claremont, California.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.830
She is a brilliant scholar, as
well as a brilliant musician

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:34.870
and she has received fellowships
from the Fulbright Foundation,

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.700
from the Ford Foundation and from
the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:44.500
Foundation which if very impressive
for a young scholar who's just a,

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.800
I won't say starting out.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.980
In fact, she's contributed
quite a bit already

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.960
to our field both musically
and intellectually.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.820
And her academic interests
and this is what's beautiful

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:58.030
about her career, is that
she, her academic interests

00:27:58.030 --> 00:27:59.870 position:56%
and you musical interests intertwine

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.660
and combined are completely
inseparable

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.150
and are beautifully
organic, and indeed,

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:08.070
her own academic interests
are fueled by her musicianship

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:11.370
as a singer, songwriter for
the Grammy Award winning band,

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:16.410
Quetzal who will be performing
later today for us and Quetzal

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:18.930
as you know has made
considerable impact

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.880
in both the Los Angeles music
scene, but the Latino music scene

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:26.030
and the folk music scene
in the states more broadly.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.350
She and her partner Quetzal
Flores have been instrumental

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:31.660
in catalyzing the transnational
dialogue between Chicanas

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.500
and Latina communities
in the United States

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.040
and the Jarocho communities
in Bejucos, Mexico.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.930
The Jarocho is a form of
rhythm and a form of music

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.970
that is typically traditional
of that region of Mexico

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:51.620
and it's just an extraordinarily
rich form of music that has very,

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:56.370
very deep roots both in indigenous
sounds and in African sounds.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:02.220
In 2014, her stomp box which was
featured earlier on the stage.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.520
You may have seen it.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.820
It was used as a platform.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.120
&gt;&gt; Martha Gonzalez:
That's an old one.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.420
I mean a borrowed one.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.720
&gt;&gt; Rafael Perez-Torres:
A borrowed one.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.500
It's called a tarima which is
a stomp box used for dancing.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:16.130 position:56%
Her tarima was acquired by the
National Museum of American History,

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:19.940
because of the wonderful work that
she and Quetzal have undertaken

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.910
in terms of musicianship and
their work for the community.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:28.690
Quetzal has just released a new
album, "The Eternal Getdown"

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:33.380
which is being released by
Smithsonian Folkways Label

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:38.510
and it is my great pleasure to
introduce to you Martha Gonzalez.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:49.040
[ Applause ]

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.970
&gt;&gt; Martha Gonzalez: I'd like to say
first of all that it's a real honor

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:55.810
to be up here with these
wonderful artists, these thinkers

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.550
and our very own Poet Laureate.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:03.310 position:56%
It's such an honor for me to be here
and I really, I'm, I was all torn

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:06.000
up in the bathroom and I just
couldn't; because I had thought

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.730
like what am I doing here?

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.820
Anyhow, a little while ago; TMI.

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:15.420
But I had to say that
because I really feel

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:20.120
so much influence directly and
some indirectly by all of these men

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.760
up here in some way and so
I'm very happy to be here.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.510
And I'm also proud to be one of
the few women up here as well,

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:29.510
the only woman up here, but right.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:37.060
[ Applause ]

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.750
But so you know there are many
others and when I'm thinking

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:44.600
about voice, I think there are two
things I'd like to say about that

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.180
and one of the things
is first of all you need

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.980
to see an example, right.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:54.170
To find your voice for me, was
seeing somebody else express

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:57.330
like the beautiful words that
our Poet Laureate said today,

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.170
where you hear yourself as you were
saying earlier, they put a mirror

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:03.440
to your face and show you just
how beautiful your culture is

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.150
and how it's not bad to
mix English and Spanish

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:08.940
and to even create new
language like Spanglish, right.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:13.160
And to say it such a way that
makes you so, fills you with pride

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:18.980
where you fluff up like a happy
chicken, you know, because you're

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.400
so excited to be there
and most of all,

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.440
as you mentioned Campbell
Hall, I too went to UCLA.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.750
I have an undergraduate
degree at the Music College

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:31.210
and I know even though
this wonderful man walked,

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:34.360
graced the hallways
of this place, I'm,

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.920
unfortunately there
are elements at UCLA

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.830
that haven't necessarily
changed that much,

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:43.930
but I imagine it was even
more desolate back in the day.

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:48.610
But in my time, you could run
into great scholars and of course,

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:54.580
but to know that Juan Filipe
Herrera has been there and to know

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:59.320
that he's influenced our, the
trajectory and body of work

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:04.870
that we have as poets is,
is extremely impactful.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:13.680
Now so for me, has been to see
witness and readings such as these,

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.320
such as [foreign names
spoken], Cherrie Moraga,

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.870
so many poets that
reflected my experience.

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:21.900
So with the first thing
it's an example.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:26.810
The second thing I think for me has
been the opportunity to have a mic

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:30.000
in your face and to be able
to say something yourself,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.860
once you're like somebody
puts a mic in your face

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.270
and they say, "Okay, go ahead.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:34.570
Say what you're thinking.

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.060
Say what you want to;
what are you thinking?

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.360
What do you want to contribute?

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.660
What do you want to say?"

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.970
And at some point,
you take it seriously

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.640
and you're given the opportunity
and then you're like "Wow,

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.290 position:56%
nobody's ever asked me what I think?

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.630
What I envision for the future?

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:49.930
What I can imagine?

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.420
What I stand to create?

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.360
Right, what I stand to contribute?"

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.170
And that's another defeat.

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.200
So, first is was the example of
seeing these [foreign word spoken]

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.820
and other wonderful
poets express themselves,

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.440
but then for me it was
also having the opportunity

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.970 position:56%
and I think my band Quetzal and
when I met my partner Quetzal Flores

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:11.540
where he said, "We would
do covers" and then he said

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.840
"Why don't you write something?"

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.140
And I said, "What?

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.440
Tell me what to sing."

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.740
And he goes "I'm not going
to tell you what to sing.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.040
You're the singer.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.340
Sing, sing something."

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.640
I was like "Damn, what
am I going to say?"

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.520
So the next thing you know I
had to write and when I had

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.620
to write I really started
paying attention to wordsmithing

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:27.950
and how things were
being put together

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:32.720
and that became really
exciting, and so the example

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.400
and then the opportunity.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.510
&gt;&gt; Rafael Perez-Torres:
Okay, thank you.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:44.110
[ Applause ]

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.070
Next I'd like to introduce
Hugo Morales

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:49.520
who is the Executive
Director of Radio Bilingue,

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.480
the national Latino
public radio network.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.100
Hugo is a Mixteco Indian
from Oaxaca, Mexico.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:00.690
My family's home state, we have
quite a bit in common there.

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.640
He immigrated to the U.S. at
the age of 9 with his family

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.960
to Sonoma County and he
joined his father working

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.940
in the California farm
fields at the age of 9.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.750
He attended public
school in rural California

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:15.740
and eventually attended Harvard
College and Harvard Law School.

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:18.490
And even during those years he
continued to work in the fields

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:20.930
with his family during his summers.

00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:26.140
Hugo cofounded Radio Bilingue
in Fresno, California in 1976.

00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:28.530 position:56%
With other farm workers and artists,

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:33.600
Radio Bilingue now has 12 full
power FM radio stations serving the

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.300
Southwest and the U.S.
Mexican border

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.870
and has 60 radio station affiliates
in the United States and Mexico.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:43.270
In 1994, Hugo received a
MacArthur Foundation Fellowship

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:45.960
which you may know of by its
alternate name which is the

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.260
"Genius" Fellowship

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:51.600
and he subsequently received
a CPB Edward R. Murrow Award

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.440
and a Cultural Freedom Award
from the Lannan Foundation.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.800
Hugo is married to Amy
Kitchener a member of the board

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.030
of American Folklife
Center in Washington,

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:03.660 position:56%
D. C. and they have twin boys age 8.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.390
They make their home
in Fresno, California.

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:08.420
But tonight he is here
with us in Washington,

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:12.510
D. C. and it's my great pleasure
to introduce Hugo Morales.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:21.270
[ Applause ]

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:22.570
&gt;&gt; Hugo Morales: Gracias Rafael.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:23.870
Gracias [foreign language spoken].

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:25.170
Thank you very, very much
[foreign language spoken] Rafael.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:27.100
So, He a, Rafael asked me
to talk about, you know,

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:30.200
what made me raise my
voice or speak out.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:34.320
You know, I'm an Indian,
Mixteco from Oaxaca.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:41.600
In ourltura, in our culture
traditional Indian culture we,

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:48.510
as children we're not supposed
to challenge or talk back

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:53.390
or ask questions of
adults or question adults.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:56.000 position:56%
So as a child it was very difficult.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.900
Obviously, because we couldn't
ask anything of the adults.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:09.860
Even in school it was a
one-way experience in the sense

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.520
of the teachers essentially
lecture or give the lesson.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.430
&gt;&gt; Louie Perez: I think
that your mic is a little.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:20.000
&gt;&gt; Martha Gonzalez: We want to
make sure your mic is working.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.060
&gt;&gt; Louie Perez: There we go.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.360
&gt;&gt; Hugo Morales: Okay, yeah?

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.660
Okay much better [applause].

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:30.960
So, anyway which I'll
talk about a little later

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.160
about technology and
raising your voice.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:39.300
So, anyway so I, it was very
interesting because you know

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.470
as a child like any child you
have a lot of question, right?

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.210
Like what's the world
about among other things.

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:48.190
But I could not ask that of
my elders and I was raised

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:50.700
by a single mom because
my father Rafael was

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:54.080
in the United States
you know working.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:01.360
So, anyway so what happened is a
child I was actually very timid

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.010
and a momma's boy.

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:08.450
I was always with my
mother and being protective.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:12.990
So, but then my father legalized
[foreign word spoken] in 57

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:16.520
and then the next year he
brought the whole family.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.650
I have an older brother
who is 4 years my senior

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:22.080
and then I have a younger
sister, a year younger.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.760
So we joined him in Healdsburg,

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.900
California which is
in Sonoma County.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:30.240
And so it was very
interesting because there's

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.520
where I got introduced
to multiculturalism.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:38.840
I was able, I did pick fruits and
other crops with poor Black kids,

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:44.340
poor White kids, Filipinos
[inaudible] and so on,

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:48.500
and so all this kind of came
together you know at the age of 9.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:52.930
And so, and we lived in a
you know, I think if looked

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:56.880
around in different fields,
we lived one labor camp

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.880 position:56%
which we stayed there in Healdsburg.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.350
So it was very interesting for us.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:03.130
It was very exciting
to see migrant workers

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:05.420
like Filipe's family to come by.

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:08.530
We were always wondering like
you know meeting new kids

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:10.040
in the summers.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:17.480 position:56%
So, anyway so it was around I think
19; when I was like 12-13 years old,

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.070
I was, I really realized
I had to speak out,

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.480
of course I was brought here

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.300
to the United States I didn't
have any bilingual education

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.800
or a second language
or anything like that;

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.550
I picked up English on my own.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:34.510
So by the age of 12, I
developed tuberculosis so I was

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:39.420
in a sanitarium for a
whole year in isolation.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:45.630
So, with no bath, no bathroom,
no radio, no TV except books.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:48.540
So that was the gift that
I was given in that time.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:54.000
And so I began to read about
what some of the people thought

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
that were not farm workers
thought about poor people

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.730
about maybe they deserve
to be poor, right?

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:02.750
They didn't take advantage
of opportunities.

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:05.560
And so that's when; and
other things they thought,

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.230
negative things they
thought about us poor people.

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:12.740 position:56%
We were dirty, we weren't deserving,
etcetera and also we deserved

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.890
to be poor because we
didn't have the initiative

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:16.730
or the energy or the intelligence.

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:18.030
So that's when I decided
to speak out.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:21.830 position:56%
And so after that, this was in 1962,

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:24.100
this is way before the
Farmworker Movement.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:28.080
After I got out of course the
Farmworker Movement began and so

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.140
after that I began like out
of high school wear my U

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:35.130
of W pin whenever I could, you know
in high school and then I ended

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:38.260
up at Harvard College and Harvard
Law School and then when I got

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:44.670
to Harvard, I started a radio
show, WHRB and that had a;

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:49.220
the radio station which is
student run, had a restriction

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.490
that only Harvard College
graduates could operate it,

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:53.900
but yet there were no Puerto
Rican students enrolled

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:57.080
at Harvard College at the time.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.660
So what I did is I called, I
did a callout to the community

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:03.280
from the radio station which
is the entire Boston area

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.280
and that's how I got Woody
[inaudible] to participate

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.540
on the radio and I just, so I
gave the voice in a way, you know,

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:14.980
to the Puerto Rican community
in Boston back in 1970 to 75.

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.230
And then also to other
Lainos, so in fact I ended

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:22.510
up being the engineer shall we say,
the sound engineer of all things

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:27.900
and so on, and then I got
the idea of Radio Bilingue

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:31.240 position:56%
because I could see my brother
establish the first radio show north

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:36.710
of San Francisco on Sundays on a
commercial station in Santa Rosa,

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:41.980
and I saw all the farm workers
listening in Sonoma, Napa County

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.780
and that's where I learned
the power of radio and so now

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:48.970 position:56%
on Bilingue we get to listen to Juan
Filipe Herrera, invite the audience

the world and hear the other voices

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.620
of workers and people
throughout the world.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:00.900
So, anyway that's what
made me speak out.

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.700

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:13.040

You may not know, however,

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.560
that that Louie is the
group's primary lyricist

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:45.500
and he is a keen observer
of the human condition.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:48.240
If you know his work

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:57.260 position:56%
in 1983 and up through their most
recent album "Gate of Gold" in 2015.

The Queen of Make-Believe"
and this play premiered

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:25.300
at the Bootleg Theater

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.340
His songs, his many
songs, have been covered

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:33.020
by extraordinary artists including,
Waylon Jennings, Jerry Garcia,

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.630

His pros has been published in
many places and he has served

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:43.010

for Best Box Recording Package.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:59.620
As a visual artist, Perez has

since 1975 in many prominent
galleries and museums

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.420

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.490
He is currently working on a career

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:13.790
and we're going to work
together to get that finished,

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:17.650

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:24.510
to introduce Louie Perez.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:33.440
[ Applause ]

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.740
&gt;&gt; Louie Perez: And you forgot

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:40.350
to mention I'm also Hugo's sound
technician [brief laughter].

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:43.590
Yeah, it's really an honor
to be here to celebrate

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:46.280
with Juan Felipe Herrera.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:51.220
We were talking a bit
in the Greenroom

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:57.280
about when we first met back
in the early 70s in Balboa Park

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:02.710
at [inaudible] Island, San
Diego way back when our hair was

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:05.930
about a foot longer
and a lot darker.

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:12.510
And it's great to,
it's great to be here.

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:16.270
The thing started, this crazy
thing called art started

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:21.550
with me a longtime ago when I
was a kid growing up in East L.A.

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:28.220
And actually, you know, it was kind
of like a process of elimination.

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:34.980
I was a terrible dancer and I, you
know, couldn't swim to save my life

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:38.180
and I was even a worse baseball
player, so I became a musician.

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:46.000 position:56%
As an inspiration, I think you know,
I was listening to Mexican music

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.990
that my mother played at home.

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:53.410
She sang at home and
inspired me in many ways.

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:56.410
Of course I listened to radio.

00:44:56.410 --> 00:45:01.100 position:56%
Mexican music when I was very little
and by the time I got old enough

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:05.680
to be able to reach the knob on
the radio, I discovered choice.

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:10.510
And that's when Jimmy Hendrix,
James Brown and everybody

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:13.040
in between came into my life.

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.350
My mother bought me a guitar
when I was about 12 years old

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:17.750
in her own sort of
youth diversion program.

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:21.680
I think it was probably partly
to keep me off the street

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.980
because she loved music too.

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:26.580
That was an inspiration.

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.520
She also inspired me by
the things that she did.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:35.960
I was also, you know,
grew up without a father.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.620 position:56%
He died when I was about 8 years old

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:43.510
and thank goodness for
strong women, right?

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:54.060
[ Applause ]

00:45:54.060 --> 00:46:01.590
She taught me by her example
of, by feeding homeless people

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:04.580
on my front porch, you know.

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.820
One day when I came
up the walk, she was,

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:11.000
there was homeless person
drinking out of my Kool Aid mug

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:18.180
that I had sent for in the mail,
and I was kind of appalled by that.

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.750
And then I realized that mother
was actually teaching me something.

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:25.510
She was teaching me that in this
life we really don't own anything

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:27.900
and if we do we have to
share it with others.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:32.500
So, musically you know,
I listened to everything

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:40.680
that I could get my hands on and
Los Lobos was formed in 1973;

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:47.850
four kids growing up in East L.A.
And we put away electric guitars

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:51.810
because we were all in rock
bands and we formed this band

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:56.470
to play traditional Mexican music
which was unheard of at the time.

00:46:56.470 --> 00:47:00.670
You know, we were typical
early 70s kids with long hair

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:04.540
and flannel shirts and beat up
chains playing Mexican music

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:07.490
so it was kind of unheard
of at the time.

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:13.360
But, at the same time
running as a parallel,

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:19.850
was the Chicano El Movimiento
and we lent our musical services

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:25.550 position:56%
to see the travelers and the United
Farmworkers and just about anything,

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:27.530
any Chicano cause that
was, you know,

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:31.680
happening at the moment
which there were many.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:37.830
We found a regular gig and playing
[inaudible] all over California

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:41.930
at all the state colleges
and universities.

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:44.720
My work has always been inspired

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:50.670
by my early life growing
up in East Los Angeles.

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:58.380
It's a wellspring of beauty
and pain and sorrow and joy,

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.850
it's a [foreign word
spoken] this thing

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:09.840
that all Chicanos have become
a quite acquainted with,

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:16.150
and so I draw from that
from all of my work.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:22.010
It's a bottomless amount of and
bountiful amount of experience

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:27.430
that I can draw from and I can't
say enough about where we come from

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:31.350
and it's something that I'll
never forget and still carries,

00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:35.500
I carry with me close
to my heart to this day.

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.300
&gt;&gt; Rafael Perez-Torres: Yeah.

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:45.480
[ Applause ]

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.780
So, I think our speakers
have each noted they're,

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:55.300
the way in which they're connection
to locale, to region, to place

00:48:55.300 --> 00:49:00.980
and then the influence of others
who came before that the importance

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:06.010
of parents, the importance of role
models, the importance of figures

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:10.690
who we can, whose model
we can draw upon.

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:13.740
Whose images and whose lessons
we can draw upon in order

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:17.710
to move things forward, in order to
transform and move things forward

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:23.840
and earlier Juan Filipe in his
poetry had stated this afternoon

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:28.780 position:56%
in the previous event, are ancestors
give us their voice, right?

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:32.520
Our ancestors give us
their voice to speak again.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.060
That's a beautiful
sentiment and I think

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:39.360
that that encapsulates the sense
of tradition and the commitment

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:44.570
to tradition that is a part of
Latino culture, Latino heritage and

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:49.250
but part of what gives
Latino communities a sense

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:51.020
of strength and a sense of purpose.

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:52.500
But I'd like to ask each

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:58.770
of our panel members what tradition
signifies, what it means to them?

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:03.050
What is tradition as far
as being a wellspring,

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:05.490
but also perhaps being
a source of concern?

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:10.350
Are there traditions that
perhaps are best left behind?

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:15.330
What, how do we, what is the
significance of tradition

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:20.790
as we move forward and tradition as
that which connects us to the past

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:24.380
and allows us to move
into the future?

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:27.260
How do you see tradition
as working or tradition

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:32.500
as working in the; please Hugo.

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.800
&gt;&gt; Hugo Morales: Well for me,

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.100
for me as Mixteco I think
there's some traditions

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:36.890
that are best left behind.

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:43.510
I think the violence against women
for example should be stopped.

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:48.210
[ Applause ]

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:51.790
Alcoholism I think should
be stopped among my people.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:57.840
There's just too much, too much
alcohol consumption among Indians.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:02.910
And to me, it appears to be
it's like a conspiracy by the,

00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:08.220
I don't know by whom, definitely
corporations to keep us drunk

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:11.350
and not work for our own
well-being and our families.

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:13.660
It's just such a terrible
thing to see drugs

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:18.740
and violence among our Mixteco
native peoples and it is, you know,

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:25.210 position:56%
there's a lot bright talented folks
and so I'd like to see that go away,

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:29.060
but what I do want to say
is there's incredible amount

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:33.920
of treasures among our Mixteco
people like in the arts.

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:40.940
You know, pottery for example or
mask making, dance of the diabolos

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:49.170
that celebrates our spirit as
Indios and our spirit in our hearts

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:53.900
and we dance to the beauty
of our people and the beauty

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:57.170
of the future and our souls.

00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:01.010
That, you know, that's
it and our music

00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:07.740
to me just really hits our heart,
because it's not sophisticated but

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:11.880
yet it really hits our
heart whether it be strings

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.230
or whether it be wind bands.

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:14.760
It's just so beautiful.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.060
It really brings the sense

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:19.060
of community together
and it's so beautiful.

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:24.820 position:56%
And also, our sense of organization;
a lot of people at least

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:27.860
in California who know are familiar
with the Mixteco communities,

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:31.590
is these folks are the most
organized people among the Latinos

00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:36.210
and in some communities we
are, and it's because you know

00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:39.200
in our own homeland we're
not united, but we come here

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:44.450
and we're discriminated against,
you know, we're not in a place.

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:47.240 position:56%
Let me just give you one example,
in Madera County which is just north

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.720
of Fresno County, is the highest
population of Mixtecos outside

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:58.030
of Mexico and there, you know, all
of us Mixtecos are farmworkers,

00:52:58.030 --> 00:53:01.170
there in Madera County
right above Fresno County,

00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:04.760
and where do we get our
greens right, our good stuff?

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:08.880
It's from the [foreign
word spoken] you know,

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.470
it's from the [foreign
word spoken] you know,

00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:13.370
it's on Sundays I guess
the only day we don't work.

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:15.000
So what does the mainstream do?

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.740
Is in the fairgrounds they
charge people one dollar to come;

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:21.260
every head is one dollar.

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:25.990
I mean, I don't see people go on
a, you know, I don't know the giant

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:27.420
or whatever, whatever it called.

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:31.720
You know, any kind of grocery
store and having to pay to get it.

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:35.580
You know, but that's the kind of
exploitation you know that we face.

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:39.520
So, I see that there's a
lot we need to preserve

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.400
as Indios and also our identity.

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:45.930
I think that's one of the things
that my father really instilled

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:47.720
on me, on us as a family.

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:49.450
So we should be proud to be Indios.

00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:50.860
We all have a rich history.

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:56.730
We have a rich traditions and
there's a lot for us to contribute

00:53:56.730 --> 00:54:00.630
to this community to make America
even better than what it is.

00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:02.760
So, anyway that's what I see.

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:04.060
&gt;&gt; Rafael Perez-Torres: Excellent.

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:05.360
&gt;&gt; Martha Gonzalez: With
these changes that you talk

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.790
about I think are really
important because if that's the;

00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:11.730
I believe that tradition
is a social construction.

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:15.130
So when the people want to change
something that is not beneficial

00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:21.070
to say like women like what you
brought up, then we have the power

00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:23.020
to do that, the [foreign
language spoke].

00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:27.170 position:56%
You know, they have that capacity to
change it to talk and to you know.

00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:29.860
But I think it's really,
there's always a balance

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:31.370
in also in traditions, right?

00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:35.520
Where you know for example,
my dad believed very strongly

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:40.460
in doing certain things and then
the circumstances, you know,

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:44.550
he left when I was 11; I also grew
up in Boyle Heights East L.A.,

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:48.190
and when he left; before he
left he didn't allow English

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:50.230
in the house whatsoever, you know.

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:52.570
That was a tradition of the
home, right, no English.

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:56.500
Nothing he couldn't understand
and then when he left, you know,

00:54:56.500 --> 00:55:00.460
music and English, you
know, the rock and roll,

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:03.730
all of this other stuff, R and
B started coming into the house,

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:06.530
you know, and so with the
circumstances where the man was

00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:10.020 position:56%
out of house and so my mom was like,
"Yeah, sure go ahead and listen

00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:12.170
to whatever you want" you know.

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:15.460
And so we were like "Yeah!"

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:19.210
But, that's in, in the
context of our you know home

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:21.520
that was very prominent right?

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:25.450 position:56%
But, so when I think about tradition
in general whether in cultures,

00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:29.440
deep traditional cultures and
others I think that there's always,

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:33.330
it's always good to have;
when I think about my dad,

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:35.550
I think it's great that he
didn't allow English in the house

00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:38.350
because I was able to learn the
language to a certain extent

00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:41.210
in a way that was really
important to me later, right,

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:43.620
in terms of expression
and all of these things,

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:46.880
but in terms of allowing new
sounds really opened my eyes

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.180
to other things as well.

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:51.620
So to have the balance of
people in every tradition,

00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:54.290
the diehards that like
just want to keep it;

00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:57.280
they believe that tradition is
nonstatic, that you just need

00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.240
to keep certain traditions certain
ways and then to have other people

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.290
that are really, they
say like "You know what,

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:03.590
tradition needs to change.

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:04.890
Tradition is fluid.

00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:06.610
Tradition is ever changing."

00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:08.310
I think I believe in
both of those things.

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:11.960
We need those two like,
you know, yes/no.

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:16.940
You know, we need that balance
and some of the things we need

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:21.260
to really change, but I think
there's every person plays a role.

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:22.560
I don't know.

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.290
What do you think?

00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:26.490
&gt;&gt; Juan Filipe Herrera:
You know, those are a,

00:56:26.490 --> 00:56:31.530
you know it's such an interesting
thing about tradition isn't it?

00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:34.620
You know, everyone is
a vibrant human being

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:37.350
and every group has a vibrant life,

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:42.040
and every culture is a
vibrant living of beautiful;

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:46.610
has a beautiful system
between all those things.

00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:50.130
And what happens is that when
you put power into the picture,

00:56:50.130 --> 00:56:54.560
if you put a drop of power
or a gallon of power,

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:58.800
then one group becomes traditional
and the other group becomes modern.

00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:05.490
And then we have the use of,
what's seen as traditional

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:11.570
which is actually a vital
human group, way of life taken

00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:18.300
and used commercially
and that group somehow

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:21.960
through various processes is
kind of kept at the margins.

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:26.970
So that's when we run
into problems, you know,

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:31.540
where we have [foreign word
spoken] Indian women's weaving

00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:39.820
and I'll just call them blouses for
the moment or apparel with weaving

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:45.350
and patterns used commercially
when in fact, if you really step

00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:49.580
into the culture and you
really look it's kind of,

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:57.940 position:56%
just kind of marketed really without
any deep notions of it and used

00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:06.040
in fashion malls and it's a, and
cartoons and it's in a number

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:10.980 position:56%
of corporate displays and platforms.

00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:15.400
And the group where the material
comes from is kept at bay;

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.460
it's kept on the side
and on the outside.

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:21.080
And when in fact, if you look
at those patterns and they say

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:25.970
"Mayan" territory, perhaps in most
our cultural weaving traditions,

00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:27.270
those symbols, and colors,

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:32.220
and patterns have many deep
stories connected to them.

00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:37.030 position:56%
And they're kind of like stories of
the creation stories of the universe

00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:41.680
and the story of a village, and
the story of tejedor the weaver.

00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:45.540
So that's when it gets
critical when I look into it,

00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:49.820
when I think about it is
that one group has tradition

00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:53.900
and the other group doesn't and
then the other group uses those

00:58:53.900 --> 00:59:00.020
"traditions" to kind of display
itself as a cultural democratic

00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:05.510
or plural group and yet the
resources are not really going

00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:10.680
to those whose "traditions"
are rooted in.

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:16.290
So, that's what gets me because
everyone has traditions and

00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:21.650
yet somehow various groups
or at time, you know,

00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:23.370
we say well we don't
have any more traditions.

00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:26.140
You know, we're kind of modern
now and you know we're kind

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:29.040
of just being ourselves
and being human beings,

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:33.300
worrying of materials
and items and pixels.

00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:37.970
And the other group is,
you know, chewing corn

00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:41.710
and you know burning a [foreign
word spoken] and we have

00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:44.590
to respect the [foreign word
spoken] and the burning,

00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:48.030
but when you don't really
know anything about it

00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:50.740
and you're separating everyone.

00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:57.140
So for me it's most important
to create unity and to have kind

00:59:57.140 --> 01:00:04.840 position:56%
of a deeper connection with everyone
and to open the flow of resources

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:08.440
and let deep knowledge flow
from all peoples, in particular,

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.300
those that we think have
traditions which they do,

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:14.210
but not in a plastic
corporate manner

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:19.350 position:56%
and a vibrant human evolving manner,

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:22.050
which to this very
day all groups have.

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:26.160
We just have kept each other apart
and we have pushed either one way

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:32.150
or another our beautiful groups,
indigenous groups to the outside

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:35.320
and feel that we are on the inside.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:39.210
But in fact, we are on the outside.

01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:42.550
&gt;&gt; Rafael Perez-Torres: That's
very, and the notion of tradition

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:46.590
as transforming the future rather
than being separate from the future

01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:48.450
or tradition as opposed
to the modern.

01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:54.230
I think that Juan Filipe and
everybody and that Latino culture

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:57.560
in general is seeking to
explore and understand.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:01.520
And as part of this we're,
our program's running down,

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:05.410
but I'd like Juan Filipe
if he could to read a poem

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:11.740
which actually written by students
as first and then written as part

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:16.760
of Juan Filipe's World's
Longest Poem Project which is one

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:22.560 position:56%
of the Poet Laureate Projects that's
been going on, and if Juan Filipe

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.740
as in order to close us out
this evening and in order

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:28.110
to share both your
words and the words

01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:32.070
of others bringing different voices
and multiple voices together,

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:33.370
if you would please
share that with us.

01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:34.720
&gt;&gt; Juan Filipe Herrera: This
is so beautiful, you know,

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:39.720
I think everyone here that's
here right now, just by hanging

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.220
out and saying hello again.

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:45.280
We've all talked in one or another
of sharing our work already.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.990
We've all said, "Hey why
don't we do this together

01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:48.290
and what are you playing?

01:01:48.290 --> 01:01:50.120
Well that base guitar
and what about you?

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.170
Well, I've just got
this guitar recently.

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:55.080
I had a [inaudible] and you
know, remember the radio?

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.380
Yeah, we used to do
[foreign word spoken].

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:59.080
Why don't we just back
into it Martha?

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.740
You know, hey let's
write a song together."

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:05.470 position:56%
So you see, you see, so you see
that's how to do it don't you think?

01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:06.770
&gt;&gt; Martha Gonzalez: Yeah.

01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:08.070
&gt;&gt; Juan Filipe Herrera: That's
how we all can do it, right.

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:09.650
That's how we can do it.

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:14.360
Yeah. It's a, you know, art
and creativity are open doors;

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:18.990
art and creativity those are
open doors like the singers.

01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:23.580
They are a collective prism of
open doors and we get inspired.

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:24.880
We want to sing too.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.180
We want to stand up there with you.

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:27.480
We want to clap.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.990
That's the idea and that's
what this is all about.

01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:35.770
So, what happened is I went to
Wyoming to Jackson Hole, Wyoming

01:02:35.770 --> 01:02:39.230
and there's a beautiful
migrant community there

01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:42.770
and the Teton Library there's
a lot of beautiful work

01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:45.960
with the migrant students
and in the high schools

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.010
and the junior high schools,
Jackson Hole Middle School

01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:50.740
and Jackson Hole High School.

01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:56.820
So I went into the middle school
and to the 8th grade class and all

01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:00.440
of us said, "Well you
know how are you?"

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:07.480 position:56%
And then a student said, "Well, Juan
Filipe, we saw that you had a poem."

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.730
"Oh very good, very good."

01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:13.650
"And we noticed that
you wrote a poem called

01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:16.370
"Every Day We Get More Illegal."

01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:17.670
I go, "Oh really?

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:18.970
Is that poem you're talking about?"

01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:20.270
"Well, okay.

01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:26.270
Uh-huh." "Well, you know, it's
typically a good poem Juan,

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:29.510
but you know we kind
of rewrote it for you."

01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:35.040
[ Laughter ]

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:41.110
"Ah, okay I think I'm
going to sit down now.

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:42.990
You go right ahead."

01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:44.440
And that's what they did.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:48.040
You know, they, this is
it and I'm telling you,

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.920
it is a much better piece.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:59.670
It is, and the name of the poem is
"Every Day We Get More Illegal."

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:06.900
Left for America on planes,
buses, vans they said, I remember.

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:11.410
Under the silver darkness it
is all in between the light.

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:15.550
I imagine going through a tunnel to
a better life, to a better future,

01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:19.260
yet, we stay broken slash.

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:23.340
"I haven't seen my parents
in 9 years" my mom said.

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:29.730
My grandma, my uncle, my
entire family left in Mexico.

01:04:29.730 --> 01:04:33.670

struggle that we saw in Mexico

after seeing a child being a fire
breather on the streets for change

part of some prestigious circus,

a living for he and his family

saddest things I've ever seen
