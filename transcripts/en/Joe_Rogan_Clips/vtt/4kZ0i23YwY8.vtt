00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
The general going experience,

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.740
but do you ever feel that it's almost like you're absorbing too much because you

3
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:10.470
are looking at all the problems of all the people,

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.530
seven plus billion around the world and all these different horrific injustices?

5
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.570
<v 1>I try to focus on what I can do and what I can do is,</v>

6
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.600
is challenge my own government. And you know,

7
00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:25.510
as an American citizen living in this society,

8
00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:30.250
I think that the U S empire and the Pentagon is the source of a lot of problems

9
00:00:30.251 --> 00:00:33.670
around the world. I look at the world as complex.

10
00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:35.950
I mean you have to understand the issues that are going on,

11
00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:40.810
especially with foreign policy in terms of the colonized and colonizers,

12
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.920
the oppressed and oppressors and the U S his role as well as other previous

13
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.590
Empire's role in shaping the world as it is today.

14
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.030
And a lot of the problems that have arisen are because directly us foreign

15
00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:54.610
policy, whether it be the global war on terrorism,

16
00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:57.040
whether it be terrorism in general, I mean that, you know,

17
00:00:57.041 --> 00:01:00.970
drone strikes basically cause terrorism, whether it be the environmental crises,

18
00:01:00.971 --> 00:01:03.220
the Pentagon is actually the largest polluter in the world,

19
00:01:03.221 --> 00:01:07.390
more than 140 countries. That's essentially every country in the world almost,

20
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.280
um, a bigger polluter than the top four chemical companies combined.

21
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.850
So it all kind of stems back from this notion that, you know,

22
00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:19.570
the U S is the world's largest empire that's ever existed and it needs to be

23
00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:24.370
stopped to save humanity. And so as an American citizen,

24
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:28.870
I look at all of the problems and I understand that there is like a very common

25
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.630
route and I can do something about this common route.

26
00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:34.570
And if you're looking at domestic problems, the lack of healthcare,

27
00:01:34.571 --> 00:01:38.980
the lack of education, I mean, Martin Luther King called it decades ago.

28
00:01:38.981 --> 00:01:40.090
He says, you know, a,

29
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.220
a nation that spends more and more on military spending is facing social death.

30
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.150
I probably butchered his quote, but that's essentially the spiritual death.

31
00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:50.590
I think he's what he said. But I mean,

32
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.710
that's exactly what's happening is when we're squandering all of our money,

33
00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:55.810
bolstering up this huge global empire,

34
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.440
we're not taking care of our people at home, our brothers and sisters at home.

35
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.360
My empathy extends as an internationalist all around the world. I, I, you know,

36
00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:08.200
I feel for my brothers and sisters in Palestine, Yemen, everywhere.

37
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.240
But I can only do what I can do based on what my government is doing.

38
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.860
And, and you know, it's doing a lot.

39
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.270
It's doing a lot of horrible things and it's time for us to really acknowledge

40
00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:23.800
what those horrible things are because we need to reinvigorate an antiwar

41
00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:24.850
movement in this country.

42
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.050
<v 0>And when you're saying that drone strikes create terrorism,</v>

43
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.200
what you're really saying is that, well, what people,

44
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.290
if they don't understand drone strikes primarily kill civilians,

45
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.400
right? Well, it's a,

46
00:02:39.401 --> 00:02:43.330
it's a really crazy number and it's this very strange,

47
00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:48.331
sanitized way of handling an issue where if you had a person and you had some

48
00:02:49.871 --> 00:02:52.510
Rambo character, you send him overseas, you said, Hey,

49
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.710
I want you to go get this ISIS terrorist. And uh, in the process,

50
00:02:56.711 --> 00:03:00.040
kill everybody. The fuck that you see everybody that's in front of them,

51
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:03.850
that person would be a war criminal. All right? If you had a guy,

52
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.880
and he knew that some ISIS guy was in a, an apartment building,

53
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.240
so he just started gunning down men,

54
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:13.510
women and children in that apartment building until he got to the terrorist,

55
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.040
that guy would go to jail.

56
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.480
But if you do it with a remote control and you launch hellfire missiles out of a

57
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:22.510
drone and it blows up the apartment building and kills all these innocent

58
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:27.100
people, but also gets the terrorist, it's mission accomplished. And it's crazy.

59
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.360
It's crazy that we're signing off on that, right? And what gives us the right,

60
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.190
it's to kill people. It's, it's a thing because we're not there.

61
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.550
Where there's this weird sort of a, just a,

62
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.210
there's a a bridge that we're allowed to cross into this really sickening act.

63
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.960
It's a very,

64
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.960
when you have anything that's ineffective to the point where most of the people,

65
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:55.870
it kills our good people, or at least are innocent people we should say.

66
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.890
That's crazy. I mean this is not saying that there's not terrorism.

67
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.280
It's not saying there's not horrible people in Iceland is absolutely right.

68
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.650
You look, I'm a pro military person.

69
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:10.120
I think we need military and I think just like the same I need, we need cops,

70
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.920
but to deny that cops sometimes are bad is fucking crazy.

71
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.240
To not deny that.

72
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:21.241
Sometimes when you allow the military industrial complex to do things like have

73
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:25.660
drones that launch missiles into wedding parties because you think one of the

74
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:28.660
people might be a terrorist and are often incorrect,

75
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.400
often to the tune of 90 plus percent. Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah, and you look at,

76
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:35.110
you know, the last 10 years,

77
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:38.830
you look at some of these terrorists who have conducted terrorist acts.

78
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:42.070
You look at actually what their intention was and a lot of them,

79
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:46.750
the vast majority literally cite us foreign policy, revenge, us foreign policy.

80
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.280
I mean, every time you kill 98% innocent people,

81
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.320
whoever survives,

82
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.220
if you lost your whole family and that you have an incredible amount of

83
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:01.690
motivation to get back at whoever did it right and that whoever did it is the

84
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:05.590
United States. We need to stop normalizing this. And um, you know,

85
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.250
militarily speaking, Trump actually, you know, it's not just Trump.

86
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:12.250
I mean this is a bipartisan effort throughout the entire Congress.

87
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.320
If there's one thing Congress can agree upon,

88
00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:19.321
it's to make nonviolent BDS efforts against Israel legal and also to just keep

89
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:24.760
ramping up the military and ageing on whoever's sitting in the oval office to be

90
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:28.750
more militaristic. And that's exactly what's happened with Trump. Um,

91
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.080
in a bizarre way. I mean, Congress approved like a seven, uh,

92
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:37.081
near trillion dollar defense budget and the increase alone in the last year was

93
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:40.960
basically Russia's entire military budget more than Russia's entire military

94
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:43.780
budget. That's how much this shit's ramping up.

95
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.450
And then you have the space force. I mean, it's just like,

96
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.230
how far is this going to go? The society is collapsing.

97
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.240
If you looked at the argument against this, you would say,

98
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.910
we need this in order to keep people safe here.

99
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.340
That would be the argument against it. My question would be, what are we,

100
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.010
what threat is there ISIS?

101
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.450
<v 1>When has ISIS ever done anything here other than, I mean,</v>

102
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:14.300
there was like a truck. I mean, come on.

103
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.100
We already know the statistics on terrorism in this country and they're very

104
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:20.420
low, right? I mean you're,

105
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:23.690
you're basically more likely to die from like furniture falling on you or shore

106
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:27.950
apartment. Yeah. Yeah, and the whole ISIS thing. I mean, as we know,

107
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:32.000
ISIS have Rose out of us foreign policy, the failed state and Libya,

108
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:35.510
the Iraq war, that's still criminally ongoing. I mean,

109
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:38.960
Trump announced this indefinite extension of the criminal occupation of Iraq.

110
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.570
It's just crazy how normalize this is. You know,

111
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.110
far longer than Vietnam were in Afghanistan.

112
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:46.640
Fatalities that aren't all time high.

113
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.360
All of these things are a direct result of us foreign policy and look at the

114
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:54.230
refugee crisis. Look at immigration. The Honduras, CU,

115
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.860
all of this shit's connected and that's what we need to start like expanding our

116
00:06:57.861 --> 00:07:01.760
consciousness and our empathy worldwide to understand all of these things are

117
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:06.710
linked and the struggle is all linked and our world is shrinking really rapidly.

118
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.460
<v 0>What candidate speaks in this way?</v>

119
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.690
Like what candidate do you think understands and recognizes all these things

120
00:07:15.691 --> 00:07:16.524
that you're talking about?

121
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.940
<v 1>I mean, Mike Ravel is the only one who's like, we need to end the U S empire.</v>

122
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.630
Bernie and Tulsi Mike Ravel was a,

123
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.510
he was the guy who basically read the Pentagon papers and directed he, he's,

124
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:31.410
he's a good guy. He is. Yeah.

125
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.600
He has like this online campaign that's really awesome,

126
00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:37.890
but I mean Tulsi is speaking a lot about regime change Wars,

127
00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:41.220
which is extremely important, but she still believes in drone strikes.

128
00:07:41.221 --> 00:07:45.720
She basically has a little bit of Obama's foreign policy that I don't agree with

129
00:07:45.721 --> 00:07:47.310
that fundamental understanding.

130
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.090
<v 0>Did drone strikes like maybe if there's an ISIS camp somewhere. I mean,</v>

131
00:07:51.091 --> 00:07:56.091
I can't believe that she believes in some sort of a just broad brush use of it.

132
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.530
<v 1>I haven't looked into the nuances of that, but I do think that, um,</v>

133
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.910
no one is saying what I want them to about us empire, about, you know,

134
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:11.400
scaling back the U S empire and stopping all of this civil society movements

135
00:08:11.401 --> 00:08:15.480
because it's not just about invasions anymore. It's about, you know,

136
00:08:15.481 --> 00:08:18.660
you surpassing the democratic processes of all of these countries like what

137
00:08:18.661 --> 00:08:19.740
we've done in Venezuela,

138
00:08:19.741 --> 00:08:23.970
what we're doing all around the world to try to foment unrest. Um,

139
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.380
all of this needs to be stopped.

140
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:30.410
<v 0>Do you foresee a time where our dependence on foreign oil is radically reduced</v>

141
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:35.370
to the point where it doesn't justify these regime change Wars and our

142
00:08:35.371 --> 00:08:39.900
dependence on these resources that these people have? I mean,

143
00:08:39.901 --> 00:08:42.570
this is almost every conflict in the world.

144
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.240
You can boil down to the acquisition of resource,

145
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.890
<v 1>right? And also the protection of capital. And that's like what a lot is.</v>

146
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:53.990
What a lot of it is now is actually just capital interests needing to expand and

147
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:58.991
grow and to up increase the profit structure of these corporations.

148
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:03.690
And that's exactly why we've seen imperialism, you know,

149
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.350
kind of go out of control in the way that it has. I don't know.

150
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:11.550
I mean I thought that we were more independent oil wise.

151
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.250
I don't think it's good. I think that climate change, yeah, I think that,

152
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.630
and it hasn't stopped, you know, it hasn't stopped the imperialist, um,

153
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.520
misadventures of the U S government.

154
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:24.960
So I think there just needs to be a really big shift in consciousness and people

155
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:28.830
to stop thinking that it's our right and that we have, you know,

156
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.280
the right and the duty to do this around the world.

157
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.350
It doesn't give us the right, we don't have it. It's not right, man.

158
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.300
It's really not. And, uh,

159
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.740
we need to really reinvigorate the masses here because again, um,

160
00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:46.890
society is collapsing. That's pretty fucking obvious.

161
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.620
<v 0>Well, if it is, if it's not obvious,</v>

162
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.800
what is obvious is that we're not evolving in terms of if we're still involved

163
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.790
in drone strikes that kill 98% of the people,

164
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:01.860
if we're still involved in regime change Wars,

165
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:06.480
we're still involved in these unnecessary military actions against Iran.

166
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.430
It's these things that people freaking out about.

167
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.650
This is all the same kind of shit that people have been fighting against

168
00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:14.311
forever.

169
00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:19.311
That we don't want our brothers and sisters and husbands and wives to die for

170
00:10:20.491 --> 00:10:23.190
nonsense. We don't want them to die.

171
00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:26.940
For some people that live in these air conditioned rooms that are making

172
00:10:26.941 --> 00:10:31.200
billions of dollars that are profiting off of the actions of these,

173
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.740
these noble people who think that they're doing it to protect America.

174
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.840
I mean, this is the narrative that they're being served.

175
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.410
This is what they're being told and when they're going to these places,

176
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:47.260
they're not going to those places to act as evil as, as to as the, the,

177
00:10:47.261 --> 00:10:48.600
the boots of some empire.

178
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:51.030
They're going over there because they think they're protecting freedom.

179
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.880
They think to protect and their family and their loved ones back home.

180
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.420
That's why they're doing it. If we're still doing that, we're not evolving.

181
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:58.351
<v 1>Well,</v>

182
00:10:58.351 --> 00:11:01.590
I mean that's what's so scary about the Iran thing because the people who are

183
00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:03.750
surrounding Iran and being directed to go out there,

184
00:11:03.751 --> 00:11:06.780
they're the ones who are going to be the sacrificial lands for these defense

185
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:07.591
contractors.

186
00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:12.210
And I don't think that you can argue anymore that this is for freedom.

187
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.800
I mean, how can you, what threat does Iran pose to the world?

188
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.660
<v 0>So it's a tough sell. I don't, I don't understand what threat they serve either.</v>

189
00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:24.470
And what, what benefit would it be for them to start some shit with us?

190
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:28.850
And this is the craziest idea ever. I mean it's like my, you know,

191
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.360
a nine year old kid trying to pick a fight with Mike Tyson's.

192
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.490
<v 1>I'm crazy. It doesn't make any sense. Like what are you trying to do?</v>

193
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:36.683
I'm trying to get killed.

194
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.800
I mean inevitably we're trying to get to the global confrontation with China and

195
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.600
Russia, I guess. I mean that's,

196
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.210
it's scary to think that we only have a couple independent States left to knock

197
00:11:48.211 --> 00:11:52.500
down to be under complete subjugation from the U S military and global

198
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:54.370
capitalism. Pretty nuts.

199
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.420
<v 0>Well, not only that,</v>

200
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.470
even if we do move into some sort of a,

201
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.870
some sort of a situation where we're in control, then we're a bigger target.

202
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:10.650
And with the amount of nuclear weapons that are possessed by these countries

203
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.210
that were, I mean,

204
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:18.450
just what North Korea has just this one small fucked up country could ruin life

205
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:21.603
on earth.

206
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.170
Just this one country and forget about Russia.

207
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:30.880
We could literally annihilate each other. Right? That's, that's a possibility,

208
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.620
right? I mean, if, if someone chose to launch an attack,

209
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.400
if they decided that they have the justification to launch an attack and then

210
00:12:39.401 --> 00:12:42.850
all of a sudden we're in a real war, like a fucking war war

211
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.800
<v 2>invading us, shit's getting knocked down. Buildings,</v>

212
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.100
<v 0>bombs blow up. I mean, over what,</v>

213
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.580
this can't be avoided. This is the only way.

214
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.630
The only way is missiles and bombs. Like you said, we're not evolving

215
00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.440
<v 1>or devolving. I mean it's, it's unbelievable.</v>

216
00:13:00.441 --> 00:13:04.910
We have the capacity to provide for everyone. We have the capacity to cooperate,

217
00:13:04.911 --> 00:13:09.650
to innovate and we're stuck. We're stuck dehumanizing the other.

218
00:13:09.651 --> 00:13:13.790
We're stuck with this mass conditioning to basically perpetuate these,

219
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:17.840
these injustices. And it's really a shame. I mean,

220
00:13:17.841 --> 00:13:19.730
we have all the information at our fingertips,

221
00:13:19.731 --> 00:13:23.690
but we still keep reverting back to what's the myths,

222
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.850
the myths that underpin our society.

223
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.750
<v 0>These conversations I have with you are so depressing because it's always,</v>

224
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:33.330
I always leave going, what, what can be done?

225
00:13:33.331 --> 00:13:37.320
What can we do? What, where does it end? Where does it go?

226
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.760
You know, these are, these are the big questions. And then also the,

227
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:42.870
what we discussed before,

228
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.900
it's impossible for anyone to really have a deep nuanced understanding of all

229
00:13:49.381 --> 00:13:51.330
these different issues. Right? Right.

230
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.710
<v 1>I mean, I think focusing on what you can do,</v>

231
00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:56.950
we can only do what we can do and you have to understand that, you know,

232
00:13:56.951 --> 00:14:00.370
you can't get debilitated or disillusion with, you know, the,

233
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:04.390
the influx of information or just the complete, you know,

234
00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:06.970
the heaviness of it all. You just have to do what you can do.

235
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:09.460
You're doing what you can do. You have me on to,

236
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.060
to help spread awareness about these issues. And that's when you it

237
00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.950
<v 2>and you're about to get it.</v>

238
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.000
You're about to get spammed with a lot of Hasbro and I don't have my real email,

239
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.950
but that's,

240
00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.630
<v 1>that's what we can do, Joe. And,</v>

241
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.510
and you just have to live your life and provide for your kids and,

242
00:14:26.511 --> 00:14:31.490
and love what you have and, but also just understand your place,

243
00:14:31.491 --> 00:14:35.420
you know, and, and just extend the empathy that you can and just, yeah,

244
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.150
I mean it's, it's hard because I don't have the answer.

245
00:14:38.151 --> 00:14:42.140
All I know is what's needed and what's needed is we need a movement of the

246
00:14:42.141 --> 00:14:45.350
masses. It's not going to come from the top down. Um,

247
00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:48.860
it's going to come from a grassroots mobilized effort to try to change these

248
00:14:48.861 --> 00:14:51.980
policies. That's the only way things have ever in the past.

249
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.000
And I absolutely have hope and optimism that we're going to change things and

250
00:14:56.001 --> 00:14:59.630
that we're going to correct this horrible path that we're on.

251
00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:05.220
<v 0>Do you think that the 2020 elections can have a real significant impact of any</v>

252
00:15:05.381 --> 00:15:05.681
of this?

253
00:15:05.681 --> 00:15:10.681
Do you think that whoever gets into office can really have an effect on the

254
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.980
kinds of policies that we're talking about with the kind of influence of the

255
00:15:14.981 --> 00:15:19.070
military industrial complex of all these lobbyists of wall street, [inaudible],

256
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:23.740
all these like ma monstrous machines that just pure,

257
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:28.270
good old fashioned democracy can actually step in and,

258
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.220
and turn this ship away from the rocks.

259
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.710
<v 1>Bernie, I really do think that he's one of our last chances,</v>

260
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:38.510
not because I think that he's going to completely do some revolutionary upheaval

261
00:15:38.511 --> 00:15:39.830
from the top down. As we know,

262
00:15:39.831 --> 00:15:43.550
Congress is stocked with a lot of terrible people who will block a lot of these

263
00:15:43.551 --> 00:15:45.170
efforts, but I think that, um,

264
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.680
he's going to mobilize the masses and reinvigorate the labor movement and

265
00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:53.681
reinvigorate unions and help workers understand that they need to fight for

266
00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:56.330
these rights that have been eviscerated. You know,

267
00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:57.500
over the last a hundred years.

268
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.520
One thing that does inspire me as well as seeing people like Ellen Omar,

269
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.900
you know, she is incredible. She's a Somali refugee.

270
00:16:05.901 --> 00:16:09.830
She advocates BDS against Israel and she does not fucking back down.

271
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.100
I love that woman. What an incredible woman. She got vicious,

272
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.590
viciously attacked for retreating. Um,

273
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.470
one of my episodes from empire files.

274
00:16:18.471 --> 00:16:22.190
And I think it just shows how scared people are of, of her and her ideas.

275
00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:26.480
And you saw how hard everyone came down on her for just saying that Israel has

276
00:16:26.481 --> 00:16:28.580
an influential lobby in D C

277
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:29.710
<v 0>yeah, well the,</v>

278
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:34.930
she's also wearing religious garbs that people are scared of that right away the

279
00:16:34.931 --> 00:16:39.610
job. And then, um, there was something, some hippies on her yesterday.

280
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.390
They're saying they think she married a brother. Oh, that's ridiculous. Yeah.

281
00:16:43.391 --> 00:16:47.740
They think she did to get into this country that she had a religious marriage,

282
00:16:47.741 --> 00:16:49.770
but then she had another, yeah. I don't know.

283
00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:55.100
<v 1>She's the only one in Congress other than [inaudible] and of course AOC and um,</v>

284
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:56.660
you know, some other very few people,

285
00:16:56.661 --> 00:17:00.230
but she's out there every day speaking against the military industrial complex,

286
00:17:00.231 --> 00:17:02.240
speaking against the Wars. I think as a refugee,

287
00:17:02.241 --> 00:17:05.060
she understands the effects of us policy.

288
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.140
And I'm really excited that she has a voice in there. But again,

289
00:17:09.141 --> 00:17:11.780
I don't think that the hope is going to come from within Congress.

290
00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:16.310
And the system is way too far gone with the electoral college and the

291
00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:20.680
gerrymandering and the voter rights, you know, that had been rescinded. It's,

292
00:17:20.681 --> 00:17:24.530
it's a lot and it's an uphill battle, but that's why someone like Bernie,

293
00:17:24.531 --> 00:17:28.670
I think, will turn to the people and say, I can't do this alone.

294
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.950
You have to come out and get my back.
