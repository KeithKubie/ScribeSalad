00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.900
Hey, what's going on with Brexit?

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.500
Well, there sure has been a lot of political squabbling here at ground level.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's...

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
...float away from all that for a look at the big picture.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.720
Up here it's easier to see the one-two-three

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.840
of the impossible Trinity.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.880
But first, quick British Isles primer:

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.640
The United Kingdom contains England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.240
This last part of the United Kingdom shares

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.580
the island of Ireland with the country of Ireland.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.800
This Ireland is in the European Union and 
 the United Kingdom is...

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.660
Well, that's the whole thing, isn't it?

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.000
Before UK voted to Brexit,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the European Union wall encircled them all.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.640
(The wall isn't literal, it's a metaphor for

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.060
the overlapping circles of EU institutions

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.060
and border complications impossible to draw, so...)

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.640
It's a metaphor wall.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.620
Maximum Brexit is the exit where UK leaves

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.780
to build her own wall separate from the EU

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.600
and be like any other country.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.480
This maximum Brexit is the top of the Trinity,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.780
with a wall around the UK,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.220
which, following the border,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.080
would go straight across the Irish island.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.860
Hahâ€”Oh, oh no...

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.040
The books on Ireland, Northern Ireland's and the UK's

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.440
long and complicated (and sometimes frightening) relationship

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.320
are not tomes to be opened here.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.160
The much shorter and safer version is

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.940
there used to be a wall between the Irelands

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.180
but there was a lot of the violence and a lot of the troubles

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.560
until on a very good Friday

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.660
Ireland and the UK agreed there would never be a wall between them again,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.380
full stop.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.540
This, while it didn't uncomplicate the relationship,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.960
at least made it nonviolent.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.780
A new wall plowing between them

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.960
would break this vital political promise,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.740
thus UK and Ireland and even EU all agree:

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.040
a wall here is super no bueno.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.420
No wall across Ireland is the second vertex of the impossible Trinity.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.840
Wait, why do we need a wall anyway?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.400
Oh, right: the maximum Brexit creates a land border with the EU.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.580
because UK is an island unto herself mostly,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.580
but not completely.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.260
So if UK says this is unacceptable

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.840
and all agree *this* is unacceptable,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.260
then the wall could go...

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.340
here, maybe?

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.880
Ah, compromise!

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.880
UK tries to march out of the EU

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.380
but not everybody makes it.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.300
Northern Ireland stays in the EU (sort of?)

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.100
on the other side of the wall while still being part of the UK,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.900
while the EU whispers into her ear

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.920
that were she to let go and unite with Ireland,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.080
that's cool with EU.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.020
Ain't no thing, girl.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.400
Poor Northern Ireland.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.380
She's on Ireland,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.060
but mostly thinks of herself as British,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.240
but also Irish,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.060
but could end up being the last part of the UK in the EU,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.240
while also having the right to leave the UK

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.680
and join Ireland if she ever votes to.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.440
For UK,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.480
this situation means a wall inside the United Kingdom.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.500
No nation wants to create an external wall through internal territory.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.500
Thus, the final vertex of the Trinity:

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.460
No walls inside the UK.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.700
Leaving Northern Ireland behind while staying connected to her

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.760
also means some of those overlapping EU institutions

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.220
can pass through the wall,

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.060
making Britain's Brexit rather less than maximum.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.100
Aaand political geography being what it is,

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.320
that's it for options!

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.500
This, this or this,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.440
all of which the UK refuses.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.480
But you wanted the wall in a different place!

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.360
That was like, your whole thing!

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.840
None of these are acceptable.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.440
Thus the impossible Trinity where the UK must pick a side.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.460
Promising no walls means no maximum Brexit,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.160
promising maximum Brexit means

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.120
there's got to be a wall somewhere,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.900
and so, for a long time,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.940
nothing of consequence happened.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.820
Can...

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.260
...you pick now?

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.780
(sips tea)

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.040
What if I put the wall...

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.080
...here?

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.940
But only temporarily.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.680
That doesn't solve anything!

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.200
That just kicks the Northern Ireland down the road

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.560
until we're right back where we started!

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.120
So that's what's been going on with Brexit.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.800
There's nothing as permanent as a temporary solution

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.700
and ultimately, there's no avoiding the Trinity.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.240
There's three things...

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.260
...pick two.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.100
[Music]

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.400
You can go now.
