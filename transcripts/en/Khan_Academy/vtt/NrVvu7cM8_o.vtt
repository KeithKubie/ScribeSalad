00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.310
Find the sum 15 plus
negative 46 plus 29.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.630
Let's just think about
this first part over here

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:13.060
where we have 15
plus negative 46.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.420
And we'll worry about
the plus 29 later on.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.680
So let's just do
15-- let me do that

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.677
in a different color--
plus negative 46.

00:00:26.677 --> 00:00:27.760
I'll do it in that orange.

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:33.250
Let me draw a number line
here, just so we can properly

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.630
visualize what is going on.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.620
That's my number line.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.120
And we're starting at 15.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.790
So let's draw a 0 over here.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.270
And so we're starting at 15.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.080
15 could be right over here.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.930
So this is 15.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.356
Let me draw a big fat arrow
to signify this is 15.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:01:00.020
15 has an absolute value of
15, so the length of this arrow

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.850
would be 15.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.310
Now we're adding
negative 46 to that 15.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.580
This is equivalent
to 15 minus 46,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.030
which means we are going to
move 46 spots to the left of 15.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.130
A negative sign or
a minus means we're

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.350
moving to the left
on the number line.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.910
So we're going to
move 46 to the left.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:31.020
We're starting at 15, and we are
going to move 46 to the left.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.152
So the length of this arrow
right here is going to be 46,

00:01:38.152 --> 00:01:39.360
and we're moving to the left.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.370
This is the negative 46
that we're adding to the 15.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.220
We're going to end up
at some point over here.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.890
That point is clearly 0.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.466
Because we were 15 to the right.

00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:53.090
Now we're going to
move 46 to the left.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.360
So we're definitely going
to be to the left of 0.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.370
It's definitely going
to be a negative number.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.510
And we can even think
about the absolute value

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.570
of that negative number.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.220
We can just visualize it.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.790
This yellow arrow
has a length of 15.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.000
This orange arrow
has a length of 46.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.100
The blue arrow that
I'm about to draw,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.890
which is the sum
of these two, is

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.310
going to have this
length right over here.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.340
And just visually,
how can we figure out

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.410
the length of this
blue part if we

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.020
know the length of
this orange part

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.320
and we know the length
of this yellow part?

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.600
Well, it's just going
to be the difference.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.683
It's just going to be the
difference of these two.

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.980
So the absolute
value of the sum is

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.140
going to be the difference
between this length, 46,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.850
and 15.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.300
Let me just figure
that out, 46 minus 15.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.740
6 minus 5 is 1.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.790
4 minus 1 is 3.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.140
So the length of this
is going to be 31,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.100
and it's going to be
31 to the left of 0.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.720
So this is going to be
negative 31 right over here.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.910
We know that this first part
over here is negative 31,

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.080
and then to that we
are going to add 29.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.657
So we're going to add 29.

00:03:06.657 --> 00:03:07.990
Let me do that in another color.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.200
What does that mean?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.840
That means that we're going
to start at negative 31,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.940
and we're going to
move 29 to the right.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.070
We're adding 29, so we're
going to move 29 to the right.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.810
So maybe that gets
us right about there.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.470
I'm trying to draw an
arrow of length 29.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.730
I can draw a cleaner
looking arrow than that.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.910
I'll do it right
over here, actually.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.400
So then we're going to
move 29 over to the right.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.350
That's the 29 part.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.600
Now this is a positive
29, and so how

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.990
do we figure out what this is?

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.570
This is 29 right here
that we're adding.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.990
This is going to land us right
over here on the number line.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.160
So how do we figure out
what number that is?

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.000
Well, once again, we
can just visualize it.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.541
And eventually you won't have
to draw number lines and stuff,

00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:01.290
but I think it'll
be useful here.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.540
We're starting at negative 31.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.720
We're adding 29 to it, so it's
going to make it less negative.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.690
But we're still
adding less than 31,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.750
so we're not going to get
all the way back to 0.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.583
We're still going to
have a negative number.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.000
But how could we figure
out the absolute value

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.870
of that negative
number, its distance?

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.410
Well, once again, that little
white part right there,

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.720
that white part plus
this 29, is going

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.334
to equal 31, if you just
think of absolute value,

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:29.750
if we don't think
about the signs,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.166
if we just think
about the length.

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:34.100
Or another way to think
about it, 31 minus 29

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.640
will give us the length
of that white part.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.600
And of course, it's
going to be negative,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.330
because the negative
number here is

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.740
larger than the positive number.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.480
And we're adding the 2.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.642
If we do 31 minus 29, you
could borrow and all of that,

00:04:49.642 --> 00:04:51.600
but that's clearly just
going to be equal to 2.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.320
You could say that's 11.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.580
This is a 2.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.600
You subtract, this
is equal to 2.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.010
But since it's
negative 31 plus 29,

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.350
it's going to be a negative 2.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.808
We're still going
to stay negative.

00:05:02.808 --> 00:05:05.630
We haven't moved far to
the right enough to pass 0.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.265
So this right here is
going to be negative 2.

00:05:08.265 --> 00:05:09.640
Or another way to
think about it,

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.170
the length of this white
bar, the absolute value,

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.466
is going to be 2.

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:15.710
2 plus 29 is 31.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.940
But we're operating to the
left of 0, so it's negative 31.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.250
This is negative 2.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.590
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.300
And let me make it clear.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:31.545
Our final answer is negative 2.
