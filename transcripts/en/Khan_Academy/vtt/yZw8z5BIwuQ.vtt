00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.000
- "Click on the graph to
draw an isosceles trapezoid

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.147
"with vertices at negative two comma eight

00:00:05.147 --> 00:00:07.481
"and negative four comma negative one.

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:09.663
"Another vertex at three comma eight

00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:11.883
"and a base nine units long

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:14.633
"that is parallel to the x-axis."

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:16.850
All right, let's see if we can do this.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.052
So we could just start
plotting these vertices.

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:21.259
So negative two comma eight.

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.337
X is negative two, y is eight.

00:00:23.337 --> 00:00:25.357
That's that point right over there.

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:29.355
The next one is x is negative
four, y is negative one.

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:31.252
x is negative four, y is negative one

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:31.863
and that's nice.

00:00:31.863 --> 00:00:33.693
They connect the dots for us.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.564
Then they say three comma eight.

00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:40.102
So three comma eight.

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:41.809
It's gonna be right up here.

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.202
Now I think when I click it,

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:45.106
it's going to try to draw a line

00:00:45.106 --> 00:00:46.429
between this point and this point

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:47.869
which isn't what we want.

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:50.527
This is a trapezoid,
an isosceles trapezoid.

00:00:50.527 --> 00:00:52.710
I actually want to
connect three comma eight

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.589
to this point right over here
to negative two comma eight.

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:56.587
So let me see what happens.

00:00:56.587 --> 00:00:58.746
Yep, yeah, that's not
what I wanted to happen.

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:01.382
So let me actually delete this.

00:01:01.382 --> 00:01:02.101
Let me delete here.

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:03.866
I'm actually gonna plot this one first.

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.387
Then I'm going to plot this one,

00:01:05.387 --> 00:01:07.581
then I'm going to plot this
one and then I'm going to see

00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:09.009
where I need to put this other one.

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.866
So let me delete all of these.

00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.225
We move these all to the trash.

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:16.439
So move them all to the trash.

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.168
And so let me start over.

00:01:18.168 --> 00:01:19.603
So I'm going to start,

00:01:19.603 --> 00:01:21.326
that looks like some type
of a bug but let's see.

00:01:21.326 --> 00:01:22.963
Let's hopefully it still works.

00:01:22.963 --> 00:01:24.518
Let's plot three comma eight first.

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:26.968
Three comma eight.

00:01:26.968 --> 00:01:28.230
That's that point.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.008
Then we're going to plot
negative two comma eight.

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:32.517
Negative two comma eight.

00:01:32.517 --> 00:01:36.685
This is the top of our
isosceles trapezoid.

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:38.147
It's nice to give us the length

00:01:38.147 --> 00:01:40.778
that has, the length of this top is five.

00:01:40.778 --> 00:01:44.182
And then, now you can do
negative four comma negative one.

00:01:44.182 --> 00:01:46.613
Negative four comma negative one is

00:01:46.613 --> 00:01:47.599
this point right over here.

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:49.564
All right, now this is
looking like a trapezoid.

00:01:49.564 --> 00:01:51.713
And now a base nine units long

00:01:51.713 --> 00:01:54.413
that is parallel to the x-axis.

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:56.561
So base, it's nine units long

00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:57.706
and it's parallel to the x-axis.

00:01:57.706 --> 00:02:00.051
We just have to move to
the right, nine units.

00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:03.172
One, two, three, four,

00:02:03.172 --> 00:02:08.172
five, six, seven, eight, nine units.

00:02:08.173 --> 00:02:10.611
And then we just move back up.

00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:13.409
And it does look like
we have got ourselves

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:14.930
an isosceles trapezoid.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.868
What is an isosceles trapezoid mean?

00:02:16.868 --> 00:02:18.656
It means that these two sides,

00:02:18.656 --> 00:02:20.757
the non top or non bottom

00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:23.857
or non base sides are going to be equal.

00:02:23.857 --> 00:02:27.177
And we see that this side
over here is equal to that

00:02:27.177 --> 00:02:28.990
and that this top is,

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.590
you can kind of view, it's in the middle.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.850
That's one way to think about it.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.008
So I like this isosceles trapezoid.

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:36.250
So let's check our answer.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.235
Make sure that we've drawn it right.

00:02:38.235 --> 00:02:40.171
Yeah, we did good.
