00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.380
SPEAKER 1: And I have not only
the pleasure, but the privilege

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.690
of introducing Shanthi,
and we're going

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.260
to be having a talk today.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.400
So before we get started,
I want to read a quick bio.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.980
So Shanthi Sekaran
teaches creative writing

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.750
at the California
College of Arts

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.720
and is a member of the San
Francisco Writers' Grotto.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.240
Her work has appeared in
"The New York Times," "Best

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.760
New American Voices,"
and "Huffington Post,"

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.934
and online at "Zyzzyva"
and "Mutha Magazine."

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:33.350
Her first novel,
"The Prayer Room"

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.640
was published by MacAdam Cage.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.940
She is a California native
who lives in Berkeley

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.562
with her husband
and two children.

00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:42.020
And today, we're going to be
talking about her book, "Lucky

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.710
Boy," which follows two stories,
that of Soli Castro-Valdez,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.720
an undocumented Mexican woman,
and that of Rishi and Kavya

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.100
Reddy, an Indian-American
couple who live in Berkeley,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.230
California, as well.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.160
Please welcome me
in joining Shanthi.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.920
So we'll go ahead and
start off by thanking

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.970
Shanthi for being here.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.511
I had the pleasure of meeting
with her a couple of weeks ago,

00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:08.150
so I'm particularly
excited for today.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.919
But I'd love to just
start with maybe

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:11.710
reading a couple of
excerpts from the book.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.626
SHANTHI SEKARAN: Sure.

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:15.220
Yeah, so I'm going to read
two excerpts from the two

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.840
sides of the story.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.970
So one side is--

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.600
one of my main characters is
an undocumented, young Mexican

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.440
woman who crosses into
California from Mexico.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.420
She's from Oaxaca, Mexico.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.690
And she ends up in Berkeley,
California, not far from here.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.240
So Soli-- I don't think you need
to know much else about her.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.760
She's crossing the border,
just getting close to it

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.510
in this scene that I'm
about to read right now.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.670
And she's met a man
named Checo on her way.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.340
She had sort of a romance
on her journey up.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.860
So that's all you need
to know, and here we go.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.200
"It had been five days
since Soli had last

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.990
seen Checo, and thoughts
of him, and what

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.420
might have happened
to him, jangled inside

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.490
her like shards of tin.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.520
Soli and two other women sat
on the bed of a yellow onion

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.820
truck, with crates stacked
high to shield them.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.160
Every now and then,
a thin whistle of air

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.400
made it through the slats of
the truck and past the crates,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.830
and for those swift
seconds, she sensed

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.050
the sweet nearness of the end.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.080
With the air, the morning
light, the company

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.350
of calm woman among who she
could, at last, close her eyes,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.370
Soli felt that she
would hold together,

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.850
cohered by a single strip
of hope, just long enough

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.430
to arrive at Silvia's door.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.950
They stopped twice that day to
piss on the side of the road

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.410
and stretch their legs.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.390
Soli slept-- for how
long, she did not know.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.530
She did not dream of
what had happened to her.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.360
She did not dream of Checo or of
the brutish men who came later.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.660
The cave between
her legs was numb,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.440
but her thighs were
sticky and began

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.390
to blister in the day's heat.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.840
When she awoke,
the air was still.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.730
A woman named Luz squinted at
her across the mound of onions.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.830
'Where are you
going?' she asked.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.960
'Berkely,' Soli answered.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.410
'Where's that?' 'Close
to San Francisco.'

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.060
'You know someone there?'

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.876
'Yes, my cousin.' 'Your
cousin have money?'

00:03:21.876 --> 00:03:23.010
'Yes, I think so.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.500
I think she has the money.'

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.840
Luz shook her head like she did
not see good things for Soli.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.290
A few hours after dark, the
driver stopped the truck

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.360
and stuck his head
out his window.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.400
'Get flat,' he called.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.660
'What's he talking about?'

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.710
Soli asked.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.740
Luz rolled herself into a ball.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.370
The truck slowed to a
halt. The engine stopped.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.980
'Get down,' she hissed, and
pulled sleeping Fatima from

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.790
the bench to the floor.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.100
'Are we here?' Soli asked.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.270
'Quiet, make yourself small.'

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.690
Through the crates
in the slats, Soli

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.630
saw the flicker of a
dark green uniform.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.670
The flicker spoke in English.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.310
He spoke in English.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.750
'We're here,' Soli whispered.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.350
'Shut up.' Luz was kneeling
beside her and she took

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.910
Soli's hand in hers.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.040
She slipped her fingers
along Soli's knuckles

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.660
like they were rosary beads.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.820
And Soli prayed
silently, thinking

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.190
of her own lost rosary.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.650
Though his words were
muffled by onions,

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.920
she knew the uniformed man
was questioning their driver.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.460
Shuffling paper, more questions,
and before she could move,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.380
a stick shot through the slats.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.580
She gasped.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.110
It grazed her skull.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.160
Again and again, it
rammed through the slats.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.680
A guard's iron wand,
trawling for migrant flesh,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.360
hoping to hit
something live enough

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.430
to cry out and prove the truck
carried more than onions.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.040
She held her hands to
her head and prayed.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.800
She knew she was shaking,
but luckily for her, fear

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.360
made no sound.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.600
Moments later, she heard
footsteps crunch away

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.240
and vanish.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.870
The engine started up again,
and they rolled forward.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.260
Luz released a tremulous breath.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.760
'Lucky,' she said.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.350
'A lazy one.'

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.290
She looked up at Soli,
grinned, and pushed her tongue

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.430
through the gap in her teeth.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.000
'We're here.'

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.310
'In the North?' 'America, mija.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.590
That's what they call it here.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.850
We are in California now.'

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.950
Soli looked up to the sky--

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.350
same blue as the Mexican sky.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.300
She looked through
the truck slats.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.960
This was California, the
United States of America.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.770
She had arrived, and
here's what she discovered.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.090
This place, this
America, this new place,

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.330
this streets of gold place,
looked a hell of a lot

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.160
like the old place.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.940
America streaked by her
stripped and tender with heat.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.190
She watched it all rush
past through the slats

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.360
of the old truck--

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.940
the tin roofs, seas
of broken glass,

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.180
glinting and breathless
like a fever dream.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.870
America was the dust in her
hair, the wind in her throat,

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.720
the sun that shouted
against her eyelids.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.240
Between the slats of
this truck, America

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.670
was nothing but a
high-tech, high-speed dream

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:19.680
of trees and houses and fences,
a sliver of interrupted light.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.710
The old folks back home, those
who'd been here and back,

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.890
told Soli she would do well
here, that she had the spirit.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.740
They told her to keep her
head down and work hard,

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.198
and for God's sake,
keep her mouth shut."

00:06:32.198 --> 00:06:32.698
OK.

00:06:32.698 --> 00:06:34.174
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.680
So that's Soli.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.470
The other side of
my story is a couple

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.480
named Kavya and Rishi Reddy.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.450
They live in Berkeley.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.050
And Kavya's a chef
at a sorority,

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.880
which is its own story.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.700
But Rishi is a worker at
a Silicon Valley company.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.790
He does stuff with air
quality in buildings.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.380
So he works for this gigantic
Silicon Valley company

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.030
that I made up.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.590
It's called the Weebies.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.750
And it's one of these--

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.320
it's a company that just--
it's like a gigantic Amazon

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.080
for children's and
babies' supplies,

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.190
combined with some
social networking stuff.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.790
So this little bit is
going to be a little bit

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.240
from Kavya's point of view, but
then we're going to transition

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.790
into Rishi's point of view.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.800
And here we go.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.440
"Despite the clarity
of her desire,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.190
Kavya had no real idea of
what sort of mother she'd be.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.640
The parents around her seemed to
take great pride in their work,

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.100
like artisans of a dying craft.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.040
Jogging through parks and
waiting in BART stations,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.650
Kavya had come across
American mothers speaking

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.040
French to their American
children, fathers explaining

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.930
the physics of
underground transport

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.210
to their preschoolers,
property tax

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.190
law to their eight-year-olds.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.100
At the farmer's market the
week before, a little girl

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.110
had fallen and scraped her knee.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.170
As she stood sobbing,
inconsolable, her mother

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.940
knelt down beside her.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:08.670
'Here, sweetie.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:09.500
Have some kale.'

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.650
The little girl had
taken it, chewed

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.580
on the tough, primordial
leaf, and stopped crying.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.500
The stakes were
high in Berkeley.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.257
The toddlers were eating
their cruciferous greens.

00:08:25.257 --> 00:08:27.590
There were things she couldn't
know about being a parent

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.980
without being one.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.920
This, she sensed from
the way men and women

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.010
with children in tow seemed
to have little to say to her.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.010
Parenthood was a members-only
organization closed

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.320
to freelancers and temps.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.690
Outsiders could visit
for lunch, but they

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.480
tended to leave quickly,
overwhelmed by the demands

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.930
of belonging.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.840
But Kavya didn't want to leave.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.970
Kavya wanted in.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.920
For Rishi, the brilliant
bonus of this new world,

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.430
this procreative world, was
a sudden abundance of sex.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.650
They were doing it every
day, sometimes twice,

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.480
like they'd done
in the early days.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.060
They had sex for lunch and
ate burritos in the car.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.760
They had sex in the living room
and toppled the throw pillows

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.870
from the sofa.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.540
They had sex in a restaurant
once, in the bathroom,

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.650
and once in a parking lot.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.680
But after two
months, then three,

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.470
these trysts began to
feel inappropriate,

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.750
like their control was slipping.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.750
He began to wonder what it was
about, all the spontaneity?

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.490
He supposed Kavya
was trying to keep

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.890
things fun, maybe
even for his sake,

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.490
to combat the impatience
that lurked in the shadows.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.210
For three months, Kavya
refused to look at her calendar

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.880
or take her temperature, or do
any of the things a woman did

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.770
to track their fertility.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.360
'It shouldn't matter,' she said.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.280
It should just happen.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.110
But then it didn't just happen.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.360
After three months of
trying and failing,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.640
the sex could no
longer be casual.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.260
She began taking
her temperature,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.380
tracking her ovulation.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.320
Rishi had been on
board with this.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.470
He would think of it as
a project, he decided.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.300
Project managing
was what he did,

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.010
and driving his
management approach

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.670
was the Weebies principle,
the Silicon Valley principle

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.160
that nothing was impossible.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.000
Impossibility was not
an absolute, but as

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.140
shiftable as a heavy boulder.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.900
Trial and error and a
little cognitive daring

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.410
were all it took to make
the impossible, possible.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.280
It had worked for PCs,
the internet, smartphones.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.070
It would work for his baby.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.470
Sex whenever became
sex on a schedule.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.920
Kavya felt a sense of
purpose, satisfaction even.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.600
She was taking charge.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.570
Kavya began demanding sex as
Rishi hurried from the house

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.580
to catch the Weebus.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.340
She once actually drove
out to the Weebies campus

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.380
and showed up at
his office door.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.510
'I'm ovulating right
now,' she said.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.360
'Like, now.'

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.470
Rishi had found them
a nap room, disobeying

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.840
the strict single
occupant limit.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.550
They'd emerged
flushed and rumpled

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.890
in full view few of
his coworkers gathered

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.320
at the espresso machine.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.630
Often, from across the Bay,
she'd text him in all caps--

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.380
mid-meeting, mid-presentation,
mid-epiphany--

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.420
to say, 'COME HOME.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.130
I NEED YOU NOW.'

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.870
What once would
have thrilled Rishi

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:16.040
stirred in him a sense of
anxiety, futility, ingratitude.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.990
He felt less like a man and
more like an indentured servant,

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:22.600
keeping up his end
of a shady bargain.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.030
And every time, every month
they tried to get pregnant,

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.690
Rishi watched Kavya
grow more brittle.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.120
He thought of himself
as a rational person,

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.340
good at compartmentalizing, good
at avoiding flights of fancy.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.390
But trying to have a
baby defied his powers

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.240
of reason and
strategy and desire.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.420
He bought into the idea
that hard work bred success,

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.970
but Rishi and Kavya
were working hard.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.790
They were working
unnaturally hard at this most

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.560
natural of tasks.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.960
Six months passed
and still nothing,

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.970
nine months, and Kavya had found
herself at Prithi's wedding.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:02.140
And now 10-- the gravel in her
throat had grown to a stone.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.060
Every time she saw
a baby or a woman

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.980
with a luscious
globe of a belly,

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.720
the stone grew
harder and larger.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.330
But Kavya knew this much--

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.500
she was a woman.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.120
She was an Indian woman.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.070
Surely a country
with 1 billion people

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.560
had produced some capable wombs.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.660
She was going to have a baby.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.520
She and Rishi just
needed to get away

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.880
from the theater of failure
that had become their bedroom.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.090
They needed to escape the
chilly corners of their bungalow

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.040
and have the sort of
relaxed intercourse

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.680
from which babies
seemed to spring.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.520
Her ears buzzed with certainty
and farther inside, her ovaries

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.660
winced.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.460
She texted Rishi.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.140
'Napa Valley, this
weekend, spa, B&amp;B--

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.590
I'm booking it!'

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.590
The exclamation
mark, so hopeful,

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.470
she began to delete it,
then decided to let it be."

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.150
SPEAKER 1: Wonderful,
thank you so much.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.830
I don't know about those
of you that heard it,

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.705
but I went through the
full range of emotions

00:13:02.705 --> 00:13:05.360
from, the powerful, beautiful
descriptive language

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.685
in the first one to--

00:13:06.685 --> 00:13:09.934
I don't know, the second segment
seemed a little familiar.

00:13:09.934 --> 00:13:12.350
I think you did a great job
at capturing the world of tech

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.970
in the Bay Area, in general.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.560
So before we go
into "Lucky Boy,"

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.639
I'd love to just hear about
your beginning as an author.

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:19.680
What's that journey like?

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.835
Did you always know
you wanted to write?

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:23.210
SHANTHI SEKARAN:
I did not always

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.376
know that I wanted to write.

00:13:24.376 --> 00:13:25.619
I knew that I loved books.

00:13:25.619 --> 00:13:26.660
And I think my brothers--

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.118
I have these two
older brothers who

00:13:28.118 --> 00:13:30.679
are 10 years and 11
years older than me--

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:31.970
I think they knew before I did.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.350
We used to play "Fresh Air."

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.057
We used to pretend we were
on "Fresh Air" together.

00:13:36.057 --> 00:13:37.640
Like, my brother
would be Terry Gross,

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.280
and I would be me,
talking about a book.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.830
And so I think
they had some sense

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:44.030
that this was what I loved.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:47.330
But I'd spent a lot
of my school years

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.820
thinking I was going to
be an English literature

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:54.750
professor, until I realized
how theoretical that field is.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.710
And what I loved was the books
and the language and talking

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.880
about that.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.550
So it was really only
when I was about 22

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.730
that I had started
writing creatively,

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:09.290
and took, really, just the
first pages of my first attempts

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:13.130
at creative writing and sent
those into an MFA program.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:17.510
And got in-- got into
one, and went to that one,

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.120
and took it from there,
just to sort of see if this

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.550
was something that I could do.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.280
And so it was a slow process,
but the love of books

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.120
was always there.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.162
SPEAKER 1: I love that.

00:14:27.162 --> 00:14:27.870
That's wonderful.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.786
Yeah, I feel like we're
all-- at least for me,

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:32.420
I'm still trying to figure
out what is the niche, what

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.359
is the thing to do.

00:14:33.359 --> 00:14:35.150
I love hearing from
authors, their journey,

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.691
because it ranges
from always knowing

00:14:36.691 --> 00:14:38.360
that you wanted to
write to just one

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.352
day, realizing that
it's your passion.

00:14:40.352 --> 00:14:41.810
And in terms of
genre, did you ever

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.351
think about what
you wanted to write,

00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:46.424
whether it was fiction or
nonfiction, particular topics--

00:14:46.424 --> 00:14:48.590
SHANTHI SEKARAN: I'd always
wanted to write fiction.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.120
I think poetry is kind of scary.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.450
I really admire poets.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.420
But really, there's no
safety net with poetry.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.890
You're really putting
yourself out there.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.530
Nonfiction-- this
was the closest

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.990
I've ever come to
nonfiction, as a writer.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:08.420
So this took a lot of
research, and I now feel

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.610
like more adept at nonfiction.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.320
I feel like I can go
in that direction,

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.750
but it took a sort
of transitional book,

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.040
like "Lucky Boy."

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.456
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
so it's wonderful

00:15:17.456 --> 00:15:20.060
because it is a fiction book,
and yet there are so many areas

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.890
that, when you and I
chatted, you really

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.507
wanted to explore to make
sure that you do it justice.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:26.090
So do you mind telling
us a little bit

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.548
about your preparation
and learning

00:15:27.548 --> 00:15:30.170
about tech companies,
immigration, the Latinx

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.340
experience?

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.350
SHANTHI SEKARAN:
Yeah, so I was faced

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:38.780
with this task of writing
these worlds that I was not

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:42.050
familiar with, from Soli's world
to the Silicon Valley world

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.510
to fertility issues.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.020
So I started very basic
with some documentaries

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.150
and oral histories,
just getting a sense

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.370
of what the undocumented
experience might

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.110
be like for people, what it's
like to cross the border,

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:58.340
why people feel they
need to leave their homes

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.460
and come to America.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:06.680
It started pretty sort of
straightforward in that way,

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.925
and then I started to
just look for people

00:16:08.925 --> 00:16:09.800
who would talk to me.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.670
So immigration lawyers,
immigration policy scholars,

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.190
adoptive parents, because
Kavya and Rishi end up

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.690
being foster parents
to Soli's child.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.700
Yeah, so in all of
these realms, people

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.330
who'd undergone
fertility treatments,

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:29.520
just anyone who would talk
to me about their experience,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.855
I tried to get a hold of.

00:16:30.855 --> 00:16:31.980
And people are pretty open.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.813
When you're a novelist
and not a journalist,

00:16:33.813 --> 00:16:36.670
people are pretty
willing to talk to you.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:40.020
And with Silicon
Valley, I spent a day--

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.270
less, like, a few hours
here with Ann Less,

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:46.530
who's here, and just kind of
went to lunch in the cafeteria,

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.600
walked around a little.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.550
I've never worked
in Silicon Valley.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:51.840
So a lot of--

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.080
I think I absorbed
literally 37 details

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.200
and put them all in this book.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.180
During those few hours--
and then, just living

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.670
in California, it's
part of the zeitgeist.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.260
You absorb stuff, as well.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.140
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
that's wonderful.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.060
I couldn't help but chuckle
when you said the Weebus.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.609
Reminded me of the G bus, I was
like, I like that similarity.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:13.650
SHANTHI SEKARAN: Yeah, I
had all kinds of things.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:16.500
I had-- we edited it out,
but I had the snack cupboard,

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.377
which was called Fweebies,
because it's all free.

00:17:19.377 --> 00:17:20.710
And I thought that was too much.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.160
But then, we were outside,
and you called a dog a Doogle.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.280
SPEAKER 1: A doog--

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.756
yeah, our Dooglers here.

00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:27.089
SHANTHI SEKARAN: Yeah, Dooglers.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:27.681
Yeah, yeah.

00:17:27.681 --> 00:17:29.430
SPEAKER 1: This is why
I appreciated this,

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:30.660
because I knew that you
had done your research.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.076
And as I was reading
through this,

00:17:32.076 --> 00:17:33.770
I was like, this is so accurate.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.650
You did a great job
of capturing it.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.190
So speaking of
tech, obviously it's

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.420
a predominant part of the book.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.440
What role do you think tech has
as an industry in this topic,

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.570
in immigration?

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:49.110
SHANTHI SEKARAN: What role
does tech have in immigration?

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:53.100
I've been thinking about the
H-1B issues that have been

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.660
coming up in the past few days.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.930
And I see tech as the new--

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.630
it is the new
industry in the world,

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.210
and especially in California.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.960
And it needs people.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.730
It needs people who are capable.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.300
And we're such a
globalized society now,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.220
that immigration and tech--

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.950
immigration feeds
tech, at this point.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.370
And I feel like that's
the way it should be.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:25.500
And on the other side of
it, being one of our biggest

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.590
industries right
now, I feel like tech

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.700
might have a role to play in--

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.640
I don't know, in having a
say in some of these issues

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.780
and issues of immigration?

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.280
I'm not all that
actually completely

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.410
certain what I think of that.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.480
I don't know if business
should stay away

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.490
from politics, if business
should stay away from issues

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.280
of immigration or not.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.930
I'd sort of be interested
to hear what people think,

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:52.790
being in this world.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.540
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, we'll
have an opportunity

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.925
to get some
questions, maybe even

00:18:56.925 --> 00:18:58.830
some opinions from the group.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.430
So speaking more
about immigration,

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:05.100
there is a lot of themes in
the book about immigration

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.314
intersecting with motherhood
or parenthood or family.

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:11.730
I feel like often in our nation,
we talk about immigration

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.990
as an individual topic.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.890
So what opportunities do
we have to view immigration

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.862
from that more family or
motherhood perspective?

00:19:19.862 --> 00:19:22.320
SHANTHI SEKARAN: So one thing
that I found out pretty early

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:28.440
on is that of our 11 million
undocumented immigrants,

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:32.970
within that statistic, 5
million children in the US

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.670
have at least one
undocumented parent.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.610
So we think of
immigration, you're right,

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.770
as a very individual pursuit.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:44.610
America was built on these
ideas of individualism

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:50.860
versus collectivism and
this idea of bootstraps,

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.430
and just being your own person
and forging your own way,

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.470
which is all very admirable.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.620
But it's worth noting
that these issues--

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.690
when we talk about
undocumented immigrants,

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.030
we're not talking about
the one immigrant who

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.250
crosses the border on his own.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.830
We're talking about
the family that he

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:12.860
might build in the US,
his family back home.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:16.030
We're talking about
generations, of ramifications

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.488
for whatever we decide
to do with immigration.

00:20:19.488 --> 00:20:21.280
SPEAKER 1:
Definitely, and I like

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.010
that you're talking about
that because we often

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.200
think of an image when we
think of immigrant, right?

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.770
And it's often the unlucky,
right, or the unfortunate,

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.440
or having to deal with
the same struggles.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.440
But we have immigrants
from all over the world,

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.290
and they come with
different experiences.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.970
You wrote an op-ed in "The
New York Times" called

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:42.585
"The Privileged Immigrant."

00:20:42.585 --> 00:20:44.710
Do you mind talking a little
bit about that article

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:48.130
and how that correlates with
what "Lucky Boy" tells us,

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:48.940
as well?

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.280
SHANTHI SEKARAN: Yeah, so
"The Privileged Immigrant,"

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.810
that came out in November.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.460
And it, basically,
is a discussion

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.600
of my own family's
immigration experience, which

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.060
was that my parents
came over in the 1960s

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.830
as foreign medical graduates.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.590
My dad had graduated medical
school at that point,

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:11.320
and the US was trying to fill
its hospitals with its Medicare

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.350
network that had just
been put in place.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:18.220
So that article sort of looks
at their experience of yes,

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.460
being alienated, yes,
struggling a lot,

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:25.960
but at least having solid
work and having a visa,

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.400
having a solid, legal
way to be in the US.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.530
And that not only put them
at ease psychologically,

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.490
but it allowed them to
put structures in place

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.590
in their lives that have brought
them where they are today.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.800
It allowed them to
start savings accounts

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.010
and start investing
and buy property.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:48.640
And we see I enjoy the
fruits of that now,

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.240
and my kids enjoy
the fruits of that.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.310
So again, we're going
forward for generations.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:57.490
And when you think about
an undocumented immigrant,

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.580
there are structures in place
for undocumented immigrants.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.820
They can go to a bank
and open a bank account,

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.640
but it's terrifying
to walk into a bank.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.370
We saw what just happened
to the first DACA

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:13.240
recipient who was deported.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.560
It's scary to go in and give
your official information

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.560
to an institution when
you don't actually

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.770
belong here with legal papers.

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.550
So it's really hard for
undocumented immigrants,

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:32.350
I realized, while researching
this book to put those building

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.100
blocks in place for
a stable future.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.530
SPEAKER 1: And how much of
your own personal experiences

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.210
would you say
influenced this book?

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:42.730
Because the first book
that you wrote also

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.730
had a lot of your personal
experiences, as well.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.300
So I'd love to see
how much of that

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.750
you incorporate in your writing.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:50.440
SHANTHI SEKARAN: So my
personal experiences--

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.560
in order to start
to understand Soli,

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.290
I had to understand
her in my terms.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:59.480
I had to relate to
her as a person.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.000
And so motherhood
is in here a lot.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.100
I have two kids.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.350
There's some material
right after the little boy

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.120
is born in this book
that comes straight

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.580
from what I had jotted down
right after my little boy was

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.290
born.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:15.490
And then the ideas of
immigration and, particularly

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:20.050
with Kavya and Rishi, these
ideas of ambition and what

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.380
parents want for their children
and what it's like for a second

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:27.730
generation Indian-American or
a second generation immigrant,

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.770
there is this unspoken--

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:34.000
sometimes spoken-- agreement
between immigrant parents

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.740
and their children,
which basically says,

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.970
look, I gave up everything
I knew to come over here.

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:42.595
So you'd better do
something with this.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:51.070
And so failure is not, in
many parents' view, an option.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:55.000
So that fed into Kavya's
experience in the story

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.970
and it fed into
Rishi's experience.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.014
And it also fed into the
narrative around fertility

00:24:01.014 --> 00:24:02.305
and being able to have a child.

00:24:02.305 --> 00:24:05.930
SPEAKER 1: Mm-hmm,
that's wonderful.

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.170
I also know that
when we were talking,

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:09.790
we were talking a
lot about the things

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:11.859
that you learned when
you were doing research.

00:24:11.859 --> 00:24:13.900
And particularly, when
looking at the differences

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.080
in immigrants, there was
the detention centers

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.249
that you observed, and you
learned a lot about that.

00:24:19.249 --> 00:24:21.040
Can you tell us more
about that experience,

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.950
what it was like to see what
undocumented immigrants go

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:25.330
through?

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.670
SHANTHI SEKARAN: Yes, so
I trained with a group

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:32.290
called CIVIC Endisolation,
and they do a lot of work

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:34.210
with undocumented immigrants.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.390
They started out sort of
providing legal representation

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.670
because when you're
in a detention center,

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:41.617
you're not given
a defense lawyer.

00:24:41.617 --> 00:24:42.700
You're not given a lawyer.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:47.770
It's not like being
a criminal in the US.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:51.520
So they were helping people
A, find their families,

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:58.420
and also try to get some
legal aid for their situation.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.350
And when I trained with them, I
visited the detention facility

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.080
out in Richmond, California.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.460
And it was just--

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:10.450
I didn't get to see where
people were actually living.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.600
And the Richmond facility
is a somewhat reformed one,

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.300
people have a little
more room to wander.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.050
They can leave their
rooms when they want.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.020
They have a little more freedom.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.830
But a lot of what I learned
about the detention centers

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.640
came from writings,
lawyers who have

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.190
devoted their careers to
researching different detention

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:31.270
centers.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:34.360
And much of what I learned
revolved around the fact

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.450
that detention centers
are basically prisons.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:41.410
They're often within the
prison facility, itself.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:43.990
But they're like prisons
without facilities,

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.710
because it's not
considered permanent,

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:50.930
a long-term solution
for an immigrant,

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:52.820
so they don't give
you resources.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:55.150
So if you're a
parent in detention,

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.510
and you're separated from
your American-born child,

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.340
there's nothing
there that allows

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:03.970
you to reunite with your child.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.460
So if a family
court says, OK, we

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.980
want you to do this
and this and this

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.546
to qualify for
reunification, there's

00:26:11.546 --> 00:26:13.420
no way a detainee can
do that because there's

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.378
nothing in the center for them.

00:26:16.378 --> 00:26:18.250
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.007
So the research behind it--

00:26:20.007 --> 00:26:22.090
I mean, I was so impressed
with the amount of work

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:24.982
that went into finding out,
understanding that experience.

00:26:24.982 --> 00:26:26.440
And actually, you
were just talking

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.540
about this, that the
story beautifully

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.540
contrasts two different
journeys of immigrants that

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.520
have different experiences.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.310
Our nation often tends to
privilege certain minorities

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:38.390
over others.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.010
And what I liked is that
you were treading lightly.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.500
You wanted to dig deep and get
information about the Latinx

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.110
experience, but you wanted to
make sure that you did it well.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:49.750
So I personally think
that you took the time

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.950
and you handled it very
eloquently and beautifully.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:53.560
And you were-- as
a Latino, I think

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.960
you told the story very well.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.120
But did you ever feel--

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.570
maybe you were-- and
I ask this as the kind

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.300
of contentious
question, in terms

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.240
of cultural appropriation, what
is the fine line between being

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.820
an ally and telling
someone else's

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.530
experience from your
perspective to show

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.530
your allieship,
versus potentially

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.805
appropriating that culture?

00:27:15.805 --> 00:27:17.721
SHANTHI SEKARAN: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:27:17.721 --> 00:27:20.830
I did struggle with this
idea of appropriation

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.020
and whether I was
telling someone's story

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.720
when I shouldn't be
telling their story.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.020
So the way I approached
that was, first of all,

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.810
to accept the fact that I
would never truly understand

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.710
Soli, my Mexican character.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:38.890
I can never truly understand
the Latinx experience.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:44.290
I can never truly understand
the undocumented experience.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:47.110
So one thing that I eventually
realized that I had to do

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:50.680
was after all the research,
which was necessary,

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:55.630
I had to figure out how
I personally related

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.060
to Soli, to my character.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:03.740
And I eventually realized
that this was, essentially,

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:06.930
a story about a young
woman who became a mother

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.590
and who wanted certain
things for herself.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.740
And the fact that she
was Latina, the fact

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.840
that she was undocumented--

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.780
these all determine the
trajectory of her story,

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.200
but they were not
the story itself.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.040
So I was able--

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:26.750
I tried to connect
with her in that way.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:32.870
And I just had to realize, I
had to accept that I was never

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.270
going to do it complete
justice, and I just

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:36.740
had to tread
carefully and make her

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.796
as fully fledged as I could.

00:28:38.796 --> 00:28:40.670
SPEAKER 1: Well, as a
former Spanish teacher,

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.120
your pronunciation of all the
names is absolutely beautiful,

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:43.500
so I do want to say that.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:43.600
SHANTHI SEKARAN: Really?

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.795
Oh, good.

00:28:44.795 --> 00:28:46.170
SPEAKER 1: It made
me very happy.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.128
SHANTHI SEKARAN: Great.

00:28:47.128 --> 00:28:49.190
SPEAKER 1: So obviously,
the topic of "Lucky Boy"

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:51.530
is very timely, not only
internally here at Google,

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:54.140
but domestically and
globally, particularly

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.680
in the last few months.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.310
What struggles or
obstacles do you

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:01.190
feel you face as an author
writing about this topic

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.872
today, in 2017?

00:29:02.872 --> 00:29:04.580
SHANTHI SEKARAN:
Struggles as an author--

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.880
there was this looming question
of cultural appropriation.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.590
That's a big issue
for us right now.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:19.430
I did sort of wonder,
initially, if this book was

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:21.770
going to be sort of taken up.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.610
I'm not-- it's not your
classic American novel

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:30.620
about people in Upper
East Side Manhattan.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.660
In fact, the people
who are white,

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.940
they're sort of on the
periphery of this book.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.765
And so I did wonder if that--

00:29:37.765 --> 00:29:40.880
if the fact that I had
this group of brown people

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.420
and this brown woman,
and everyone was brown,

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.330
if that would be sort of
an obstacle to getting it

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:48.680
published.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.596
And at one point, I
said to my agent--

00:29:50.596 --> 00:29:52.970
it wasn't getting published,
it went through two or three

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:54.110
rounds of rejections.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.360
And I said to my agent,
maybe I should just

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.580
make all my Indians white
and see what happens.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.412
And she was like,
absolutely not.

00:30:01.412 --> 00:30:02.745
SPEAKER 1: Uh, amen to her, wow.

00:30:02.745 --> 00:30:03.700
SHANTHI SEKARAN:
She was like, no.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.080
Well, she pointed out to
me that this is not just

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.220
about a Mexican woman.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:12.920
This is a story of immigrants
on American soil in 2000--

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:13.880
whatever it was then--

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.310
2000, the 2000s.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.860
And so that allowed
me to sort of take

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:22.305
a new perspective on what
I was doing, so yeah.

00:30:22.305 --> 00:30:23.180
SPEAKER 1: Wonderful.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.860
So in looking into your
future endeavors, what's next?

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.700
It could be a
specific book, or do

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.530
you think you've found
your area and you

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:33.269
want to continue talking about
the immigrant experience?

00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:35.060
SHANTHI SEKARAN: I kind
of want to do both.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.990
So I'm going to start slowly
working on it on my next book

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.170
as soon as all
this touring ends.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:46.010
And I also feel like, you
know, I've written this book,

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.570
so this is what
I'm grappling with.

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:48.860
I've written this book.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.269
It's about this topic.

00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:53.810
What, am I just going to drop
it now and talk about something

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:54.854
else next?

00:30:54.854 --> 00:30:57.020
Because I feel like now
that I've written this book,

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.520
I want to do something
more with it.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.610
I want to actually
use it in some way

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:04.940
to enact some
beginnings of change

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.996
in something that I care about.

00:31:06.996 --> 00:31:08.120
So hopefully, I'll do that.

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.710
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, and
just out of curiosity,

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:10.940
obviously, you're a writer.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.610
We're all super
excited that this book

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:16.130
is out, nothing but
positive feedback,

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:17.670
at least that I've seen.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.120
But what are some of
your favorite authors?

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.290
What do you like to read?

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.180
Who do you look up
to, who inspires you?

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.721
SHANTHI SEKARAN: My
favorite author--

00:31:24.721 --> 00:31:26.540
so for this book in
particular, I really

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:32.330
looked to "Beloved" by Toni
Morrison because for one thing,

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:35.510
on a technical level, I was
trying to figure out how

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.520
to work with past and present.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.330
And in "Beloved," Toni Morrison
does this beautiful job

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:45.830
with memory, where she passes
seamlessly from the present day

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:51.020
narrative into her character's
days as a slave and her journey

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.510
up north as a slave.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:56.330
And when I was writing
this, I literally

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:57.890
had my little notebook.

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:00.920
It was on the 20th
revision, or whatever.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.250
I had my little notebook, and I
would copy out Toni Morrison's

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:06.620
sentences just to
sort of understand how

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.050
she made those transitions--

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:10.640
so "Beloved" by Toni Morrison.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.170
I really like Zadie Smith.

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.420
She's a British writer.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:19.351
And Anne Enright, her book, "The
Green Road" kind of influenced

00:32:19.351 --> 00:32:19.850
this.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:22.010
I like reading
writers whose voices

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.680
are very different from my own.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.440
It loosens up something
in me, creatively.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.400
SPEAKER 1: Wonderful.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.070
Well, we definitely want to
give the audience an opportunity

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.270
to ask questions.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:34.049
AUDIENCE: I haven't
read your book yet,

00:32:34.049 --> 00:32:35.090
but I look forward to it.

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:39.834
But I hear you telling the
stories of two brown women who

00:32:39.834 --> 00:32:42.500
have had the experience of being
immigrants or second generation

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.185
immigrants in America.

00:32:44.185 --> 00:32:45.560
And then I hear
about your op-ed,

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.180
which talks about "The
Privileged Immigrant,"

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.013
and then obviously, the
flip side of that is

00:32:49.013 --> 00:32:52.134
the unprivileged or
underprivileged immigrant--

00:32:52.134 --> 00:32:54.090
[COUGHS] sorry.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.894
So I was just wondering
what you think--

00:32:56.894 --> 00:32:58.310
why you think those
two narratives

00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:59.768
that sound so
similar at their root

00:32:59.768 --> 00:33:02.100
have developed so
differently in America,

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:06.060
and what we can learn
from deconstructing those?

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.710
SHANTHI SEKARAN: So
the two narratives,

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:12.840
they have evolved very
differently on American soil.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.600
To some extent, it's not
a matter of what country

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:21.870
you come, from it's a
matter of the structures

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:25.240
that you've been able to
put in place for yourself.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.160
So if we talk about my
characters Kavya and Rishi,

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.592
they own this little
house in Berkeley.

00:33:31.592 --> 00:33:34.050
They were able to buy that
house because their parents were

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:36.540
able to help them
buy that house.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:39.730
And I never really go into what
their parents did for a living,

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:43.080
but the assumption
is that their parents

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.220
were similar to my parents.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.970
They came over in the '60s,
'70s, had good stable jobs,

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.670
were able to accrue
some savings.

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:54.240
And then, if you have
someone like Soli,

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:58.480
she sort of kept her
money in her home.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.420
She wasn't able to invest.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.980
And so much of this--

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.950
so much of this just comes
down to the technicalities

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:12.470
of money and land and the
neighborhoods and the schools

00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:14.219
that you're able to
send your children to.

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:15.757
And I guess the choice--

00:34:15.757 --> 00:34:17.340
I guess really, what
it comes down to,

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.190
is the power to choose
where you want to live

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.170
and what you want
to do with your life

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.612
and for your children.

00:34:23.612 --> 00:34:25.320
And I think that that
really has informed

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:28.325
the various trajectories
that we see in the US.

00:34:31.705 --> 00:34:34.080
SPEAKER 1: Just very quickly,
particularly on that point,

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.409
in the op-ed in "The New York
Times," you mentioned that it's

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:40.620
not one immigrant group is
better or stronger or more

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.540
competent than the
other, but rather,

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.110
the opportunities
or the path that

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.050
was already created
for them in this nation

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:47.457
before they come here.

00:34:47.457 --> 00:34:49.790
So I think that distinction
that you made was beautiful.

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:52.440
SHANTHI SEKARAN: Thank you.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.250
AUDIENCE: So you
live in Berkeley,

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.940
and you've written
a book about a topic

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.190
that, in some parts of the
country, kind of like plays

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:02.031
better, is better
accepted than maybe

00:35:02.031 --> 00:35:03.280
in other parts of the country.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:07.160
And I'm curious if you're going
to other parts of the country

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:11.200
and if, in those places,
is this more or less

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.460
of like a political novel?

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.209
Is there some sort of
statement about that

00:35:14.209 --> 00:35:16.330
based on where you are,
who you're even talking

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:17.920
with or talking to about it?

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.586
SHANTHI SEKARAN: Yeah,
so whether or not

00:35:19.586 --> 00:35:21.970
this is a political novel,
that usually comes down

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:23.740
to the individual reader.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:25.630
So people who really
want to engage

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.790
with the political
aspects of this,

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:30.250
they'll talk to me about that.

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:33.270
And some people are just not
very politically engaged,

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:37.210
and so they see it for
the interpersonal drama

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:38.290
of the book.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:41.650
And in terms of traveling to
different parts of the country,

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:43.300
I've been mostly
on the West Coast,

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.710
and then, New York and DC,
but I did go down to Dallas.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:51.100
And I've been waiting for
the person with the red hat

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.470
to stand up and ask
me some questions,

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:54.370
but they haven't yet.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:59.859
I find if--

00:35:59.859 --> 00:36:01.150
I assume that there is dissent.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.080
I assume that there
are going to be

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.850
people around who
don't like what

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:06.392
I'm talking about in this book.

00:36:06.392 --> 00:36:07.850
But they haven't
said anything yet.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:10.100
And I think that,
like a lot of us,

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:13.840
when they don't like something,
they're keeping quiet

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.140
or they're just not
thinking about it.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:16.740
So that's--

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.644
AUDIENCE: How would
you respond to that?

00:36:18.644 --> 00:36:20.920
SHANTHI SEKARAN: How would
I respond to that dissent?

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.795
I'd first want to know
if they read the book.

00:36:22.795 --> 00:36:23.634
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:23.634 --> 00:36:24.300
SPEAKER 1: Fair.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.780
SHANTHI SEKARAN: Because
I feel like if you--

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.670
when you engage
with someone's story

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:31.070
and you really sort of connect
to them as a character,

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.630
you start to see things
in a more complex way

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:34.630
than you would normally.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:40.630
And I guess I would
want to listen

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:45.170
to where they're coming from.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.320
I'm not the sort
of writer who can

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:52.570
get into a political
argument with the reader.

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:58.090
But I could talk to them about
the issues within the book.

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:04.022
And really, I can't pretend
to want to convert people,

00:37:04.022 --> 00:37:05.730
but I want people to
understand that this

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.400
is a more complex
situation than they

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.110
may have initially assumed.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.449
AUDIENCE: I'm curious-- you
mentioned that you're a teacher

00:37:17.449 --> 00:37:19.740
and you're a mother and you
wrote this book, obviously.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.080
I'm just curious how
you structured your time

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.110
and what a day in the
life is like when you're

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:28.020
working on a book like this
that requires so much research

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.835
and time and engagement?

00:37:29.835 --> 00:37:33.930
SHANTHI SEKARAN: Right,
yeah, so it was very slow.

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:35.430
I should say I wrote
most of it when

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.310
I had just one kid, not two.

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:42.270
Because when you have two,
it's like you have 1,000.

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:46.140
So basically, what I would
do is I would drop my kid off

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:46.682
at preschool.

00:37:46.682 --> 00:37:48.390
I was teaching at the
same time, but only

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:52.270
part-time at an
art college at CCA.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:55.410
And so I would drop my
kid off at preschool,

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:57.540
take BART into San Francisco.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.390
I used to go to the Writers'
Grotto in San Francisco

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:02.074
to write a lot.

00:38:02.074 --> 00:38:03.990
So I'd have one or two
days where I would just

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:08.020
spend the day there, and then
be back in Berkeley for the 4:00

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.500
PM pickup at preschool.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.200
And so I had a couple of
days like this per week

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.440
that were just completely
devoted to the book.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.140
And slowly, slowly it builds.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.570
And at a certain point, you
get enough into the book

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:23.530
that you can just write
anywhere at anytime.

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:29.231
You know, you can be standing
on a bus and writing, so yeah.

00:38:29.231 --> 00:38:31.230
AUDIENCE: How long did
the whole thing take you?

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:33.354
SHANTHI SEKARAN: How long
did the whole thing take?

00:38:33.354 --> 00:38:36.030
So it took about 2 and
1/2 years for one draft.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:41.910
And then there was about 3 and
1/2 more years of reworking it

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:43.550
and editing.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:46.380
Yeah, yeah, that was a
lot slower than I thought.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:50.040
I thought I'd like, write it,
and it'd be ready, but no.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.540
AUDIENCE: I haven't
read the book,

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:54.140
but I'm curious, how
do you sit on the title

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.840
when there's these paths
of luck and un-luck,

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.150
depending on the
different journeys

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:02.259
and where their characters are
in their stages of their lives?

00:39:02.259 --> 00:39:03.800
SHANTHI SEKARAN:
Yeah, so the title--

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.750
I never thought of lucky as--

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:08.690
in terms of the
characters' journeys,

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:10.550
but I guess it
does apply to that.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:14.000
So "Lucky Boy"
refers, primarily,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.450
to Ignazio, who's a
little boy born to Soli.

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:23.660
And it has sort of an ironic
side, but also a sincere side.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:28.610
He's sincerely lucky because
he has these two mothers who

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:30.680
love him and want him.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.750
And he's not so
lucky because it's

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:36.140
this love that sort of
pulls apart his destiny.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.000
He doesn't know where
he's going to land,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.144
or we don't know where
he's going to land, really.

00:39:42.144 --> 00:39:43.560
And in terms of
picking the title,

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.005
I think this was maybe
the fifth or sixth title

00:39:46.005 --> 00:39:47.715
that I settled on.

00:39:47.715 --> 00:39:50.090
SPEAKER 1: Can we ask what
some of the other titles were?

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:53.810
SHANTHI SEKARAN: Oh, yeah, so
I think the first one, when

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.060
I didn't really know where
this was going completely,

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.041
was "Our Winning Smiles," which
is from the Belle and Sebastian

00:39:59.041 --> 00:39:59.540
song.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:02.540
I just-- I liked it.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:05.930
And then, there were
some not so great ones.

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:09.200
But one of the other major
ones was "Season of the Beast,"

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.780
because I--

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.940
that image of the
beast comes up a lot,

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.650
but also there's
La Bestia, which

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.620
is the freight train
that migrants ride up

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:19.790
through Mexico.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:22.940
They ride the top of it,
and it's pretty dangerous.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.590
That's in here, as well.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:27.500
And at one point--

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.370
this is bad.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:30.500
So at one point--

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.230
Ignazio's nickname that his
mother gives him is Nacho.

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:36.170
So at one point, it was
"Nacho!"-- exclamation mark.

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:42.490
And then, eventually,
there is this one line

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:45.630
that has the phrase
"Lucky Boy" in the book.

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:48.800
And so eventually, I was like,
oh, OK, I'll just go with that.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.749
And my editor wanted to change
it, and then we decided not to.

00:40:52.749 --> 00:40:54.540
SPEAKER 1: So thank
you so much for coming.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.390
We had a blast.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:56.390
We really appreciate it.

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:57.806
SHANTHI SEKARAN:
Thanks, everyone.

00:40:57.806 --> 00:40:59.440
[APPLAUSE]
