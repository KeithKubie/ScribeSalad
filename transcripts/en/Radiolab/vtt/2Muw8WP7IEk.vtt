00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.370
Hey, I'm Jen [inaudible], I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

2
00:00:03.371 --> 00:00:07.480
Today our topic is limits, limits. How far can you take your,

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.940
your body? We've done that. We've exhausted that thing. So,

4
00:00:10.941 --> 00:00:15.220
so let's go uptown to the limits of the brain to tackle just a piece of that

5
00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:17.920
question. Let's just take a look at memory. Okay. All right, great.

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.230
And we're going to do that by telling a story,

7
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.820
a story that we heard from Jonah Lehrer, you know, frequent guests on the show,

8
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.070
author of the books, Proust was a neuroscientist.

9
00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:30.780
How we decide the story begins in a small, um,

10
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.710
town in the old Soviet Union back in the 1920s and it's about a newspaper

11
00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:39.570
reporter named Mr s, at least that's what we're going to call him. Yes.

12
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.110
So Mr Eslan newspaper reporter,

13
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.070
and one day his boss starts yelling at him because his boss gives out these

14
00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:45.904
assignments,

15
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.290
talks to the whole newsroom and he notices that Mr s never takes notes.

16
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.930
And this drives his boss crazy cause his bosses, you know,

17
00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:56.800
saying all these things they have to report on and Mr Estis never writes them

18
00:00:56.801 --> 00:01:00.340
down. And so his boss calls him into his office and says, are you lazy?

19
00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:03.050
Do you not take this job seriously? And Mr [inaudible] responsible,

20
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.933
I just remember

21
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.993
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

22
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.570
<v 2>and the editor says, come on, and he sort of quizzes him. He says,</v>

23
00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:18.400
what did I assign you yesterday? His boss gives him this quiz and sure enough,

24
00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:21.520
he remembers everything. He remembers everything.

25
00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:23.920
The editors said word for word

26
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.920
and the editors thinking, I don't know what's wrong with this guy. I mean,

27
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:34.330
he's not a great reporter, but he has something queer going on in his head.

28
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.570
So he decided to send him to a famous

29
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.240
<v 0>medical doctor in Moscow. A are Luria who is</v>

30
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.480
Luria Louie Louie of music. Classical figure in,

31
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.730
in your psychology and in psychology in general. And who is this host?

32
00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:54.790
Your name? Oh, that Goldberg. I have a clinical professor at Ted. Well,

33
00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:59.640
you political school Goldberg Knew Laurie o Luhya was my mentor.

34
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:03.050
I've worked with her closely this year. Not only was he a student of Loris,

35
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.080
Luria gave him a present once they see this book,

36
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.220
the book about the original book about this book is one of the great works of

37
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.450
early neuroscience. So we are going to the right guy.

38
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:20.160
You have an autographed copy.

39
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.870
It is a beautiful and almost novelistic description of what happened to Mr s.

40
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.720
The original title was a little book about big Beverly

41
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.450
[inaudible]. Okay, so Jonah, this guy,

42
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:38.790
Mr [inaudible] goes to the psychologist Luria.

43
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.990
Now what does Lauria do with them?

44
00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:43.680
Luria during the book talks about how he wrote random numbers on a blackboard

45
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.320
numbers like one, eight, six, four,

46
00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:50.130
three about 50 numbers and asked Mr [inaudible] to remember them.

47
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.410
Here we are on page 60.

48
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.120
That's what studied the material or the board for about three minutes.

49
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.120
Slow skews. Eyes opened them for a moment. Okay. Done.

50
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.100
And with that, you would really love this series. Precisely. Six,

51
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.023
six.

52
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.200
<v 3>[inaudible] that's like a superpower.</v>

53
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.870
<v 0>Yeah. And this impresses Larry. He says, so he takes it up to the next level.</v>

54
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.080
Then Larry, uh, gives him, you know, this, this,

55
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.610
this incredible assortment of memory tasks and everything from memorize Dante's

56
00:03:25.611 --> 00:03:30.350
inferno, um, to Dr [inaudible] the whole thing. No,

57
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.210
no. Wow. Not the whole thing.

58
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.340
Just the opening stances and men coming [inaudible] nearly provide [inaudible]

59
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.470
use the really weird thing. Mr s does not read Italian months, speak Italian.

60
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.090
He had no idea what he was talking about,

61
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.240
like theory [inaudible] Murray and yet the thing he memorizes,

62
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.630
he gets word perfect. Yeah. And not only that,

63
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.090
he was tested 15 years after.

64
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.530
He'd memorize those stances and he's still got it right. Yeah. Oh Man.

65
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.890
You remembered everything. He had everything.

66
00:04:00.891 --> 00:04:04.040
What did you mean by you mean every fig? Okay. So if he,

67
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.470
suppose he interviewed you 10 years ago,

68
00:04:06.471 --> 00:04:09.020
he would have remembered the color of your sweater,

69
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.110
whether you held him Mike in the left hand or in the right hand.

70
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.170
He would have remembered everything. I mean, everything.

71
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.710
Laurian never talks about a computational limit on Mr s's memory as an

72
00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:24.260
experiment or I soon found myself in the state.

73
00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:29.261
Virgin got utter confusion and they simply had to admit that the capacity of his

74
00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:31.490
baby had low distinct limits.

75
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.550
How can there be no limits?

76
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.250
<v 4>Because I'm thinking about the size of a normal head.</v>

77
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.620
It's like 50 centimeters or something in diameter.

78
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.360
The brain is three pounds. It's a very confined little situation.

79
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.630
How could there be no limits? I wish there was a good answer.

80
00:04:47.631 --> 00:04:52.631
Nobody has any idea why it is he had this infinite capability for recall.

81
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.220
What it does suggest though is that the brain has the capability to store an

82
00:04:58.221 --> 00:05:01.520
incredible amount of stuff. How much stuff though?

83
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.900
How much can you GAM into a human brain? I don't,

84
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.960
I don't think anyone knows. I mean, so let's just stop.

85
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.160
Let's just call it quits. Go ahead and like, no, no, no, and if I forget that,

86
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.460
in fact, let me take you to a competition which investigates that very question.

87
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.570
We're going to change locations from where we are. We just now Russia.

88
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.830
We were in Russia from Russia in 1920s too. Okay.

89
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.190
<v 3>It this London 2009 here we are at the world memory championships,</v>

90
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.500
the worldwide, the world memory championships. Just go with me for a sec. Okay,

91
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.650
so we're in a hotel in central London.

92
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.370
The lobby is crowded with the world's best memorizers. So what was your name?

93
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.150
Get people here from like Oman [inaudible]. I'm Dr Grantee Manchester. Hello,

94
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.360
I'm a meal Hall Netherlands. Yeah, Rick de Young.

95
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.200
Even have a team of Chinese girls in the corner getting a cheer.

96
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.340
And what are we doing here? Well,

97
00:05:56.341 --> 00:05:59.330
the people here a little bit like the guy you were describing, Mr s,

98
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.660
they are walking experiments in brain stuffing

99
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.370
the differences. They're perfectly normal human beings. Just

100
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.510
like take this guy on the veining world memory champion.

101
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.760
I'm 33 years old and I live in Nottingham.

102
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.800
Then can take a string of numbers that is 1400 numbers long, random number,

103
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.590
random numbers, and he can commit it to memory instantly.

104
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.900
He can take a deck of cards and memorize it in 24 seconds.

105
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.870
Wow. Yeah. We've not actually reached, you know,

106
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:36.620
any kind of upper limit of what is possible to memorize yet anybody still

107
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.890
consistently in thing. So here's what we did.

108
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.540
We, we found a guy,

109
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.530
my name's Ronnie White and I am the 2009 USA memory champion.

110
00:06:47.531 --> 00:06:50.350
He's a Navy reservist from Dallas, Texas.

111
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.560
I had to get permission from my unit to come here,

112
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.110
but we followed them around the competition. What's about to happen?

113
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.150
Well the competition's about to start, you know,

114
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.620
they want to be a fun day cause we wanted to know like how do you do it?

115
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.090
How do you take the limits of a normal brain and completely shattered.

116
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.890
So I walked in the room that day wearing my Michael Phelps tee shirt. You know,

117
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.410
it said USA on the front

118
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.110
socks. The, the final minutes before you start an event,

119
00:07:23.111 --> 00:07:26.230
you're sitting in your chair and you're just collecting your thoughts.

120
00:07:26.231 --> 00:07:28.390
I put on my military glasses, I got some,

121
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.680
they look at drew Carey's glasses and I put those on drew money. Hey,

122
00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:35.540
remain calm. You know,

123
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.640
I wore those all throughout my tour in Afghanistan.

124
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.640
If you're going down a road and you're needing to be on the lookout for ideas,

125
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.570
but you're not calm, you're nervous and jittery, you could die.

126
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.940
Then I'll put on some noise canceling headsets. Then I just close my eyes,

127
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.023
sit in my chair.

128
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:02.350
[inaudible] neurons on the ready. They say, yeah.

129
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.750
That moment, 60 people turn over papers

130
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.560
on these pieces of paper or number six, one nothing but numbers, numbers,

131
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:18.290
numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers, forever. What are they doing? Well,

132
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:20.040
they have to memorize them, so they just have to do shit.

133
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.000
All these people staring at pieces of paper. Yeah. Absolute silence.

134
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.670
Heads down. 60 heads down, staring at numbers six, seven but here's the,

135
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.540
here's the interesting thing in their heads. Three, they're not seeing numbers.

136
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.480
Four instead, those numbers are turning into eight of George Bush or spy.

137
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:44.320
Go One. Randy Richardson, he's a friend. Line 45 a rash.

138
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.240
Michael Jordan, Chuck Norris, Donnie Brasco, two Bush.

139
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.480
That was boy George. Joe T, Martha Stewart, George Michael,

140
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.090
Ben Franklin, Chuck Norris, and Indiana Jones,

141
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.030
my friend Ronnie kink. Todd. Uh,

142
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.900
I have a person assigned to every number from zero to 99,

143
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.640
and then I have a verb assigned every person from zero to 99.

144
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.820
And then I have a noun assign to every digit.

145
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:14.850
So you're just taking the person verbs and objects.

146
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:21.020
<v 0>Please hold the cards down and you're putting them all together and they really</v>

147
00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:21.854
don't make sense.

148
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:23.803
<v 4>Well,</v>

149
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.580
<v 3>give me an example of the images I saw.</v>

150
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.170
I saw Albert Einstein riding the roller coaster and do a bunch of fog.

151
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.040
Five, nine, three, seven, eight, seven. That was one of the images. Um,

152
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.870
I saw a fat Albert cartoon character driving a car

153
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.453
<v 4>nine, nine.</v>

154
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:54.170
<v 3>Um, I saw a Victoria's secret model, which was one of my favorite pictures.</v>

155
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.110
I saw Victoria's secret bottles shooting a gun,

156
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:01.610
uh, stuff like that.

157
00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:08.740
<v 4>So there seems to be something about turning data into pictures that makes that</v>

158
00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:12.760
data edge, it becomes easier to hold on to. Do you have any idea why?

159
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.660
Do I have any idea of why? You know, but Jonah,

160
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.510
<v 0>I dunno, I would just be purely speculating here,</v>

161
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:23.560
but the visual cortex has been hugely enhanced in human evolution. It's the,

162
00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:27.640
you know, the rear half of our brain because we know that memories, you know,

163
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.900
there is no memory center of the brain. It's distributed in our sensory areas.

164
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.710
It might make a little sense that given that we've got this huge chunk of visual

165
00:10:35.711 --> 00:10:38.800
Cortex, that it's easier to store memory there.

166
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:43.300
<v 4>Okay, so let me ask you, how did Ron's visual cortex do in the big content?</v>

167
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.080
Well, Ron, Ron didn't actually do so well.

168
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.050
He did it [inaudible] he was trying to memorize these 12 decks of cards and he

169
00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:55.530
had constructed this whole, like a stack of pictures. But he,

170
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.900
he did them in the wrong order and he screwed it up. He lost,

171
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.810
he lost really badly. Unfortunately, I was shocked. I mean,

172
00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:05.811
I was just shocked that that knocked me out of any passion,

173
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.660
you know, a little bit, by the way, who didn't lose it? Remember Mr [inaudible],

174
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.120
the guy we started this conversation with? Yeah, sure. This is interesting.

175
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.560
It turns out that Mr s also had little pictures and little characters running

176
00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:22.020
around in his mind. But unlike Ron,

177
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.110
he never asked for the picture.

178
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:27.970
<v 0>No, he couldn't. You know, even when he wanted not to do it,</v>

179
00:11:27.971 --> 00:11:29.790
he couldn't help but do it anyway.

180
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
What he was born that way he had this tremendous memory without any effort,

181
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.170
without any mnemonic techniques. Phishing the point.

182
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.840
You mean his mind made the pictures automatically? Yeah.

183
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:45.700
Mr S had a condition called synesthesia where your senses get kind of tangled

184
00:11:45.701 --> 00:11:50.680
up. So he heard voices in terms of colors, right? Colors of voices,

185
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.640
textures, smells of words. His numbers weren't just numbers.

186
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.950
Sometimes he imagines walking through a crowded Moscow street and the numbers

187
00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:01.450
are scattered along the way.

188
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.270
And so he describes how I'm walking down the street. There's the number one.

189
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:08.860
This is a proud, well-built that then I make a right turn onto the side street.

190
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.220
There is the number two years of high-spirited do over.

191
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.220
I then I make a left turn. There's a number three, a gloomy person. Why?

192
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.230
I don't know. Nobody knows.

193
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.240
Nobody knows exactly what accounts for the individual associations of

194
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:23.830
synesthesia that they just exist,

195
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:28.510
but they're this extra scaffold for mr s's memory to cling to. Wow.

196
00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:32.740
So he's like Ron, except he's using all his senses to remember numbers. Yeah,

197
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.690
exactly. So I'm getting back to the plot. What did, uh,

198
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:41.110
what did he do with his talent? He became a traveling circus freak basically.

199
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:46.230
Yeah. [inaudible] let me just remember the fish. Eliminate the nimbleness.

200
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.060
Yeah. He gave up journalism to perform for crowds.

201
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:54.120
<v 2>Just imagine it when something like this. She had told me, please</v>

202
00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:01.720
see Mr Memory. Thank you. A lot of shitty shit.

203
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.810
Imagine this in a big crowd. He walks onto the stage,

204
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.990
he gives them an invitation. He asked them to shout random members.

205
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.230
25 [inaudible] seven

206
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.110
541 5,203 then after a little while, the crowd, yeah,

207
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.580
<v 0>quiets down. Eh,</v>

208
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:25.050
Mr s would close his eyes and step forward and he would remember them all.

209
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.380
<v 2>This was his job.</v>

210
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.840
<v 0>Yeah. And it wasn't just numbers by the way. He was thrown weird phrases.</v>

211
00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.480
<v 2>Nonsense sounds, nouns, verbs.</v>

212
00:13:38.481 --> 00:13:42.500
And sometimes you do four shows a day and the more he did,

213
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.460
the more obvious it became with this business,

214
00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.820
you'd had a downside.

215
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:52.110
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

216
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.910
<v 0>here's what we're going to finally reach.</v>

217
00:13:53.911 --> 00:13:57.180
Maybe the limits question that we're really examining in this program.

218
00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.230
You would hear all these nonsense phrases being thrown at him and they would

219
00:14:01.231 --> 00:14:03.830
build up in his mind, and it's important to note.

220
00:14:03.831 --> 00:14:06.660
This was incredibly frustrating for Mr [inaudible].

221
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:10.200
He had a constant stream of memories pouring into his brain.

222
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.130
He couldn't get any of it out, and on top of that, as they piled up,

223
00:14:14.131 --> 00:14:17.070
the memories began to kind of Mush together.

224
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.190
One would trigger another and then another and then another.

225
00:14:20.191 --> 00:14:24.990
It was the suffocating web of association. The moment he encountered everything,

226
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:30.470
everything debug the both the related in his past to that something was

227
00:14:31.081 --> 00:14:34.440
immediately evoked in his bedroom. For example, let's suppose

228
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:39.060
<v 2>a man in the audience stands up and you shout out the word</v>

229
00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.330
<v 0>no. For a split second, Mr s sees a dog,</v>

230
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.930
which suggests another dog and then another dog,

231
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.530
and then every dog he ever saw

232
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.870
<v 2>and the main suggestions, not just that man,</v>

233
00:14:56.871 --> 00:14:58.580
but the other man.

234
00:14:58.581 --> 00:15:02.990
The minute he knew all the other competitions were a similar look mean and stood

235
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:04.340
up in, chatted something similar.

236
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.720
He was barrage. He was brilliant was all kinds of memories.

237
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.100
Totally unrelated.

238
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.630
Everything layer one layer on top of of the other. Horrible. I agree.

239
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.950
<v 0>Oh that would be a bloody nightmare.</v>

240
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.160
The mind isn't just interested in storing information.

241
00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:29.860
It really wants to be able to get meaning out of that information,

242
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.300
out of those memories.

243
00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.590
And that actually seems to be turned off to be inhibited by remembering too much

244
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.560
<v 6>[inaudible].</v>

245
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.190
<v 3>In other words, there really is a limit in our heads.</v>

246
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.600
It's a different kind of limit,

247
00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:48.860
really not the limitless ability to remember one number after another,

248
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:50.960
but a precious balance in your head.

249
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:57.080
If you remember too much you will make no sense of the world.

250
00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:58.251
It's weird.

251
00:15:58.251 --> 00:16:02.630
I've never actually thought of making sense of the world as being an active

252
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.590
negotiation. Yeah. Do you know what I mean?

253
00:16:04.591 --> 00:16:07.640
It's very much that they kind of make sense because if you think about like

254
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.290
living here in New York City,

255
00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.820
all the people you bump into,

256
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.310
if you remembered every freaking one you would have fun.

257
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.270
Like you wouldn't be able to have a relationship with your wife or your husband,

258
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.500
your child. Cause they just be lost in this thick crowd and your head

259
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.660
just like came out somehow. That's the balance.

260
00:16:32.661 --> 00:16:35.960
The act for getting is crucial to create

261
00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:40.310
<v 0>preciousness. Although I do wish I had a better memory.</v>

262
00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:41.960
That's your name again.
