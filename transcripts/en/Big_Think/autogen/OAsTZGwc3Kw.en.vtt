what makes you you you know what's one
of the things about you that can't be

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940

of the things about you that can't be
changed no matter how you perform in

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829
changed no matter how you perform in
 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.180
changed no matter how you perform in
this negotiation or on this math test so

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190
this negotiation or on this math test so
 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.029
this negotiation or on this math test so
it comes from knowing who you are

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039
it comes from knowing who you are
 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.169
it comes from knowing who you are
accepting who you are you know believing

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179
accepting who you are you know believing
 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.229
accepting who you are you know believing
your story and you know then being able

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239
your story and you know then being able
 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.439
your story and you know then being able
to access those things and sometimes

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449
to access those things and sometimes
 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.630
to access those things and sometimes
people have all of that but they can't

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640
people have all of that but they can't
 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.700
people have all of that but they can't
access it so when they when they get

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710
access it so when they when they get
 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.890
access it so when they when they get
into that stressful situation they go

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900
into that stressful situation they go
 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.810
into that stressful situation they go
into fight or flight mode and they

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820
into fight or flight mode and they
 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.540
into fight or flight mode and they
basically shut down and a wall comes up

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550
basically shut down and a wall comes up
 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.420
basically shut down and a wall comes up
and now they can't access the very tools

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430
and now they can't access the very tools
 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.120
and now they can't access the very tools
that they actually possess to do well in

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130
that they actually possess to do well in
 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.340
that they actually possess to do well in
that situation so they can't be present

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350
that situation so they can't be present
 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.740
that situation so they can't be present
it's just not possible everyone has

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750
it's just not possible everyone has
 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.660
it's just not possible everyone has
these biggest challenges and they are

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670
these biggest challenges and they are
 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.820
these biggest challenges and they are
situations that we approach with a sense

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830
situations that we approach with a sense
 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.940
situations that we approach with a sense
of dread that we execute with anxiety

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950
of dread that we execute with anxiety
 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.410
of dread that we execute with anxiety
and distraction we're thinking about

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420
and distraction we're thinking about
 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.940
and distraction we're thinking about
what they might be thinking of us what

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950
what they might be thinking of us what
 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.110
what they might be thinking of us what
we should have said two minutes ago

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120
we should have said two minutes ago
 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.670
we should have said two minutes ago
what's going to happen in the future and

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680
what's going to happen in the future and
 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.440
what's going to happen in the future and
then we leave them with a sense of

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450
then we leave them with a sense of
 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.270
then we leave them with a sense of
regret feeling that we weren't seeing

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280
regret feeling that we weren't seeing
 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.000
regret feeling that we weren't seeing
now what you know these big challenges

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010
now what you know these big challenges
 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.730
now what you know these big challenges
vary dramatically across people so for

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740
vary dramatically across people so for
 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.680
vary dramatically across people so for
some people it might be a job interview

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690
some people it might be a job interview
 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.840
some people it might be a job interview
for a lot of people it's a job interview

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850
for a lot of people it's a job interview
 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.940
for a lot of people it's a job interview
for some people it might be relationship

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950
for some people it might be relationship
 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.340
for some people it might be relationship
conflict at home for other people it

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350
conflict at home for other people it
 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.540
conflict at home for other people it
might be going to see the doctor and you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550
might be going to see the doctor and you
 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.980
might be going to see the doctor and you
know making sure that you're getting all

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990
know making sure that you're getting all
 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.920
know making sure that you're getting all
the information you need so it varies

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930
the information you need so it varies
 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.020
the information you need so it varies
dramatically but I think that there are

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030
dramatically but I think that there are
 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.800
dramatically but I think that there are
sort of two key elements one is that it

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810
sort of two key elements one is that it
 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.890
sort of two key elements one is that it
feels very high-stakes so it feels like

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900
feels very high-stakes so it feels like
 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.080
feels very high-stakes so it feels like
whatever happens in that situation is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090
whatever happens in that situation is
 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.240
whatever happens in that situation is
going to dramatically affect your life

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250
going to dramatically affect your life
 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.150
going to dramatically affect your life
and the other is that there's some

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160
and the other is that there's some
 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
and the other is that there's some
element of social judgement so somebody

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170
element of social judgement so somebody
 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.309
element of social judgement so somebody
is judging you

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319
is judging you
 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.929
is judging you
on a dimension that really matters to

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939
on a dimension that really matters to
 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.089
on a dimension that really matters to
you so you know are you a good person

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099
you so you know are you a good person
 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.119
you so you know are you a good person
are you a smart person are you a healthy

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129
are you a smart person are you a healthy
 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.369
are you a smart person are you a healthy
person you know so there's it's the

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379
person you know so there's it's the
 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.020
person you know so there's it's the
stakes are high and there's social

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030
stakes are high and there's social
 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.360
stakes are high and there's social
judgement now what happens when you put

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370
judgement now what happens when you put
 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.520
judgement now what happens when you put
these things together is that people

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530
these things together is that people
 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.539
these things together is that people
feel as if they are in a really

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549
feel as if they are in a really
 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.759
feel as if they are in a really
threatening situation and so their

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769
threatening situation and so their
 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.429
threatening situation and so their
nervous system sort of goes into this

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439
nervous system sort of goes into this
 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.379
nervous system sort of goes into this
fight-or-flight mode which might be

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:44.389
fight-or-flight mode which might be
 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.059
fight-or-flight mode which might be
adaptive if you're being chased by a

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069
adaptive if you're being chased by a
 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.670
adaptive if you're being chased by a
tiger but you're not being chased by a

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680
tiger but you're not being chased by a
 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.710
tiger but you're not being chased by a
tiger in a job interview you're just in

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720
tiger in a job interview you're just in
 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.449
tiger in a job interview you're just in
a job interview and you're either going

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459
a job interview and you're either going
 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.800
a job interview and you're either going
to get the job or you're not going to

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810
to get the job or you're not going to
 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.229
to get the job or you're not going to
get the job that's it it's not adaptive

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239
get the job that's it it's not adaptive
 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.899
get the job that's it it's not adaptive
in the situations in which you see it

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909
in the situations in which you see it
 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.710
in the situations in which you see it
happen in today's world so I kind of

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720
happen in today's world so I kind of
 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.659
happen in today's world so I kind of
think that it's a it's it's sort of

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:04.669
think that it's a it's it's sort of
 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.140
think that it's a it's it's sort of
evolution not catching up with with what

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150
evolution not catching up with with what
 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.490
evolution not catching up with with what
the real challenges are that we're

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500
the real challenges are that we're
 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.250
the real challenges are that we're
dealing with today the most important

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260
dealing with today the most important
 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.929
dealing with today the most important
thing I think is to know what are your

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939
thing I think is to know what are your
 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.259
thing I think is to know what are your
biggest challenges now you probably can

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269
biggest challenges now you probably can
 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.670
biggest challenges now you probably can
come up with some off the top of your

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680
come up with some off the top of your
 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.440
come up with some off the top of your
head but there might be some that you're

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450
head but there might be some that you're
 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.719
head but there might be some that you're
not even really aware of until you're in

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:22.729
not even really aware of until you're in
 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:25.300
not even really aware of until you're in
them so I think one way to get at that

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310
them so I think one way to get at that
 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.930
them so I think one way to get at that
is to really pay attention to your body

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940
is to really pay attention to your body
 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.270
is to really pay attention to your body
what are the what's happening in the

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280
what are the what's happening in the
 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.640
what are the what's happening in the
moments when you tend to slouch and wrap

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650
moments when you tend to slouch and wrap
 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.890
moments when you tend to slouch and wrap
yourself up what's happening when you

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900
yourself up what's happening when you
 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.050
yourself up what's happening when you
start to breathe shallowly and quickly

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060
start to breathe shallowly and quickly
 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.390
start to breathe shallowly and quickly
what's happening when you start to sweat

never do that although we've all
 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:31.930
never do that although we've all
probably been instant

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940
probably been instant
 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.610
probably been instant
where we've had to try to sell something

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620

cues that investors really look for when
 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.490
cues that investors really look for when
they're looking at pitches you know if

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500
they're looking at pitches you know if
 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.620

challenged it works in that moment but
 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.210
challenged it works in that moment but
it's not a sustainable strategy and if

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220
it's not a sustainable strategy and if
 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.150

you if you communicate arrogance and you

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160
you if you communicate arrogance and you
 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.980

leave that situation the people who you

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990
leave that situation the people who you
 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.270
leave that situation the people who you
talk to you probably aren't going to

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280

weren't challenged in that moment but
 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.190
weren't challenged in that moment but
you also didn't get the desired outcome

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200
you also didn't get the desired outcome
 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.850
