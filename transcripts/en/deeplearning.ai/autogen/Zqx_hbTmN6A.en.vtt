our n ends like this and what we really

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259
our n ends like this and what we really
 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.010
our n ends like this and what we really
do is take an audio clip maybe compute

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
do is take an audio clip maybe compute
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.080
do is take an audio clip maybe compute
spectrogram features and that generates

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
spectrogram features and that generates
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.289
spectrogram features and that generates

x3 that you pass through an RNN and so

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
x3 that you pass through an RNN and so
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.499
x3 that you pass through an RNN and so
all that remains to be done is to define

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
all that remains to be done is to define
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.319
all that remains to be done is to define
the target labels Y so if this point in

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
the target labels Y so if this point in
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.139
the target labels Y so if this point in
the audio clip is when someone just

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
the audio clip is when someone just
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.630
the audio clip is when someone just
finished saying the trigger word such as

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640
finished saying the trigger word such as
 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.179
finished saying the trigger word such as
a lecture or seralini ha or history or

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
a lecture or seralini ha or history or
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.609

okay Google then in the training sets

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619
okay Google then in the training sets
 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.069
okay Google then in the training sets
you can set the target labels to be zero

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079
you can set the target labels to be zero
 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.559
you can set the target labels to be zero
for everything before that point and

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
for everything before that point and
 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.270
for everything before that point and
right after that to set the target label

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280
right after that to set the target label
 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.140
right after that to set the target label
and then if a little bit later on you

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150
and then if a little bit later on you
 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.910
and then if a little bit later on you
know the trigger word was set again and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920
know the trigger word was set again and
 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.930
know the trigger word was set again and
the trigger what was said at this point

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940
the trigger what was said at this point
 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.059
the trigger what was said at this point
then you can again set the target label

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069
then you can again set the target label
 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.280
then you can again set the target label
to be one right after that now this type

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290
to be one right after that now this type
 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.759
to be one right after that now this type
of labeling scheme for an RNN you know

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769
of labeling scheme for an RNN you know
 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.650
of labeling scheme for an RNN you know
could work actually this won't actually

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660
could work actually this won't actually
 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.949
could work actually this won't actually
work reasonably well one slight

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959
work reasonably well one slight
 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.960
work reasonably well one slight
disadvantage of this is it creates a

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970
disadvantage of this is it creates a
 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.270
disadvantage of this is it creates a
very imbalanced training set to have a

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280
very imbalanced training set to have a
 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.240
very imbalanced training set to have a
lot more zeros than once so one other

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250
lot more zeros than once so one other
 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.339
lot more zeros than once so one other
thing you could do that's it's getting a

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349
thing you could do that's it's getting a
 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.100
thing you could do that's it's getting a
little bit of a hack but could make them

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110
little bit of a hack but could make them
 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.660
little bit of a hack but could make them
although a little bit easy to train is

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670
although a little bit easy to train is
 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.420
although a little bit easy to train is
instead of setting only a single time

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430
instead of setting only a single time
 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.580
instead of setting only a single time
step to output one you can actually make

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590
step to output one you can actually make
 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.610
step to output one you can actually make
it output a few ones for several times

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620
it output a few ones for several times
 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.470
it output a few ones for several times
over a fixed period of time before

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480
over a fixed period of time before
 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.819
over a fixed period of time before
reverting back to zero so and that's

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829
 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.660
slightly evens out the ratio of ones to

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670
slightly evens out the ratio of ones to
 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.479
slightly evens out the ratio of ones to
zeros but this is a little bit of a hack

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489
zeros but this is a little bit of a hack
 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.000
zeros but this is a little bit of a hack
but if this is when in the audio clipper

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010
but if this is when in the audio clipper
 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.250
but if this is when in the audio clipper
trigger where the set then right after

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260
trigger where the set then right after
 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.349
trigger where the set then right after
that you can set the target label to 1

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359
that you can set the target label to 1
 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.360
that you can set the target label to 1
and if this is the trigger where it said

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370
and if this is the trigger where it said
 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.280
and if this is the trigger where it said
again then right after that is when you

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290
again then right after that is when you
 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.000
again then right after that is when you
want the RNN to output 1 so you get to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010
want the RNN to output 1 so you get to
 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.680
want the RNN to output 1 so you get to
play more of this as well in the

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690
play more of this as well in the
 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.430
play more of this as well in the
programming exercise but I think you

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440
programming exercise but I think you
 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.110
programming exercise but I think you
should feel quite proud of yourself that

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120
should feel quite proud of yourself that
 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.759
should feel quite proud of yourself that
you've learned enough about the learning

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769
you've learned enough about the learning
 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.949
you've learned enough about the learning
that it just takes one picture in one

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959
that it just takes one picture in one
 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.229
that it just takes one picture in one
slide to this to describe something

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239
slide to this to describe something
 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.789
slide to this to describe something
that's complicated to this trigger word

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799
that's complicated to this trigger word
 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.390
that's complicated to this trigger word
detection and based on this I hope you'd

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400
detection and based on this I hope you'd
 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.039
detection and based on this I hope you'd
be able to implement something that

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049
be able to implement something that
 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.229
be able to implement something that
works and allows you to detect trigger

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239
works and allows you to detect trigger
 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.440
works and allows you to detect trigger
words when you see more of this in the

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450
words when you see more of this in the
 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.890
words when you see more of this in the
program exercise so that's it for

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900
