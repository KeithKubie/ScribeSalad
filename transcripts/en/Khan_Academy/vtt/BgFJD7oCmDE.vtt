00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.980
A strong cipher is one which
disguises your fingerprint.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.814
To make a lighter
fingerprint is to flatten

00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:13.480
this distribution of
letter frequencies.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.480
By the mid-15th
century, we had advanced

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.320
to polyalphabetic ciphers
to accomplish this.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.970
Imagine Alice and Bob
shared a secret shift word.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.690
First, Alice converts
the word into numbers

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.140
according to the letter
position in the alphabet.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.750
Next, this sequence of numbers
is repeated along the message.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.050
Then each letter
in the message is

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.140
encrypted by shifting according
to the number below it.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.770
Now she is using multiple
shifts instead of a single shift

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.930
across the message, as
Caesar had done before.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.380
Then the encrypted message
is sent openly to Bob.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.480
Bob decrypts the message
by subtracting the shifts

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.800
according to the secret
word he also has a copy of.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.900
Now imagine a code breaker, Eve,
intercepts a series of messages

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.500
and calculates the
letter frequencies.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.230
She will find a flatter
distribution, or a lighter

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.480
fingerprint.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.470
So how could she break this?

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.010
Remember, code breakers
look for information leak,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.360
the same as finding a
partial fingerprint.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.210
Any time there is a differential
in letter frequencies,

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.490
a leak of information occurs.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.059
This difference is
caused by repetition

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:39.100
in the encrypted message.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.910
In this case, Alice's cipher
contains a repeating code word.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.900
To break the encryption,
Even would first

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.330
need to determine the
length of this shift

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.525
word used, not the word itself.

00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:57.650
She will need to go through
and check the frequency

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.540
distribution of
different intervals.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.400
When she checks the
frequency distribution

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.350
of every fifth letter, the
fingerprint will reveal itself.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.990
The problem now is to
break five Cesar Ciphers

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.620
in a repeating sequence.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.750
Individually this is a trivial
task, as we have seen before.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.520
The added strength
of this cipher

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.320
is the time taken to determine
the length of the shift

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.790
word used.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.342
The longer the shift word,
the stronger the cipher.
