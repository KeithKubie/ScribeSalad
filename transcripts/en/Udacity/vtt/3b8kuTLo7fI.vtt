00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's change it up a little bit: I'm going to delete this closing tag,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and I'd like you to tell me what happens

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
when we don't have the closing tag.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In our previous example, we had an opening tag

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and I left off the closing tag.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What happens when we forget to close that tag?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Nothing is italicized,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the browser crashes.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Everything after that opening tag is italicized

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
or--I don't know--

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.061
your guess is as good as mine.
