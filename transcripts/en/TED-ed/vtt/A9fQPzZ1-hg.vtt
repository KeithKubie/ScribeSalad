00:00:07.237 --> 00:00:10.918
In the early hours of August 13, 1961,

00:00:10.918 --> 00:00:14.817
East German construction workers flanked
by soldiers and police

00:00:14.817 --> 00:00:19.717
began tearing up streets and erecting
barriers throughout the city of Berlin

00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:21.558
and its surroundings.

00:00:21.558 --> 00:00:25.677
This night marked the beginning of one
of history's most infamous dividing lines,

00:00:25.677 --> 00:00:27.807
the Berlin Wall.

00:00:27.807 --> 00:00:30.580
Construction on the wall continued
for the next decade

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.058
as it cut through neighborhoods,

00:00:32.058 --> 00:00:33.582
separated families,

00:00:33.582 --> 00:00:36.898
and divided not just Germany,
but the world.

00:00:36.898 --> 00:00:39.019
To understand how we got to this point,

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.368
we have to go back to World War II.

00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:43.037
America, Britain, and France

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:47.449
joined forces with the Soviet Union
against the Axis Powers.

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.028
After they defeated Nazi Germany,

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:52.739
each of the victorious nations occupied
part of the country.

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.010
The division was meant to be temporary,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.850
but the former allies found 
themselves at odds

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.550
over their visions for post-war Europe.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.248
While Western powers promoted
liberal market economies,

00:01:03.248 --> 00:01:07.510
the Soviet Union sought to surround itself
with obedient Communist nations,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.279
including a weakened Germany.

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:11.998
As their relations deteriorated,

00:01:11.998 --> 00:01:15.300
the Federal Republic of Germany
was formed in the West

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.312
while the Soviets established the
German Democratic Republic in the East.

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:23.850
The Soviet satellite countries restricted
Western trade and movement,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.313
so a virtually impassable border formed.

00:01:27.313 --> 00:01:29.869
It became known as the Iron Curtain.

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.564
In the former German capital of Berlin,
things were particularly complicated.

00:01:34.564 --> 00:01:38.641
Although the city lay fully within
the East German territory of the GDR,

00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:42.921
the post-war agreement gave the allies
joint administration.

00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:46.722
So America, Britain, and France created
a Democratic enclave

00:01:46.722 --> 00:01:49.231
in Berlin's western districts.

00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:52.593
While East Germans were officially banned
from leaving the country,

00:01:52.593 --> 00:01:55.704
in Berlin, it was simply 
a matter of walking,

00:01:55.704 --> 00:01:57.963
or riding a subway, streetcar or bus,

00:01:57.963 --> 00:01:59.482
to the Western half,

00:01:59.482 --> 00:02:02.632
then traveling on to West Germany
or beyond.

00:02:02.632 --> 00:02:06.632
This open border posed a problem
for the East German leadership.

00:02:06.632 --> 00:02:10.663
They had staked a claim to represent
the Communist resistance against Hitler

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:14.762
and portrayed Western Germany as
a continuation of the Nazi regime.

00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:18.873
While the U.S. and its allies poured
money into West Germany's reconstruction,

00:02:18.873 --> 00:02:23.493
the Soviet Union extracted resources
from the East as war reparations,

00:02:23.493 --> 00:02:27.412
making its planned economy 
even less competitive.

00:02:27.412 --> 00:02:31.132
Life in East Germany passed under
the watchful eye of the Stasi,

00:02:31.132 --> 00:02:35.283
the secret police whose wiretaps 
and informants monitored citizens

00:02:35.283 --> 00:02:37.874
for any hint of disloyalty.

00:02:37.874 --> 00:02:40.723
While there was free health care
and education in the East,

00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:42.844
the West boasted higher salaries,

00:02:42.844 --> 00:02:44.522
more consumer goods,

00:02:44.522 --> 00:02:46.654
and greater personal freedom.

00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:52.664
By 1961, about 3.5 million people,
nearly 20% of the East German population,

00:02:52.664 --> 00:02:56.315
had left, 
including many young professionals.

00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:57.724
To prevent further losses,

00:02:57.724 --> 00:03:02.924
East Germany decided to close the border,
and that's where the Berlin Wall came in.

00:03:02.924 --> 00:03:05.434
Extending for 43 kilometers
through Berlin,

00:03:05.434 --> 00:03:08.124
and a further 112 through East Germany,

00:03:08.124 --> 00:03:12.095
the initial barrier consisted
of barbed wire and mesh fencing.

00:03:12.095 --> 00:03:14.916
Some Berliners escaped by
jumping over the wire

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:16.715
or leaving from windows,

00:03:16.715 --> 00:03:20.065
but as the wall expanded,
this became more difficult.

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:27.005
By 1965, 106 kilometers of 3.6-meter-high
concrete barricades had been added

00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:30.505
topped with a smooth 
pipe to prevent climbing.

00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:34.175
Over the coming years, the barrier
was strengthened with spike strips,

00:03:34.175 --> 00:03:35.197
guard dogs,

00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:36.866
and even landmines,

00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:40.706
along with 302 watchtowers
and 20 bunkers.

00:03:40.706 --> 00:03:46.176
A parallel fence in the rear set off
a 100-meter area called the death strip.

00:03:46.176 --> 00:03:50.237
There, all buildings were demolished
and the ground covered with sand

00:03:50.237 --> 00:03:53.797
to provide a clear line of sight
for the hundreds of guards

00:03:53.797 --> 00:03:57.126
ordered to shoot anyone 
attempting to cross.

00:03:57.126 --> 00:04:03.187
Nevertheless, nearly 5,000 people
in total managed to flee East Germany

00:04:03.187 --> 00:04:06.507
between 1961 and 1989.

00:04:06.507 --> 00:04:10.187
Some were diplomats or athletes
who defected while abroad,

00:04:10.187 --> 00:04:13.367
but others were ordinary citizens who
dug tunnels,

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:15.048
swam across canals,

00:04:15.048 --> 00:04:16.877
flew hot air balloons,

00:04:16.877 --> 00:04:21.168
or even crashed a stolen tank
through the wall.

00:04:21.168 --> 00:04:22.488
Yet the risk was great.

00:04:22.488 --> 00:04:26.248
Over 138 people died
while attempting escape.

00:04:26.248 --> 00:04:30.958
Some shot in full view of West Germans
powerless to help them.

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:35.920
The wall stabilized East Germany's economy
by preventing its work force from leaving,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.010
but tarnished its reputation,

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.947
becoming a global symbol 
of Communist repression.

00:04:41.947 --> 00:04:44.088
As part of reconciliation with the East,

00:04:44.088 --> 00:04:49.219
the Basic Treaty of 1972 recognized
East Germany pragmatically

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:53.808
while West Germany retained its hope
for eventual reunification.

00:04:53.808 --> 00:04:56.979
Although the Eastern regime
gradually allowed family visits,

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.583
it tried to discourage people
from exercising these rights

00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:04.611
with an arduous bureaucratic process
and high fees.

00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:08.060
Nonetheless, it was still overwhelmed
by applications.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.790
By the end of the 1980's,

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.740
the liberalization of 
other Eastern Bloc regimes

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.481
caused mass demonstrations
for free travel and demands for democracy.

00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:20.080
On the evening of November 9, 1989,

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.450
East Germany tried to defuse tension
by making travel permits easier to obtain.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.501
But the announcement brought thousands
of East Berliners

00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:31.200
to the border crossing points in the wall,

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.241
forcing the surprised guards to open
the gates immediately.

00:05:35.241 --> 00:05:37.692
Rejoicing crowds poured into West Berlin

00:05:37.692 --> 00:05:41.361
as people from both sides danced 
atop the wall.

00:05:41.361 --> 00:05:45.372
And others began to demolish it 
with whatever tools they could find.

00:05:45.372 --> 00:05:48.231
Although the border guards initially
tried to maintain order,

00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:52.972
it was soon clear that the years
of division were at an end.

00:05:52.972 --> 00:05:58.332
After four decades, Germany was
officially reunified in October 1990.

00:05:58.332 --> 00:06:01.422
And the Soviet Union fell soon after.

00:06:01.422 --> 00:06:04.273
Today, parts of the wall still 
stand as a reminder

00:06:04.273 --> 00:06:07.353
that any barriers we put up 
to impede freedom,

00:06:07.353 --> 00:06:09.472
we can also break down.
