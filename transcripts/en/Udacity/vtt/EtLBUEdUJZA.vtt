00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.692
If we insert a value of 7 for x in our equation, we end up with a value of 5 for

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:09.390
y. This is perfectly in light of what we would expect, considering we have a

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.408
0.57 on our parabola that we're looking at. However, let's think about what this

00:00:14.408 --> 00:00:19.017
means. We just said that the smallest value we could get for the quantity x

00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:23.813
minus 7 squared was zero. We got that by plugging in 7 for x. We're finding a y

00:00:23.813 --> 00:00:28.104
value here based on an x value. So the x value that we pick minimizes an

00:00:28.104 --> 00:00:32.722
expression that's helping to determine the y value. And the y value is going to

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:36.579
be as small as it can be. Which, as we can see, is true of the point that we

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.280
just graphed, since it's the vertex of this upward facing parabola.
