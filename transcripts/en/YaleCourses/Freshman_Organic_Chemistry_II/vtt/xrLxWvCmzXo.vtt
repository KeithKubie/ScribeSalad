1
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.180
We've been talking about,
uh,
oxidation and reduction.

2
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.480
And today we're going to talk about a very special kind of oxidation by,
uh,

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.540
Iota Casad,
a pariah date.
That is to say,
uh,

4
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.600
uh,
variety cleavage,
the carbon wheel with an alcohol.
Then let's try that.

5
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.800
Uh,
carbon deal with two alcohol molecules,
but the chromium,

6
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:29.090
which is double bonded to three oxygens and don't think about the chromium just

7
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.240
for the terms of the analog.
Just think of as thinking,

8
00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:35.960
I suppose that was a carbonyl group instead of Idaho Bondos suppose it was c

9
00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:38.600
double bond o what reaction do you get?
Yeah,

10
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.700
<v 1>yeah.
Pardon me.</v>

11
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.820
[inaudible] you could imagine.
Yes.

12
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.960
<v 0>Effication of an acid with an ester.
But I said not suppose it's not it.</v>

13
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.080
Suppose that we're a carbonyl group.
C double bond o no,
h on the group up at top.

14
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.550
What reaction do you get between a ketone yet?
Matt Aquis

15
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.390
<v 1>towel.
Right.
So you get a reaction.
It's just like that.</v>

16
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.070
<v 0>Tell forums.
Right.
And now we have a thing that's a little bit like ozone.</v>

17
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.683
Okay.

18
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.550
Because this sort of sort of key towel can unzip.
Right?

19
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:21.240
That's what reminds you a little bit of ozone,
that kind of thing.
Okay.

20
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.480
So it can come apart that way.
Right?

21
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.450
And notice that's what what's happened is that the dial has become to carbon

22
00:01:29.451 --> 00:01:31.710
eels.
And of course that's an oxidation.

23
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.100
The eidon started an oxidation state seven,
right?

24
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:39.060
Seven bonds to oxygen and it ended in five,
right?

25
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:43.680
So the I had and has reduced and at the same time the carbon is oxidized.

26
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.240
It's plus one here and it's plus two over here,

27
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.980
right?
And two of them get oxidized.
Two carbons get oxidized.
Okay.

28
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:57.981
Now this might remind you of have this reaction where you get to carbon IOLs.

29
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:02.280
And what uh,
what reaction is that?
What reagent we'll do that.

30
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.260
<v 1>That's ozone.
Alright.
What reagent does it oh zone.</v>

31
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.120
So it's nice to think of it about

32
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.800
<v 0>when do you have a certain functional group you want to get?</v>

33
00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:18.740
What reaction will lead to it?
So there's one that will lead to that.

34
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.040
We could also think what reaction would come back from to ketones to give a dial

35
00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:28.790
with a carbon carbon bond in between.
That's a more exotic reaction.

36
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.930
Does anybody remember that one?

37
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.950
That's the pinnacle reduction,
right?
That we talked about were metals,

38
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.720
give electrons to the ketones,
the radicals couple.
And then you,

39
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.550
you have to old minuses that get hydrogens on them.

40
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.040
So That's the pinnacle reduction that we mentioned.

41
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.210
And then you might wonder if there's a reaction that does that right.

42
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.890
And we'll see an indirect version of that later in this lecture.

43
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.430
That's the video reaction,
which is familiar or it involves the vedic reaction,

44
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:03.100
which is a familiar to you from lab.

45
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.620
So periodic acid,
cleavage of carbohydrates as a diagnostic tool.

46
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.700
This is a useful reaction.
It actually,
it actually used to prepare compounds,

47
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:17.701
but it also was historically important in finding out the ring size of,

48
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.370
uh,
of sugars that we talked about earlier as a problem.

49
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.670
Remember nowadays you do that kind of thing by Nmr,

50
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.990
but in the early days you had to do chemical transformations to known compounds

51
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:31.690
in order to figure out what something was,
right?

52
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.180
So if you have a dial as we just showed,

53
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:39.181
you could react it with periodic acid and get to aldehydes in particular for

54
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:43.400
this one.
Formaldehyde.
Okay.
So remember what,

55
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.470
what sugars are a bunch of carbons in a row?
Their carbohydrates.

56
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.510
So it's carbon hydrate.
Ooh,

57
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.600
h and then the carbons linked together and one end to see h two o h typically.

58
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.780
And the other end is an Aldehyde or the carbon eel.

59
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:01.540
Could be other positions down the chain.
Okay,

60
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.120
but how do you figure out what they are?
Okay.

61
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:08.060
Suppose you had three in a row and did periodic acid.
Okay,
so you,

62
00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:11.350
you react with one of them and get the formaldehyde out from the end.

63
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.880
But from the bottom part there you get another Aldehyde and Ooh.

64
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.170
And that reacts again with per ionic acid.

65
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.020
Now why?
Because remember,

66
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.160
the aldehydes form hydrates.

67
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.280
So that's their equivalent in water to alcohols.

68
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.390
So now we have a dial again and per ionic asset oxidizes and cleaves such dials,

69
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.340
right?
So from this reaction,

70
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:46.300
then you get to formaldehyde molecules and the one in the middle,

71
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:49.930
which had only one hydrogen on the carbon,
gives formic acid.

72
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.880
Okay?

73
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.350
So formaldehyde arises from the primary alcohols at the end of the chain and

74
00:04:56.351 --> 00:05:00.520
formic acid from the ones in the middle of the chain that have just an h on
them.

75
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:01.840
And incidentally,

76
00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:06.100
I've taken these slides from lectures given in the course last year by Professor

77
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.630
Ziegler cause he had nicely animated them already.
Uh,

78
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.850
so here's that reaction we just talked about.

79
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.450
Now suppose we had an Aldehyde at the end of the chain and we did this right now

80
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.890
the one now the one,

81
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:23.800
not only the one in the middle of the chain has only one h on it,

82
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.980
but the one at the top has only one age.
So from that,

83
00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:31.210
when you get a formaldehyde and two,
four make acids,
right?

84
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.880
Or if the carbon eel,
we're in the middle of the chain,

85
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.830
you're going to get to four.
Uh,
you gotta get formaldehyde and the,

86
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.900
and the,
uh,
acid in the middle.

87
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.500
But that acid in the middle itself can hydrate and Lou and be oxidized and give

88
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.890
CO2.
So from this one,

89
00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:54.550
we get to a Aldehyde to formaldehydes and a co two molecule,

90
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.510
right?

91
00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.060
So now we could go down and see what groups were that our includes an adjacent
h,

92
00:06:00.061 --> 00:06:04.210
right?
Uh,
and what,
which products you'd get from formaldehyde,

93
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.930
formic acid and carbon dioxide.
So that just summarizes what we just looked at.

94
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.710
Now Suppose you had glucose right now the top would give formic acid,

95
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:18.680
the next company and formic acid for me,
Casad formic acid,

96
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:22.400
formic acid at the bottom would be formaldehyde.
Cause there were two H's on it,

97
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.320
right?
If you had mannitol,
a reduced form related to glucose,

98
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.720
then the top would be formaldehyde to ages and acid,
acid,
acid,
acid,

99
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.790
and at the bottom would be formaldehyde.

100
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.950
So you see the ratio of these various well known products.
You get out,

101
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.040
tell you something about what the structure of the of the uh,
sugar was.

102
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.590
Or if you had fructose,
which has a ketone in it,

103
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.210
you'd get formaldehyde in the top CEO two now from the one that has no hydrogens

104
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:54.140
at all.
Acid acid,
acid,
a formaldehyde.

105
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.670
And you can also apply it to the question of the key towels that are formed when

106
00:06:58.671 --> 00:06:59.630
you form a ring.

107
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.370
So I remember we spoke before about this key towel being a protecting group,

108
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.580
both for the Aldehyde that was formerly here and that's it's oxygen.

109
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.950
And for the alcohol that was here.
Okay,

110
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.940
now we talked about the problem of determining the ring size.

111
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:19.430
Think what would happen with this with Hii oh four.

112
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.560
So it would cleave those two bonds where there are adjacent ohs,
right?

113
00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:28.490
Visitable.
Those are the only places where they're adjacent.
Ohs.

114
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.200
So we'd give formic acid.

115
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:33.560
There was one h on that central carbon and aldehydes on the end.

116
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.490
And now if you treated that with acid and heat,

117
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.480
then you'd open up the,
the key towel,
right?

118
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.870
Key towels could be opened by acid.
Incidentally,
uh,

119
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.350
people don't typically notice the necessity for heat in this,

120
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.120
but it must require heat because if you can get that product,

121
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.900
which hasn't opened,
the key towel in the first reaction,

122
00:07:56.901 --> 00:08:01.901
which has done at room temperature for a day per iot acid is a strong acid,

123
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.920
right?
So here's water and it's done in water.
So it's water with an acid.

124
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:11.210
Ketalysis,
you'd think it would take the key towel apart.
But in fact,

125
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:13.760
taking the key talent apart requires some heat.

126
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:19.040
So that's done in the second step.
And then you,
uh,
you get the,
uh,

127
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.110
the Aldehyde taken apart.

128
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:26.090
So the pieces you get are from the piece up here.
Uh,
you get,
uh,

129
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.390
Ooh,
Ooh,
and Aldehyde.

130
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.530
So you get Douglas or Aldehyde,
uh,
from the piece over here.

131
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:38.531
You get Aldehyde and Aldehyde again and find that of course there's methanol

132
00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:43.820
that came along because it was a,
because it was,
uh,
uh,
uh,
the,

133
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.740
uh,
key dal involving that alcohol.
So by telling what the products are,

134
00:08:48.741 --> 00:08:50.720
you can tell what the ring size was.

135
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.150
Now here's the problem for you to think about.

136
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.480
Suppose you could imagine these key towels being formed with other,

137
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.410
instead of this,

138
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.280
instead of this ooh being the one that's involved to make a six membered ring,

139
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.180
it could have been this Oah and made a five membered ring.
Or in principle,

140
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:09.720
this one that made a four or that one that made a seven membered ring.

141
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.610
I'd like you to make a table that shows what the products would have been from

142
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.630
[inaudible] oxidation of those others to see whether in fact you can prove what

143
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:24.450
the ring size was by what products come out from this.
This was,
this,

144
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:25.340
a reaction was,

145
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.610
was developed in 1928 and applied for that purpose,

146
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.110
that analytical purpose.
Okay,
so that's oxidation.

147
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:36.330
Now we're going to talk about a little bit of a,

148
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:39.630
of reduction and in particular about making,
uh,

149
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:44.750
about synthesizing alcohols and the idea of retro synthesis a little bit,

150
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:47.130
which is,
uh,
you look at the product,

151
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:51.420
usually it's a product you want to have and you're trying to figure out what

152
00:09:51.421 --> 00:09:53.820
starting materials and reagents would have given it.

153
00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:57.600
So really you're working backwards rather than forwards in a synthesis.

154
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.200
So analyze in such problems as called retro synthesis.

155
00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:03.620
And we'll engage in a little bit of this here.
Uh,

156
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:07.890
using a problem that occurs in the Jones Textbook.

157
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.110
Okay,
so here's an alcohol we want to get.
We want to put our on a,

158
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.200
on an alcohol that already has two methyls right now we can start with acetone

159
00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:23.550
there,
the two methyls and now we have to put the R on.

160
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.300
Now what kind of are do we need in order to attack a carbon eel?

161
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.620
What will attack a carbon eel to make a carbon carbon bond for our,

162
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:34.560
what form of our will we use?
For example,

163
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.700
could you use at how kill haylight our cl,

164
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.940
would that be something that would react in order to give this product?

165
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.480
What is it that will react with the car video?
What makes a carbon eel reactive?

166
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.800
Roy,
you need a nucleophile.

167
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.350
So you need a carbon that has a high homo on it.

168
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.450
Can you think of any such things?
Where do you get a high home?

169
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:03.420
We'll want a carbon from a grid yar reaction.
Where,

170
00:11:03.421 --> 00:11:07.770
or I'll kill lithium,
something where our is attached to a metal ion,

171
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.150
so it'll be our minus.
Okay.
So you have are with a metal,

172
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.830
like a,
a Grinny are reagent or an owl kill lithium,
right?

173
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.820
You do this reaction.
Then of course you can,
uh,

174
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:24.480
those electrons can be used to form of bond to the metal and you get that

175
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:27.690
intermediate.
And in fact,
as we've already discussed,

176
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.380
it's not so obvious what the order of those additions are.

177
00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:34.380
The are heading to carbon in the metal ahead into oxygen.

178
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:39.280
It could be either first or in fact,
probably both at the same time.
Uh,

179
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.440
so at anyhow we can,

180
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.640
we can make that new carbon carbon bond and then treat the salt,

181
00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:48.600
the Oh minus and plus with h plus and get the alcohol.

182
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.550
So there's a simple synthesis.

183
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.310
Now suppose we wanted to put an h instead of an are,

184
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:59.710
what form of h do we need?
Can we do this with an acid for example?
H plus.

185
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.920
Is that going to be a good idea?
Megan?
What?

186
00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.160
What type of reagent,

187
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:10.720
what kind of age would attack the carbon eel?
What makes the carving?

188
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:13.590
He overreacted
low.

189
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:17.150
Lubo so you need an h with a High Hobo.
How about Proton?

190
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:23.830
Protons have no electronics at all.
So what form of HD you need h minus.

191
00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:27.450
Where are you going to get h?
Minus?
Where did you get r minus

192
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:33.550
our metal art metal.
So what do we need now?
H metal.
Okay,

193
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.240
so this is going to be a hydride reduction.
Okay.

194
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.930
So we have h with a metal doing exactly the same thing we showed above,

195
00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:44.830
except it's h minus instead of our mind is doing the trick and we get it from

196
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:49.420
something like h attached to aluminum with a minus charge on the aluminum,

197
00:12:49.421 --> 00:12:53.920
which means it's really going to be a high homo or h attached to Boron with a

198
00:12:53.921 --> 00:12:55.090
minus charge on it.

199
00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.360
So those reagents are lithium aluminum hydride sodium borohydride,

200
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.650
which can reduce a,
an alcohol to put the h on there.
Okay.

201
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.820
And we also talked about the biological equivalent of these hydride donors,

202
00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:14.821
which is a n a d h where the unshared pair on the nitrogen can get into the act

203
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.670
forming an aromatic system and losing h minus,

204
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:23.290
which can go onto the carbon eel a group.
Okay.
So we have,
uh,

205
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.970
our minus or h minus as ways to attack carbon yield groups.

206
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.530
Now let's look a little bit at the synthetic versatility of Greeny,
our reagents.

207
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.980
So the,
here's a problem to suggest high yields syntheses,

208
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:41.670
where the carbons come only from alcohol's with no more than three carbons.

209
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.720
And,
but you can use any other reagent.
Now,
these are very artificial.

210
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:50.560
These are not a problem you'd be faced with in the laboratory because almost
all,

211
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.290
many of these you could buy,
not all of them,

212
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.070
but many of them you could buy cheaper than you could make them,
right?

213
00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:01.210
But in a way of thinking about how you do syntheses and an elementary way,

214
00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:04.630
this is a good exercise and it's,
as I've mentioned here,

215
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.130
you can find that problem in,
in,
uh,
in,
uh,
the Jones Textbook.

216
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.930
So let's think first about the first molecule in this list.
Now,
what's the,

217
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:18.880
what problem do we face in making this from alcohols with no more than three

218
00:14:18.881 --> 00:14:21.520
carbons,
therefore carbons in it?

219
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.750
So we've got to make a carbon carbon bond somehow.
So,
uh,

220
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.420
let's think about what carbon carbon bonds we might make.

221
00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:33.010
We could make the first carbon carbon bond nearest doh or the next one or the

222
00:14:33.011 --> 00:14:35.200
next one,
right?
There are three that we could make.

223
00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:38.320
And let's see how we would go about that.
Okay.
First,

224
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:40.690
let's try to make the one adjacent to the age.

225
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.400
So we need to have two carbons that will react with one another.

226
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.650
One a high homo,
the other,

227
00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:51.770
the low Lumo that will establish that bond.
Okay,

228
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:56.600
so we did a nucleophile,
a high homo,
and an electrifying the low Lumo.

229
00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.470
So what will the nucleophile be?
Anybody got an idea?

230
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:06.423
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

231
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.130
<v 0>it could be either the piece on the left or the piece on the right.</v>

232
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.360
If the nucleophile,
if the electro file where the piece on the left,

233
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:19.100
the three carbon,
what kind of,
what kind of molecule would you do use?

234
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.830
If it were three carbons and you want it to be attacked by a high homo,

235
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.450
right?
A Halon would do it right.
The loads.

236
00:15:30.451 --> 00:15:34.320
The sigma star of I'll kill haylight would do that.
Okay.

237
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.400
Now suppose you wanted it to be the high homo,
then what would you do?

238
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.810
Megan,
you just told us about that.
Suppose you wanted our to be a high homo.

239
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.130
You'd use a metal now feel metal.
Okay.
Now,

240
00:15:47.131 --> 00:15:50.280
how about the electro file on the right?
Uh,

241
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:54.160
here's a great example of a use the low Lubo of carbon eel.

242
00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:57.840
So now what we want on the,
on the left is the high homo.

243
00:15:57.841 --> 00:16:02.520
We want the Al Kill metal,
but we can,
but we can only start from alcohols.

244
00:16:02.521 --> 00:16:06.000
In fact,
we can't even start with this because that's a carbon that goes into the

245
00:16:06.001 --> 00:16:08.490
product.
We have to start from an alcohol.

246
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.830
So how are we going to make that from an alcohol?

247
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:18.140
How is it related to an alcohol to eight,
which has an h on the car.

248
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.610
So we get an h on the carbon h on here.
That would be an alcohol.
Methanol.

249
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.930
What kind of reagent do we need to get from the alcohol to this?

250
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.930
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

251
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:31.730
<v 0>it's an oxidation.
Is that a reduction?</v>

252
00:16:31.731 --> 00:16:36.350
Is it needed to remove two hydrogens?

253
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:37.640
It's an oxidation.

254
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:43.570
There's a problem though because the oxidizing agents that oxidize alcohol's

255
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.320
also react with aldehydes.
If you have any water,

256
00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:53.210
their water,
we'll add,
make the Aldehyde into a dial,
right?

257
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.330
And then that will react that we'll get oxidized by the reagent.

258
00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:59.180
How do you avoid that?
We've talked about this last time.

259
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.220
You don't have any water there,
right?

260
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:08.420
So we talked about that last time period end IOM chloro chromate done in

261
00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.050
methylene chloride solvent.
So there's no water there.
Can do that trick.

262
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.050
So we have the electric file.
Now we need the nucleophile.

263
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.960
We need a c three group with a metal on it,

264
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.240
but we can only start with an alcohol.

265
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:25.550
So if we had normal propyl Grinny our reagent,
that would do the trick.

266
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.800
Where do you get a grin?
Yard reagent from our MTBR.

267
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.040
What's the starting material?

268
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:34.993
<v 2>Okay,</v>

269
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:39.170
<v 0>so you guys need to go through this to get a little drill under your belts.
Okay.</v>

270
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:44.480
Did you get,
you get Grinny our reagents from Al Kill Haylight ads.
Okay,

271
00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:46.520
so we could get it from,

272
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:51.550
we get our Mtbr from magnesium and Al [inaudible] and Al [inaudible] Bromide.

273
00:17:52.441 --> 00:17:55.440
But where do we get the [inaudible] bromide?
We could only the,

274
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:59.580
the rules of the game have a starting with alcohol.
Yeah.
Amy,

275
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:04.470
can you hear three PBR.
Three on the alcohol,
right.
So we got it.

276
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.390
Okay,
so we could make that first one.
Now how about the second one?
Now we need a,

277
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.140
we need an electro file in a nucleophile the electro file.

278
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:17.790
Now on the left could be the ethyl magnesium bromide,
just two carbons.

279
00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:19.860
And we would make it the same way here.
Uh,

280
00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:23.340
starting with ethanol instead of propanol.
So that one's okay.

281
00:18:23.341 --> 00:18:25.140
Now what will the group on the right B,

282
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:30.500
we want to be able to attack this carbon and end up with Oah on the adjacent

283
00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:31.764
carbon.

284
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.230
Right now you haven't done a lot of problems like this,

285
00:18:37.231 --> 00:18:40.140
but you need to think them through and whatever textbook you're using,

286
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.170
you'll find problems of this sort.
So try some of them.

287
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:47.220
But W we talked about such a reaction,
which is an EFP oxide.

288
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.020
Remember the strange rings could be attacked by a nucleophile the open here,

289
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:53.370
right?

290
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.540
But w a t t to form this ring where you attack this carbon in the oak comes away

291
00:18:57.541 --> 00:19:02.130
as a leaving group.
Protonated now,
uh,
where do we get that from?

292
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.370
Where does it have Parkside come from?
We have to start with an alcohol.

293
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.370
Any reactions that give EFP oxides.

294
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.020
<v 2>Okay.</v>

295
00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.890
<v 0>Hey,
come by adding oxygen to an alkene.
Okay.</v>

296
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.560
Anybody remember the reagents at the land and oxygen?

297
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.240
<v 2>What as the,</v>

298
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:27.150
that something say good odds Liam?

299
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.270
<v 0>Uh,
no.
The,
the,</v>

300
00:19:29.271 --> 00:19:33.950
the osmium tetroxide takes an alkene and puts two o's on it,

301
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.680
right?
That'll put two o's.

302
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:41.360
We want to just put one over in the middle and you'll kick yourself when I oh

303
00:19:41.361 --> 00:19:44.270
yeah,
Chris,
the CEO.
I think we do it,
but you need something else.

304
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:48.560
You can add cl and o h and then remove hcl.

305
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.800
That was one way of doing it.
There's another way where you do it in one step.

306
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.850
EPDA MCP,
VA Mehta,
chloro per benzoic acid.

307
00:19:56.851 --> 00:20:01.130
Or remember that cyclic butterflied mechanism that transfer the oxygen from the

308
00:20:01.131 --> 00:20:05.470
proxy acid.
Okay?
So we got that,
but now we need the owl cane,

309
00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.470
but we only have available alcohols,
but that's a trivial one.

310
00:20:09.471 --> 00:20:14.030
Just dehydrated alcohol or,
or dehydrate and Al Bromide,

311
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:19.170
right?
So you treat it with strong base and remove HBR and you've got things.

312
00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.550
Okay,
so we've got that.
We could do that one,
uh,

313
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.480
with heat and Naoh.
Okay.
Now,
how about the bottom one?

314
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.790
That one is quite a problem.

315
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.900
The problem is that you could have methyl Grinny are,

316
00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:35.330
but what are you going to attack?

317
00:20:35.331 --> 00:20:38.750
Because if you had a four membered ring here with oxygen,
it wouldn't,

318
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:43.770
it wouldn't open.
It's not strange like the three membered ring would be,
and you,

319
00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.670
if you try to make the nucleophile be on the left,

320
00:20:46.671 --> 00:20:51.550
that top right carbon being in an eye on,
and this one being say Formaldehyde,

321
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.120
then you have the problem that you have two oh eight,
you'd get an Oah here,

322
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:56.081
right?

323
00:20:56.081 --> 00:20:59.230
And that's a problem because you have to get rid of just one of the two Oh ages

324
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:04.450
or uh,
or you would have to have a grin yar reagent or something like here.

325
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:06.220
And that would react with its own age.

326
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.090
Now you could imagine complicated schemes where you use protecting groups and

327
00:21:10.091 --> 00:21:12.040
stuff like that.
So it's conceivable,

328
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:17.230
but it's hard work because this is not a particularly good carbon to be,

329
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:21.220
to be reactive.
The,
you could have,
if so,

330
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.590
it's not an an activated position.

331
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:27.610
This one was in a position where it could have been attached to that oxygen.

332
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.160
This one was in a position that was a carbonyl,

333
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.210
but this one has no special virtues that makes it reactive.
So,

334
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:39.160
so that one is a tough one to make.
Okay,
now let's think about the second one.

335
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.560
Okay,
now we,
let's try to make that bond.
For example,

336
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.540
right now we need a nucleophile and electrified.

337
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:52.090
Does anybody have an idea of what the low Lumo is that could be attacked?

338
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.370
In order to make that red bond,

339
00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:56.990
<v 1>you have an idea.</v>

340
00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:03.890
<v 0>We want to make this carbon carbon bond and one of the two carbons has to be a</v>

341
00:22:03.891 --> 00:22:07.310
high homo and the other and unusually low Lumo.

342
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:12.460
And notice incidentally that this one that's a need that needs to be one of them

343
00:22:12.461 --> 00:22:14.270
is has an oxygen next door.

344
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:18.530
Carbon carbon double bond with.
Oh right.

345
00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.690
So then what would you use on the right?

346
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:28.800
<v 1>Um,
RCL RCL</v>

347
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:33.930
<v 0>is,
is like our plus,
right?
You want our minus,
you want a high homo,</v>

348
00:22:33.931 --> 00:22:38.700
not the low luma,
not sigma star.
What would you use?
That was a battle,
right?
Okay.

349
00:22:38.701 --> 00:22:40.350
So we needed a nucleophile and electrify all,

350
00:22:40.351 --> 00:22:44.970
we use the three carbons on the right,
right as a,
as a Greenie our reagent.

351
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.170
And now we need that Aldehyde,
right?

352
00:22:49.171 --> 00:22:52.680
That for Carbon Aldehyde,
we can only start with three carbon things.

353
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:57.210
So we can't oxidize one of the things they give us and make that Aldehyde.

354
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.380
How are we going to make that four Carbon Aldehyde?
Any ideas?

355
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

356
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.260
<v 0>You don't have to look far,</v>

357
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.450
<v 1>Linda,
do you have an idea?
You need</v>

358
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:13.740
<v 0>four carbons that terminate in oxygen,
double Bondo.</v>

359
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.980
And you can only start with three carbons.

360
00:23:16.981 --> 00:23:19.950
Can you think of any way of making four carbons?
When you start with,

361
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.660
with three or less,

362
00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:25.520
<v 1>that was the first problem.</v>

363
00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:31.720
<v 0>So you've already made this.
Can you think of any way of making the Aldehyde?</v>

364
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.980
How do you go from the alcohol to the Aldehyde?
What do you need to do?

365
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.040
<v 1>You need to remove two H's,
right?
It's an oxidation.</v>

366
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.260
<v 0>So think only of oxidizing agents.</v>

367
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:52.400
Can you think of any oxidizing agent that changes in alcohol to an Aldehyde

368
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:59.260
<v 2>pcs?
So that's just the art too.</v>

369
00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.590
<v 0>Uh,
Vr tube to do it right,</v>

370
00:24:02.591 --> 00:24:06.340
but you're going to have problems depending on how you do it,
of over oxidation.

371
00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.650
The aldehydes can go on to acids.
VCC,

372
00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.950
the same one we used on the last slide.
So you treat that one at PCC and in the,

373
00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.860
uh,
methylene chloride solvent.
You got that Aldehyde.

374
00:24:17.861 --> 00:24:22.720
So we've solved the second one,
PCC and methylene chloride.
Now.

375
00:24:22.721 --> 00:24:25.720
So the next one that they suggest you try to make is this one.

376
00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.140
Now suppose you wanted to make that bond.

377
00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.660
Can you think of any way of doing it,

378
00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.670
<v 2>Ellen?
What's going to be the nucleophile?</v>

379
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:48.400
<v 0>Yeah,
what's the are going to be,
is it on the right or the left?</v>

380
00:24:48.401 --> 00:24:50.920
The one we're ready.
It's going to be the,
the,

381
00:24:50.921 --> 00:24:55.090
our metal that we're going to deal with.
Are we,

382
00:24:55.091 --> 00:24:57.880
is it going to be this carbon or this carbon?

383
00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:00.360
<v 2>Okay.</v>

384
00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.130
<v 0>The bottom right at the top left carbon.</v>

385
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:09.630
What's the top left carbon going to be in order to make that wrong?

386
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.730
Amy and I'll be,
uh,
another legacy.
Don't Bondo.
So you know,
Bondo.

387
00:25:14.731 --> 00:25:18.200
This,
when we see the old next to the carbon,
we think Aldehyde is,
that's,

388
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.890
that's gotta be the Lumo that gets attacked.
And the Hobo Ella,

389
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.780
the one on the right's going to be a graveyard.

390
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.450
But this time instead of an propal,
it's ice or pro ball.

391
00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.780
And this is the Aldehyde.
We need any way of getting that Aldehyde Ella?

392
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:34.750
<v 2>Yeah,
that's the same way.</v>

393
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:39.690
<v 0>It's the same one to five,
right?
So we got that one.
Okay.
Now how about this one?</v>

394
00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:45.000
Any ideas for that?
So let's make that bond.

395
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.650
Okay.
So what gets attacked on the left?

396
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.690
Amy,
you had help us again.
Well,

397
00:25:56.691 --> 00:26:00.080
it would be the top where the second one,

398
00:26:00.081 --> 00:26:04.790
how many carbons on the left?
One,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,

399
00:26:04.791 --> 00:26:07.910
seven.
We can only start with three carbon alcohols.

400
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:13.420
So could you make the second product and then there's some kind of at the second

401
00:26:13.971 --> 00:26:14.630
problem.

402
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:18.020
The second product has the seven with like with an alcohol in the middle.

403
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.810
So what do you do?
You need a ketone in the middle.

404
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.000
You've made the alcohol,
you need the Ketone,

405
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:32.030
so you have to oxidize it.
So you could use the same reagent again,

406
00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.910
but you don't need to worry because it's a ketone this time.

407
00:26:34.911 --> 00:26:36.740
So you're not so worried about over oxidation.

408
00:26:36.741 --> 00:26:39.560
So you could use one of those chromate things that we talked about or,

409
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:44.370
or borough mean or anything.
And on the right,
it's just the,
and propyl again,

410
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.670
we've already made that.
Okay,
so we got that one made.

411
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.930
What about if we wanted to make the next bond,
the,
the vertical bond instead?

412
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:55.760
Oh,
I didn't show it here.
Well,
what if,

413
00:26:55.761 --> 00:27:00.170
what if we needed to make the vertical bond?
It's the same thing,
right?

414
00:27:00.171 --> 00:27:04.040
The things symmetrical.
It has three SL,
three propyl groups on there.
Okay,

415
00:27:04.041 --> 00:27:07.160
so here's another one.
How are we gonna make this one?
Well,

416
00:27:07.161 --> 00:27:11.120
we could make that bond.
Anybody see how to do that?

417
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:13.373
<v 1>Mary,</v>

418
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:20.610
<v 0>what are we going to use on the right?
Same one here.</v>

419
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:25.110
I started to say,
one is here.
I said approachable.
Okay.
And what's on the left?

420
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:31.730
We're going to oxidize the oxygen,
right?
And it's going to be the same one,
right?

421
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:36.880
That's seven carbon.
So we got that one.
And now finally,
uh,

422
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:41.850
how about if we wanted to make that one instead,
then what would the grin Yar,

423
00:27:41.851 --> 00:27:46.240
reagent B,
it would be in propyl instead of ice appropriate.

424
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.550
And what would the Ketone B it would be this?
And where would we get that

425
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:56.790
by oxidizing this one?
Right?
Okay.
And finally,

426
00:27:56.791 --> 00:27:57.241
this one,

427
00:27:57.241 --> 00:28:02.241
now we could imagine making this bond or making this bond or making this bond,

428
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.340
and we have the means to do all these things now,
but one wonders,

429
00:28:08.341 --> 00:28:12.810
is there a preferred order?
Is One way of doing this better than the others?

430
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.910
Right?
And in this case,
I suspect that they're all about the same.

431
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.673
Uh,

432
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:24.030
it might come down to what's cheap and available and so on,

433
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.270
which alcohols are cheaper.
And in fact,

434
00:28:27.271 --> 00:28:30.660
of course you would never do this because simple things like this,
you would,

435
00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:32.160
you wouldn't start from the alcohol,

436
00:28:32.161 --> 00:28:34.410
you'd buy the bromide or something like that.

437
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.370
But when you talk about versatility of Grinny are agents,

438
00:28:38.371 --> 00:28:40.710
there are other things they could do to,
for example,

439
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.920
if you try to make the dye ice of propyl methyl version of the carbonyl here,

440
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:50.340
right?
To make this one.
You find that you can,

441
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:54.240
that you do first make the salt,
then treat it with acid.

442
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:58.110
You get that alcohol and it's 95% yield.
Great.

443
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:03.420
Now suppose you wanted to use t butyl instead of methyl,
right?

444
00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.950
So you want to get that one.

445
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:09.270
So you try that reaction and you get 0% yield of that.

446
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:11.820
The product is this.

447
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:15.210
So what was it that added to the carbon eel?

448
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.940
It wasn't the t butyl an eye on what an ion was it?

449
00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.100
<v 1>What did the addition,</v>

450
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:30.330
<v 0>it was hydride but where did the hydride come from?</v>

451
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.393
Okay,

452
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:37.650
so it was a reduction by h minus or the equivalent of h minus,
right?

453
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:40.680
What you had was the t butyl grin yard.

454
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:45.490
Now what problem did t beautiful Grin Yar have in trying to form this alcohol?

455
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:50.560
Yeah,
Cassie spherically hindered the carbon.

456
00:29:50.561 --> 00:29:55.420
Can't get close to the carbon,
but a hydrogen can get close to the harbor,
right?

457
00:29:55.421 --> 00:30:00.070
That Beta hydrogen can get close to the carbon.
So now we can do this,

458
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:02.303
<v 2>right?</v>

459
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.950
<v 0>And you'll see that the,
that,
that the,</v>

460
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
the carbon part that was t butyl loses magnesium and loses age to become the

461
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:16.050
alkene and the,
and the other product then is that 65% yield alcohol.

462
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.710
And this reminds you this hydrogen transfer from t butyl,

463
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.150
although it's happening here in the context of an anti and it reminds you of two

464
00:30:24.151 --> 00:30:27.660
t butyl radicals having trouble for me in the carbon carbon bond and

465
00:30:27.661 --> 00:30:31.200
transferring a hydrogen atom instead for the same reason,

466
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.740
okay?
To avoid steric hindrance.
Okay.
Now,
uh,

467
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:41.010
if you use t butyl ch two magnesium bromide,

468
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:46.340
then you don't have to worry about this hydride transfer because it has ch two

469
00:30:49.171 --> 00:30:53.460
in this position and three methyls attached to that carbon.

470
00:30:53.461 --> 00:30:58.140
There is no hydrogen in the Beta position.
So it looks like we're home free here,

471
00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.010
but you only get a 4% yield of the Grin Yard,
right?

472
00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:03.750
Cause it's still sterically hindered.

473
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:08.910
What you get instead is reduction of the,

474
00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:13.230
of the,
uh,
of the uh,
or,
or protonation pardon me,

475
00:31:13.231 --> 00:31:17.340
of the t butyl of the,
uh,
of the uh,
neopentyl group.
Right?

476
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:22.140
So remember that the ketone itself has alpha hydrogens.

477
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:26.490
So you can form enal h you can give up a proton from those.
So this,

478
00:31:26.491 --> 00:31:30.510
this thing which is a nucleophile is also a strong base and can take that off.

479
00:31:30.511 --> 00:31:35.300
And you get that one,
uh,
uh,
easily plus the Eataly,

480
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:38.130
which lost the Proton.
But then when you work it up with acid,

481
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:43.110
you've protonated again.
So the ketone gets recovered it 90% of it and the,

482
00:31:43.111 --> 00:31:45.720
and,
and the,
uh,
your,
uh,

483
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:49.740
carefully made Grinny our reagent just becomes a hydrocarbon.

484
00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.620
No use there.
Okay?

485
00:31:52.621 --> 00:31:55.650
So those are other things that can happen with Grinny our reagents.

486
00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:59.340
And that same thing incidentally can happen here because this one also this,

487
00:31:59.341 --> 00:32:02.700
the Alpha hydrogen was president here and this one was a strong base.

488
00:32:02.701 --> 00:32:06.740
And in fact,
35% of that one was that plus the,
uh,

489
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:11.340
starting Keto.
And after you put the Proton back on,
okay?

490
00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:16.560
Uh,
now,
uh,
this,
uh,
if you try to make this bond as we just,

491
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.160
uh,
you could make it,
uh,
uh,

492
00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:21.750
uh,

493
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:25.920
with notice the difference this time is that it's ice appropriately instead of t

494
00:32:25.921 --> 00:32:30.690
butyl group here,
right?
So you could try doing this,
right?

495
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:34.710
Uh,
so that has an h Beta and steric hindrance.

496
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.050
So there's the risk that it would give reduction,

497
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.433
<v 2>right?</v>

498
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:46.240
<v 0>But if you started with that ketone and edited Methyl Grin Yar,</v>

499
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:50.930
then the methyl doesn't have any hydrogen Beta that it could give in reduction.

500
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:55.670
So now you get a good yield of the product that you wanted.
So there,

501
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:59.690
so sometimes it's helpful to,
to choose one of the bonds to make.

502
00:32:59.691 --> 00:33:02.820
So in making this,
in trying to make this alcohol,

503
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:04.730
the thing you get when you've protonate here,

504
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.520
you could make this bond or this bond or this bond,

505
00:33:07.521 --> 00:33:11.720
but the bonds to methyl are much more practical to make them the bond to the ch

506
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:15.710
two,
because of the risk of reduction.
Okay.

507
00:33:15.711 --> 00:33:19.550
Now the vinegar reaction we can zoom through because you all know that from lab,

508
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:24.110
I don't remember what base you used to make the videography agent.

509
00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.760
Do you remember
sodium

510
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:34.360
hydroxide?
So that,
so you had,
you didn't have such a simple video.

511
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.840
A reagent is this one,

512
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.680
a notice that here you make the reagent by reacting with Bro,

513
00:33:39.681 --> 00:33:42.980
by just light nitrogen would do an sn two reaction.

514
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:47.960
Now you have that cad ion and you treat it in this case with a very strong base,

515
00:33:47.961 --> 00:33:51.260
butyl lithium,
right?
So a carbon and iron.

516
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.810
What's the Ph of a carbon hydrogen bond?

517
00:33:53.811 --> 00:33:56.540
Typically just like butane losing a proton

518
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.800
order of 50,
right?
Very weak acid.

519
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.080
So the butyl lithium is a very strong base.
Okay.

520
00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:08.420
And pulls that Proton off the ch two.
Now in this case,

521
00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.570
the PKA is about 30 of that,

522
00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.630
of the ch three group to lose a proton,
right?

523
00:34:14.631 --> 00:34:18.430
You're never going to get that off with hydroxide,
right?
Uh,

524
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.590
but you can do it in this,
in this case there,
uh,

525
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:23.900
with a stronger base.

526
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:27.770
But what is it that you couldn't do this if instead of phosphorus you had

527
00:34:27.771 --> 00:34:31.430
nitrogen.
Now what's good about forming this an ion?

528
00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:35.390
Why is that anti in a reasonable one to try to make where you don't pull

529
00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:40.370
hydrogens off carbons willy nilly and not off normal hydrocarbons?

530
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.040
What does the neighboring phosphorus have to do with it?

531
00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:45.950
How does it make it easy to form the anti it?
Well,

532
00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:49.360
the phosphorus is a cat eye and it's easy to form an anti in near the cad I,

533
00:34:49.361 --> 00:34:54.020
and you could do that with nitrogen and it could be an end plus the next

534
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:59.120
neighbor up in the periodic table,
right?
But phosphorus is even better,

535
00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:01.530
right?
Because when you get that and I,

536
00:35:01.531 --> 00:35:06.020
and to be stabilized fos for us down in the next row of the periodic table has

537
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:09.710
vacant d orbitals that are able to stabilize that electron.

538
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.330
So it's a specially acidic but not so acidic that you're going to pull it off

539
00:35:14.331 --> 00:35:16.280
with Oah minus.
Right?

540
00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:19.370
So you could draw a resonance structure where you have a double bond where not

541
00:35:19.371 --> 00:35:23.750
only the phosphorus has given electrons to the carbon in making the bond,

542
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.210
but the,
uh,
but the,
uh,

543
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.050
carbon has given electrons back to the phosphorous through this d orbital

544
00:35:30.051 --> 00:35:32.320
interaction.
Anyhow,

545
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:37.330
you have this so called Iliad and then it can act as a nucleophile with the

546
00:35:37.411 --> 00:35:40.270
carbon eel.
And now the,
the,
the uh,

547
00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.570
oxygen can add to the phosphorus,

548
00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:47.250
which can form five bonds because it has extra valence orbitals these d
orbitals,

549
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:50.040
right?
So you get the four membered ring,

550
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.240
but that very easily unzips uh,

551
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.110
because the po double bond is unusually stable.

552
00:35:58.111 --> 00:36:00.270
The Eno bond of a,

553
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:05.750
of a trivalent nitrogen that in adds oxygen is only 70 kilocalories per mole,

554
00:36:05.851 --> 00:36:10.230
but the phosphorus version is a hundred kilocalories per mole because of those d

555
00:36:10.231 --> 00:36:13.230
orbitals making it especially stable.
Okay.

556
00:36:13.231 --> 00:36:17.490
So you can get that try fennel phosphine oxide and the alkene.

557
00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:18.391
And as you know,

558
00:36:18.391 --> 00:36:23.391
what this Davidic reaction results in is replacing double bond o by double bond

559
00:36:24.341 --> 00:36:27.350
ch two or in other cases,
double bonds.

560
00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:32.310
See something else depending on what you started with up here.
Okay.

561
00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:37.140
And I say directly because there are other ways of going round about to do this

562
00:36:37.141 --> 00:36:38.970
rather than to do it directly.
For example,

563
00:36:38.971 --> 00:36:42.960
you could add a methyl grin yard to this ketone to make the alcohol,

564
00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:47.580
treat that with acid,
lose the water to make the primary cat died,

565
00:36:47.581 --> 00:36:51.510
and it could then lose a proton and that would replace,
here's,

566
00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:54.900
here's where our ch two is coming from,
right?

567
00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.900
And then we lose the h from the ch three to get that.

568
00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:02.990
So that replaces the double Bondo with double bond c h two the same thing.

569
00:37:03.001 --> 00:37:07.650
The video reaction would do,
except that's not the major product.

570
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:11.880
It's a minor product.
What's the other product?

571
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:21.120
The other product is losing a different Alpha hydrogen,
right?
One of those.

572
00:37:21.121 --> 00:37:25.170
That's the major product y it's a more stable owl keyed,

573
00:37:25.171 --> 00:37:29.460
more highly substituted.
Right?
So,
so,
uh,

574
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.600
uh,
so you can see the advantage of the vintage reaction,

575
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:38.780
which directly gives the replacement of double bond o by double bond ch two in

576
00:37:39.031 --> 00:37:43.260
this case,
or a double bond,
CHR or double bond cr two.

577
00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:49.590
Now I was going to say a little bit about Green Chemistry and in connection with

578
00:37:49.591 --> 00:37:51.480
some of these reactions we're talking about.

579
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.170
So pharmaceuticals are big chemical industry nowadays.

580
00:37:55.171 --> 00:37:59.910
100 years ago it would still have been dye industry,
right?
And then petroleum,

581
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:05.130
pharmaceuticals,
plastics.
But now pharmaceuticals,
uh,

582
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:10.160
generate only 0.2% of the chemical industry product measured by mass,

583
00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:15.000
but 25% of its value buy in money,
right?

584
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:20.300
Which means that it's worth doing a lot of work to on those to do a lot of

585
00:38:20.521 --> 00:38:24.420
reactions in order to get these pharmaceuticals.
There's a lot of value added,

586
00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:28.500
right?
But in the process of doing all of these manipulations,

587
00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:33.060
the pharmaceutical industry generates more than 50% of the chemical waste,

588
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:34.763
right?

589
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:39.910
So the idea of green chemistry is to find new ways of doing things that won't

590
00:38:39.911 --> 00:38:44.900
generate so much waste or will be safer,
for example.
Okay.
So there was a,

591
00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:48.610
there,
there's a journal called green chemistry,
and in 2000,

592
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:53.350
they published a paper called Ky Green Chemistry research areas of perspective

593
00:38:53.351 --> 00:38:55.300
from pharmaceutical manufacturers.

594
00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:59.860
So representative of representatives of the biggest pharmaceutical companies,

595
00:38:59.861 --> 00:39:04.300
Astrazeneca,
glaxosmithkline,
Lilly,
Pfizer,
Merck,
Schering plough,

596
00:39:04.301 --> 00:39:06.290
which is now part of Merck,
uh,

597
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:10.960
got together to talk about what they saw as the places where you could make

598
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:14.290
advances to make chemistry,
uh,

599
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:19.000
more friendly to the environment and the people practicing it.
Uh,

600
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:24.680
and uh,
obviously from the,
from the perspective of,
of,
uh,

601
00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:27.580
of the pharmaceutical industry,
right?

602
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.420
So this is gazing into a crystal ball,
right?

603
00:39:31.421 --> 00:39:35.140
And there's nothing as hard to predict is the future.
Right?

604
00:39:35.141 --> 00:39:38.500
But at least these are their ideas and are people that have a great practical

605
00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:42.280
interest in it,
not only in the sense of their things they want to happen,

606
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:46.840
but they're willing to give money to people to try to help make it happen,

607
00:39:46.841 --> 00:39:50.170
to do research projects,
to try to develop new ways of doing it.

608
00:39:50.171 --> 00:39:52.900
So they were trying to decide what they would most like to have.

609
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.440
And Th th th so it involved frequency of use.

610
00:39:56.441 --> 00:39:58.360
If there's a reaction you hardly ever use,

611
00:39:58.361 --> 00:40:00.310
you don't want to spend a lot of trouble on that one.

612
00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.580
But if there's something that you use all the time that you could make better

613
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:05.680
than that's important.
So frequency of use,

614
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:10.270
how much volume is involved of the of this stuff.
If it's only a milligram,

615
00:40:10.271 --> 00:40:13.390
who cares?
But if it's tons,
that's a big deal.

616
00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:15.490
And of course safety is another one.

617
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:20.650
So one of the top priorities is solvents because that's what they use the most

618
00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:21.910
of.
So,

619
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:26.800
and in something that wouldn't occur to the outsider probably is a very

620
00:40:26.801 --> 00:40:28.920
important thing is to clean the,

621
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.780
they have these big reaction vessels and they have to clean them.

622
00:40:31.781 --> 00:40:36.040
So that stuff that's left over from the previous reaction doesn't get into some

623
00:40:36.041 --> 00:40:39.280
other drug.
So they have to be scrupulously cleaned.

624
00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:44.590
And two thirds of the solvent they use is used in cleaning the reactors to make

625
00:40:44.621 --> 00:40:47.800
sure that they're,
they're cleans.
But there might be other ways of doing it.

626
00:40:47.801 --> 00:40:48.634
For example,

627
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:53.560
use water and an oxidizing agent like hydrogen peroxide maybe to do it.

628
00:40:53.561 --> 00:40:57.600
So then now they're interested in,
in that is one of the big,
uh,

629
00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:02.380
steps they could take or replacements for what are called,
uh,

630
00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:06.040
a protech solvent.
So these are organic solvents.

631
00:41:06.041 --> 00:41:10.720
They'll dissolve organic compounds,
but they also typically dissolved salts.

632
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:15.190
So you can have salts react with organic compounds in these solvents.

633
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:20.110
So ones like NMP there on the left and methyl Perala Dean or demethylate

634
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:24.460
sediment or dimethyl form amid are very heavily used solvents because you can

635
00:41:24.461 --> 00:41:29.110
mix organic and,
and salt reagents in them,
right?

636
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:31.890
But the problem is that there,

637
00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:34.880
that they're very difficult because they're miscible with water.

638
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.330
They're very hard to get out of the water at the end of the,
uh,

639
00:41:38.331 --> 00:41:39.980
at the end of the day,
right?

640
00:41:39.981 --> 00:41:43.400
So they're worried about polluting the water streams.

641
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.830
So they would like to get replacements for that.

642
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:49.190
Now you could wish for anything you could wish for $2 billion.

643
00:41:49.191 --> 00:41:52.760
I'd like to have $2 billion.
Now I'm willing to split it with all you guys.

644
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.860
That doesn't mean it's going to happen,
right?

645
00:41:54.861 --> 00:41:56.810
And so you can see a real problem with this.

646
00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:00.620
The reason these solvent's are good is because they're organic and they're

647
00:42:00.621 --> 00:42:01.730
miscible with water.

648
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:05.870
But the visibility with water is what makes them bad cause it's hard to get out

649
00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:08.050
of the water again.
So,
uh,

650
00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.810
I don't know what progress has been made on this,
but anyhow,

651
00:42:11.811 --> 00:42:13.250
it's something that they would really like.

652
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:18.650
But then they thought of 13 processes that is not just solvent's but actual

653
00:42:18.651 --> 00:42:20.480
reactions that need improving.

654
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:26.050
And they thought ones that they already use heavily and 14 they suggested new

655
00:42:26.511 --> 00:42:30.230
processes that there isn't a good way to do now but would really be handy.

656
00:42:30.231 --> 00:42:33.170
A few if you could do them.
And then they voted.

657
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:38.410
So there were six companies represented doing the voting and each of them could,

658
00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:44.300
could cast five votes to choose among the 13 processes that need improving and

659
00:42:44.301 --> 00:42:48.950
another five votes among the 14 processes that they would like to have
available.

660
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:53.810
So this is,
this is the perspective from the people who really do it,

661
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:58.370
about what would be useful to do.
So current processes that need reviewing,

662
00:42:58.371 --> 00:43:03.371
all six of them voted that a way of doing a forming amids,

663
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.130
avoiding poor Adam economy reagents.

664
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:12.160
Now what that means is you're just trying to put this nitrogen onto a carboxylic

665
00:43:12.261 --> 00:43:13.520
acid to make an a mid.

666
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:17.630
But if you use other reagents that have an enormous number of atoms in it,

667
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:21.290
then necessarily you're going to have an enormous amount of waste generated,

668
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:24.140
right?
But if you could do it with Adam economy,

669
00:43:24.141 --> 00:43:27.050
so you have a minimum number of Adam's going in,

670
00:43:27.051 --> 00:43:29.170
in order to hope know,

671
00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:34.220
ideally would be just the element you want to have added to the molecule,

672
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:35.660
right?
For example,

673
00:43:35.661 --> 00:43:39.920
a catalyst might allow you to do that where a stoic geometric reagents where you

674
00:43:39.921 --> 00:43:44.780
have to add a whole mole of it wouldn't do it.
So then,
Ooh,

675
00:43:44.781 --> 00:43:47.120
activation for nuclear Phillips substitution,

676
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:50.780
this is something we've talked about a lot.
You make the,
Ooh,
you protonate it,

677
00:43:50.781 --> 00:43:52.430
you make it into an acid chloride,

678
00:43:52.431 --> 00:43:54.860
you make it into a Tassa late with the leaving group.

679
00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:59.120
But this is something that five of these industries still say as one of the most

680
00:43:59.121 --> 00:44:03.040
important things to develop.
A better way of activating,
Ooh,

681
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.980
for nucleus substitution,
reduction of Amids,

682
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:10.210
the carbonyl group in amids without using high drives a,

683
00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:14.870
so they say lithium aluminum hydride having likely way to 38 and four drives per

684
00:44:14.871 --> 00:44:17.780
molecule has the highest high dry density.

685
00:44:17.781 --> 00:44:22.510
So it's from the terms of Adam economy,
it's very good.
Uh,
it,

686
00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:25.790
but it code generates an inorganic byproduct,

687
00:44:25.791 --> 00:44:30.380
which is difficult to separate from the product and that makes this filtration

688
00:44:30.381 --> 00:44:34.980
slow.
You'll lose product when you're trying to filter it,
get absorbed in this,

689
00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.590
uh,
extra junk that's being made.

690
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.980
So they need something better than the available.
Hey,

691
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:46.160
a hydride reagents or to be able to do oxidation or EFP oxidation without using

692
00:44:47.161 --> 00:44:48.420
a chlorinated solvent.

693
00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:52.750
Four of them said that was a top priority and they noticed in,
in,

694
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:57.950
in connection with the oxidation that using the Ma,

695
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:02.410
the kinds of metals like chromium or osmium that we've talked about or are

696
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.533
manganese,

697
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:08.780
these are virtually been eliminated from pharmaceutical processes because small

698
00:45:08.881 --> 00:45:12.480
amounts of these metals can be injurious to the health.

699
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:16.170
So the FDA requires that there be none in there.

700
00:45:16.171 --> 00:45:20.820
So better is to use oxidation oxidizing agents that don't involve such metals

701
00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:23.880
when you're making pharmaceuticals.
Okay.

702
00:45:23.881 --> 00:45:28.470
Then safer and more environmentally friendly.
Mitsui,
Nobu reactions.

703
00:45:28.471 --> 00:45:30.990
Now we're going to talk about the myths and overreaction next,

704
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.610
but three said that was important.

705
00:45:32.611 --> 00:45:36.510
So it's worth knowing what the myths and Obu reaction is if they think it's so

706
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:41.430
important.
Friedel crafts reactions on unactivated systems,

707
00:45:41.431 --> 00:45:46.140
we talked about,
uh,
substituents that we're activating or deactivating,

708
00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:47.910
right?
But they'd like,

709
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:52.020
they're not good ways they say of doing their Friedel crafts reactions on

710
00:45:52.021 --> 00:45:54.630
unactivated systems.
At least two of them said that.

711
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.570
And two of them said nitration was a problem.

712
00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:59.970
Not because the reactions hard to do,

713
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:05.270
but because of the danger of explosion with nitric acid.
Hey,

714
00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:07.020
and now,
how about the new process.
