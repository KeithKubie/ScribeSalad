00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It turns out the answer is 32, which is pretty high.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here's 1 way to see it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's say that you had invited just 1 more person here, person X.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Then either X shows up or X doesn't.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We already had 8 possibilities with just these 3 friends,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but now we have 8 more where X shows up.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So there was the empty set, the empty list,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but that also gives us the empty list plus person X.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We had just LM, but now your friend X could show up as well.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So if it used to be 8 and you add a new friend, X, now it's 16.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And if you add another friend, Y, bringing you up to 5 friends,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
it goes from 16 to 32.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
In fact, in general, if you have N entries,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
there are 2 to the power of N possibilities.

00:00:50.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So there's going to be quite a lot of output.
