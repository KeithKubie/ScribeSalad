00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.010
When female mosquitoes poke their proboscis
through your skin so they can suck some of

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.510
your blood to be later used to make eggs,
they inject you with some of their saliva.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.400
This saliva helps them to drink your blood
more quickly, because it contains a cocktail

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.710
of anticoagulants.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.090
Once the female mosquito is full up of your
blood or is disturbed, she flies away, leaving

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.849
some of her saliva behind.

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.030
Your body then kicks your immune system in
gear as a response to the presence of this

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.030
saliva.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.140
It produces various antibodies which in turn
bind to the antigens in the mosquito’s saliva.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.920
This then triggers the release of histamine.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.790
Histamine is a nitrogen compound that, among
other things, triggers an inflammatory response.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.680
It also helps white blood cells and other
proteins to engage invaders in your body by

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.989
making the capillaries of these cells more
permeable.

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.199
Bottom line, the histamine ends up making
the blood vessels near the bite swell up.

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.879
This produces a pink, itchy bump where the
mosquito poked you.

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.830
Scratching the bump only makes this worse
because it causes more irritation and inflammation

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.920
of the sight, resulting in your immune system
thinking it needs more antibodies to get rid

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.409
of the foreign protein.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.549
So the more you scratch, the more it will
swell; the itchier it will get; and the longer

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.690
it will last.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.399
Only female mosquitoes drink blood.

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.409
They don’t need the blood for their own
nourishment; rather, they need it to be able

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.479
to produce eggs.

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.780
Once the female has safely acquired a “blood
meal”, she will rest for a few days while

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.049
her body develops the eggs from digesting
the proteins and iron in the blood, producing

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:42.320
amino acids which are used as the building
blocks for the synthesis of the egg yolk proteins.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.950
Male and female mosquitoes alike get their
nourishment from plant nectar and other sugar

00:01:46.950 --> 00:02:01.460
sources.
