00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:01.929
Voiceover: What I want to
talk about in this video

00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:05.717
are the notions of Electronegativity,

00:00:05.717 --> 00:00:13.071
electro, negati, negativity,

00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:15.692
and a closely, and a closely related

00:00:15.692 --> 00:00:22.003
idea of Electron Affinity,
electron affinity.

00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:24.405
And they're so closely
related that in general,

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:27.328
if something has a high electronegativity,

00:00:27.328 --> 00:00:29.719
they have a high electron affinity,

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.228
but what does this mean?

00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:34.351
Well, electron affinity
is how much does that atom

00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:37.705
attract electrons, how much
does it like electrons?

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:41.667
Does it want, does it
maybe want more electrons?

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:45.283
Electronegativity is a
little bit more specific.

00:00:45.283 --> 00:00:49.085
It's when that atom is
part of a covalent bond,

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:53.333
when it is sharing
electrons with another atom,

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.891
how likely is it or how badly does it want

00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:58.873
to hog the electrons
in that covalent bond?

00:00:58.873 --> 00:01:01.844
Now what do I mean by hogging electrons?

00:01:01.844 --> 00:01:03.820
So let me make, let me write this down.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:13.871
So how badly wants to hog,

00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:15.815
and this is an informal
definition clearly,

00:01:15.815 --> 00:01:18.803
hog electrons, keep the electrons,

00:01:18.803 --> 00:01:20.973
to spend more of their time closer to them

00:01:20.973 --> 00:01:23.572
then to the other party
in the covalent bond.

00:01:23.572 --> 00:01:28.258
And this is how, how
much they like electrons,

00:01:28.258 --> 00:01:32.732
or how much affinity they
have towards electrons.

00:01:32.732 --> 00:01:39.674
So how much they want electrons.

00:01:39.674 --> 00:01:41.043
And you can see that these are very,

00:01:41.043 --> 00:01:43.569
these are very related notions.

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.510
This is within the context
of a covalent bond,

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.732
how much electron affinity is there?

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:50.104
Well this, you can think of it
as a slightly broader notion,

00:01:50.104 --> 00:01:54.052
but these two trends go absolutely
in line with each other.

00:01:54.052 --> 00:01:55.883
And to think about, to just think about

00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:58.075
electronegativity makes it
a little bit more tangible.

00:01:58.075 --> 00:01:59.833
Let's think about one of the most famous

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:00.855
sets of covalent bonds,

00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:03.292
and that's what you see
in a water molecule.

00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:07.983
Water, as you probably know, is H two O,

00:02:07.983 --> 00:02:11.166
you have an oxygen atom,

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.934
and you have two hydrogens.

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:17.074
Each of the hydrogen's
have one valence electron,

00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:21.095
and the oxygen has, we see
here, at it's outermost shell,

00:02:21.095 --> 00:02:25.596
it has one, two, three, four,
five, six valence electrons.

00:02:25.596 --> 00:02:31.184
One, two, three, four,
five, six valence electrons.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:33.106
And so you can imagine,
hydrogen would be happy

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:35.398
if it was able to somehow
pretend like it had another

00:02:35.398 --> 00:02:37.788
electron then it would have
an electron configuration

00:02:37.788 --> 00:02:41.218
a stable, first shell that
only requires two electrons,

00:02:41.218 --> 00:02:42.621
the rest of them require eight,

00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:45.214
hydrogen would feel, hey
I'm stable like helium

00:02:45.214 --> 00:02:46.787
if it could get another electron.

00:02:46.787 --> 00:02:49.288
And oxygen would feel,
hey I'm stable like neon

00:02:49.288 --> 00:02:51.159
if I could get two more electrons.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.759
And so what happens is they
share each other's electrons.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:57.642
This, this electron can
be shared in conjunction

00:02:57.642 --> 00:02:59.206
with this electron for this hydrogen.

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:01.800
So that hydrogen can kind
of feel like it's using

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.125
both and it gets more stable,

00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:04.676
it stabilizes the outer shell,

00:03:04.676 --> 00:03:06.301
or it stabilizes the hydrogen.

00:03:06.301 --> 00:03:08.027
And likewise, that electron could be,

00:03:08.027 --> 00:03:10.494
can be shared with the hydrogen,

00:03:10.494 --> 00:03:13.027
and the hydrogen can kind
of feel more like helium.

00:03:13.027 --> 00:03:14.465
And then this oxygen can feel like

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:16.487
it's a quid pro quo,

00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:18.467
it's getting something in
exchange for something else.

00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:20.236
It's getting the electron, an electron,

00:03:20.236 --> 00:03:22.856
it's sharing an electron
from each of these hydrogens,

00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:26.646
and so it can feel like
it's, that it stabilizes it,

00:03:26.646 --> 00:03:30.261
similar to a, similar to a neon.

00:03:30.261 --> 00:03:32.447
But when you have these covalent bonds,

00:03:32.447 --> 00:03:34.193
only in the case where they are equally

00:03:34.193 --> 00:03:35.882
electronegative would you have a case

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.203
where maybe they're sharing,

00:03:37.203 --> 00:03:38.482
and even there what happens

00:03:38.482 --> 00:03:40.361
in the rest of the molecule might matter,

00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:42.323
but when you have something like this,

00:03:42.323 --> 00:03:43.507
where you have oxygen and hydrogen,

00:03:43.507 --> 00:03:45.515
they don't have the
same electronegativity.

00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:49.756
Oxygen likes to hog electrons
more than hydrogen does.

00:03:49.756 --> 00:03:51.416
And so these electrons are not gonna spend

00:03:51.416 --> 00:03:52.617
an even amount of time.

00:03:52.617 --> 00:03:54.639
Here I did it kind of just drawing these,

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.941
you know, these valence
electrons as these dots.

00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:59.490
But as we know, the electrons are in this

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.575
kind of blur around, around the,

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:06.665
around the actual nuclei,

00:04:06.665 --> 00:04:09.507
around the atoms that make up the atoms.

00:04:09.507 --> 00:04:11.971
And so, in this type of a covalent bond,

00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:15.459
the electrons, the two electrons
that this bond represents,

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.316
are going to spend more
time around the oxygen

00:04:18.316 --> 00:04:20.829
then they are going to
spend around the hydrogen.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.564
And these, these two
electrons are gonna spend

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:25.144
more time around the oxygen,

00:04:25.144 --> 00:04:27.425
then are going to spend
around the hydrogen.

00:04:27.425 --> 00:04:30.360
And we know that because
oxygen is more electronegative,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.773
and we'll talk about
the trends in a second.

00:04:31.773 --> 00:04:34.656
This is a really important
idea in chemistry,

00:04:34.656 --> 00:04:36.915
and especially later on as
you study organic chemistry.

00:04:36.915 --> 00:04:39.091
Because, because we know that

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:40.407
oxygen is more electronegative,

00:04:40.407 --> 00:04:41.761
and the electrons spend more time

00:04:41.761 --> 00:04:44.377
around oxygen then around hydrogen,

00:04:44.377 --> 00:04:47.135
it creates a partial
negative charge on this side,

00:04:47.135 --> 00:04:50.517
and partial positive charges
on this side right over here,

00:04:50.517 --> 00:04:55.712
which is why water has many of
the properties that it does,

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:59.292
and we go into much more in
depth in that in other videos.

00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:00.984
And also when you study organic chemistry,

00:05:00.984 --> 00:05:02.830
a lot of the likely reactions that are

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.745
going to happen can be predicted,

00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:06.525
or a lot of the likely molecules that form

00:05:06.525 --> 00:05:09.833
can be predicted based
on elecronegativity.

00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:10.872
And especially when you start going

00:05:10.872 --> 00:05:12.404
into oxidation numbers
and things like that,

00:05:12.404 --> 00:05:15.436
electronegativity will tell you a lot.

00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:19.037
So now that we know what
electronegativity is,

00:05:19.037 --> 00:05:21.435
let's think a little bit about what is,

00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:24.062
as we go through, as we start,

00:05:24.062 --> 00:05:27.880
as we go through, as
we go through a period,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.687
as say as we start in group one,

00:05:29.687 --> 00:05:35.177
and we go to group, and
as we go all the way

00:05:35.177 --> 00:05:38.464
all the way to, let's say the halogens,

00:05:38.464 --> 00:05:42.700
all the way up to the yellow
column right over here,

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.131
what do you think is going to be

00:05:44.131 --> 00:05:47.848
the trend for electronegativity?

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:49.232
And once again, one way to think about it

00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:50.629
is to think about the extremes.

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:53.965
Think about sodium, and
think about chlorine,

00:05:53.965 --> 00:05:54.935
and I encourage you to pause

00:05:54.935 --> 00:05:56.930
the video and think about that.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.624
Assuming you've had a go at it,

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:01.293
and it's in some ways the same idea,

00:06:01.293 --> 00:06:03.537
or it's a similar idea
as ionization energy.

00:06:03.537 --> 00:06:06.451
Something like sodium
has only one electron

00:06:06.451 --> 00:06:07.785
in it's outer most shell.

00:06:07.785 --> 00:06:09.855
It'd be hard for it to
complete that shell,

00:06:09.855 --> 00:06:12.036
and so to get to a stable
state it's much easier

00:06:12.036 --> 00:06:15.706
for it to give away that
one electron that it has,

00:06:15.706 --> 00:06:18.688
so it can get to a stable
configuration like neon.

00:06:18.688 --> 00:06:22.625
So this one really wants
to give away an electron.

00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:24.668
And we saw in the video
on ionization energy,

00:06:24.668 --> 00:06:26.783
that's why this has a
low ionization energy,

00:06:26.783 --> 00:06:29.590
it doesn't take much
energy, in a gaseous state,

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.196
to remove an electron from sodium.

00:06:32.196 --> 00:06:33.620
But chlorine is the opposite.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.708
It's only one away from
completing it's shell.

00:06:35.708 --> 00:06:37.580
The last thing it wants to
do is give away electron,

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.682
it wants an electron really,
really, really, really badly

00:06:40.682 --> 00:06:42.937
so it can get to a configuration of argon,

00:06:42.937 --> 00:06:45.984
so it can complete it's third shell.

00:06:45.984 --> 00:06:49.118
So the logic here is
that sodium wouldn't mind

00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:50.578
giving away an electron,

00:06:50.578 --> 00:06:52.880
while chlorine really
would love an electron.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.471
So chlorine is more
likely to hog electrons,

00:06:55.471 --> 00:06:59.727
while sodium is very
unlikely to hog electrons.

00:06:59.727 --> 00:07:00.953
So this trend right here,

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:02.505
when you go from the left to the right,

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.815
your electronegativity, let me write this,

00:07:04.815 --> 00:07:07.089
your getting more electronegative.

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:13.811
More electro, electronegative, as you,

00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:16.623
as you go to the right.

00:07:16.623 --> 00:07:18.237
Now what do you think
the trend is going to be

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:22.403
as you go down, as you go down in a group?

00:07:22.403 --> 00:07:25.774
What do you think the trend
is going to be as you go down?

00:07:25.774 --> 00:07:27.250
Well I'll give you a hint.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.246
Think about, think about
atomic radii, and given that,

00:07:31.246 --> 00:07:31.973
pause the video and think about

00:07:31.973 --> 00:07:32.896
what do you think the trend is?

00:07:32.896 --> 00:07:34.747
Are we gonna get more
or less electronegative

00:07:34.747 --> 00:07:36.871
as we move down?

00:07:36.871 --> 00:07:39.267
So once again I'm assuming
you've given a go at it,

00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:41.810
so as we know, from the
video on atomic radii,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.093
our atom is getting larger,
and larger, and larger,

00:07:44.093 --> 00:07:46.191
as we add more and more and more shells.

00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:50.838
And so cesium has one electron
in it's outer most shell,

00:07:50.838 --> 00:07:52.150
in the sixth shell,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.854
while, say, lithium has one electron.

00:07:55.854 --> 00:07:57.620
Everything here, all
the group one elements,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.471
have one electron in
it's outer most shell,

00:07:59.471 --> 00:08:01.746
but that fifty fifth electron,

00:08:01.746 --> 00:08:03.282
that one electron in the
outer most shell in cesium,

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:05.810
is a lot further away then
the outer most electron

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.334
in lithium or in hydrogen.

00:08:08.334 --> 00:08:12.156
And so because of that, it's, well one,

00:08:12.156 --> 00:08:14.460
there's more interference
between that electron and the

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.792
nucleus from all the other
electrons in between them,

00:08:16.792 --> 00:08:18.403
and also it's just further away,

00:08:18.403 --> 00:08:20.513
so it's easier to kind of grab it off.

00:08:20.513 --> 00:08:24.780
So cesium is very likely to give up,

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.698
it's very likely to give up electrons.

00:08:27.698 --> 00:08:30.752
It's much more likely to give
up electrons than hydrogen.

00:08:30.752 --> 00:08:33.159
So, as you go down a given group,

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:39.045
you're becoming less, less
electronegative, electronegative.

00:08:39.045 --> 00:08:41.115
So what, what are, based on this,

00:08:41.115 --> 00:08:44.586
what are going to be
the most electronegative

00:08:44.586 --> 00:08:46.016
of all the atoms?

00:08:46.016 --> 00:08:47.467
Well they're going to be the ones

00:08:47.467 --> 00:08:50.447
that are in the top and the
right of the periodic table,

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.478
they're going to be these right over here.

00:08:52.478 --> 00:08:54.634
These are going to be
the most electronegative,

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:56.837
Sometimes we don't think as
much about the noble gases

00:08:56.837 --> 00:08:59.092
because they aren't, they
aren't really that reactive,

00:08:59.092 --> 00:09:01.133
they don't even form covalent bond,

00:09:01.133 --> 00:09:02.597
because they're just happy.

00:09:02.597 --> 00:09:03.896
While these characters up here,

00:09:03.896 --> 00:09:06.119
they sometimes will form covalent bonds,

00:09:06.119 --> 00:09:09.855
and when they do, they really
like to hog those electrons.

00:09:09.855 --> 00:09:11.524
Now what are the least electronegative,

00:09:11.524 --> 00:09:13.620
sometimes called very electropositive?

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.570
Well these things down
here in the bottom left.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.328
These, over here, they have only,

00:09:18.328 --> 00:09:19.569
you know in the case of cesium,

00:09:19.569 --> 00:09:21.835
they have one electron to give away

00:09:21.835 --> 00:09:25.333
that would take them to a
stable state like, like xenon,

00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:27.510
or in the case of these group two elements

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.525
they might have to give away two,

00:09:28.525 --> 00:09:29.547
but it's much easier to give away two

00:09:29.547 --> 00:09:31.813
then to gain a whole bunch of them.

00:09:31.813 --> 00:09:34.145
And they're big, they're big atoms.

00:09:34.145 --> 00:09:35.925
So those outer most electrons are getting

00:09:35.925 --> 00:09:39.448
less attracted to the positive nucleus.

00:09:39.448 --> 00:09:40.718
So the trend in the periodic table

00:09:40.718 --> 00:09:42.562
as you go from the bottom left,

00:09:42.562 --> 00:09:44.787
to the top right,

00:09:44.787 --> 00:09:48.787
you're getting more, more
electro, electronegative.
