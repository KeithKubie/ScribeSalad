00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.009
In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, we’re
always left asking the question: how could

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.160
anyone do this to another person?

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.259
While nothing can excuse their actions, maybe
psychology can help us understand the mind

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:11.920
of a terrorist.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.810
Hello everyone, I’m Julian and this is DNews.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.570
Terrorists are defined as a non-state group
that use violence against non-combatants for

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.820
political gain.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.270
Their goal is to instill fear, and they achieve
it by targeting innocent people where they

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.270
feel safe.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.930
This brutality is hard for us to comprehend,
so some may reason that a terrorist must be

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.960
mentally unstable in some way.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.090
According to psychologist John Horgan, who
has written multiple books on the subject

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.610
of terrorism, psychologists have been trying
for over 40 years to identify the personality

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.170
disorder that defines a terrorist.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.310
Are they psychopathic?

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.899
Are they anti-social?

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.710
Is there one defining characteristic that
unites them?

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.320
Unsatisfyingly, there is no one archetype
that every terrorist neatly conforms to.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.100
There are risk factors and common threads
though.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.250
Recruits are often motivated to join terrorist
groups because they feel alienated or disenfranchised,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.399
or think they are the victims of a social
injustice.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.080
They may be frustrated by other methods of
political change, want to take immediate action,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.700
and don’t have a problem with violence against
the state.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.080
Psychologist Steve Taylor from Leeds Beckett
University in the UK writes that it’s often

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.670
adolescent men who are drawn to this life,
because they’re at a point when they are

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.260
looking for a sense of belonging and purpose.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.080
Once in the group, they develop an “us”
vs “them” mentality that makes it easy

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.100
to switch off empathy to the victims of their
attacks.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.560
To them the deaths they cause are more akin
to destroying an object than ending a life.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.220
Strangely though, sometimes they draw arbitrary
lines.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.260
Horgan interviewed a former Irish Republican
Army bombing instructor who left the group

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.740
after the IRA murdered a pregnant officer.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.130
Other people Horgan spoke to became disillusioned
when their group robbed a bank.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.540
To them the killing was acceptable, but theft
was not.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.590
Sometimes though, recruits are just bored
and looking for adventure, or they’re worried

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.330
about not leaving a lasting legacy.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.689
People with little going for them in their
former lives are more likely to support the

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.170
actions of a group rather than form opinions
as an individual and voice dissent.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.500
This groupthink can lead to further radicalization
of all the members.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.090
Wanting to support and look out for each other
also becomes another motivation for killing.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.700
Dr. Clark R. McCauley, director of the Solomon
Asch Center for Study of Ethnopolitical Conflict

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.590
at Bryn Mawr College, points out, modern militaries
use the same techniques by stripping soldiers

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.890
of individuality and placing the goals of
the group first.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.800
Terrorists who do disagree with the group
will feel pressure to remain silent, because

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.180
they fear the consequences of voicing dissent.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.960
Horgan points out they don’t have the option
to really leave either, as state governments

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.720
will offer little sympathy to deserters.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.459
It’s tempting to boil down terrorists to
one trait or other.

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.220
The so-called "Islamic State," or ISIS, is
a group that’s stated goal is to create,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.930
well, an islamic state, and so a facile conclusion
is their faith is to blame.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.450
But according to political scientist Dr. Max
Abrahms, groups like that are quote, ”ignorant

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.460
people with respect to religion and they are
generally the newest members to the religion."

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.890
Horgan agrees with that assessment, saying
that young converts are more susceptible to

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.180
recruiters because they lack a deeper religious
knowledge that would help them reject extremist

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.180
arguments.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.450
But Horgan insists that even if a perfect
model of a terrorist could be identified,

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.450
it wouldn’t be very useful.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.769
After all you can’t arrest people just because
they have the potential to join violent extremists.

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.709
Instead he says we should be focusing on understanding
the paths that lead them there and giving

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.280
them options to get out.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.440
Plenty of people who join up with radicals
eventually become disenchanted.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.200
They realize that the group doesn’t really
serve their ideals, or isn’t the utopian

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.239
society the recruiters made it out to be.

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.620
Of course, Horgan and the people who study
terrorists have a tough job cut out for them.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.480
Terrorist groups rely on fear tactics because
they are tiny minorities, and the people who

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.269
leave and are willing to talk to researchers
are an even smaller subset of that.

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.550
It’s a pressing problem that’s tough to
study, so hypotheses abound but there’s

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.659
very little in the way of actual data.

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.709
Once again, more research is needed.

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.090
Even though there are a lot of paths people
take to join groups like ISIS, for some reason

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.140
an unusually high number come from one town
in Belgium.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.470
Lisette explains why over on Seeker Daily.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:08.069
Whether you’ve been directly affected by
terrorism or not, we encourage you to find

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.159
a way to help.

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.280
Doing good anonymously is great, but if you
want to share what you’ve done or give others

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.280
ideas on how to get involved, we have a comments
section down there.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.159
Let’s try and make the world a better place,
and I’ll see you next time on DNews.
