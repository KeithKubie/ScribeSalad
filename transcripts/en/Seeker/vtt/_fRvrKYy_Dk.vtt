00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.170
YOU PLOP DOWN IN BED AFTER A NIGHT OF DRINKING
ONLY TO FEEL THE ROOM SPINNING WILDLY AROUND

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.060
YOU...YOU HAVE THE DREADED SPINS.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.660
HERE'S WHY THEY HAPPEN.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.000
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.340
HEY THIS IS ANNIE FOR DNEWS.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.679
SO LET'S SAY YOU HAD ONE TOO MANY TONIGHT.

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.489
YOU STUMBLE ONTO YOUR BED OR THE NEAREST COUCH
TO CRASH, BUT ONCE YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES YOU

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:25.099
GET THE SENSATION OF SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
ON THE WORLD'S LEAST ENJOYABLE MERRY GO ROUND...OFTEN

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.220
ALONG WITH NAUSEA AND DOUBLE VISION THAT MAKES
IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE SLEEP YOU NEED.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.640
YOUR OPTIONS ARE TO WAIT IT OUT, OR TO WRAP
YOURSELF IN A COLD PORCELAIN EMBRACE TO RID

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.340
YOURSELF OF THE TOXINS...AND HOPEFULLY GET
TO SLEEP..

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.340
GOOD TIMES.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.340
BUT WHAT CAUSES IT?

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.680
OTHER THAN THE OBVIOUS ANSWER OF THE FOUR
SHOTS OF FIREBALL YOU TOOK TONIGHT, THE SPINS

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.430
HAVE TO DO WITH YOUR INNER EAR.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.570
IN THERE, YOU HAVE SEMI CIRCULAR CANALS THAT
ARE FILLED WITH A FLUID, CALLED endo-lymph

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.920
and a gelationous structure called the cupula.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.280
IN THE CUPULA ARE CELLS COVERED IN TINY HAIRS.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.120
THIS IS CALLED THE vestibular system, AND
IT HELPS TO REGULATE YOUR BALANCE.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.170
WHEN YOU DRINK A LOT, THE ALCOHOL THINS YOUR
BLOOD - AND WHEN THE INNER EAR RECEIVES THIS

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.509
THINNED BLOOD, IT THROWS OFF THE DENSITY BETWEEN
THE FLUID AND THE CUPULA - CAUSING THOSE TINY

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.190
HAIRS TO BEND ARTIFICIALLY.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.130
THIS IS WHAT SENDS A FALSE SIGNAL TO YOUR
BRAIN THAT YOU'RE ROTATING WHEN YOU'RE REALLY

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.130
NOT.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.249
AND GUESS WHAT PARTY ANIMALS - MIXING BOOZE
WITH WEED IS OFTEN REPORTED AS MAKING THE

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:17.359
SPINS WORSE, AT LEAST ANECDOTALLY - LIKE ON
THIS YAHOO!

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:18.359
ANSWERS THREAD.

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.399
BUT IT IS PROVEN THAT ALCOHOL AND POT CAN
AMPLIFY EACH OTHER'S EFFECTS.

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.350
INTERESTINGLY, A 2001 STUDY SHOWED THAT PEOPLE
WHO SMOKED MARIJUANA AND THEN DRANK ALCOHOL

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.810
ENDED UP WITH HIGHER THC LEVELS IN THEIR BLOOD
THAN THOSE WHO HAD JUST SMOKED THE POT.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.090
ONE EXPLANATION IS THAT ALCOHOL CAUSES CHANGES
IN YOUR BLOOD VESSELS AND INCREASES ABSORPTION

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.090
OF THC.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.340
SO NO - CONTRARY TO WHAT THAT ONE GUY FROM
COLLEGE TOLD YOU ONCE - SMOKING WEED IF YOU'RE

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.530
DRUNK WILL NOT "SOBER YOU UP".

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.740
IN FACT, THE TWO CAN ADD UP TO MORE THAN THE
SUM OF THEIR PARTS...IN TERMS OF YOUR BUZZ,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.709
AND THE CONSEQUENCES YOU MAY FACE LATER.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:49.770
BUT LET'S SAY IT'S TOO LATE.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.759
THE ROOM IS ALREADY SPINNING AND THERE YOU
ARE LYING IN BED TOO DRUNK TO SLEEP.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.880
NOW THERE'S NO DIRECT SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT FOR
THIS, BUT LOTS OF PEOPLE SAY DROPPING ONE

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.009
FOOT ON THE GROUND OR ON A WALL TO COMPENSATE
FOR THE DISORIENTATION YOUR INNER EAR IS HANDLING,

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.459
CAN HELP RESTORE BALANCE AND REDUCE THE SPINS.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:09.170
BREATHING DEEPLY, NOT LOOKING AT MOVING OBJECTS,
AND THROWING UP - AS UNPLEASANT AS THAT IS

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.530
- MIGHT HELP YOU GET TO SLEEP FASTER.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.950
BUT I'M NO SCIENTIST, JUST A PERSON WHO HAS
HAD THE SPINS BEFORE AND READS A LOT OF YAHOO!

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.950
ANSWERS THREADS.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.140
AND OF COURSE WE'RE OBLIGATED TO SAY...CONSIDER
NOT TAKING THAT 2 AM FIREBALL SHOT.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.750
HAVE YOU EVER HAD THIS BEFORE AFTER DRINKING
TOO MUCH?

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.071
