00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.530
This team of of scientists and engineers are
camped above an abandoned Cold War military

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.190
base that’s buried 30 meters below Greenland’s
ice sheet.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.770
William: “That is Delta storm condition.”

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.390
They’re part of a special climate monitoring
program, because the underground base that

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.980
they’re studying, could eventually thaw
out and unearth thousands of tons of toxic

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.150
waste.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:42.750
“On the top of the world, below the surface
of the giant ice cap, a city is buried.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.200
This is the story of Camp Century.”

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.620
During the early years of the Cold War, the
U.S. started paying close attention to Greenland.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.560
To protect the island from creeping Soviet
influence, the US and Denmark signed the 1951

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.140
Defense of Greenland Act.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.800
“Today on the island of Greenland…..the
United States Army has established an unprecedented

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.400
nuclear powered Arctic research center.”

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.189
Army personnel put the latest advances in
polar construction to the test, building several

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.690
military bases out on the ice sheet... one
of them was Camp Century.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.250
“We finally picked this plateau, a smooth
white plain of ice for as far as you could

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.250
see.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.860
This was the closest to location to Thule
our supply base, which would not be affected

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.470
by summer thaw."

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.780
William: “Researchers were doing a lot of
very fundamental glacier and climate research.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.520
Camp Century is probably best known for being
home of the first deep ice core to the Greenland

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.520
ice sheet.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.390
It's like nothing we have today.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.219
It was just this phenomenal marriage of technology
and innovation in the 1960s.”

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:56.149
They built an entire underground city, complete
with housing, kitchens, lounges, a library,

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.090
scientific labs, communications center, supply
rooms, a chapel, scientific labs, and even

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.090
a barber shop.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.350
William: “And the whole camp, which could
house up to 200 people on a year-round basis

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.930
was powered by a nuclear power plant.”

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.960
The US Atomic Energy Commission developed
small, portable nuclear power reactors that

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.390
could be built in remote locations, and Camp
Century was the perfect proving ground.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.920
They flew over 400 tons of equipment to Greenland
to build a PM-2A reactor, and they carefully

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.930
transported the materials to the base, where
scientists then installed it to power the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.349
polar camp.

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:41.360
“Now here this..all control rods withdrawn,
PM2A went critical at 06 52 hours.”

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.709
Camp Century was presented to the world as
a heroic conquest of the Arctic, in man’s

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.520
never ending pursuit for knowledge and scientific
progress.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.050
William: “They had Walter Cronkite up there
doing news hour specials back in the '60s.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.050
Everybody knew about it.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.530
It was no secret.”

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.080
But, this scientific endeavor was actually
part of a covert U.S. Army operation, codenamed

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.769
Project Iceworm.

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.840
In response to escalating Cold War tensions,
the U.S. wanted to position 600 medium range

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.590
missiles with nuclear warheads underneath
the Greenland ice sheet.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.540
All was going according to plan, until engineers
noticed the ice that surrounded the base...was

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.690
shifting faster than initially projected.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.769
William: “The people who were working at
Camp Century did not have an understanding

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:27.769
of climate change.

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.290
They didn't have solid records, global climate
models, these big data sets that let you see

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.909
an overview of what's happening to earth's
climate.”

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:44.209
The ice sheet started to destabilize the underground
tunnels faster than scientists projected.

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.360
William: “When Camp Century was decommissioned,
only the nuclear reactor was taken out for

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.319
destructive testing, and the rest of the camp
was left in place, and they closed the doors

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.410
and left.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.540
It was abandoned on the assumption that climate
wouldn't change, and it would continue to

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.730
snow at Camp Century forever.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.670
The perpetual snowfall would entomb all of
the base infrastructure and eventually bury

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.670
it.”

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.140
But the climate has changed.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.410
Temperatures have reached record highs in
the Arctic and Greenland’s ice sheet is

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.650
melting at an unprecedented rate, which could
turn Camp Century’s abandoned waste into

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.230
a major environmental risk.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.020
So, a team of scientists, including William,
went back to the site.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.250
William: “In 2017, the government of Denmark,
at the request of the government of Greenland,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.220
started the Camp Century climate monitoring
program.We set up a bunch of instruments that

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.510
are erected on the ice sheet surface, and
then we drill in and we put probes into the

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.510
ice sheet.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.080
It keeps a real-time data stream coming from
the Camp Century site where we monitor a bunch

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.420
of things, mainly the temperature of the snow,
the temperature of the ice, the air temperature.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.030
That will help us model how the snow and ice
at Camp Century is going to behave over the

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.420
next century.”

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.790
They also mapped the debris left behind using
ice penetrating radar.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.950
William: “The radar is perhaps the most
time-consuming because you have to manually

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.910
tow it at a slow speed.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.350
It sends out a pulse of energy that goes down
into the ice, and then it reflects off different

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.170
things and comes back to a receiver.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.970
It was 80 kilometers in total.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.200
That's a lot of radar.”

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.090
They turned the radar profiles into a 3D map
of the entire debris field.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.980
William: “ At Camp Century, you get those
horizontal lines of annual accumulation layers,

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.400
but then you also get these big pockets of
chaos.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.140
You can see the main tunnels.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:40.110
You can see pieces of debris down to about
the size of a vehicle, maybe even a fuel drum.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.130
Our preliminary estimate is that we think
the debris field is about 55 acres in size,

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.650
which is about 100 football fields, and we
think it contains just over 9,000 metric tons

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.910
of debris.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.680
We're very interested in how deep everything
is and where it is so that when we go to do

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.430
our simulations of how much melt water that
might be at the site over the next century

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.100
and how deep it is going to percolate into
the ice sheet.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.320
There is concern that if melt water starts
interacting with the debris field, it could

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.190
mobilize some contaminants.”

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.190
Those contaminants include diesel fuel, nuclear
waste like radioactive coolant water, and

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.290
other toxic chemicals from the camp’s buildings
and general infrastructure.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.190
And all of that is on track to seep into the
environment.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.820
William: “In the 1960s, the building codes
were a little different.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.350
So we know, for example, that the materials
they were using at Camp Century were rich

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.970
in PCBs and other types of persistent contaminants.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.470
And they still come out of the ground kicking.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.920
They don't deteriorate at all.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.700
We're at a fork in the road for Camp Century.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.940
Under the “business as usual” climate,
it looks likely that we will start to see

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.800
more melt than snowfall at Camp Century.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.500
But if we stick with something like Paris
Agreement, we can keep more snowfall that

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.790
melt beyond the end of the century.”

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.060
But this does raise questions about who is
ultimately responsible for the clean up.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.280
And that leads us into a geopolitical gray
area.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.690
Camp Century was a U.S. base on Greenland
soil, which was governed by Denmark.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.620
And currently, no party has taken responsibility
for the abandoned base.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.610
And International environmental law really
hasn’t figured something like this out yet.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:26.050
William: “It's really a microcosm of the
multi-generational, even multinational implications

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:33.290
in climate change facing us now, and we have
to be very aware of future projections, and

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:38.090
take action today to go on the high mitigation
and low emissions route.”
