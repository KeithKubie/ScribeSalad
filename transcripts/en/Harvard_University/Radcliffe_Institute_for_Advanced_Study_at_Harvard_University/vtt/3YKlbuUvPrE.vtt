[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.740
-Thank you, Judy, for your
introduction and your kind

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.620
words, and to all of you for
your presence here today.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.660
I feel extremely grateful
to Radcliffe and the Harvard

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.080
Scholar at Risk Program for
giving me the opportunity

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.230
to find an intellectual
sanctuary where

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.130
I can feel safe.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.690
I feel truly honored
to be here and being

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.160
able to share with
you my concerns

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.910
about the fight
against corruption

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.500
and the future of my country.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.270
When I was starting to
become a lawyer in Guatemala,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.540
I dreamed that someday
I will be able to do

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.820
a post-graduate studies
in a foreign country.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.670
But never in my wildest dreams
I imagine that one day I

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.670
will be a scholar at Harvard.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.390
So being a fellow
at Radcliffe makes

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.100
me feel that life has
been very generous to me.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.820
For a Guatemalan woman,
having a college degree

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.540
is a great achievement
since the opportunities

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.420
to go to university
are very limited.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.540
Only 2% of the
population is able to go

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.250
to university, and a
fraction of tenths of degree.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.370
So I consider myself extremely
privileged for the learning

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.490
opportunities that I have had.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.510
Serving my country
as a judge was

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.410
the best way to
show my appreciation

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.160
for that privilege.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.120
Nelson Mandela
said that education

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.420
is the most powerful
weapon which you

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.580
can use to change the world.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.270
He argued that education
is the great engine

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.310
of personal development.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.020
It is through education that
the daughter of a peasant

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.610
can become a doctor, that
the son of a mine worker

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.240
can become the head of the mine,
that the child of a farmers

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.610
worker can become the
president of a great nation.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.040
It is what we make out of what
we have, not what we are given,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.240
that separates one
person from another.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.580
I do believe that if
you have the opportunity

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.990
to grow and develop
your skills, you also

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.180
have the responsibility
with your community

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.330
to contribute to build a
better country so others

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.980
can have the same
opportunities that I had.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.790
During this presentation,
I will give you

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.130
some highlights and general
information about Guatemala.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.850
Then I will present some facts
about the judicial system,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.800
and the role of the
International Commission

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.150
Against Impunity,
known as [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.260
At last, I will
elaborate the challenges

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.070
that my country face in order
to become a true democracy.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.240
Located at the center of
the American continent,

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.840
Guatemala has a strategic
location for business

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.540
and exchange of goods.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.660
It is known as the
country of eternal spring,

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.420
since the weather is
70 degrees all year

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.690
round in the central region.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.950
It is the perfect land for
growing any kind of crops

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.290
since there is a variety
of microclimates.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.410
There's also beautiful scenery.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.910
Guatemala has a wide, diverse,
and multicultural population.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.480
It is one of the countries
in the region with one

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.230
of the largest assessment
of ethnic groups.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.130
Most of them are
descendant of the Mayans.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.530
Each community has its
own custom and languages.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.230
In Guatemala, there are 24
different spoken language

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.170
in total.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.830
We have a rich history,
great archaeological sites,

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.970
and many beautiful
places to visit.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.380
If we didn't have
security problems,

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.530
Guatemala could sustain itself
just with the tourist industry.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.780
It could be the perfect place
for any kind of vacation

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.720
or to relax.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.590
But despite its
beauty, Guatemala

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.260
is one of the most violent
country in the region.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:46.920
Last year, the rate of murders
was 35 per 100,000 inhabitants.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.240
The level of impunity is 98%.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.660
So as all you can
imagine, it is really

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.070
a paradise for
criminal activities,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.280
causing many violations
of human rights.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.650
This is what happened in
Guatemala almost every day.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.360
The economy of
Guatemala is something

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.990
that I also would like to
show you in very short.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.540
The gini is one of the
highest in Latin America, 55.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.030
And the income per capita
is only $5,200 a year.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.930
Guatemala's population
is about 50 million.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.340
But more than half of the
population are indigenous.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.070
And they are the
ones more exposed

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.590
to poverty and extreme
poverty, creating

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.390
an environment of not
only monetary inequality,

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.570
but also racial issues.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.040
Many people consider Guatemala
to be a poor country.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.590
I think it is not true.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.830
It is a country with
lots of potential

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.960
that has been plundered
by terrible rulers who

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.200
usually become millionaires
after being power.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.880
Politicians usually get
together in political parties

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.440
to take advantage of the
institutional weakness

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.480
and promote
corruption, which has

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.521
brought the country to the
worst institutional crisis

00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:06.145
in its history.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.780
Public safety is an
issue of greatest concern

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.970
to Guatemala's citizens.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.070
And almost no
family that has not

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.950
been a victim of different
type of violence.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.460
For me, personally it's
extremely difficult

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.620
to forget the day
more than 10 years ago

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.510
when I had planned to go to
the beach for a long weekend.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.620
I had to stop at the
bakery to buy bread.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.060
While I did, I left four of my
kids in the car with a nanny.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.680
Suddenly, two man
entered the bakery.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.250
One pointed a gun to the
lady that sold the bread.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.820
And the other approached me.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.440
He placed a gun in my
stomach and asked me

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.540
for the keys of my car.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.560
I had left the keys in the car.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.980
The engine was on.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.780
So I told him to get the key,
my kids out of the car first,

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.170
and beg him not to hurt him.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.100
It was the most terrifying
moment in my life.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.070
But I thank God that all my kids
were safe, and also the nanny,

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.140
and it was only a bad incident.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.040
Many of these things that
citizens in a country where

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.140
there is freedom and
peace can do normally

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.260
are very risky
situations in Guatemala.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.410
Ordinary activities that do
as part of your normal life

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:29.456
are there life threatening, like
riding a bus, riding a bicycle,

00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:31.080
talking in the cell
phone meanwhile you

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.750
walk or meanwhile
you're in the phone.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.050
It is common to see heavy
armed guards in the streets,

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.270
in supermarkets, in bakeries,
pharmacies, movie theaters.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.750
There are more private guards
than policemen in Guatemala.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.190
But this is another topic
that I will not address today.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.690
Middle and upper class citizens
live in closed neighborhoods,

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.120
like the ones we see here.

00:06:57.789 --> 00:06:59.830
Usually, they live in
closed neighborhoods closed

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.510
by high walls, bars, and
razor wire that resembles more

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.850
a ghetto than a neighborhood.

00:07:09.026 --> 00:07:12.770
The robbery of cell phones
is an epidemic problem.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.790
Every member of my family has
been assaulted at least once.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.230
Before my older son
was 18 years old,

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.900
he had been robbed
three times at gun point

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.570
in the middle of the day.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.730
In every case, the thieves
were younger than him.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.210
And all they wanted
was his cell phone.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.440
One of the most dangerous
jobs in the country

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.260
is to be a bus driver
or a taxi driver

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.840
because the guns can kill you
if you aren't willing to pay

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.160
the fee of extortion.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.860
If you are a user of
the public transport,

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.540
and happens to be
in the bus, you also

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.180
have a high chance
to be assault. Let's

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.090
look at the statistics.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.530
In our report about the
violence in the human rights

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:58.620
situation from
January to June 2015,

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.680
131 persons related to
the transport service

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.530
had been killed.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.270
This is something
to worry about.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.930
So there is no
doubt that Guatemala

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.330
is one of the most violent
countries in the region.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.650
According to the United
Nations, the Central America

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:19.230
northern triangle is the worst
second most violent region

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.500
behind South Africa.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.970
We cannot ignore that the
country suffered internal armed

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.910
conflict the lasted 36 years.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:33.340
The war left our region with a
legacy of different structures

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.919
that were built
during the period

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.549
to insure impunity,
corruption, and violence.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:39.840
And they're still
operating today.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.809
I do believe that all
Guatemalans have wounds

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:43.799
from the war.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:48.170
The Civil War ended in
1996 with the signature

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.504
of the peace accords.

00:08:49.504 --> 00:08:51.170
But the agreements
haven't been honored.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.495
So after almost 20 years
of the signature of peace,

00:08:54.495 --> 00:08:57.750
as a society we have the
same problems or worse

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:04.220
than before the war that
started more than 50 years ago.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.590
As a consequence of the violence
and the lack of opportunities,

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.110
thousands of people
migrate to other countries

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.130
looking to have a better life.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.850
Last year, the migration
of kids without parents

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.010
to the border of
the United States

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.500
was declared as an origin
humanitarian situation

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.890
by President Barack Obama.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.720
Being forced to
leave your country

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.300
is one of the most painful
situations to face in life.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.770
For Guatemalans
and many Hispanics,

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.760
the ties to the family,
the land, and their culture

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.620
are very strong.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.320
When you decide to
leave your community,

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.650
you do it because there
is no other choice.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.310
I think is not easy to
understand why a family would

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.820
send their kids to a
strange country facing

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.910
any kind of threats
in the journey.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.380
So maybe a story
about a boy named

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.150
Angel can help us
understand what is happening

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.450
in the Central American region.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.640
So I want you to meet Angel.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.440
Last July, meanwhile
many Guatemalans

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.840
were in the streets claiming the
government to stop corruption

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.325
and asking the
president to resign,

00:10:12.325 --> 00:10:15.180
Angel was fighting for his life.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.320
A gang kidnapped
Angel from his school.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.250
The days after, he was found
at the bottom of a deep ravine.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.120
Incredible, he survived.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.310
He told his family
that the gang wanted

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:32.100
to force him to kill a bus
driver as a rite of initiation.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.810
Angel was not a violent kid.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.110
Actually, he was a
very good student.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.070
The gang members probably
didn't knew that Angel's father

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.830
was a bus driver.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.450
Angel refused to kill anyone.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.960
So the gangster
decide to kill him.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.910
But they gave him two options--
either to be dismembered,

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.570
or thrown at the ravine.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.125
He chose the last one.

00:10:53.125 --> 00:10:55.360
The day after, he
was found alive.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.910
But the story doesn't end here.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:01.640
The firemen that rescue him
took him to a public hospital.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.040
As usual in Guatemala,
there were no medicines.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.920
So his father had to go and buy
medicine and sterilize water

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.300
for the doctors to be
able to cure his words.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.820
In the meantime, Angel died.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.110
As a Guatemalan
journalist pointed out,

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.205
this 12-year-old boy was killed
twice-- one by the violence,

00:11:22.205 --> 00:11:25.275
and the other by a system
marked by corruption.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:34.550
So maybe this can help us
understand why the parents are

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.230
willing to send their
kids away, because this

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.760
is what their they're facing.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.270
As we all know, governments
have certain obligations

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.790
toward their citizens.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.590
Among these, they should
guarantee security and justice

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:48.680
for all.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.910
If the institutions that are in
charge of this important task

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.630
do not do their job,
then the rule of law

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:55.560
is an empty concept.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:03.080
Guatemala is a clear example
of a weak state where

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.160
the correlation between
corruption, weak institutions,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.800
impunity, and violence has a
clear impact in human rights

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.820
violations of different kinds.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.960
Since we live in an era of
globalization, and in many ways

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:22.830
we are related, this affects
other states as well.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:30.430
Martin Luther King said that
injustice anywhere is a threat

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.350
to justice everywhere.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.020
We are caught in an inescapable
network of mutality tied

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.890
in a single garment of destiny.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:42.070
Whatever affects one directly,
affects all indirectly.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.200
I do believe that the
words of Martin Luther King

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.980
are true today.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.400
The effects of impunity
and constant violation

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.790
of human rights in
one small country

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.750
can affect the stability
of its neighbors.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:57.440
According to our research done
by a foreign policy magazine,

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.020
one of the three most
important foreign policy

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.440
issues facing the
United States today

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:08.110
is the issue failure
or failing states.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.600
Guatemala has a long
history of good relations

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.170
with many nations that
have tried to help

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.370
the country in different ways.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.250
For example, the sign
of the peace agreement

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.920
was possible thanks
to the mediation

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.230
of the international community.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.970
The European Union has
spent millions of Euros

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.410
in different projects to help
build better institutions.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.710
The United States has a program
called the Central American

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.360
Regional Security
Initiative, known as CARS.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.120
This program focuses on the
rule of low promotion, police

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.300
professionalization, and poverty
reduction in Central America.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.750
But it seems that despite all
the help that we have received,

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:52.800
nothing has changed since 1980
when the program was launched.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.120
So in 2006, 10 years after the
sign of the peace agreements,

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.850
the violence claim as much
lives as the civil war did.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.000
The high levels of impunity
force the Guatemalan government

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.390
to ask the United
Nations for help

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.510
in the fight against corruption.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.550
So the International Commission
Against Impunity in Guatemala

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.820
was created.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.354
This is what the former
Vice President Stein said.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.110
We realized that we couldn't
fix our institution alone.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.770
We figured that if member
states could ask the Security

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.940
Council for
peacekeepers, why not

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.050
help to address an
internal problem that

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:34.390
is as serious as
war, organized crime.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:39.000
This new institution from the
United Nations, know as CICIG,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.580
was conceived as
an independent body

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.220
to support the Public Prosecutor
Office, the National Police,

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.282
another state institutions
in the investigation

00:14:46.282 --> 00:14:49.650
of sensitive and
difficult cases.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.260
The ultimate goal is
that through CICIG work,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.430
national judicial
sector institutions

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:57.050
will be strengthened,
and be able to confront

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.200
illegal groups and organized
crime in the future.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.690
According to CICIG,
there are certain things

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.190
that the government
of Guatemala has

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.750
to do in order to
build the capacity

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.600
to fight against
impunity and corruption.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.090
One of those recommendation
is independence of judges.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.900
And that is something I would
like to tell you more about

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.720
and share my personal
experience in this manner.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.440
As a judge, I have
always been protective

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.510
of the judicial independence.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.215
I do believe that it is the
keystone of any republic

00:15:27.215 --> 00:15:29.190
and democratic system.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.200
I am also convinced that
through the proper application

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.980
of justice most of our
conflicts can be solved,

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.700
and we as a community can
achieve the freedom and peace

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.860
that we all desire.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.100
But in Guatemala
history, there has never

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.790
been independence
of the judiciary

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.165
from other branches of
power, the executive

00:15:47.165 --> 00:15:49.000
or the legislative.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.090
And nowadays, we have organized
crime, corrupt politicians,

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.460
and even law firms trying
to influence the judiciary.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.880
So the goal to build
a stronger institution

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.370
and gain judicial
independence is something

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.690
that the judges have
to build and insist on.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.150
On this regard,
Stephen Breyer said

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:14.290
that, ultimately, independence
is a matter of custom, habitat,

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.470
and institutional expectation.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.910
To build those customs,
habits, and expectations

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.920
require time and support, not
only from the bench and bar,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.980
but from the communities
where the judges serve.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.800
Unfortunately, it
may prove easier

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.312
to dismantle that independence
than to obtain it.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.250
That was the case during the
[INAUDIBLE] process of election

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.612
from magistrates from the
Appeals and Supreme Court

00:16:41.612 --> 00:16:42.570
last year in Guatemala.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.400
I think it's necessary to
tell you that in my country

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.330
there's a clear difference
between being a judge

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.700
and being a magistrate.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.430
A judge usually are
appointed in the lower

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.530
courts, which are called
Peace Courts or First Instance

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:02.880
Courts.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.329
They are named after a
long process of selection

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:07.990
by opposition that
requires a person

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.119
to prove their
knowledge, capacity,

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:12.609
and ability to become a judge.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:15.530
Then he or she will have to
go to the School of Judicial

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:19.630
Studies and be [INAUDIBLE],
previously to be appointed.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:22.660
But if a judge wants to become
a magistrate for the Appeal

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.970
or Supreme Court, the
process is totally different.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.370
First, the candidate has to go
through a process of nomination

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.985
by the nominating
committees better known

00:17:31.985 --> 00:17:34.260
as postulation commission.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.700
And then he or she will have
to be elected by the congress.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.780
Every five years, there are
election for magistrates.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.280
Many judges want to
become magistrates.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.020
But everybody knows it is
a high political process.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.290
And this is in the news.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.620
And everybody knows
that the process is not

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.200
something that is very clear.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.520
I have been a first instance
judge for almost seven years

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.950
and a substitute
magistrate for two,

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.540
and wanted to continue in
my position as a magistrate.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.200
Therefore, last year I
participated as a candidate

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.530
to be reelected in
the Court of Appeals.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.010
During the last election
of judges of higher courts,

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.930
there were many
claims of violation

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.530
of the constitutional law.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.340
Different human
rights organizations

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.920
present complaints.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.590
More than 80 lawsuits
for serious violations

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.580
took place during the process.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.670
The commissioner from
CICIG, [INAUDIBLE],

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.620
spoke out against the
process in the selection.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.690
The special repertoire
of independence

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:37.470
of judges and lawyers
of the United Nations

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:41.510
denouncing that the process
was against the basic principle

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:45.810
of independence of the
judiciary approved by the UN.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:51.110
According to this principle,
the qualification selection

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:55.120
has to do a lot with
selection and training.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.150
And I consider this
subject very important

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.080
because instead of appointing
the best candidates, those

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.550
with the background
experience and ability,

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.320
the court selection
process in Guatemala

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.220
has become a political game.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.880
Therefore, what
prevails is favoritism

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.140
and the granting of
privilege to individuals

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.710
that lack values,
principles, and morals ethics

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:18.100
required to fulfill such
a high respected position.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.800
Furthermore, some of
those who were appointed

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.000
are generally connected to
special interest groups and/or

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.750
to organized crime.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.570
As Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg said,

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.530
judicial independence is
vulnerable to assault.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.070
It can be shattered if
the society law exists

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:41.740
to serve does not take care
to assure its preservation.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.790
For many judges of
lower courts, it

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.960
was clear that the whole
process of election

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.430
of judges in the higher courts
was against the Constitution,

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.840
and above all, a clear violation
against the human right

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:56.041
for a citizen to have an
independent and impartial

00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:56.540
tribunal.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.620
Even though some of us had
applied to become magistrates,

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.000
we were convinced that the
process was a fraud organized

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.270
by corrupt politicians, broke
lawyers, and also unethical

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.210
lawyers, that were
looking forward

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.680
to take the judiciary
under their control.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.140
For me, it was the end of
our incipient democracy,

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:21.100
and the last step to
become a failed state.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.800
I felt terribly disappointed.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.246
So I decided to formulate a
legal opinion which clearly

00:20:26.246 --> 00:20:29.480
indicate interferes with
the judicial independence

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.140
by interested groups
and parallel powers.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.810
I always knew that
this was dangerous

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.560
and a very difficult battle.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.417
But it was worse not to try.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.770
I was the president
of an organization

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.040
of judges that promotes changes
inside the judicial system

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.880
called [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.330
So I present a legal
opinion to CICIG,

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.980
to the Office of the High
Commission of Human Rights,

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.770
and later to the prosecutor
of human rights in Guatemala

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.910
in order that his office
could present a complaint

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:04.540
at the Constitutional Court
and override the whole process.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.140
But, meanwhile this
happen, suddenly

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.600
on a Saturday
afternoon three days

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.970
before the election
of Courts of Appeals,

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.810
I receive a very weird message
in my Facebook from a lawyer

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.750
that I hardly remember.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:22.260
This is the copy of the message
that I received that day.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.900
It said, hello, Claudia.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.830
I'm Vernon Eduardo Gonzalez.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:29.640
We studied together in the
University Francisco Marroquin.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.290
I need to talk about the
issue of election of judges.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:32.850
It is urgent.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:34.607
My cell phone is--

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.070
I was very suspicious
of the message.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.820
But I decide to
call him and agreed

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.450
to meet alone with
[INAUDIBLE], a high rank

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.120
congressmen of the ruling
party and former president

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.720
of the congress.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.230
During the meeting, I
find out that Gonzalez

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.580
was the attorney of the Vice
President Roxana Baldetti,

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:56.210
and that they had present
a petition in the court

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:57.690
where I serve.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.200
In Guatemala, it's
unconstitutional for government

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.520
officials to hold position
with the political parties.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.060
But they wanted
the court to allow

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.350
the Vice President to
serve as a secretary

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.974
of the official party.

00:22:08.974 --> 00:22:11.140
The attorney of the Vice
President, Vernon Gonzalez,

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.750
and Congressman
Rivera offered me

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.500
to be elected as a magistrate in
exchange for a favorable ruling

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.576
to the vice president.

00:22:19.576 --> 00:22:23.870
The congressman clearly said,
you know that in this process

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:27.210
it doesn't matter your
experience, your background,

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.450
your knowledge.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.500
All that counts is
who do you know.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.950
And now you have the chance to
have good friends in Congress.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:36.510
We can help you to be elected.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.340
But you need to give
us this resolution

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.880
in favor of the Vice President.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.140
I was in shock.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.650
The 30 minutes that
the meeting lasted,

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.500
I knew I was not going
to give the resolution.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.980
But I didn't know how to react.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.380
I knew it was going to
be the end of my career.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.810
And I was terribly
nervous, because I

00:22:55.810 --> 00:23:00.720
was recording the conversation
without them knowing.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.570
At the end, I
denied the petition

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:07.310
in Monday, September 29, 2014.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.080
Next day, the Congress
voted to elect me

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.960
as a magistrate for
the Appeal Courts.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.830
But I could not accept the post
knowing that the whole process

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:18.350
was a scam.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.810
Then I took the time to
talk to some judges that

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.900
were elected as magistrates.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.730
I tried to convince
them to resign with me.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:26.990
But they didn't want to.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:29.480
Some of them were afraid
of the consequences.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.000
And others preferred to
have their job secure.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.070
I decided to resign as
an elected magistrate

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.870
and remain as a judge
in the lower courts.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.890
When I did, I publicly
denounced all the flaws

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.970
in the process of election.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:49.960
Later, a group of more than
80 judges backed me up.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.920
And we all asked the
Constitutional Court

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.510
to void the process.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:57.840
However, the judges who
support the claim immediately

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.170
received retaliation.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.740
And the newly elected
magistrate put pressure on them

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.920
to dissuade them.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.030
This pressure were in the form
of threats, and dismissal,

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:14.100
and reviews of prohibition by
the administrative [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.520
of the judiciary in
order to discharge them.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.960
In the meantime,
the high officials

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.360
of governments-- the
president, the vice president,

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.210
and many of the leaders
of the political parties--

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.030
in public declarations,
refute my statement

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.170
and ask for proofs.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.500
This was a clear interference
with the dependence

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.940
of the judiciary.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.730
They didn't knew at
that time that I also

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.535
made a complaint before CICIG
against the lawyer Gonzalez

00:24:39.535 --> 00:24:43.940
and the congressman Rivera on
charges of influence spending

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.340
and bribery.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.670
Along with the complaint,
I submitted the recording

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.410
of the conversation and the
offers of those involved.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:57.160
Three days after I resigned,
Guatemala Constitutional Court

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.420
decide to temporarily
suspend the swearing

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.510
of the judges of
the Supreme Court

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.980
and the Chamber of Appeals
elected for the period

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.480
2014-2019.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.840
All members of the
Institute of the Judiciary

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.070
made every effort
we could to ensure

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:16.150
that Guatemala citizens
and international community

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:19.430
knew what was going on
in the justice system.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:23.170
We went to radio, television
programs, organized forums,

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.010
interviews, and talks.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:28.070
The media covered
this issue abundantly.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:31.340
At international level, we
denounced the serious event

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.360
that threatened the democratic
system in our country.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.400
We wanted the world to
know because we desperately

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.320
needed help to save our
small but beautiful country

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.670
from corruption and impunity.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.280
I was able to go to Europe.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.030
In Brussels, I talked to
officials of the European

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.200
Commission and also met
with human right defenders.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.770
In Geneva, I went to the
Office of the High Commissioner

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:55.710
of Human Rights, the Office
of the Repertoire of Judicial

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.030
Independence.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:59.000
We also went to the
Inter-American Commission

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.180
of Human Rights of the
Organization of the American

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.400
States in Washington to
file a complaint a violation

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.380
of judicial independence.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.030
However, no effort was enough.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.980
Given the influence
of the powers that

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.900
control the appointment
of Congress,

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.320
40 days after the
Constitutional Court decided

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.580
to suspend the
election, the court

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:22.930
issued a final ruling that the
allegations were unfounded.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.046
And the courts elected
should take office.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.110
When I realized that
there was nothing else

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.820
to do against the process
of election of courts,

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.890
I decided I was going to go back
to my post in the lower courts

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.760
and do my best as a judge.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.210
I was aware that the
Supreme Court magistrates

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.810
were not happy with
everything that had happened,

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.330
but hoped that
they understood it

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.920
was about ethical
principles and not

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.590
a personal remark against them.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:52.230
I was totally wrong.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.530
They wear absolutely offended.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.130
They were ready to destroy
my judicial career.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:01.090
First, they didn't want
to recognize my position

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.660
as a judge.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:03.960
I had to present a claim.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.340
The prosecutor of human rights
of Guatemala had to intervene.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.180
And, finally, they allowed
me to go back to my court.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.500
Then they send a
supervision to my judiciary

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.110
and pressure all the officials
to press charges against me

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.830
with no reason.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.580
This is when I realized that
my actions and initiation have

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:24.040
placed my family and me
in a high risk situation.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.480
Not only my professional
career was at risk.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.570
But I also was advised that
our physical integrity was

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:33.020
in jeopardy because I made clear
evident that the difference

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.650
of the executive and
the legislative power

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:37.860
in the election of high
judicial officials,

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.320
and had also note
further infiltration

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.230
of the parallel
powers and organized

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.330
crime in the judicial system.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.080
The case of election
of the judges

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.640
was an alarm that all government
institutions in Guatemala

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.880
were infiltrated
by organized crime,

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.440
and also was a precedent
for what happened later

00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.410
when CICIG made public the
investigation about corruption

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:03.490
in the executive and in
the legislative branch.

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:06.730
The work of the International
Commission Against Impunity

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:11.020
in Guatemala under the direction
of Commissioner Ivan Velasquez

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.560
has been a key player in
the history of justice

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.820
in Guatemala.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.950
Believe me, Ivan Velasquez is
a super hero for Guatemalans.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.900
He is.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.170
And he also has a
great recommendation

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:27.780
in international level.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.830
Yesterday, the Foreign
Policy Magazine

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:32.680
recognized him as one of
the most influential persons

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.770
in the world.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:37.920
From April to August,
different cases of corruption

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.240
were made public after
CICIG investigations.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.220
It was clear that the most
powerful and influential

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.610
politicians were involved.

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:48.450
Institutional
weakness in Guatemala,

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.270
and non-fulfillment of
duty by public officials,

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.450
have caused a constant
violation of human rights

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:54.520
for Guatemalans.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.740
The current crisis is the
result of many years of abuse

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.670
by political and legal
system incapable of proving

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.460
peace and justice.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.595
Through the investigations
carried out by CICIG,

00:29:04.595 --> 00:29:07.620
it has been evident
why politicians

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.830
are other interested
groups manipulated

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.670
the election of judges.

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:14.570
They discovered the relation
between the group of lawyers

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:17.980
known as a legal
freedom for impunity

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.320
and its link with judges.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:24.730
And here we have how
this structure works.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:28.124
This picture here
is from a judge.

00:29:28.124 --> 00:29:30.040
And this is the structure
that they discovered

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.845
that was in the scam.

00:29:32.845 --> 00:29:35.410
And these are the lawyers.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.920
And these are the ones
that are involved.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.290
And this is a picture
of a Supreme Court judge

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:44.260
magistrate that was elected.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.320
And this is the structure.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.880
His son is involved in
one of the structures,

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.440
his nephew in another one.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:57.740
And this lady is the same
that was before here.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.780
And she's her sister-in-law.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.670
So it's all tied.

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:08.280
OK, so this lead to
a national awakening

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.550
unprecedented in the country.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.870
Citizens from different
sectors forgot their difference

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:15.800
and peacefully and
spontaneously took the streets

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.480
to express their rejection of
corruption and demand justice.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.220
For more than eight
months, every Saturday

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:27.250
the Central Park of Guatemala
City was crowded by families.

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.750
I'm going to show you a video.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:33.220
It was crowded by families,
students, human right

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.080
defenders, entrepreneurs,
among others.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.370
And all of them were
demanding for a change

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.038
through peaceful protest.

00:30:43.038 --> 00:30:45.030

[END PLAYBACK]

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.520
So in August, CICIG
reported that according

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.150
to the investigation,
destruction

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:38.170
of the case of custom
fraud, [SPEAKING SPANISH],

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:40.710
was also directed by the
President of the Republic,

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.680
General Otto Perez Molina.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.340
That created a national
strike in August 17,

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.700
the first of the
process in a weekday

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:52.270
where businesses, schools,
universities, and factories

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:53.820
were shut down.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.600
Eventually, on September
2, the congress

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.200
lift impeachment, and leave
no immunity to the President.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.170
So he was forced to resign.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.950
Hours later, he
was sent to jail.

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:11.750
So now, it is up to
the justice system

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:13.860
to demonstrate that
it has the ability

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.590
to solve these problems.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:18.360
Some judges of the
first instance court

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.410
are, with no doubt,
committed to justice

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:22.610
and to promote the rule of law.

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:25.250
But what will happen
with the magistrates that

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.840
were elected last year?

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.010
Will the Court of Appeals
and the Supreme Court

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:31.810
step away from their groups?

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:35.140
Or will they answer to the
so-called telephone justice

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:39.610
system, the one that occurs when
the party boss calls the judges

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:43.260
and tells them how to decide the
outcome of a particular case,

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.560
as explained by Stephen
Breyer regarding

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.230
the judicial system in Russia?

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:50.330
CICIG Commissioner
Ivan Velasquez

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:54.295
have repeatedly said
the efforts from CICIG

00:36:54.295 --> 00:36:56.810
and the public ministry
to combat corruption

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:59.400
and to help the
country won't help

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.970
if the judiciary doesn't assume
its historical responsibility.

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.410
The fight against
corruption is a fight

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:09.580
that involves the
society as a whole.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.790
Many years ago,
Edmund Burke said

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:16.820
that the only thing necessary
for the triumph of evil

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.070
is for good men to do nothing.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:23.580
That means that apathy
is the enemy of justice.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.990
But we do not want Guatemala
or any other country

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.620
to be a failed state.

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:28.860
I am optimistic.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.050
And I believe that
good Guatemala citizens

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.050
will stand to make
that large scale

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:36.150
changes that need
to be done so we

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:38.790
can hope for a better future.

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:40.290
OK, thank you.

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:42.390
