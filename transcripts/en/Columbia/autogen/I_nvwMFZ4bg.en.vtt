your question was really how come if all

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
your question was really how come if all
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.080
your question was really how come if all
of this has been going on for so long

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
of this has been going on for so long
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.859

things aren't better and I think that's
 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.600
things aren't better and I think that's
the that that is the fundamental

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610
the that that is the fundamental
 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.160
the that that is the fundamental
question and you gave one answer and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
question and you gave one answer and
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.469
question and you gave one answer and
that is a critical answer I don't think

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
that is a critical answer I don't think
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.499
that is a critical answer I don't think
that there has been many of these

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
that there has been many of these

up to make you feel good and you really

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159
up to make you feel good and you really
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.719
up to make you feel good and you really
feel good when you're doing it if you do

the semester or and then what happens

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079
the semester or and then what happens
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.700
the semester or and then what happens
over Christmas break and so but that's

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
over Christmas break and so but that's
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.809
over Christmas break and so but that's
not how problems live on the world they

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819
not how problems live on the world they
 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.449
not how problems live on the world they
live on our calendars so it's both the

live on our calendars so it's both the
 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.970

program's themselves which often don't
 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.550
program's themselves which often don't
hold themselves to achieve impact the

individuals who were working in them who

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870
individuals who were working in them who
 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.009
individuals who were working in them who
scheduled in public service according to

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019
scheduled in public service according to
 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.800
scheduled in public service according to
their convenient and I'm not being

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810
their convenient and I'm not being
 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.229
their convenient and I'm not being
pejorative I'm really exactly I've we've

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239
pejorative I'm really exactly I've we've
 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.300
pejorative I'm really exactly I've we've
been trying to analyze this because that

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310
been trying to analyze this because that
 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.009
been trying to analyze this because that
is the sixty-four-thousand-dollar

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019
is the sixty-four-thousand-dollar
 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.839
is the sixty-four-thousand-dollar
question why aren't the problem solved

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849
question why aren't the problem solved
 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.879
question why aren't the problem solved
we have all these things going on lots

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889
we have all these things going on lots
 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:46.770
we have all these things going on lots
of people lots of money lots of time new

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780
of people lots of money lots of time new
 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.530
of people lots of money lots of time new
problems arise so clearly that's one

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540
problems arise so clearly that's one
 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.009
problems arise so clearly that's one
part of the answer but as we've

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019
part of the answer but as we've
 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.909
part of the answer but as we've
disaggregated it the things that i've

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:53.919
disaggregated it the things that i've
 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.069
disaggregated it the things that i've
just reviewed and maybe many others or

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079
just reviewed and maybe many others or
 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.860
just reviewed and maybe many others or
another piece of the answer and so you

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870
another piece of the answer and so you
 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.170
another piece of the answer and so you
need to systematically look at this and

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180
need to systematically look at this and
 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.059
need to systematically look at this and
address all of these ways that these

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069
address all of these ways that these
 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.939
address all of these ways that these
these efforts could improve yeah in

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:08.949
these efforts could improve yeah in
 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.670
these efforts could improve yeah in
order to finally perhaps solve problems

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680
order to finally perhaps solve problems
 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.189
order to finally perhaps solve problems
you also need to get to the root causes

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:14.199
you also need to get to the root causes
 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.740
you also need to get to the root causes
a lot of what we're doing in public

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750
a lot of what we're doing in public

the fundamental causes of the problems

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849
the fundamental causes of the problems
 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.379
the fundamental causes of the problems
and the only way ultimately to solve

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389
and the only way ultimately to solve
 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.319
and the only way ultimately to solve
them so that they don't recur is to

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329
them so that they don't recur is to
 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.710
them so that they don't recur is to
solve the root cause and a lot of

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720
solve the root cause and a lot of
 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.300
solve the root cause and a lot of
intervention is not doing that dammit

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310
intervention is not doing that dammit
 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:56.280
intervention is not doing that dammit

you know but the last six years I've

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049
you know but the last six years I've
 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.050
you know but the last six years I've
been living in an unnamed neighborhood

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060
been living in an unnamed neighborhood
 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.379
been living in an unnamed neighborhood
in Brooklyn and I've seen my presence

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389
in Brooklyn and I've seen my presence

actually being in the community making a
 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.240
actually being in the community making a
difference and the kind of work that

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250
difference and the kind of work that
 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.930
difference and the kind of work that
I've been doing there I I really believe

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940
I've been doing there I I really believe
 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:35.879
I've been doing there I I really believe
that NGOs or other programs academic

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889
that NGOs or other programs academic

I should be careful about this we are

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470
I should be careful about this we are

they working with the community or

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880
they working with the community or
 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.520
they working with the community or
within the community and I think it is

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530
within the community and I think it is
 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.420
within the community and I think it is
extremely important to first figure out
