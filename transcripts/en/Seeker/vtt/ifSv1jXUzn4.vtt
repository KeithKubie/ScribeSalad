00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.410
Around 100,000 years ago (dates vary), ancient
humans moved out of Africa and into the Middle

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.040
East and Europe… but, another group of hominids
called the Neanderthal were already there.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.540
They wanted to be... where the people were…
and now we are forever ‘part of their world.’

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.669
So to speak.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:16.669
We sexed them up.

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:20.880
Today, we live with a mix of the DNA of every
one of our ancestors.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.420
Luckily for us, both the human and neanderthal
genome have been sequenced.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.140
This means, we can look at the full breadth
of our DNAs and find places where things match

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.140
up.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.190
For many of us, that includes a few hundred
neanderthal bits as well.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.320
For example, I have 301 neanderthal markers
in my genome.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.860
They say, that’s more than most!

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.030
So, many of us have a little genetics from
the valley of Neander… which plants a question

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.350
in a lot of people’s minds… did putting
some Neander-cream in our Homo sapien-coffee

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.930
make things better or worse?

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.600
In 2016, the first study to try and discover
what genetics the neanderthal added found

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.750
some shocking results….I want to say first,
a lot of this research sort of feels… icky.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.200
“Ew, we mixed the races and now we’re
somehow weaker!”

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.960
But, that’s not the case.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.130
According to their research, neander-genes
influence “the skin, the immune system,

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.240
depression, addiction, and metabolism,”
among other things.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.920
They compared the genes and electronic health
records of thousands of people, and found

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.240
those with certain genetics related to neanderthals
also had higher incidences of addiction to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.030
nicotine -- and thus tobacco use.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.259
Another mutation from the neanderthals gave
ancient humans hypercoagulability of the blood

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.189
-- which the researchers said was be an advantage
at the time, but today increases risk of clots

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.469
in the bloodstream.

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.340
A separate set of researchers found neanderthal
DNA may have helped our skin toughen…

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.539
As the genes affected keratin production -- the
stuff that makes fingernails and hair stronger.

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.439
And still others have identified neander-genes
that decrease risk of schizophrenia, and more

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.719
that help the immune system detect fungi and
organism invaders!

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:57.079
There’s even a study stating that Tibetans
can tolerate lower oxygen levels, in part,

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.429
because of a gene EPAS1 -- which came from
mixing with Denisovans -- another separate

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.189
ancient group related to the neanderthal.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.490
But it’s not all positive.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.420
Neanderthal DNA also brought some negatives
with it -- like marrying into a new family,

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.730
you get both good and bad!

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.819
Neanderthal DNA has been implicated in connection
to lupus, type-II diabetes, malnutrition,

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.730
heightened allergies… and so on.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.030
All this is pretty amazing stuff, but a new
study took the neanderthal mixing a step further,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.730
which skeeves me out a bit…

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.710
They’re claiming an influx of neanderthal
DNA could have changed the shape of the skull,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.130
and thus the brain.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.360
To test their hypothesis they created a system
to compare how much neanderthal genetics a

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.310
group of people had, giving their participants
a NeanderScore.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.590
Their research pointed to two areas of the
brain that were altered after mixing with

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.580
neanderthals: the visual cortex, which you
know, and also the IPS — which is associated

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.320
with grasping and coordinating body movements
-- it’s part of the reason we can use tools.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.880
The thing is, after that it get’s a liiiiiittle
shaky, as they’re making assumptions about

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.270
evolution based on a bunch of hypotheses.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.060
In the end, obviously, more research is needed.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.050
Genes are very important for some traits,
but they’re not 100-percent predictors.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.930
For example, even if you have a gene that
puts you at high risk for cancer, it’s still

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.270
not a guarantee.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.340
Just like with any progeny, mixing genetics
is a risk.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.490
As ancient humans mixed their genes with these
ancient groups, our evolutionary paths were

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.490
intertwined.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.970
As we learn more about the volumes of information
hidden in our DNA -- I, for one, look forward

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.870
to expanding my family reunions to include
even more of my neander valley cousins.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.270
After the reunion, we could start a website…
but we’d need a URL from Domain.com.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.850
When you buy a domain name from Domain.com,
you’re taking the first steps in creating

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.960
an identity and vision for your brand.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.870
No domain extension will help tell your story
like a .COM or .NET domain name.
