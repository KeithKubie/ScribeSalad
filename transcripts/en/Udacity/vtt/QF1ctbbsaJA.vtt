00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.710
So, using the genetic code, we would say that this mutation is best

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.251
described as a missense mutation. Because if the change is from an amino

00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:14.438
acid that would be a Glycine coded by GGG to an Arginine coded by AGG,

00:00:14.438 --> 00:00:19.820
one amino acid changed to another is considered a missense mutation.
