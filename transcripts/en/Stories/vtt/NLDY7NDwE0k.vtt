[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:06.860
INTERVIEWER 1: This picture
shows a pair of Kazakh Golden

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.460
Eagle Hunters, but that title
is actually a bit misleading.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.890
The eagle in the picture
isn't a prisoner, or the pray,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.400
this golden eagle is
actually the hunting tool.

00:00:20.244 --> 00:00:22.160
INTERVIEWER 2: Hi, my
name is David Baxendale,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.930
I'm a professional travel
photographer based in Glasgow,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.620
in Scotland.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.040
The photograph
you are looking at

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.920
was taken in the Altai Mountains
of Mongolia in July, 2004.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.600
There are thousands
and thousands

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.840
of square miles of absolutely
no people, no roads,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.640
no electricity, no
cellphones, it's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.837
an incredible area to visit.

00:00:44.837 --> 00:00:46.420
INTERVIEWER 1: But
the landscape isn't

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.790
the only fascinating
thing about the area.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.190
David traveled to this
remote part of Asia

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.859
to learn about the people,
and their way of life.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.150
INTERVIEWER 2: The Kazakh
people, and their traditions,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.960
are incredibly
hospitable, warm people.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.020
Obviously nomadic, and they
move maybe three times a year

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.900
with the gers, in
the mountain areas.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.420
If you ever visit the area, you
get a very, very warm welcome.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.835
They have an open door
policy on the gers,

00:01:12.835 --> 00:01:15.700
and anyone can just
literally walk in, sit down,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.470
and you'll be immediately
given food and drink.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.766
I lived alongside them
for about a week in 2014,

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:26.720
and I was able to walk with
them on a ridge with a eagle

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.050
at dusk, and that
photograph was taken

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.927
along the walk with the bird.

00:01:31.927 --> 00:01:34.260
INTERVIEWER 1: One of the
world's largest birds of prey,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.330
golden eagles are
extremely important

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.320
to the nomadic Kazakh
hunters, because

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.090
of their extreme environment
that they live in.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.610
INTERVIEWER 2: The
landscape vast,

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.680
and obviously, the
animals and the prey

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.340
move rapidly, they're
faster than horses,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.964
so I think the idea is to
use eagles to catch the prey,

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:51.505
because they're much
faster, and they

00:01:51.505 --> 00:01:52.990
can make a kill a lot easier.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.530
INTERVIEWER 1: And when David
says faster, he means it.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.410
A golden eagle can reach speeds
up to 200 miles per hour,

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.910
which is no match
for the animals

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.210
that Kazakh people rely on.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.630
INTERVIEWER 2: The eagles
are used to hunt, primarily,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.960
foxes, wolves, marmoths, which
the hunters obviously use

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.640
for food in the harsh winters.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.330
They also use the fur from
the animals for clothing,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.170
and I think, in
the photograph, you

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.520
can see that they're wearing
clothes that they captured

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.110
from wolves or a fox.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.680
INTERVIEWER 1: And even though
he spent only a week there,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.805
David knew the impact
the golden eagles have

00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:36.894
on the people of
the Altai Mountains.

00:02:36.894 --> 00:02:38.310
INTERVIEWER 2: The
region, itself,

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.547
is absolutely incredible.

00:02:39.547 --> 00:02:41.130
It's one of the last
true wildernesses

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.006
in the world, huge
mountains 4,000 meters high,

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:48.040
and snow-capped
glaciers are everywhere,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.351
and obviously, it's the
land of the golden eagle.

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:56.500
iNTERVIEWER 1:
"this happened HERE"

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.646
aims to share compelling images
and the stories behind them.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:01.520
If you liked this video,
be sure to check out

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.530
this one to see what
it's like to dive

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.195
into a humpback whale fight.

00:03:05.195 --> 00:03:06.820
INTERVIEWER 3: This
is an image moments

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.040
after this juvenile humpback
whale took a sharp turn

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.470
to avoid smashing in to me.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.160
INTERVIEWER 1:
Thanks for watching.
