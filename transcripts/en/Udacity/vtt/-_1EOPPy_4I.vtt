00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.181
So we can't write the equation of a vertical line in slope intercept form. But

00:00:04.181 --> 00:00:08.172
what about the other two forms for linear equations that we know of? Can we

00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:12.305
write it in point slope form? Or can we write it in general form? Please pick

00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:14.337
yes or no for each of these questions.
