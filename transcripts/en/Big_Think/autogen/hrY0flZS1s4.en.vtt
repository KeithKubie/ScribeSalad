often in combat as well because we're

feels like oh my god this is exactly

what I'm supposed to be doing this is
 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.660
what I'm supposed to be doing this is
this is right and and that kind of

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670
this is right and and that kind of
 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.289
this is right and and that kind of

deployment often often they missed the

miss that communal connection because in

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110
miss that communal connection because in
 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.870

modern society it's pretty much gone and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880

they don't really notice that until they
