00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.170
SPEAKER 1: I'm very
happy here to welcome,

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.550
and an honor for me to
welcome Hariharan [? G. ?]

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.070
Let's give him a
round of applause.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.890
We have had the pleasure here of
hosting other musicians, but no

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.160
one as exceptional as him.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.250
And it's my honor again to
welcome him for this event.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.580
HARIHARAN: Do you normally
say that to everyone?

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.690
SPEAKER 1: No, I normally
don't say that to everybody.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.570
He's a soul of Indian playback
singing, as most of you know,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.210
right?

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.720
A lot of ghazals he's
composed, and sung,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.100
and produced more than
30 albums of ghazals,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.670
which is an incredible feat.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.070
He's sung in number of
Indian language films.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.660
Hindi, Kannada, Tamil-- his
mother tongue-- Malayalam,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.520
and lots of others.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.620
So we're going to
talk about how it

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.780
is to be versatile across
multiple languages soon.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.450
So without further
ado, let's get started

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.340
and ask him some questions.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.590
So I'm going to go back
in history a little bit.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.279
HARIHARAN: All righty.

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:07.070
SPEAKER 1: We're thrilled
to have you here.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.080
And the history goes back
and says, when I look at it,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.320
you learned from your parents.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.502
Carnatic music, right?

00:01:14.502 --> 00:01:15.210
HARIHARAN: Right.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.950
SPEAKER 1: Your mother
was your first guru.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.382
How was it learning
from a parent?

00:01:20.382 --> 00:01:22.340
Because as a parent, when
I try to teach a kid,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.030
I know how difficult it is.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.800
HARIHARAN: Well, see basically,
since the day I was born,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.210
I'm always listening to music.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.390
Like somebody is learning,
or somebody's performing,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.480
or something is being
played in the house.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.680
Just 24 and 7, music
was on in the house.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.080
So learning music, it was
more like an osmosis process.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.130
Pick up certain things.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.110
And then she thought
that I could sing,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.280
so sometimes she used
to say, OK, learn this.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.120
And as I grew up, there was
problems in learning also.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.980
Because I'd say, no,
I'll sing it this way.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.000
She said, you can't
sing it this way.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.370
I said, why?

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.170
Because this is carnatic,
this is classical music.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.920
This is how it should be sung.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.860
I couldn't understand it then.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.210
But then, it was a beautiful
relationship we had,

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.720
and it still continues.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.940
SPEAKER 1: Good.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.030
And I like the osmosis
example, because we all

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.870
learn from our surroundings by
osmosis from music around us,

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.210
whether it be music
or other fields.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.040
HARIHARAN: And my parents,
they are carnatic musicians.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.200
My father's normal.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.950
But they used to be keen
listeners of Hindustani, also.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.530
So I've been exposed to
Hindustani classical music,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.830
which I trained later under
Ustad Ghulam [? Mustafa ?]

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.460
from my childhood.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.760
SPEAKER 1: What has been the
influence and the learning

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.490
from your Hindustani
classical guru?

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.410
HARIHARAN: Influence, it's
my stable diet, I would say.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.650
Because a I'll sing khyal.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.600
Khyal is a genre where you
have an [? untrained ?]

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.780
and a [? stay. ?] Khyal, as
the word goes, imagination.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.810
It is about imagining phrases
of scale, of a [? raga. ?]

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.430
And you can go for hours just
building that [? raga. ?]

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.190
So it's a good way of
becoming imaginative.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.570
You can add your phrases.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.470
And there comes a
point when you keep

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.730
doing this khyal
[? gaiki. ?] You need not

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.650
think that you have
to imagine now,

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.490
and you have to come up with
a phrase, the phrase happens.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.540
Still we don't know how it
happens, but it happens.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.250
Like, a phrase which you've
never sung in your life

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.260
from a certain
scale, it pops out.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.590
And you think, OK,
how did it come out?

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.157
So that is--

00:04:03.157 --> 00:04:04.490
SPEAKER 1: The creative process.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.240
HARIHARAN: The
creative process, yeah.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.590
SPEAKER 1: And now I hear your
son actually is also a singer.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.090
And I'm going to get to the
other side of now as a parent,

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.089
working and being a guru to
your son, how does that--

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:21.680
HARIHARAN: Well, my elder one,
actually, he's not basically

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.180
a singer.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.482
He's more of a composer
and a programmer.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.090
He just blew my head one day.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.850
I mean, he's an economics
graduate from LSE.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.350
And then suddenly,
after finishing,

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.630
I thought he'll be
joining a corporate house,

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.240
and he'll start working.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.160
He says, dad, I
need three months.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.195
I want a break.

00:04:48.195 --> 00:04:50.960
I said, OK, take three months.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.000
So after three months,
the fourth month comes,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.130
and he's still on a break.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.550
So I ask him, OK, what
are you going to do?

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.110
So he turns around and he
says, dad, I want to do music.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.200
I said, music?

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.460
Of course he's learned the
[? ragas ?] from my guru,

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.370
and things like that.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.960
Kind of OK.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.690
But I've never seen him
perceive into music like.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.470
And then says, dad, do you
remember about five years back,

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.480
you gave me a laptop.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.500
I said, yeah, it still works.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.020
Yes, it works, and he came out
and played some production.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.680
He's been producing music.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.800
So I said, man, it's nice
what you've been doing,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.180
but you remember, I'm your dad.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.500
I can't just say that
you take up music,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.750
because I should feel secure
that you're taking up music.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:57.170
So I give you a one and a
half years, and impress me.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.460
Do something which when I
can say, OK, now you do this.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.680
And he's done it.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.320
He's done two films after
that, he's done two films.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.210
He's coming up
with an electronic

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.640
based Indian classical album.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.340
It's a fusion between
Indian classical music

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.150
and electronic music.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.110
EDM, as you call it.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.730
So he's coming up with that.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.720
So wish him best luck.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.220
SPEAKER 1: Since
you mention fusion,

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.850
I'm going to sort
of talk a little bit

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.930
about that genre of music
that you pioneered with--

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.830
HARIHARAN: Me and
Leslie, Leslie Lewis.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.320
SPEAKER 1: Leslie Lewis
pioneered with in Mumbai.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.320
And putting together
Indian and Western music

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.330
together, and created
this group called

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.110
Colonial Cousins, which has
been sort of, in my opinion,

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.420
been impactful in crossing
the effort for the youth

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.137
to pick up.

00:06:52.137 --> 00:06:53.470
So what is that experience like?

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.420
Putting together two
different genres?

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.795
HARIHARAN: Again,
it is something

00:06:56.795 --> 00:07:00.940
like the Indian talking Marathi
and suddenly going to Canada

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.710
and going into English.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.755
When you talk, converse.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.750
We are multilingual, I
would say, as a country.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:18.640
And everybody speaks
English in India.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.640
And everybody speaks
English in the countries

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.200
which was colonized.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.890
So the word Colonial
Cousins came about

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.530
that there's fusion
in such countries.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.000
It's a positive thing.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.910
And I've heard my grandmother,
and they sing "Twinkle Twinkle

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:49.050
Little Star" in [? Draga. ?]
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.110
(SINGING)Twinkle,
twinkle, little star,

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.300
how I wonder what you are.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:03.250
So that's how Colonial Cousins
was [? regard, ?] basically.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:21.700
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.850
(SINGING) The
darkness coming round,

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:28.100
and everybody fighting
with your brothers.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.510
Everybody wants control
to keep us locked in, hey,

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.240
please release us.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.489
So come down and help us,
save all the little ones.

00:08:38.489 --> 00:08:44.500
They need a teacher, and you
are the only one we can rely on

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.530
to build a better world.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.710
Well, that's what you're in.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:52.190
Well, that's for everyone.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.084
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:08:54.084 --> 00:08:56.799
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:01.151 --> 00:09:02.073
Thank you.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.060
SPEAKER 1: So fusion
music, particularly

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.972
for youngsters growing up
here, should be very ideal.

00:09:10.972 --> 00:09:13.180
Because they grow up with
an Indian heritage at home,

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.200
and outside in America,
they're looking

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.104
at Western music and influence.

00:09:17.104 --> 00:09:17.770
HARIHARAN: Yeah.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.370
SPEAKER 1: So what
advice would you

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.210
have for either budding
musicians in this audience,

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.140
or--

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.630
HARIHARAN: I think
if it's Indian music,

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.490
there are a lot of great
artists who are visiting here,

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.420
and some people have workshops,
and teachers, and things like.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.300
I think, get exposed to them,
and that's the best way.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.610
Feel free.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.320
Any kind of music
which gives you peace

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.400
is good music, basically.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.610
It's not about genres.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:54.570
And the world, as we know, is
becoming a very small place.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.275
I mean, there's so much
interaction between things.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.440
I've started something
called as Urdu blues.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.520
It's in Urdu.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.610
But what does a person talk
about when he's singing blues?

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.950
It's about his life,
his love, his beloved,

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.310
his high points in life,
happiness, low points in life.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.330
Same thing we do in Urdu.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:32.500
So the Navarasa, all the
emotions of the human being,

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.300
are same in each
and every country,

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.360
in each and every human.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:44.660
And we're so identically same,
similar, the whole world.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.940
I think any kind of
music is-- you can just

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.490
walk across and say,
wow, this is that.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.270
It is so simple.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:56.278
And I think through
Google we can learn a lot.

00:10:56.278 --> 00:10:58.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.770
We just may get all the
information easily accessed.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.330
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.960
And wbat advice in
terms of training,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.300
should people, budding musicians
who want to practice in this

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.330
or play in the genre?

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:13.660
HARIHARAN: There's no
shortcut in learning music.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.020
There are exercises for
instrumentalists, as well as

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.130
for vocalists.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.110
And you've got to keep doing it.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:28.580
Because playing music, singing
music, is basically discipline,

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.540
hard work.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:35.200
And that same hard work
becomes your muscle memory.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:41.590
And it seems as if
it is spontaneous.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.690
It is spontaneous, but it is
because of all this buildup,

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:49.200
all this work, the
brilliance comes suddenly.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.650
So it's hard work, basically.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:56.450
And learning music is very good,
because you know the grammar,

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.050
you know what you're doing.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.150
And when you do
something wrong, you

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.500
know how to rectify yourself.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.350
Otherwise, it's like a
wild goose chase, you know?

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:09.300
All your life you've been
singing a phrase wrongly,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:14.580
and you feel, wow, there's
something I'm doing amazingly.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:23.950
And some people are born
with-- they can sense pitch.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.180
Some people are tone deaf.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.480
If you're tone dear, it's very
difficult to be a musician.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.336
Because
[SINGING DIFFERENT PITCHES]

00:12:32.336 --> 00:12:32.960
What do you do?

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.650
I mean, you can't
do a damn thing.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.230
Or if you don't have
rhythm sense, basically.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.980
So obviously, a person
who's interested in music

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.290
and who will go towards
it is someone who

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.370
has got both these qualities.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.810
And learning music
is very important.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.470
Practicing is important.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.660
SPEAKER 1: And it said
that you used to practice

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.080
like 13 hours a day.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.480
HARIHARAN: Actually,
It used to be 10 hours,

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.850
now it's going to 13 hours.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.740
It's increases, basically.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.420
But practically speaking, yeah.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.950
There was a time when I
kept singing the whole day.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.820
So I've never actually
counted hours, but yeah.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.640
Waking hours, that much.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.150
SPEAKER 1: I think that that's
true for any discipline.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.375
If those of us here in
the technology sector

00:13:21.375 --> 00:13:22.604
worked 13 hours a day--

00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:23.520
HARIHARAN: Absolutely.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.290
SPEAKER 1: We'd do
wonders as well.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:30.860
Let me take you down through
memory lane to the year 1978.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.864
HARIHARAN: 1978, OK.

00:13:34.864 --> 00:13:39.010
SPEAKER 1: You were brought
in by the late Jaidev

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:43.720
for your first Hindi movie
song, in the movie, "Gaman."

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.620
HARIHARAN: Lot of people, when
you guys weren't being born.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.630
So yeah.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:56.060
1977, '78, yeah.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.090
SPEAKER 1: That first song
that got you a nomination

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:00.840
at the national awards.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.060
And another British--

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.970
HARIHARAN: It was an Urdu song.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:10.070
And For a [? salkandin ?]
to sing Urdu was like,

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.450
wow, why is he doing that?

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.610
How is he doing that?

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:18.460
But again, being born and
brought up in Bombay helped me.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:23.650
And it was a song called "Ajeeb
Sa neha Mujh Par Guzar gara

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.730
yaaron."

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.360
Now, you know understand Ajeeb,
and and Guzar gara yaaron.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:35.450
Sa neha means incident, a
very odd incident took place.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:40.570
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I got
scared of my own shadow.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.230
Like, my own existence.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.524
That was my first song.

00:14:44.524 --> 00:14:45.940
SPEAKER 1: That's
very incredible.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.370
And since it was
your first foray

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.400
into Hindi movies, any
special memories about how

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.760
that process went, how
working with Jaidev was?

00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.450
HARIHARAN: Oh, Jaidev,
it was like a friend,

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.660
philosopher, guide.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:08.390
And I was his assistant for the
three or four years after that.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:14.107
And I remember, it
a small orchestra,

00:15:14.107 --> 00:15:15.440
it was not a very big orchestra.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.840
About 20 people orchestra.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.340
In those days, we didn't
have dubbing facilities.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.380
We had to sing at one go.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.350
One, two, three, and
then you just start.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.280
So that time, the
first take was OK.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:34.880
And then we did one more take
for the safety sake on that.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.920
But I remember
that very clearly,

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.980
and it is very interesting.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:42.650
Very exciting.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.733
SPEAKER 1: It's very
exciting to be in your first.

00:15:44.733 --> 00:15:48.180
And then 14 years
later, in 1992,

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:52.230
when [? Marina ?] [? Dram ?]
signed you up for working with

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:56.510
A.R. Rahman on the film
"Roja" with the Tamil song,

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.250
Thamizha Thamizha.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.660
What was your experience
moving from Hindi to Tamil?

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.010
HARIHARAN: Well, I
never thought that I'm

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.990
going to sing in Tamil films.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.200
Not for anything else, I
was engrossed in my ghazals.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.890
And as I said, I used
to compose and perform

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.510
ghazals, and things
[? like. ?] Kept

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.150
doing Bollywood
numbers, and all that.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:22.540
Then I met this
young boy, Rahman.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.400
He had come to Bombay
to do a jingle.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.300
So he called me for the
jingle, so I went and met him.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.050
Very quiet.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:36.830
And he said, I love your
album called Reflections.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.270
I've been listening to it.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.200
So I said, fine.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.990
And then we did the jingle.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:44.810
I really worked hard on it.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.650
It bounced.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:50.780
But the only thing which came
out of it was he called me

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:55.600
three months later
for the song in "Roja"

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:01.530
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So that's
how I started working with him,

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:06.349
and we worked a lot together.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:09.550
An amazing musician and
human being to work with.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:10.990
Very humble.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.460
And for him, it was
like block building.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.970
We used to sing the
composition the way it is,

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.910
and then keep improvising.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:24.230
And it was like always an
experience to work with him,

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.730
I would say.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:26.510
Good experience.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:32.610
SPEAKER 1: And you have a number
of fantastic music produced

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:33.880
with A. R. Rahman.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.034
HARIHARAN: Oh, yeah.

00:17:35.034 --> 00:17:36.950
SPEAKER 1: What has his
been sort of influence

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.620
on your career over the years?

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.570
As a collaboration, what do
you see has moved or changed

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:44.370
your career than--

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.610
HARIHARAN: I always felt that
I started my career in '77.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.080
Through the '80s,
I was doing songs,

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:59.410
but not to the extent of
like a Roja or a Bombay.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:05.860
I think I was preserved
for the '90s, you know?

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.180
Rather than saying,
look at it, I mean,

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.030
you can either look at it
saying that, man, '80s,

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.090
I struggled and struggled,
and you no like.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:18.270
And it's not that, I
was preserved for '90s.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.940
I'm still there in front of
you, and you all come to see me.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.370
Thank you so much.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.152
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:31.650
SPEAKER 1: So you've sung
songs in multiple languages.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:36.170
Hindi, Tamil, Marathi,
Malayalam, Kannada, and a few

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:37.340
more.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.545
The list goes on.

00:18:38.545 --> 00:18:39.920
Do you speak all
these languages?

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.350
HARIHARAN: No, no, no.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.750
SPEAKER 1: So how do you manage
to put a perfect rendition

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.780
in a language that
you don't speak,

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.780
without accents, is that you
sound like a native speaker?

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.410
HARIHARAN: Yeah.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.750
Of course I have goofed
up, but it has not

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.340
come out in the public.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.502
We all goof up.

00:18:57.502 --> 00:18:58.210
I mean, you know.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.806
That's the beauty of music.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.510
The composer and the lyrics
writer, they sit down together

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.450
and make a song.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:19.240
So obviously, each
song, each word

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:26.230
is translated musically
to its emotional content.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:27.900
The way it should be said.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.410
In what context it
comes in the lang.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:35.440
So to speak the language is
difficult, to sing a language

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.310
is easier.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.150
Because you get the
meter to sing it,

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.950
you get the expressions
of the words.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:47.840
And obviously, when your
pitching is perfect,

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:53.130
the power, the emotion
of each word comes out.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:53.848
That's art.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.910
So when you have these three--
and, of course, you sit there

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:09.372
and you go through the lines,
say, 30, 40 times and learn it,

00:20:09.372 --> 00:20:10.800
you can sing it.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.660
SPEAKER 1: So it's
different, because you're

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.869
singing the emotions
rather than just the words.

00:20:16.869 --> 00:20:17.660
HARIHARAN: Exactly.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.380
That helps you.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.720
SPEAKER 1: And the emotion
stands in language.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.460
That's what I guess
you're saying.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.270
HARIHARAN: Yeah.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.760
And it's like it's like
working the other way.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.620
SPEAKER 1: Again, another
thing with languages.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.370
You had two National
Award songs.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.470
One in Hindi, with
"Mere Dushman Mere Bhai"

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:41.300
in the movie "Border," right?

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.860
And then the second one was
in the Marathi movie "Jogwa."

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.730
HARIHARAN: "Jogwa."

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.340
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.530
How are these two
different kinds

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:53.570
of songs in two different
languages, spread across 15, 20

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:58.350
years probably,
what in your mind

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.790
was sort of exceptional
about these songs?

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:07.250
HARIHARAN: Both the songs had
a lot of emotional content,

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:12.660
and it was placed in a very
beautiful point in the film.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.820
So film music is
not music per se.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:22.160
How the song has been shot,
who's singing the song,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.170
and what context it comes in
the film is very important.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:29.520
That also makes
or breaks a song.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.240
Like [? Tu ?] [? Hide. ?] I
mean, the way it has been shot,

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.620
and the point it has been
shot, it became the highlight

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:36.510
of the movie.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:39.780
And it's still the
highlight of all the songs

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.690
which I've sung in my career.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:47.320
So these are two, three--
like, "Mere Dushman Mere Bhai,"

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.820
it's about how
useless and senseless

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.100
is this war and killing.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.680
And it's a beautiful
lyrics, and the way

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.100
that Anu has composed it.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.350
The same goes to Jogwa, also.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:05.570
It's all said and
done, you know?

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:09.650
You say that people
like rhythm, they

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:11.460
like to dance, everything, fine.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:16.720
But if some melody's there and
the words touches your soul,

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.890
that's a song that stays, man.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.140
It just stays.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:26.080
You will forget all the songs
you've heard, you enjoyed.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:32.640
But these kind of songs,
it gives you a tug.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.670
SPEAKER 1: So you're
saying it's the lyrics

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.920
and the melody bring
out the emotions

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.320
before the musician does,
that reaches the heart.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.610
And that's why it stays.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:47.730
HARIHARAN: Again, I would
say, what makes a singer?

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.036
Songs.

00:22:49.036 --> 00:22:51.700
You need songs to be a singer.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:56.010
So I mean, these two songs,
I've been lucky to get them.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.210
And I've sung it to
the best of my ability.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:00.560
That's very important.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.930
So what is the song, what
the content of the song?

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:03.940
That's very important.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:08.565
What is-- la, la, la,
[? gonna get? ?] [LAUGHTER]

00:23:08.565 --> 00:23:10.630
So it's a teamwork, I would say.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.710
It is basically a teamwork.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:17.049
SPEAKER 1: So let me shift
to a little bit of ghazals.

00:23:17.049 --> 00:23:17.840
HARIHARAN: Ghazals.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.870
SPEAKER 1: You have
been singing ghazals

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:24.260
that goes how, from
what I understand,

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.210
A. R. Rahman found
you, or got interested.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.543
He has been following your
ghazals even before he signed

00:23:28.543 --> 00:23:29.860
you up for the first song.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.990
How do you find this
genre of ghazals

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:36.450
has influenced your later
music in films, in fusion?

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:38.850
What's the connection there?

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:41.300
HARIHARAN: So basically,
ghazal means to talk,

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.440
a conversation
with your beloved.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.640
So when you sing a ghazal,
if I sing a ghazal,

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.850
each one should feel that I'm
singing it for you, or for her.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:55.250
It has to have the
personal touch.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:57.800
And you can reach to
each one in the room

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.960
only when you're conversing, and
you're not throwing the words.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.210
You're conversing
it to somebody.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:13.230
So conversational element in
ghazals is-- it sets it apart.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.270
That's why you never
shout a ghazal.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:18.150
You never belt out a
ghazal, we just say it.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:22.512
We just-- [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:24:44.445 --> 00:24:51.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.740
And there is no
drama in the singing.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.370
There's no drama.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.165
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:25:35.647 --> 00:25:38.641
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:46.280
In contrast to this, you're
singing for a hero in a film,

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.040
right?

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.296
So the hero is dramatic.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:53.410
Hero has to be dramatic lately.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.440
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.560
So you're throwing
your voice here.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.820
Because most of
the girls are deaf.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.354
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:26.139 --> 00:26:26.930
[? Checks ?] apart.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:33.845
That's why the girls
also sing loud, you know?

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.302
So these are two
contrasting-- yeah.

00:26:39.302 --> 00:26:41.760
SPEAKER 1: But again, they're
referring two different types

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.590
of people in conversations.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.230
HARIHARAN: Absolutely.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.550
SPEAKER 1: And now a lot of
conversations are the same,

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.170
starting to happen on the web.

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:51.226
Use of technology.

00:26:51.226 --> 00:26:51.900
HARIHARAN: Yeah.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.316
SPEAKER 1: And
we're sitting here,

00:26:53.316 --> 00:26:57.850
so I cannot just sort of not
ask you a technology question.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:05.800
HARIHARAN: Like again,
the nuances of music, it

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.680
can go across to the
people because you

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.640
have sensitive microphones.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.850
If the microphone was not
there, you had to sing louder.

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:21.700
So the louder you sing,
the small nuances,

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.580
you can't produce it.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.860
The dynamics are less.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.590
It is more of one
volume, basically.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.960
So there, it has helped music.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.090
SPEAKER 1: So it has helped
there, but a lot of us

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.240
know that it has also
helped in distribution,

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.860
and reaching out to your fans.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.400
But more curious question
is, how has it helped you

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.010
in the creation process?

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.850
In the olden days,
you probably sat with

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:49.510
[? dubla, ?] and sitar,
and harmonium, and so on.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:53.320
Now they sit with computers,
and mixers, and synthesizers.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.694
Has it changed the process of--

00:27:54.694 --> 00:27:55.610
HARIHARAN: Well, yeah.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.360
I mean, you listen
to a groove, and you

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:02.520
listen to some kind of
harmony, and we work out

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.940
a kind of sequences.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:06.850
I can compose on them.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.510
It's basically a
starting point you need.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:13.400
Like, you want to compose
something on [? rakido. ?]

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.270
So this is starting point.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:20.360
So that way we use this
also, the modern technology.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.630
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:23.912
You have a large
presence on social media.

00:28:23.912 --> 00:28:26.370
Twitter and Facebook, you have
more than two million people

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.210
who like you.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:31.030
And I'm sure a lot more people
like you in real life in India,

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.026
so that's impressive.

00:28:34.026 --> 00:28:35.400
You've also started
recently, you

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.324
announced a new application.

00:28:37.324 --> 00:28:37.990
HARIHARAN: Yeah.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.890
SPEAKER 1: Sing with Hari.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:39.853
HARIHARAN: Sing with Hari.

00:28:39.853 --> 00:28:41.890
SPEAKER 1: Can you tell
us some more about that?

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:42.556
HARIHARAN: Yeah.

00:28:42.556 --> 00:28:44.380
It's an application,
very simple.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.020
You can download
it in your phones.

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:52.530
And I sing, then you got
to listen to me carefully,

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.430
and sing the way I sing.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:58.010
And I've explained
certain difficult parts

00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:59.440
of the song, and all that.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.960
So you learn it,
you can sing it,

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.690
and then you can make
a video with me also.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:07.950
I come and I pop out of the
screen and say, sing a song,

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:09.210
sing with me.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:12.870
And then you send it to us,
then we evaluate and tell you

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:14.845
how good it is, and you know.

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:26.100
I wanted to reach out to people
who would benefit from learning

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.170
certain things from me.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:32.840
And once we start this, then I
will take up a section of it.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:37.760
I will be teaching techniques
of singing, basically.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.530
Just get the interested
people, and then

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:44.570
I'll start telling them the
grammar of music, how to do

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:46.478
the [? az, ?] things like that.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:50.570

You want to sing with Hari?

released in the month of July.

00:30:01.827 --> 00:30:04.160

when it's released in July,

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.770
you'll be announcing it.

that you also see

your sons and the next
generation singing,

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.560
do you see the
difference between how

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.800
you and this generation sang,
and how the children are

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.620
picking up music?

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.900
Is it more fusion,
is it more classical?

tell the new generation,

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.170
the kids, they're
very intelligent kids.

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:40.750

at which they pick up things

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:53.560
We didn't have anything
to distract us.

00:32:56.457 --> 00:32:57.415
There was no idiot box.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:02.990
When I was a kid, I used
to play, or I used to sing.

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.450
That's it, two entertainments.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:10.100
No going out and
eating, no [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.560
But this gets us
into so many things.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.640
They have knowledge, but
sometimes it is superficial.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:23.600
They're very happy with
just going 15% into it.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.610
And that is why you
don't get depth.

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:29.660
I'm talking of
musicians, basically.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.250
They are very, very intelligent.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:39.300
The kids who do the full course,
like if you have learned piano,

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.910
or if you have
to-- if they do it

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:44.570
for a proper six,
eight years, the same

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:46.370
happens to Indian
classical music.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:49.030
Because if you do
it, then they shine.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:52.100
Otherwise it is like that
half knowledge thing.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:55.642
And the window today is
so small for a musician.

00:33:55.642 --> 00:33:56.475
Is very frightening.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:04.070
Gone are the days when you
can sing for 30, 40 years.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:08.280
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
Somebody else is coming.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.760
So the stress on the
kids are also a lot.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.469
So it's tough.

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:16.570
Only some survive.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.580
SPEAKER 1: It's tough, but
the message that you told us

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.263
earlier is, hard work.

00:34:21.263 --> 00:34:22.179
HARIHARAN: Absolutely.

00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:23.400
SPEAKER 1: Still required.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.187
Persistence.

00:34:24.187 --> 00:34:25.520
HARIHARAN: It's always required.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.780
SPEAKER 1: That's
always required, right?

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.739
And the distractions just
make it more difficult.

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:30.322
HARIHARAN: Yeah, and
just get into it.

00:34:30.322 --> 00:34:32.090
Get into the subject.

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:34.520
Become a part of the subject.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.650
Just the swallow it.

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:37.420
Eat it.

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.820
SPEAKER 1: Is there any
tips you have for just

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.075
having a melodious voice?

00:34:41.075 --> 00:34:42.949
I mean, you have a
God-given melodious voice,

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:44.361
but you've perfected
it through--

00:34:44.361 --> 00:34:45.194
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:50.580
SPEAKER 1: Or just taking
care of your voice.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.100
Is there any tips?

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.190
HARIHARAN: Well, don't
do anything silly.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:56.639
I mean, be normal.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:35:00.710
Like, today I was having
lunch, and a friend of ours,

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:06.076
he asked me, you
have a concert, Hari,

00:35:06.076 --> 00:35:10.820
so would you take any care
about what you're eating?

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:11.580
I said, nothing.

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.500
You're eating this,
I'm eating this.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.360
So it's basically normal.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.080
But normally you
avoid oily food,

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.440
or you avoid an ice cream
before a concert, definitely.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.160
These things are logical
things, you don't do it.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:26.730
That's it.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:27.840
And dust, of course.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.570
You can't have dust.

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:32.780
It just clogs you up.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:35.840
SPEAKER 1: So you've won
numerous awards, as I said.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.370
You won the National
Award twice,

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:39.070
you've won numerous
state awards.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.910
The Padma Shri was
awarded to you.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:45.610
Which of these-- either the
awards, or something else,

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:48.450
has, you think, been your
proudest moment so far?

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.040
What are you most proud of?

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:55.410
HARIHARAN: Having my gurus,
like my mom, or Ghulam Mustafa.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:59.960
And Medhi Hassan
was my soul guru.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.640
Rouhani guru.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.500
When they say that
you have sung well

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:09.390
in some concert or something,
that really gives me a high.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:10.580
Really it gives me a high.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:16.730
And of course, awards
are like goodies.

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:18.670
It gives you that satisfaction.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:22.010
Especially when you get the
state award, or a Padma Shri,

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:22.900
or something like.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.420
You feel, OK, the
nation is proud of you,

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:29.664
so behave yourself, and
keep doing what you do best.

00:36:29.664 --> 00:36:32.472
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:36.990
SPEAKER 1: I like that
it wasn't the awards,

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.686
but it is the recognition
from your gurus.

00:36:39.686 --> 00:36:41.580
HARIHARAN: Yeah.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.230
It's all there, you know.

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:55.170
And in my concerts, I have
kids from the age of 10, 15,

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:59.260
write to 60-, 70-,
80-year-old people.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.900
Which I'm really
happy of, because I

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:07.110
have been successful
in identifying myself,

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:10.980
my music being identified
by all the generations.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.490
And I hope I keep doing that.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:15.850
That's it.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:19.610
SPEAKER 1: So for
the coming years,

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:20.910
what should we expect from you?

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:23.470
What should we expect
more of, should

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:26.080
we expect more of Hariharan
the ghazal maestro?

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.290
Should we expect more of
Hariharan, the pioneer

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.280
of fusion music in India?

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.960
Or Hariharan, the melodious
singer of film scores,

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.950
or a new facet to this
brilliant diamond?

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:38.490
HARIHARAN: I'm doing a
lot of fusion with my son.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.080
Lot of [? rugtadi, ?]
and lot of singing.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.310
But EDM music.

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:46.500
That's one thing
which is happening.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.820
I'm doing pure classical
Hindustani, which

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.720
I've never had the time to do.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:59.190
Because it requires a lot of
time if you want to do it.

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:07.310
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] It's
not possible, basically.

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:10.010
It's a way of life.

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:14.140
Your timetable of the day has to
be different, and things like.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.670
So these two things.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:21.010
And I will definitely sing
till I'm comfortable singing,

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:23.670
till I like my own singing.

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:26.980
I will stop at the day
I [? can't ?] do it.

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.360
But that's important.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:33.360
You gotta know till
what I can sing.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.610
Has been lovely knowing all of
you, who have been supporting

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:37.960
me all these years.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.450
Who have given me so much love.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:41.730
And thank you.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.610
SPEAKER 1: And on that note,
can you sing us a few lines?

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:52.200
HARIHARAN: All right.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.940
SPEAKER 1: Of your
favorite song?

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.505
HARIHARAN: My favorite song, OK.

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:05.375
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:11.127
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:19.570
SPEAKER 1: A last question.

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:24.450
Do you have specific
advice for the use

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:28.700
of our technology
in general that

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:31.785
will help music, that will
help creation of music, that

00:40:31.785 --> 00:40:34.776
will help promotion of music,
that will help people to get

00:40:34.776 --> 00:40:36.400
music to reach their
hearts, whether it

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.025
be Indian or western?

00:40:38.025 --> 00:40:39.650
HARIHARAN: You want
my advice for that?

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:41.540
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.250
HARIHARAN: Wow.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:46.200
OK.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:53.970
Why don't you have form a
club of the elite musicians

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:58.280
of the world, from each genre?

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:02.170
A Google club of musicians.

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:08.690
And they're available to
students or institutes

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:11.710
of music for their advice.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:15.040
And this whole process
happens through them.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:24.940
And to do that, a student of
music or a connoisseur of music

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:34.140
have to read standards, and
be a member of that society.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:34.930
Start it.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:38.070
It will grow like wildfire.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:42.130
So at least you know that if
a person wants to be a singer

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:44.350
and feels that he's
a singer, he can get

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:46.750
evaluated by the right people.

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:51.440
Rather than the mother,
father, and the cousins.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.885
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:08.410
When he comes somewhere
and he sings, you said, so,

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:11.740
why have you come here to sing?

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.750
What are you doing here?

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:17.630
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I'm a
very popular singer from--

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:19.030
so at least that doesn't happen.

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:27.370
So I think that should be-- that
should be one of the things.

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:32.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.300
SPEAKER 1: So friends, let's
thank Hariharan [? G ?]

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:38.750
for this time he's
spent with us.

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.210
Let's give him our applause.
