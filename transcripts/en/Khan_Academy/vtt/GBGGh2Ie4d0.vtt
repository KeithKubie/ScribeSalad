00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.960
Let's learn a little bit about
centripetal acceleration.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.690
So let's say I have a dot.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:06.550
It could be anything.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.160
And we're in deep space, so
we're not going to think about

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.080
gravity and all these
things yet.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.540
Let's say I have some object
that's floating through space

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.370
with some velocity.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.210
Let me draw the object.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.800
It's this dot.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.250
And it has some velocity.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.660
And I will draw its
velocity vector.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.200
Let's say that this is-- I'll
draw this really big.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.020
That's not big.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.270
Let me make a thicker line.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.140
There you go.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.000
Thicker line.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.950
If you can see that.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.550
So let's say that's the
dot's velocity vector.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.130
And I have a question for you.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.190
So this is what the dot's doing
at exactly this moment.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.170
Let's say a little bit later,
I want the dot to be doing

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.700
something like this.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.010
I want its velocity vector
to look like-- i want its

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.240
velocity factor to
look like this.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.490
A little bit later.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.630
And its color changes
to yellow.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.450
That's out of the scope.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.270
Color changing is out of the
scope of this lecture.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.620
But let's say a little bit
later I want its velocity

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.880
vector to look something
like that.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.720
So I was a little careful,
because I want it to have the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.950
same magnitude, but just a
little different direction.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.980
I want it to tilt into the
right a little bit.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.650
Let me draw that.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.780
And my question is, what had to
be the acceleration acting,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.630
when this was its velocity
vector, in order to get its

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.070
velocity vector to look like
this a little bit later?

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.840
Well, right here, its
velocity vector is

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.840
completely in the x direction.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.510
And there's no y component.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.140
Let's break down this
velocity vector

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.240
into the x and y component.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.818
So its x component looks
something like this.

00:01:50.818 --> 00:01:54.725
And its y component looks
something like this.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.140
So in order to change its
velocity, something would have

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.710
to-- Because clearly here
its y component was 0.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.260
There's no y component.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.570
And now there is
a y component.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.310
So the acceleration that you
would have to apply to this

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.720
dot would have to have
some y component.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.090
The acceleration would have
to have some y component.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.700
Let's say that.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.660
This is acceleration, that's
why it's not the same size.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.593
Actually let me draw
acceleration

00:02:21.593 --> 00:02:23.370
in a different color.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.160
And I'll try to do this in a
bunch of different ways, so

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.036
that you get an intuition
for it.

00:02:28.036 --> 00:02:30.690
I'm doing it in a slightly
different blue.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.430
So you have to accelerate in the
y direction a bit, and we

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.210
don't know how long, but long
enough to get its velocity in

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.360
the y direction this big.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.370
And then what would you have to

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.460
accelerate in the x direction?

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.760
Well, your x component
shrinks a little bit.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.170
This was its x component, and
now since you're tilted down,

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.510
you get more y and less x.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.770
So what direction does
acceleration have to go in to

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.280
shrink the x component?

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.690
You have to go opposite.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.020
So your acceleration is going
to go that way a little bit.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.415
And so if you were to add these
two vectors, you would

00:03:06.415 --> 00:03:08.620
have to accelerate something--
the acceleration vector would

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.870
look something like this.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.740
So I'm-- And this might be a
little confusing to you, but

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.385
all I'm showing is that, I want
you to think about-- Say

00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:28.060
an object is traveling through
space at a constant velocity,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.540
what does the acceleration
vector have to look like in

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.310
order for that object to
curve a little bit?

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.670
So for example, if this was
the-- let me draw, let's say

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.400
this object was here.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.530
And if we had no force on it,
it would just keep moving in

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.930
this direction.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.220
Its path would look like this.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.260
I'll draw the path in brown.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.210
The path would look like this.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.330
It would be here, and then
it would be here

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.400
a few seconds later.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.220
It would just keep going in the
direction that it's at.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.430
And we know that from Newton's
law, an object in motion tends

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.730
to stay in motion.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.120
And the only way you can have a
change in velocity is if you

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.840
have some net force
and some net

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.160
acceleration on the object.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.410
So in order for the object to
curve, in order for the

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.080
object's path to look something
like this-- so

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.010
here's the other path.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.600
Let's say the object's
path is like this.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.480
And let's say it
keeps curving.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.620
The object's path
is like that.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.940
It keeps curving.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.070
Goes there, to there.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.670
It's going in a curved motion.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.720
What has to keep happening?

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.240
Well, in order for the object's
velocity to go from

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.330
this direction, in the x
direction, in order for its

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.750
velocity to go from this,
to go from this.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.130
You have to accelerate
a little bit inwards.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.990
We drew that right here.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.450
You have to have an inward
acceleration.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.800
And now its velocity-- and now
if you did nothing else, and

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.730
the object will just keep
going in this direction.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.560
So in order to make it curve
little more, you've got to

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.580
pull in a little bit again.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.770
So you have to have-- and then
if you don't pull in again,

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.620
it'll just keep going
in this direction.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.560
So you got to keep pulling
inwards on it.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.250
And I think you're starting
to get a sense of what I'm

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.930
saying, so if you want the
object to go in a circle, for

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.210
example, there has to be
constant inward force always

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.560
pulling on the object.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.190
Because if there isn't that
constant inward-- so this is

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.270
this off white color, this
is when there's a

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.310
constant inward force.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.030
The object's going to travel
in a circular path.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.600
Well, what if that inward
force doesn't exist?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.710
Let's say that inward force is
there, and then all of a

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.460
sudden when the object's here,
the inward force disappears.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.100
Then the object's just going
to go in a straight line.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.280
Tangent to the circular path.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.830
And that makes more sense.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.980
And I'll go into it
in a little bit

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.720
more detail in a second.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.170
But if you are spinning
an object around in

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.490
a circle on a string.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.490
And the string is providing the
inward force, and as soon

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.730
as you let go of the string,
the object goes off in a

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:50.500
straight line.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.320
And so that that's what
we're talking about.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.215
So what does this inward
acceleration has-- actually,

00:05:56.215 --> 00:05:58.170
before I go into actually
calculating what that inward

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.940
acceleration has to be, let's
think about what happens when

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.860
that inwards acceleration
isn't enough

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.110
or if it's too much?

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.290
So I just said, if I have an--
let's say this is like the

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.510
center of our rotation.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.160
Let's say this is where the
inward force is coming from.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.140
Right there.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.770
And let's say this
is my object.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.070
Let say it's a spaceship.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.320
That's my spaceship.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.440
Fire coming out of it.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.410
And actually the fire would
only go on an impulse.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.300
Because once you have a little
fire coming out in space,

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.480
there's no wind resistance,
so it'll keep just going.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.850
You don't have to keep-- so the
science fiction movies,

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.310
where the fire just
keeps going, that

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.010
doesn't make sense.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.400
You would just have an impulse
of fire that would accelerate

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.690
you, and then you wouldn't have
to keep fueling the fire

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:44.820
in the back of the spaceship.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.455
But anyway, maybe you realize
it already, or that's out of

00:06:47.455 --> 00:06:50.180
the scope of this lecture, but
let's say that the object's

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.580
velocity is like that.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.420
And I don't know, let's say this
is a planet, or it's some

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.830
kind of weird forcefield,
or something.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.520
If this forcefield is a weak
forcefield, if this object is

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.100
moving really fast, and this
is a weak forcefield that's

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.540
always pulling in towards it,
the object's path is going to

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.790
look something like this.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.490
It's not going to be a circle.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.750
It's going to kind of
spiral outwards.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.620
So that's kind of a
weak inward force.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.693
If it's a really strong inward
force, the object's path is

00:07:25.693 --> 00:07:26.650
going to look like this.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.250
And I'll do that in yellow.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.290
It's actually going
to fall in.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.310
It's going to spiral
into the object.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.540
And if it's just right, given
how far the object is, and

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.100
I'll give you a formula for
what just right implies.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.680
But if the inward force is just
right, the object's going

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.960
to essentially orbit
around the subject.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.380
It's going to go in
a perfect circle.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.620
Its path will be like that.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.460
So let's think about what that
inward force has to be.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.730
And we're not going to-- well,
this could have been gravity,

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.870
this inward force, but I won't
work with gravity yet, because

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.300
gravity, actually the force
changes depending on how close

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.190
you get to it.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.020
So I won't deal with
gravity yet.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.970
But it could've been anything,
it's just a tractor beam.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:15.360
So let's try to get an intuition
of how strong that

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.280
inward force is, and what
variables it's dependent on.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:26.100
So let's say I have a let's
say this is my hand, and I

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.350
have a string.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.950
And on that string,
I have a rock.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:41.980
And my question is, if I want
this rock just spinning around

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.400
in a circle, and it'll spin
around in a perfect circle.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.720
We've all done this before.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.180
If I want the rock to spin
around in that circle, what

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.330
has to be the force that
I pull on this string?

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.320
Or essentially, how much does
the inward acceleration have

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.280
to be on that rock?

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.870
Let's get an intuition for
maybe what has to happen.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.430
So think about it, if the rock
is moving, let's say that

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.750
right here, at this point,
its velocity looks

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.700
something like that.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.310
At this point, it's velocity
looks something like this.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.480
And then when the rock is
here, its velocity looks

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.730
something like this.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.650
So to move from this velocity
to this velocity, if the

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.990
magnitude is really big, I'm
going to have to apply more

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.990
acceleration to change
direction.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.170
Hopefully that makes
a little sense.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.130
To go from this velocity
vector to

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.730
this velocity vector.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.390
If this vector was even bigger,
if to say the vector

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.330
looked like this, it
had more magnitude.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.910
I would have to pull inward
with even more force and

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.000
accelerate inward at an
even higher rate.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.290
So definitely, the higher the
velocity the more I'm going to

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.410
have to pull in.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.400
And also the higher the
velocity, the shorter the time

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.580
between this and this.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.620
This object is moving
around in a circle.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.540
So there's kind of two
components that are

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.180
affecting-- velocity affects
the acceleration

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.840
I need in two ways.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.620
Well, actually I'm running out
of time, so I'll continue this

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.220
in the next video.
