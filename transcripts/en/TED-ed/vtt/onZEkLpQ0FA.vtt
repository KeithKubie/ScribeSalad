00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:07.281
In this short video,

00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:08.528
we're going to show you how we use

00:00:08.552 --> 00:00:10.302
two different animation techniques,

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:11.692
both rotoscoping

00:00:11.716 --> 00:00:13.660
and traditional hand-drawn animation

00:00:13.684 --> 00:00:15.317
in the TED-Ed Lesson,

00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:18.725
"Miss Gayle's 5 Steps to Slam Poetry:

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:21.941
A Lesson of Transformation."

00:00:26.648 --> 00:00:28.351
A poetry slam is a competition

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:30.805
in which poets are judged on their poems,

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.639
often for qualities of emotional power

00:00:32.663 --> 00:00:34.239
and lyrical resonance.

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:36.439
Our Lesson was created by Gayle Danley,

00:00:36.463 --> 00:00:37.528
a veteran slam poet

00:00:37.552 --> 00:00:39.219
who spent decades teaching children

00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:42.009
to express themselves
through spoken words,

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:44.367
a Lesson, which offers
a guide to creating poetry

00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:46.038
with immediacy and power,

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:49.239
also serves as a great
example of exactly that.

00:00:49.263 --> 00:00:51.121
It's a story told in the form of a poem

00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:53.405
that packs a real emotional punch.

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:54.746
She introduces Tyler,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.994
who's sitting in an 11th
grade writing class,

00:00:57.018 --> 00:00:59.685
struggling with the assignment
of having to write a poem

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:01.412
based on a personal experience.

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:03.573
The story is told from two perspectives,

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:04.555
one external

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.107
and one internal.

00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:07.905
Miss Gayle's narration sets the stage

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:09.497
of the outside world,

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:11.850
and spoken word artist Pages D. Matan

00:01:11.874 --> 00:01:13.941
performs Tyler's inner voice.

00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:15.103
To set these two realms

00:01:15.127 --> 00:01:16.979
of inner- and outer-experience apart,

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:18.908
a different animation technique was used

00:01:18.932 --> 00:01:20.021
to illustrate each.

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:22.093
The real world was animated
by rotoscoping,

00:01:22.117 --> 00:01:24.881
with a frame-by-frame tracing
of live-action footage

00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:26.657
in black and white line art.

00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:28.449
The animation depicting the inner-stream

00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:30.530
of consciousness world of Tyler's memories

00:01:30.554 --> 00:01:32.126
was traditionally drawn on paper,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.722
featured watercolored backgrounds

00:01:33.746 --> 00:01:35.898
and a more expressionistic design.

00:01:35.922 --> 00:01:37.780
Once deciding on this general approach,

00:01:37.804 --> 00:01:40.062
the project went right
into pre-production.

00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:47.567
In animation, pre-production
is the planning stage.

00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:49.026
It's all the decisions
that need to be made

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.050
before going and actually making the thing

00:01:51.074 --> 00:01:52.056
in its final form.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.366
This can include developing

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.065
the look or design of the piece,

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:57.137
experimenting with colors
and camera angles,

00:01:57.161 --> 00:01:58.228
revising the script,

00:01:58.252 --> 00:01:59.059
and so on.

00:01:59.083 --> 00:02:00.655
All these decisions are important

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.822
because they determine
how much work and time

00:02:02.846 --> 00:02:04.161
the production will take.

00:02:04.185 --> 00:02:06.204
Extra time spent here figuring things out

00:02:06.228 --> 00:02:08.757
can often save a lot
of time down the road.

00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:11.085
For our project, a storyboard
was first created,

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:13.300
in which the framing,
composition, and imagery

00:02:13.324 --> 00:02:14.812
for each shot was determined.

00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:16.143
Then an animatic was made,

00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:18.228
which is basically a movie
of the storyboard.

00:02:18.252 --> 00:02:20.597
This helped us figure
out the timing of each shot.

00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:21.688
It also helped us get an idea

00:02:21.712 --> 00:02:23.811
of how well everything
would flow together visually

00:02:23.835 --> 00:02:24.806
between our rotoscoped

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.402
and traditionally animated scenes

00:02:26.426 --> 00:02:28.075
once they were assembled.

00:02:32.846 --> 00:02:35.132
For the rotoscoped shots,
we first had to create

00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:37.348
the live action footage to be traced.

00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:40.412
Working with what we had
in our humble office,

00:02:40.436 --> 00:02:41.969
we created a classroom of desks

00:02:41.993 --> 00:02:43.912
using only one small table.

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.837
We shot this multiple times

00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:48.880
from each angle the storyboard called for,

00:02:48.904 --> 00:02:50.045
each time with a different volunteer

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.961
from among our co-workers.

00:02:52.883 --> 00:02:54.266
Our source footage elements

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.850
then needed to be composited,

00:02:55.874 --> 00:02:57.541
or assembled and arranged together,

00:02:57.565 --> 00:02:59.393
before we could rotoscope them.

00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:01.431
A composite is a special effects term

00:03:01.455 --> 00:03:03.884
for a shot that combines
two or more elements in it

00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:05.559
that were created separately.

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:07.313
To do this, we used After Effects,

00:03:07.337 --> 00:03:10.103
a digital compositing
and motion graphics program.

00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:11.245
The first step was to isolate

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.746
the part of the frame we needed

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.129
by masking off the unnecessary
negative space,

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:17.197
or parts of the frame we didn't need.

00:03:17.221 --> 00:03:19.269
The individual shots
were then each layered

00:03:19.293 --> 00:03:20.445
into one composite shot,

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:22.290
resized and arranged appropriately

00:03:22.314 --> 00:03:23.242
to create the illusion of them

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:26.560
all being there in perspective
at the same time.

00:03:26.584 --> 00:03:28.732
Every third frame was then exported

00:03:28.756 --> 00:03:29.825
as an image sequence,

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.571
ready to be rotoscoped.

00:03:31.595 --> 00:03:33.242
The tracing was done digitally,

00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:35.617
drawn directly on a Cintiq monitor.

00:03:42.363 --> 00:03:43.554
The rest of the animation

00:03:43.578 --> 00:03:45.431
was done by hand on paper.

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:46.849
Unlike rotoscoping,

00:03:46.873 --> 00:03:48.921
here the timing and motion
of the animation

00:03:48.945 --> 00:03:51.464
was all planned out by the animator
ahead of time.

00:03:51.488 --> 00:03:53.774
An appropriate number
of drawings were then done

00:03:53.798 --> 00:03:55.444
to accomplish the movement.

00:03:56.258 --> 00:03:58.368
Each animation drawing is then scanned,

00:03:58.392 --> 00:03:59.050
registered,

00:03:59.074 --> 00:04:01.335
and sequenced together in the computer.

00:04:02.288 --> 00:04:04.435
That animation sequence is then composited

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.793
with the layered background art.

00:04:06.817 --> 00:04:09.684
Camera moves are then
plotted out and executed.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.847
One way that poetry uses language

00:04:17.871 --> 00:04:19.625
to communicate emotions and ideas

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.577
is through the use of metaphor.

00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:25.985
"Mama's lies are footsteps
too many to count

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.454
making excuses on black snow."

00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:32.028
Animation's a medium that's also
uniquely well-suited

00:04:32.052 --> 00:04:34.031
to communicating emotions and ideas

00:04:34.055 --> 00:04:36.161
through visual metaphor.

00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:37.557
Applying the dual techniques

00:04:37.581 --> 00:04:39.644
of rotoscoped and traditional animation,

00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:41.492
each with their own inherent looks,

00:04:41.516 --> 00:04:43.040
allowed us to visually represent

00:04:43.064 --> 00:04:44.922
the dual nature of the creative process

00:04:44.946 --> 00:04:46.525
described in the Lesson.

00:04:46.549 --> 00:04:49.073
There's the internal aspect
of experience and memory,

00:04:49.097 --> 00:04:50.832
which is mined for inspiration,

00:04:50.856 --> 00:04:52.166
and there's the external aspect

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.419
of revealing it to the world

00:04:53.443 --> 00:04:55.129
through a structured presentation.

00:04:55.153 --> 00:04:57.014
We combined both techniques
for the last shots

00:04:57.038 --> 00:04:59.150
of Tyler delivering his poem to the world,

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:01.373
allowing us to convey
in a direct, visual way

00:05:01.397 --> 00:05:03.350
the power of that moment of communication

00:05:03.374 --> 00:05:05.078
when internal becomes external,

00:05:05.102 --> 00:05:06.974
which, in both poetry and animation,

00:05:06.998 --> 00:05:08.778
is where the magic happens.
