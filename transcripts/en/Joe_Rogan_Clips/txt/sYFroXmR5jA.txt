Speaker 1:          00:00          How do you, how do you deal with people like the haters? Because there's so many people. I call them thumb thugs, but how do you deal there? There's hate in the dark. I don't know what they're doing. You don't read all those comments there? I don't read shit anymore, man. A very, very rarely go into mentioned. If I do, it's usually a mistake. I just, I just do my best, do my best. I post and I go, I post and ghost. You don't even look at people's feeds, do? No. I look at some people's feeds on Instagram when I'm bored. You know, I'm, I'll, I'll read some things. You know, I want to look at some cool pictures. I watched some inspirational shit. I like going to the rocks, seen him lifting weights. May pumped up. I want to go to the gym. Let me do the rock is, let me tell you it Fletcher.

Speaker 1:          00:41          I interviewed the rock the first time I met him. I was like 11 years ago during the game plan and we just hit it off right game playing the game plan. That's where he played a quarterback because he was a lot thinner. It's his first breakout movie that he did Scorpion and then the game plan. And after that interview, uh, he took some time and just talk to me. He wasn't the rock then. I mean he was, and then over the years, every time I interviewed him, he would pull me aside and go, are you going to my acting coach? Are you doing this? Are you doing that? Is there anything I can help you with? And I'm like, what? Like, and then he got bigger and bigger and the last time I saw him, same thing, Yo, are you doing, are you going to acting coach?

Speaker 1:          01:18          Are you working on your goals or your improved like literally his Instagram but in real life and um, and it's, and he'll never know this, but it's the thing that's for me just average Schmo, Michael Yo d to take the time out. Every time I interview him to ask me if I'm achieving my goals, if I'm moving forward in life, giving me positive things, positive thoughts to take that time like five minutes after every interview. And this dude is booked nonstop, but to actually take time and it's just so inspirational in to see him be the biggest movie star in the world. And he knows everybody's name. He's very respected. I don't know if he has an earpiece, but like, it's like he's like the president when he walks, he knows everybody's name. He could be president. He, oh hundred percent hundred percent could be predators. He cannot run through forum.

Speaker 1:          02:05          I went to, because he, he's just a hard also comes from humble beginnings. Yes. You mean he's in Hawaii right now and he's filming on his Instagram. He's talking about all the neighborhoods that he goes back to to check to see where he was. Where's from when he was poor and starving. Yeah. You know, I mean, he really is from humble beginnings. I mean he, he had only like, you know, it's the story of like $5 left in as account and then he got discovered and wrestling and I knew him in Miami when he was doing WWE. I interviewed him a couple of times over there and, and he played for the University of Miami. My favorite college football team. So it's a thing where, you know, the history of 11 years, but for him that big to take time to motivate me separately. And you know, I know if he sees me out, he knows my name, but it's not like I'm texting, I'm not like Kevin Hart with them and just to be a random dude that he takes time out every time he sees me to make sure I'm hitting my goals and moving forward with my career and not back and then offering, hey, if you ever need anything, get in touch with me.

Speaker 1:          03:04          You know, I would never take them up on that. But it's a thing where I'm nobody, he's the rock. And to be that inspiration, I mean it, it just does so much man. Like it. Little things that big celebrities do or somebody that really inspires you. Like they don't know how much that means. Like just that little time he spins it, it'd so much. I think he does know, I think he's a genuine leader. He is, you know, 100% that's why so many people like him because what he says is it's authentic. It's really who he is. There is nothing fake about that man. You don't have to be fake. You just have to be successful. And if you want to work as hard as that guy, you can be successful. I, I asked one day, I was like, do you just take a bunch of pictures at the gym like in just posts throughout the day because you're always at that big from taking pictures for no man.

Speaker 1:          03:53          That guy's picking heavy shit up. That's too big. But you know what? I left. That's just too big Joe stuff. Too Big for him. No, he's an action star Dude. And he's the first action start at looks like an egg. Like I would want him to save my life in real life. Wow. What does he like six, seven or some shit like that. And like he's, he's this giant, he's a little bit taller than me. I'm seeing these giant, he's built like a fucking like legitimate superhero. Like, will Smith was my guy, but I left will Smith for the rock. And you left him? No, no, no. I stayed. He's still, well, no, no, no. But like you gotta do what you gotta do. Burning, building a burning building. Who's going to save you? Who's going to save you? Will Smith let me save you two aliens coming at you. Uh, Independence Day. Did you not see will Smith Save the world? I dug my look. I love will Smith. An earthquake. An earthquake. Well, if you want someone to hold one hand on the top of a building and then hold your wrist with another and know that he's got you according to the movie poster, that's the rock. See, I never saw will Smith holding the top of the building. [inaudible] shoot a gun by the hand. Will Smith can shoot a gun? Those, those zombies he did. I am legend. Oh Man. What a great fucking movie. Oh my goodness. Great. Fuck moving. God.
