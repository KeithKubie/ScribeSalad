00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.400
Everyone is up in arms about Ebola, but what
about the Enterovirus?

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.750
Is that an even bigger threat to our nation’s
health?

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.750
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and there’s
been a lot of media coverage lately about

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.539
all kinds of diseases - Ebola, the flu, and
now Enterovirus.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.980
A 4-year-old boy in New Jersey died in his
sleep two weeks ago, making it the first reported

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.250
case of death caused by Enterovirus EV-D68.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.360
So what is the Enterovirus, and should we
be worried about it?

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.579
/Well, believe it or not, Enterovirus EV-D68
is just one of over 100 different strains

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.100
of enterovirus, the most famous one being
poliovirus.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.770
/According to the CDC, the US sees about 10-15
million cases of enterovirus every year, usually

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.250
peaking around the end of summer and early
fall.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.380
The EV-D68 strain, though, is a relatively
uncommon form.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.030
Over the past 50 years, it’s been responsible
for fewer than 100 cases of enterovirus.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.880
/So the reason it’s receiving so much attention
THIS year - is because of the sheer amount

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.200
of cases of it, and the numbers of hospitalizations
it’s caused.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.280
So far, more than 43 states have reported
cases of the D68 virus.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.360
/Symptoms of enterovirus usually appear in
the form of a bad summer cold - fever, runny

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.880
nose, cough, and muscle aches are all indications
of a mild infection.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.530
But D68 in particular, has been linked to
severe respiratory illness, and in some cases,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.370
even temporary paralysis.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.270
Children - and especially those with asthma
- are particularly vulnerable, because they

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.830
haven’t been exposed to the virus as much,
and thus haven’t developed an immunity to

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.830
it.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.280
Most of them also attend schools, which is
a very easy way to pass the virus around.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.550
/Unfortunately, since there’s really no
cure or vaccine for D68 - the best method

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.530
of treatment is prevention.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.580
The CDC is recommending that everyone reduce
their exposure by washing their hands with

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.490
soap and water for 20 seconds, keeping their
hands away from their face, and avoiding people

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.910
who are sneezing or coughing.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.920
/In the event your child DOES become ill over
the next few months, then there’s probably

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920
no reason to worry.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.390
But if they start exhibiting respiratory problems
or showing signs of extreme muscle weakness

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.840
- then, the CDC says, you should contact a
doctor immediately.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.810
/Of course the silver lining here, and the
one thing you SHOULD remember if your child

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.200
does get sick, is that enterovirus, usually
isn’t deadly.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.280
Which means the case of the boy in New Jersey,
appears to be an extreme outlier.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.220
What do you guys think about this?

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.900
And are you more worried about enterovirus,
or Ebola?

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.060
