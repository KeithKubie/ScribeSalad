00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.280
Filmmaking is a painstaking process, one that
usually takes months, sometimes years, to

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.280
complete.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.650
Your average film takes two to four months
to shoot, with bigger-budgeted films often

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.120
taking much longer, as each and every scene
usually requires multiple takes.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.430
A talented cast and crew can make all the
difference, and it’s always helpful when

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.349
your stars manage to nail a scene on their
very first try.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.650
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Incredible Movie
Scenes Nailed on the First Take.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.690
Rocky

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.610
A relative unknown before his breakout role
in the boxing drama, star Sylvester Stallone

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.040
fought tooth and nail for his script to be
adapted exactly the way he envisioned.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.330
After convincing producers to allow him to
play the lead role, Stallone and the rest

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.260
of the crew had to cut plenty of costs, but
the actor refused to let this crucial scene

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.260
be one of them.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.479
With the film running behind schedule, Stallone
was allowed only one shot at Rocky’s most

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:10.640
vulnerable moment, confessing his insecurities
to his girlfriend, Adrian.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.700
Thankfully, that was all he needed, and the
character’s pivotal moment was kept.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.899
10 Thing I Hate About You

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.090
This romantic comedy launched the careers
of its trio of young stars: Heath Ledger,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.729
Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Julia Stiles, with
the latter’s high school poem giving the

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.340
movie its title.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.759
The poem could have been a little corny, but
was given an added layer when the then-17

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.590
year old Stiles slowly broke down into tears
on the very first take, an acting cue that

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:50.170
was not in the film’s script.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.159
First-time director Gil Junger was so moved,
he called a wrap to the shoot after that,

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.150
and the scene’s only take continues to live
on in ‘90s pop culture lore to this day.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.170
The Man with the Golden Gun

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.759
Thanks to the innovations of CGI, spectacular
action pieces are far easier (and less dangerous)

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.789
to pull off than they used to be.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.280
Roger Moore’s second outing as James Bond
featured one of the most outrageous stunts

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.720
in movie history, one that reportedly had
several ambulances watching from the sidelines,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.580
fearing the worst.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.150
When the angle, speed, and rotation were all
calculated and built to let gravity deliver

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.510
a perfect barrel roll, stunt driver Loren
“Bumps” Williard not only managed to avert

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.620
disaster and pull off a full corkscrew, he
did so on his very first attempt.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.360
And earned a huge bonus for it.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.140
The Master

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.310
Both Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman
received Academy Award nominations for their

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.390
work in Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master,
and with scenes like this, it’s easy to

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.390
see why.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.670
Phoenix’s unhinged performance as an alcohol-addled
follower of Hoffman’s character was on full

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.040
display in this largely improvised scene.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.570
Phoenix goes absolutely berserk, and his first
take at the scene was the one Anderson chose

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.540
to use in the final cut, for obvious reasons.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.620
Phone Booth

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.690
Already well on his way to Hollywood’s A-List
in 2003, Colin Farrell teamed with director

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:30.200
Joel Schumacher to star in this psychological
thriller about a man held hostage in a New

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.080
York City phone booth by a sniper.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.080
The shooter, played by Kiefer Sutherland,
demands that Farrell’s character come clean

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.610
to his wife about his marital infidelities,
resulting in an emotional scene that the actor

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.650
managed to nail down on the first take.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.210
The entire film was shot in just 12 days and
proved to be a sleeper hit with critics and

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.810
audiences alike, thanks in no small part to
Farrell’s stellar performance.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.820
Beauty and the Beast

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.830
The climactic theme song of this Disney classic
underwent several changes on its way to winning

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.870
Best Original Song at the 1992 Oscars.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.060
Originally conceived as a more up-tempo rock
song, it was eventually retooled into a romantic

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.240
ballad to better fit the scene.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.030
Angela Lansbury, who portrayed Mrs. Potts,
was initially reluctant to provide the vocals,

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.720
thinking herself a poor fit for the style
of song.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.710
At the directors’ request, the actress recorded
one take as a backup, in case no other options

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:35.370
were found.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.749
Lansbury reportedly brought the entire studio
to tears with her performance, and audiences

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:42.699
followed suit when the film was released a
year later.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.249
Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.939
Working with animals is never an easy process,
no matter how well-trained they are, but it’s

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:54.120
probably much easier when you’re dealing
with the Lord of all horses.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.939
Shadowfax was said to be capable of running
faster than the wind and understanding human

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:02.240
speech in the Lord of the Rings novels, which
would help explained how he was able to nail

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.560
down his majestic entrance on the first take.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.000
Complete with a dramatic twist of his head.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.300
It turns out the horse was more than ready
for his moment in the spotlight.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.229
Citizen Kane

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.539
Continuing the trend of cinematic classics
is screen legend Orson Welles’ film debut,

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.650
widely considered one of the greatest and
most influential of all time.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.181
That also means its home to one of the most
critically acclaimed one-take scenes, when

00:05:29.181 --> 00:05:34.360
the main character’s wife leaves him, sending
the decaying mogul into a violent tirade,

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.150
completely destroying her bedroom.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.039
Given the destruction Welles caused to the
set, the first take of this infamous scene

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.690
was, understandably, the only take.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.169
That was all the actor needed, and one of
the film’s most iconic moments was born.

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:49.169
To Kill a Mockingbird

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.770
It’s probably the most memorable one-and-done
scene in movie history.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.620
Gregory Peck’s performance as Atticus Finch
earned him the title America’s greatest

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.100
movie hero of the 20th century, and the unforgettable
closing statement in which Finch demanded

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.710
the jury “do their duty” was originally
planned to take several days.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.650
But the seasoned veteran of the stage and
screen somehow managed to nail the speech

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:19.210
in only one take – 
that alone was enough to guarantee Peck’s

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:26.919
first and only Best Actor Oscar.

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:34.069
Alien Resurrection

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:38.960
Finally, can a shot nailed on the last take
be just as impressive as the first?

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.129
Allow us to explain.

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:43.939
One of the few bright spots of the fourth
entry in the Alien film series was Sigourney

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:48.080
Weaver’s infamous no-look basketball shot
in the movie’s first act.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.029
After spending weeks practicing, Weaver was
only hitting about a sixth of her attempts.

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:55.699
The director preferred to just add the shot
in later – which is why the shot was staged

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:00.710
with the ball leaving the frame – but allowed
Weaver six attempts to pull it off for real.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.939
With 5 misses, the actress put her last chance
to good use.

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:09.819
The cheers from her co-stars meant the shot
had to be cut immediately, but Weaver delivered,

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:11.550
hitting nothing but net.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.249
The rest of the movie?

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:17.800
Not so much.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.949
So what did you think of our list?

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:20.999
