&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We are all going
to take out our cell phones

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.850
and turn them off now.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.690
OK. Good. I'm Ron Charles.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.320
I write about books
for the Washington Post

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.930
where I also host the
Totally Hip Video Book Review.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.290
First, a word of thanks to our
cochairman of this festival,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.140
David Rubenstein, and the other
generous sponsors who've made

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.440
this event possible.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.230
If you'd like to add
your financial support,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.040
please note the information
in your program.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.300
We'll have some time after this
conversation for your questions.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.450
And I've been asked to
remind you that if you come

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.770
to the microphone, you will
be included in the videotape

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.090
of this event, which may be
broadcast at a later date.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.510
Our guest this afternoon
is Deborah Harkness.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.040
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.570
Now as you may have
heard...as you may have heard,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.300
there's a witch hunt
going on in Washington.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.590
[ Laughter ]

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.730
Some old man keeps
nattering on about that.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.030
&gt;&gt; Whoa!

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Well,
today, it's true.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.630
But it has nothing to
do with Robert Mueller.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.140
[ Laughter ]

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.070
Dr. Harkness is a
professor at the University

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.100
of Southern California,
historian of science

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.060
and medicine with a particular
interest in the period of 1400

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.960
to 1700, which if you know
your history, was a really,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.300
really bad time to be a witch.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.330
[ Laughter ]

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.200
Dr. Harkness has
published scholarly work

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.520
on the 16th-century
alchemist John Dee,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.270
the Scientific Revolution
in England,

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.780
female medical practices,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.580
and even the development
of accounting.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.590
[ Laughter ]

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.920
She's received fellowships
from the Guggenheim Foundation,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.740
the National Science Foundation,
the National Humanities Center.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.750
So this is clearly a scholar who
knows her way around a library.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.230
But then a bewitching
thing happened

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.760
to her about ten years ago.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.100
"I began to wonder," she says,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.000
"what if there really
are witches and vampires?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.300
What would they do
for a living?"

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.040
[ Laughter ]

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.130
It was at that moment she
turned from the dusty world

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.670
of academics and wrote a
magical novel called A Discovery

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.490
of Witches about
the relationship

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.360
between a historian
descended from Salem witches

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.010
and a 15-year-old --
1,500-year-old vampire.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.660
[ Laughter ]

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.280
That's a whole different
story, yeah.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.140
Sorry. I'm reading fast
because I want to get her

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.440
up here as soon as possible.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.870
An international best
selling trilogy was born,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.300
the All Souls Trilogy, which
eventually included Shadow

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.990
of Night in 2012 and The
Book of Life in 2014.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.880
And her new book, A Discovery
of Witches, has been --

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.000
her first book, A Discovery
of Witches, has been adopted

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.220
into a TV series that
will be broadcast

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.510
in the United States
early next year.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.340
And in a few weeks,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.110
she'll publish a new novel
called Time's Convert.

[ Applause ]

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.650
Which through magic of
my own, I have a copy

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.740
of that she has never seen
before, and it is signed.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.540
We have some fans
here, I suspect?

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.040
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.230
OK. What is Marcus's [assumed
spelling] astrological sign?

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.840
&gt;&gt; Aries.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.530

don't hear the answer.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.830

&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: They're
just guessing now.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.480
OK. In what town
was Marcus born?

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.230
&gt;&gt; Hadley, Massachusetts.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes!

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.830
Who said that?

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.130
The book is yours!

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.930
Come on up.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.480
Ladies and gentlemen,
witches and warlocks,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.510
I give you Deborah Harkness.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:45.480
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.650
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: You can't
get away with guessing like that

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.010
with a professor in the room.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.310
[ Laughter ]

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.310
Anyway, thank you, Ron, for
that lovely introduction,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.280
and thanks to all of
you guys for coming

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.230
out to this amazing event.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.960
It's the first time I've been
at the National Book Festival,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.690
and it is such a
treat be to here

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.360
to celebrate the
special relationship

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.530
between books and readers.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.080
So I think that it's fair to
say that if you're in this room,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.330
you are a reader, right?

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.650
[ Applause ]

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.490
Which means that these are
now, you know, several hundred

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.670
of your best friends
because everybody

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.390
in the room shares that.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.070
And there's nothing like books
and sharing our favorite books

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.870
to sort of bring
people close together.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.290
And that's what's so amazing

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.010
about the National
Book Festival,

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.120
based on what I've seen already.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.530
So as Ron said -- and I'm sure
that comes as news to nobody

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.680
in the room, I am
not only an author,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.310
but I'm also a professor.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.730
And I am a specific
kind of professor.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.090
You know, there's a sort of tree

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.650
of knowledge out
there in history.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.490
There's all these fields
and subfields and subfields.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.930
So when people say,
well, do you teach?

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.730
I always say, Europe
between 1400 and 1700.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.640
And they said OK, yeah, but
-- you know, so Louis the XIV?

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.960
And I say, no, no,
not Louis XIV.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.450
I mostly teach the 16th century.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.770
And they say, oh,
OK, Henry VIII?

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.180
And I'm like, kind of, but
usually I teach, you know,

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.970
the history of science
and medicine,

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.500
which makes me an
intellectual historian.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.810
And people always say, and
intellectual historian?

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.530
Yeah, I study how people
think about the world

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.830
and their place in it.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.610
That's what intellectual
history is really all about.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.860
And I became an intellectual
historian basically

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.100
when I was a sophomore
in college.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.090
Everybody in the room
probably can remember a teacher

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.530
who may have asked
them a pivotal question

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.400
at some point in
their education.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.270
For me, it was a professor named
Harold Gare Goodyear [phonetic],

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.110
and he asked in a class on
magic in the Renaissance --

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.270
talk about the shape
of things to come --

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.800
he asked, how do you know
what you think you know?

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.740
And I still remember
to this day --

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.240
I remember the table in the
library where I was sitting

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.540
when he asked that question.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.750
I remember which chair I was in.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.560
Because I felt like the whole
top of my head lifted off.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.640
How do I know what
I think I know?

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.220
That was the beginning
of my journey

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.870
into intellectual history
and the history of science.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.810
But of course, even though
I've gone from European history

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.300
to the 16th century to
intellectual history

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.620
and the history of science,
there's even a further,

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.100
weird subspecialty of mine;

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.710
and that subspecialty is
the history of the book.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.020
What the history of the book is,

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.920
is a little less
self-explanatory

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.130
than the history of
science and medicine.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:05.050
Basically, the history of
the book studies what it is

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.030
that we're here celebrating,
this special relationship

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.330
between books and readers.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.630
[ Applause ]

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.930
But it's -- yeah.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.510
So for those of you who are
really into reading yourself,

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.120
you should know that there's
a whole historical field

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.200
that is dedicated
to you in the past.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.340
So I actually -- like, if you
really burrow down closely,

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.410
my real research
specialty is, how did people

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:37.110
in the past share
information about science

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:41.480
and medicine in their notebooks?

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.010
That's what I really
do for a living.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.380
[ Applause ]

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.830
Talk about the head
of a pin here.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.450
So the history of the book, it
includes how books were made,

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.970
who wrote books,
how they were sold,

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.380
the technologies of printing.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.510
Papermaking is included in
the history of the book,

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:03.340
ink making -- for those of you
who remember Diana buying ink

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.900
in London in Shadow of Night,

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.490
is included in the
history of the book.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.170
The transition from
manuscript culture

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.670
to print culture is included
in the history of the book.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.430
You might be entertained to know

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.890
that when the printing
press was invented,

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.010
people thought it was the end
of civilization as we knew it.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.990
[ Laughter ]

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.130
Because no one would
remember how to write anymore.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:29.040
And when I was listening to all
of the debates about e-readers

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.600
and electronic books, and
it was the end of the world,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.280
I was so reminded of what
people thought at the end

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.080
of the 15th century when
printing presses were set up

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.180
and put a whole lot of scribes

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.310
who had been handwriting
books --

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.670
imagine that for a
job -- out of work.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.600
And people said it's
the end of the world,

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.310
it's the end of civilization.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.870
So these are some of
the things that we study

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.620
as historians of the book.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.090
And for those of
you who are readers

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.390
of the All Souls Trilogy,

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.160
what you're probably realizing
is you've picked up a lot

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.190
of information about the history
of the book in your travels.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.830
So you may have thought you
were just getting history,

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.980
political history, history
of science and medicine.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.930
You were getting my great love,

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.650
which is the history
of the book as well.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.640
Now in the history of the book,
there are things that are harder

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.890
to come to terms
with than others.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.580
It's pretty easy
for us, for example,

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.850
to figure out what
books were published

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.230
in X year in any given country.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.830
One of the things that I
used to do for fun was to go

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.320
through the Library of
Congress's lists of all

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.760
of the books that were
published in a given year

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.260
in England and then read them.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.460
[ Laughter ]

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:48.440
Because it was maybe a couple
hundred titles back in the day

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.260
when printing was
still a new technology.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.270
And it was a great way
to learn about a culture.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.100
That all worked its way into
Shadow of Night as well.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.700
If you think about her
going book shopping

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.150
and seeing those
books on the counter

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.810
at the local apothecary's shop.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.430
So it's easy for
us to get access

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.780
to things like, what
did people buy?

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.780
It's even easy for us to
get access into what kinds

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.910
of things they marked
up in their books.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.120
I wrote a whole book
about the annotations

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.780
that Queen Elizabeth's
court astrologer, John Dee,

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.890
what annotations he made in his
scientific and medical books.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.960
However, there's something
that's very hard for historians

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.750
of the book to get access to,
and it's the thing we most want

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:40.070
to know, which is what was
the experience of reading

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.950
like for people in the past?

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.120
So you can do a little thought
experiment here with me.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.260
Just close your eyes
for a minute and try

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:58.170
to remember a sort of important
reading memory that you have.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.950
It could be a memory
from childhood.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.450
It could be a recent memory.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.200
It could be something
that you experienced

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.590
where you had a strong
negative reaction to a book

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.640
or a strong positive
reaction to a book.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.010
Think about how old you were.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.710
Think about where you were
when you were reading it,

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.240
when it was in your life.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.140
Do you remember anything
else about it?

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.180
Do you remember how you
felt at that moment?

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.760
What you've just conjured

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.470
up is the Holy Grail
for book historians.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:40.700
It is the moment when the
reader and the text connect.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.190
And of all the things I study,
that is the thing I most want

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:49.830
to understand and where I
can find very little evidence

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.320
in the 16th century that helps
me understand what it was

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.560
like for one of Shakespeare's
contemporaries

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.460
to essentially pick
up a book and read it.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.640
Because what we know is
they didn't read like us.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.850
Some of them didn't
read silently.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:08.130
Often, you read aloud to
people and shared texts orally.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.030
We're not really sure
if you even bought,

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.010
for example, books
as whole books.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.970
Some people, it's clear,
bought pieces of books

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.360
and then had them
stitched together later

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.050
because they couldn't afford
the whole text at one time.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:26.290
So for me, my memory
is a memory of being --

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:31.710
it was 1973, so I would
have been eight years old.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.360
I was visiting my
mother's family in England.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.990
I was in my cousin Sharon's
[assumed spelling] upstairs

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.310
bedroom sitting on the bed,

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:43.740
and my aunt Sylvia [assumed
spelling] gave me a copy of Anne

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.260
of Avonlea that had
been my mother's

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.860
when she was growing up.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.740
And it had, "If this book
should chance to roam,

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.170
just box its ears
and send it home

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.230
to Olive Riddell [phonetic],"
which is my mother's name.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.890
And there was a lovely
drawing of a woman's face.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.660
I had no idea at the age of
eight my mother could draw.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:12.710
And I remember that the pages
in the book smelled like toffee.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.050
They were sort of
that funny paper

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.740
that turns brown really fast.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.560
Because my mother grew up
in Liverpool during the war,

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.230
and so paper was pretty scarce
and it wasn't of high quality.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.280
And to this day, I
remember sitting on that bed

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.510
in that second-floor room
with my mother's copy of Anne

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.640
of Avonlea and feeling connected
to the book, to my mother,

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.960
to a whole world
outside of Liverpool.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.190
And, you know, I've read
hundreds and hundreds of books

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.550
in my life, but that
is my memory.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.340
And now that I've said it to all
of you, hopefully at some point,

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:52.250
somewhere, it will actually
be recorded, and it will exist

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.860
for future historians who
are looking for what was it

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.630
like to be a reader
in the 20th century.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:03.420
So I started with this story
of the history of the books

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.600
because of the ways
that my fictional world,

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.280
the All Souls world, is
a world that is built

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.220
around books and readers.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:18.630
It is a world that is
filled with libraries,

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:22.760
from the Strahov Library in
Prague to John Dee's library

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.270
at Mortlake to the
Bodleian Library,

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.450
to the Beinecke Library.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:32.630
It's filled with texts that
have very close relationships

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.520
with the people who
touched them.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.420
There's a reason why in the
third book of the trilogy

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.890
that when Diana finally
gets the whole Book of Life,

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.610
it enters into her and
changes her forever.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.630
That's because that's how I
feel when I read a book, right?

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.700
It gets into me and
it changes me forever.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.910
So when I was thinking
about what I would do

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.680
after I finished the
All Souls Trilogy --

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:07.930
other than have a rest, other
than work with a wonderful team

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:12.420
of authors on The World of All
Souls Encyclopedia for you all,

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:18.480
I was trying to think about how
I could continue in the world

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:24.300
of the trilogy and what my
path forward might look like.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:29.430
And not surprisingly, I turned
to the history of the book.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.920
And I started to
think about the ways

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:38.210
in which we are what we read,
just like we are what we eat.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:42.090
That our reading shapes
us, just as Diana's contact

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.650
with the Book of
Life shaped her.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.660
I think I was influenced
a bit by this

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.540
because I was teaching the
history of the book at the time,

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.810
and I was teaching a book that
is still fairly controversial

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:57.660
by Irving Leonard called
Books of the Brave.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.770
And Irving Leonard
was interested

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:03.890
in how the conquistadors
coming from Spain

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:08.230
to the New World spent
their time on ships.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:13.140
And he looked through various
ship inventories to look

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.430
to see what books were
on board these ships

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:19.430
for this very long voyage going
from Spain to the New World.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.300
And we're in the perfect
place to discuss this.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.460
Guess what he found?

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.660
He found that the number
one reading material --

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.170
there was always a
copy of the Bible.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.020
But other than that, these
ships that were going from Spain

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.380
to the New World were
filled with genre fiction.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:43.490
They were filled with chivalric
romances, tales of King Arthur,

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.150
and knights going on quests.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:50.800
And what Irving Leonard
argued was that you can see

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.910
in the way the conquistadors
conceptualized what they were

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:57.990
doing in the New World, which
seems to be at such a distance

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:01.610
from what we as modern observers
see looking back at the evidence

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.310
of what they did to
the native populations.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.080
We see a tale that is a tale
of brutality and a failure

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.510
of empathy and a lack
of understanding.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.780
What the conquistadors saw
in themselves were people

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:20.980
on a heroic quest to look for
-- to spread the word of God.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.130
People who were looking
to have adventure

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.050
and to meet magical creatures,

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.630
all of which were in
the genre fiction.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.980
Now of course people
aren't only what they read.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.190
A lot of other things
go into it as well.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:37.420
But I was struck by
the ways in which --

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.550
the question of are you
what you read might be able

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:44.710
to help me get into my
characters' backstories.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:50.650
And I had a little bit of
a trial balloon with this.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:54.400
For those of you who read The
World of All Souls, when we came

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.300
to write the section on Matthew
and his ideas about science --

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.220
Matthew's a 1,500-year-old
vampire, as you heard,

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.560
and so he's read a
lot of science books.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.220
And when the author team
met to talk about The World

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.000
of All Souls, they
said, Deb, you know,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.360
you've got to write an overview
of Matthew's scientific ideas

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.250
and where they came from.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.550
And I just thought it was going

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.300
to be stupefyingly
boring to do that.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.990
And I'm an educator, so I have
kind of an idea of what's going

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:25.290
to be stupefyingly boring.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.190
[ Laughter ]

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.370
So I said, oh, gosh, you
know, I don't want to do that.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:33.480
But you know what, I could
tell you what were some

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:38.550
of the most pivotal reading
moments in Matthew's life,

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.620
what books influenced him, like
me reading that copy of Anne

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.230
of Avonlea that belonged
to my mother.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:50.420
And so we put books on an
imaginary bookshelf that I felt

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.840
like Matthew would have had a
really strong connection with.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.560
And once I did it with
Matthew, I wanted to do it

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.330
with other characters as well.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.630
So that brings us
to Time's Convert,

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.350
to the new book that's coming
out in just a few weeks.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:10.410
Time's Convert, the title of
the book, comes from a line

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.640
from Thomas Paine's
Common Sense.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.980
Time makes more converts
than reason.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.290
And when I was trying
to imagine the books

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.400
that Marcus would have read

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:29.550
up until the time he
became a vampire in 1781,

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.280
Common Sense was
definitely on that list,

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.160
but there were others as well.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.860
So the person who won the
book, Tracy, knows that one

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.880
of the things that Marcus
is is a child from Hadley.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.170
Hadley, Massachusetts, was on
the frontier of the colonies

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:52.430
in the 18th century
when Marcus was born.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:54.510
Incidentally, he is a Leo.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.500
[ Laughter ]

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.520
But he would have been taught

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:05.130
to read reading something
called a primer or a primer.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.850
And the Library of
Congress has amazing copies

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.920
of the New England Primer,
if you're ever in Washington

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.830
and you get a chance to
go or to look at them

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.600
on their digital collections.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.980
They were books that
had little verses

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.040
for children to read
and memorize.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.030
They often had words of
praise about the King.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:31.740
They had words of one syllable,
words of two syllables,

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.930
words of three syllables,
little parables.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.230
And that's how somebody

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.690
like Marcus would
have learned to read.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.230
What's amazing to us
is if we look back

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:48.690
at those vocabulary lists where
it's like, God and King and lady

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:53.010
and courage, words that we
wouldn't necessarily maybe think

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:56.020
would be sort of the
words that you would put

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.230
in a children's reading
guide appear on the list.

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:04.340
When Marcus finished learning
to read, he would have gone

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.810
from primers to almanacs,

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.730
the bullet journals
of the 18th century.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.310
Almost every house
had an almanac in it.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:17.030
It gave you the roads in
and outs of major cities,

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.810
it told you when major
agricultural fairs were coming.

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:25.490
It told you about big
events, big events in the life

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:29.200
of the nation, which at that
point was Great Britain.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.480
The birthdate of the King
was almost always highlighted

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.060
in red in an almanac.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.410
So Marcus would have had one

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:40.560
of those almanacs in
his house as well.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.110
He might have had an
adventure story or two.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.850
One of the most popular books

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:51.490
in the 18th century was
Robinson Caruso, and the stories

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.150
of adventure were
highly abbreviated.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:55.850
They weren't reading
the Robinson Crusoe

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.470
if you read it in English lit.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.200
That wasn't the version
they were reading.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.450
They were reading a really
sort of highly adapted,

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.530
shorter version of the story

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.130
that was really geared
towards children.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.900
As he got older, Marcus would
have moved to newspapers.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.470
Newspapers were the lifeblood

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:17.760
of print culture
in the US colonies.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.140
And again, the Library

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.230
of Congress has online the
most amazing collection

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.390
of 18th-century newspapers.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:28.290
Remember how I told you I used
to read, like, a whole year

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.580
of 16th-century books
at a clip to see

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.070
if I could learn
something about the past?

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.390
When I wrote Time's
Convert, I sat down

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.640
and started reading
colonial newspapers.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.470
And it was an amazing experience
to see that on the front page

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.700
of the newspaper were all
the advertisements for coffee

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.300
and chips, and the
political news is buried

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.600
on pages two and three.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.040
[ Laughter ]

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.520
Totally different than what
we think are the headlines

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.690
for an 18th-century audience.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.940
And of course, Common
Sense, this classic work

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.050
of the American Revolution
started its life

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.090
as a newspaper column.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.100
It was first published in
installments in newspapers,

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.690
which is how Marcus would have
first come into contact with it.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.760
And then Marcus having
read a bit of Common Sense

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.090
in the newspaper that would have
been passed around in his town

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:23.050
of Hadley that would have
been in some ways shocking

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:27.950
to the conservative town that he
grew up in that called for life

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:31.970
and liberty and equality
in really strong terms.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:36.650
Those words worked their way
into Marcus's bloodstream

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:40.710
and turned him into a patriot
who fought at Bunker Hill.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:46.120
So there's Marcus's mini
bookshelf: the primer,

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.640
an almanac, Robinson Caruso,
a folded-up newspaper,

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.010
a worn copy of Time's Convert
-- of Time's Convert --

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:55.310
[ Laughter ]

00:23:55.310 --> 00:24:00.730
-- Common Sense, where the
title Time's Convert comes from.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:05.810
And it was drawing those texts
together that gave me hope

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.000
that with all of the characters
in the All Souls Trilogy,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.490
be they witches or demons or
vampires, that I had a way

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:17.810
of connecting to them for
you and getting their stories

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:23.190
on the page that would
illuminate this world of books

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.340
and readers and characters
for you in a way

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:30.380
that would be interesting
and have something fun to say

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.590
about them and about us.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:36.110
Because I do want to continue
with the All Souls world,

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:38.710
but I never want to be the
person who when you walk

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.320
into your bookstore, your
eyes roll, and you say, oh,

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.620
God, there's another one.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.920
[ Laughter ]

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.040
Right? I always want
it to be an experience

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.790
that somehow captures a bit
of that first-time magic some

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.320
of you felt when you were
reading A Discovery of Witches.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.400
So don't be surprised
if you see more books

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.200
in the All Souls world --

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.120
[ Applause ]

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.380
-- and don't be surprised
if you're getting a lot

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.320
of the history of the
book in them as you read.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.320
Because really, that's
what we are at heart,

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.300
a community of booklovers
and book readers.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.100
So I want to at this
point invite you guys --

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.500
I've saved a lot of
time for questions

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.600
because I thought
there might be some.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.510
So we've got about, wow, 15
or 20 minutes for questions.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:33.940
So does anybody have any, please
come on up to the microphone.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.450
If nobody has them, I
will just riff for you.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.170
Oh, good. This is the moment

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.870
in a teacher's life that's
very anxiety producing.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.170
Questions?

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:43.470
Yes?

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:46.570
&gt;&gt; Hi. I first encountered
your books via audiobooks.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:47.870
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Yeah.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.080
&gt;&gt; And they're beautiful
pieces performance in my view.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.150
[ Applause ]

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.450
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Hear, hear.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:57.920
&gt;&gt; And I'm curious given
your historical perspective

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.170
on the history of the book,
where you see books going.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:05.940
I'm a first-generation Kindle
owner, so I kind of understand,

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.690
you know, you chuckling

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:11.910
at the Chicken Little
perspective on e-readers.

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:16.050
So I'm interested to hear where
you think we're going from here.

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:17.350
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: You know,

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.460
if you had told me even five
years ago how popular audiobooks

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.770
and Kindle books would become,

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.580
I think I would have
been surprised.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.900
But even more surprising
is the renaissance

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.510
of independent bookstores
that's happening.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:35.110
[ Applause ]

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:39.260
So what I think is -- what I'm
seeing a lot of is almost a --

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.560
there's a name for it.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:45.840
It's called platform agnostic
readers, which basically means,

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.140
I'll read anything on anything.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.750
[ Laughter ]

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.440
I'll read it in hardback
and paperback and audiobook

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.720
and Kindle, and that's what
I think is so exciting.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.630
So I'm trying to imagine
what the next evolution

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:00.150
of that might be.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.270
As somebody who thought
email was silly,

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.200
I'm probably the worst person
to ask about the future.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.380
[ Laughter ]

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:11.630
But it is intriguing to think
about the ways that, you know,

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:16.070
how an audiobook and a
textual book and, you know,

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:20.160
a visual adaptation of the book
might someday fuse together.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.160
And you could go back and forth
between them, which is, I think,

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.960
what a lot of people
do who have e-books.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.160
They are bouncing
back between their car

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.130
and their Kindle
and their paperback.

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:31.830
And I think that's
really what we're going

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:33.130
to see in the future.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.430
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.730
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness:
Great question.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.030
&gt;&gt; Quick follow-up.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.330
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Yeah.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:39.630
&gt;&gt; Serpent's Mirror?

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:40.930
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness:
So Serpent's Mirror.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:42.230
Who has questions about
the Serpent's Mirror?

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.530
So the Serpent's Mirror.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:44.830
The Serpent's Mirror is a book

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.690
about Matthew in
the 16th century.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:51.210
And it covers Matthew's
life under Henry VIII

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:54.530
and Mary Tudor and Elizabeth.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:58.020
And it turned out to be way
more complicated a story

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.740
than I thought.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.370
And about halfway through --

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:05.130
I have about 225
pages of it written.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.470
And Matthew did something
very surprising,

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.230
and it brought me up short.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.240
And I started working on
the Marcus book as a kind

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.310
of antidote as I worked
out the Matthew problem,

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:20.590
and the Marcus book
was finished first.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:22.840
So I had a choice at that
point whether I was going

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.320
to give you the Marcus
book first or just hold it,

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.010
and I decided I would
give it to you.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:28.310
[ Applause ]

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:29.610
But Serpent's Mirror is coming.

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:30.910
I promise.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:32.210
I promise.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.510
Yeah?

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.810
&gt;&gt; First of all, I
want to thank you

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:36.110
for how very responsive
you are with your fans --

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:37.410
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness:
Oh, you got it.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:39.780
&gt;&gt; -- especially on Facebook.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.080
That's awesome and
we appreciate it.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.380
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Thanks.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.260
&gt;&gt; So I also wanted to
ask about Gallowglass.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.930
He's my favorite
character and [laughs] --

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:48.740
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: I've
never heard that before.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.740
You are the first person
who's ever liked Gallowglass.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.430
Thank you.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:54.730
Joke [laughs].

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:59.820
&gt;&gt; Is he getting a book, please?

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.010
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: I think
Galloglass will get a book.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:09.990
I spent two wonderful weeks this
summer sailing around Ireland

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:14.700
and Scotland in a boat to get
a little closer to Galloglass.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:18.050
So he now has been advanced
to the official position

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:22.760
of having a notebook devoted
to him, which is the first step

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.080
in the book being -- now
you know I'm not fast,

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.380
so please nobody look
for this for Christmas.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.680
It's not going to happen.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.980
[ Laughter ]

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.280
But he will get his book.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.580
He will get his moment
in the sun.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.880
I promise.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.180
Yeah?

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.400
&gt;&gt; Hi. So one of the things
that I enjoyed the most

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.740
about the entire
trilogy was the way

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:43.490
that you were layering
history and science and all

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:44.790
of these things on
top of each other.

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:47.900
And so I was actually wondering
if you could talk a little bit

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.200
about the difficulty

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.930
of world-building
over actual history?

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:54.230
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Yeah.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:55.530
Great question.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.030
So as a historian, as you
can imagine, I have a kind

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.670
of fairly allergic
reaction to history going

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:05.190
out the window, be
it in anything.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:07.810
And so the way I
felt about it was --

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:10.260
and it may be a little
different for other people

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.970
who write historical fiction.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:17.560
I felt like if something was
knowable to me as a historian,

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.490
that's what it needed
to be in the book.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.370
But if something was unknowable,

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:27.140
like what was Kit Marlowe
[phonetic] doing on Halloween

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.860
in 1590, I could invent it.

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:34.130
So I'll give you an example
of how that played out.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:38.480
Matthew Roydon, who was a
real person and was part

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.140
of my research for
my master's thesis,

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.330
which was on George
Chapman's Shadow of Night.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:46.710
Any of that sound familiar?

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:50.100
He was this annoying, hanging
chad of my master's thesis

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.650
who the Shadow of Night was
dedicated to him, but he was,

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:58.080
like, the Forrest Gump
of the 16th century.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.910
But I couldn't find any real
concrete information about him.

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:03.260
So I thought, well,
he's perfect,

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.320
that's exactly what a
vampire would be like.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.030
I'm going to use Matthew Roydon.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:10.710
So actually even in Discovery
of Witches, you were falling

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.480
in love with a 16th-century
dead poet.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.620
Because I use whatever I
knew about Matthew Roydon

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.430
to shape Matthew
Clermont's character.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:21.460
Because he was this sort
of fixed, historical thing.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:25.670
Then as I started writing it, I
thought, well, Shadow of Night,

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.390
they're there in October,
they'll be out by Christmas.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:31.770
And as I kept writing, as
I do, in my loop de loops,

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:36.790
and we got closer and closer
into spring, I thought, oh, no.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:39.380
Because one of the other things
I knew about Matthew Roydon was

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.940
that he was in Prague
in March and April.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.100
I had no intention
of going to Prague.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.160
We were going to go to
London and come back.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.240
But as the plot unfolded, I
said, I'm sorry, the book --

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.000
you know, it's going
to take me longer.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.300
I have to go to Prague.

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.630
[ Laughter ]

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:58.420
And people said, what do you
mean you have to go to Prague?

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.090
And I said, Matthew
Roydon went to Prague.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:01.390
It's now March.

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:02.690
I have to go to Prague.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:04.510
And they said, no one
knows that but you.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:07.260
[ Laughter ]

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.090
And I said, I know, but I know
it, and I can't un-know it.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:14.220
And so that's sort of my
relationship with history.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.530
So people keep saying to
me, well, why is Marcus --

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:18.340
when they read the drafts
of Time's Convert --

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.460
why is Marcus in that
battle and not this battle?

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.460
Because that's what was
happening and I'm not going

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:25.940
to sort of rearrange history.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:30.010
So I almost think of it
as like a pinball machine.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:31.660
You know how when you
used to shoot the ball

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.920
of the pinball machine, there
were these little flippers

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.170
that kept the -- that's how I
think of history in my books

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:39.020
as little flippers that
are just keeping the ball

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.080
within a set of boundaries.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:45.440
And it's sometimes challenging
to work really closely

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.530
in that parameter, but
it's a challenge I enjoy,

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.910
how to stretch the truth
without breaking it.

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:53.210
A little bit like magic.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:54.510
Thanks for your question.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.470
[ Laughter ]

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:57.770
&gt;&gt; A similar question.

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:00.500
Being that you are a researcher

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:06.100
and an academic before
you were a novelist,

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.290
at what point do you
stop yourself following

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:11.580
down the rabbit hole of
delicious search in order

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:15.710
to write the actual
words of the novel?

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:18.580
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: OK, so
this is a great question.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.550
I don't stop myself from
falling down a rabbit hole.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:27.250
If you want to know why there
was a gap between Shadow

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.060
of Night and the Book of Life,
it's because I kept falling

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.040
down rabbit holes,
scientific rabbit holes,

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.790
and not being able
to extricate myself.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:37.960
So, you know, I spent 2
and a half weeks in Shadow

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.360
of Night trying to figure
out how long the voyage

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.630
from Woodstock to Europe
would take in November.

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:48.290
I called long distance
eventers who work on horses

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:52.030
over long distances and had
long, complicated discussions

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.240
about the speed you --
how long you can canter,

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:59.410
how long you can gallop, when
you have to change horses.

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:02.060
It ended up being one
sentence in Shadow of Night.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.100
[ Laughter ]

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.680
Two weeks of unending research.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.640
It was the most frustrating
two weeks.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.940
They don't teach you this

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.720
in graduate school,
just so you know.

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:16.600
And so it is one of the
delights of writing a book.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.600
And even though it feels
like a weird rabbit hole,

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.470
it almost always
produces something useful.

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:25.900
So now that I have a little
bit more confidence in myself

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:31.160
as a writer, I panic less when
I fall down those rabbit holes.

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.780
But it's always a -- where
it's a balancing act is

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.080
in the writing.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.380
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.740
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Because
historical information is

00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.450
like jalapeno pepper
or cilantro:

00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:44.820
a little goes a long way.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.300
So you don't want to sort of
take everything you've learned

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.550
about history -- and I know you
have read books like this --

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:53.510
and dump them in so that
it overwhelms the story.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:56.550
It should be a spice,
a flavoring, an accent.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.880
So one of the things that
I do is I ask myself,

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.540
if this story was
set in the present,

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:07.020
would I spend three
pages describing a table?

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:08.870
No, right?

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:12.500
So if I'm in the past, I try to
hold that same standard to it.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:18.030
That if in fact Diana sits down
at a table in the 16th century,

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:20.590
I don't devote -- I
could devote three pages

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:23.080
to describing the
table, but I try not to.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.680
And that's how I sort
of balance it out.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.980
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.280
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Great.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.580
Yeah?

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:29.880
&gt;&gt; Hi. Well, USC
grad, so fight on.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.180
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Fight on.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.310
&gt;&gt; I hope that Philippe
might get a book in there.

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:36.580
I would love to maybe see
an early version of him.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:41.380
My question is, I am a leader
of a club of Army spouses,

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.570
well-read and well-traveled.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.370
So after we read your new books

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:48.170
and before your newer
ones come out,

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:50.830
what books would you
recommend for us?

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:52.700
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Wow.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.370
So, you mean, just, like,
what are some of the books

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:56.680
that I'm just loving
reading these days?

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:57.980
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.280
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: So
I will tell you for --

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.540
who has read Eleanor
Oliphant Is Completely Fine?

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.010
Give it up to Eleanor Oliphant.

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:06.310
I love that book.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.610
&gt;&gt; Did that.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:08.910
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Did that.

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.210
[ Laughter ]

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:11.510
I also have to say I just
finished reading Girl,

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:14.520
Wash Your Face, by Rachel
Hollis, which I had a lot

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.960
of fun with, and which I felt

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.670
at times she was
writing directly to me.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:22.910
I tend to be a professional
nonfiction reader,

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:27.430
so I'm actually reading
a book about papermaking,

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.700
because why not as a
historian of the book,

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.430
and I'm enjoying that.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:36.320
So yeah, those are three off the
top of my head that are right

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.540
on my to read pile or
have just read pile.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.140
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness:
Yeah, you're welcome.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.440
Hi.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.740
&gt;&gt; Hi. I run an apothecary
museum here

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.590
in Alexandria right
outside of D.C.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:59.030
that you should totally come
and visit, 18th, 19th century.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:02.470
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: OK,
that sounds like fun.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:07.560
&gt;&gt; There's people
who've been there, also.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.970
And an apothecary, that's
my particular interest.

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:18.120
I'm curious what sources you
used for some of the botany

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:22.190
that you talk about
in the witchcraft

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:24.120
that are in the books.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.420
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Yeah.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.720
It's a great question.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.020
So I spend, like I
said, lots and lots

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:32.970
of times reading scientific
and medical notebooks.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:36.570
So I spend lots of
times with notebooks

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:39.720
that medical practitioners
kept of their medical receipts,

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.470
their cures, their recipes.

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.870
Similarly, I work
on a lot of people

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:47.460
who would have self-identified
as magicians

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:50.190
in the 16th century, and
those include their spells

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:52.680
and their plant lore.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.970
So the Bodleian Library
probably has one

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:57.270
of the biggest collections

00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:04.280
and the British Library has
the second biggest collection

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:08.060
for what I do, which
is 16th century.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:14.320
But I did just buy an early
19th-century medical formulary

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.620
on eBay.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:16.920
&gt;&gt; There's a lot out there.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.210
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: I know,
there's amazing stuff on eBay.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:28.560
So I'm sort of delving
into the wonderful world

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:34.700
of 19th century drugs
right now and medicines.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.350
&gt;&gt; Come see me.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:39.180
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Well,
it's amazing, because again,

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:42.610
this book is, like,
breaking apart.

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:48.470
There's newspaper clippings in
it, there's handwritten recipes,

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:53.610
and it's everything
from veterinary recipes

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:56.520
to headache cures to apple pies.

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.820
And I just love it.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:01.000
You know, but it was clearly
some household's essential text.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.110
&gt;&gt; Well, we have
a massive archive.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:09.780
So if you are needing
research on American stuff --

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.140
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: I
will take you up on that.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.440
&gt;&gt; -- you can [inaudible] --

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.740
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Perfect.

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.040
&gt;&gt; -- on Facebook,
and [inaudible].

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.340
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: All right.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.640
I will come --

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.940
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:20.240
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness:
-- visit you.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.540
I'll take you up on that.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.840
Yes?

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.140
&gt;&gt; Hi, Deborah.

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:25.440
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Hi there.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.740
&gt;&gt; First of all, thank you.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.040
You've made the last couple
years completely enjoyable late

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.340
at night.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.640
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Oh, thanks.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.940
&gt;&gt; And during the day and
in the middle of the night.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.240
How has all this
changed your life?

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.540
How has it impacted you?

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.840
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: I
have a bigger classroom,

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.140
that's for sure.

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.440
I have to make hard
decisions about priorities

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.740
that I didn't have to do before.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:44.050
So when I first started,
you know, I was writing

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:48.110
in the morning between
five and seven.

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:51.640
No one had ever heard of me,
no one knew anything about it,

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.870
no one was waiting
for the Philippe book

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.530
or the Galloglass book.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:40:03.260
And I was just writing in the
morning, and then I would go off

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.940
and teach my classes and then
I'd cook dinner and, you know,

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:14.290
pet the dogs and go to sleep
and start the next day.

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:18.400
But now I have a couple of --

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.020
you know, in addition to being
a writer and a professor,

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:28.060
I'm an author, which is this
part of my life is coming

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.820
and meeting you, which I love.

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:34.670
And I'm also, of course,
working on the TV show

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:37.640
as an executive producer.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.140
So that's a lot of
different hats to wear.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:44.680
And sometimes I have
to make decisions

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:51.370
about doing one thing
instead of the other

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:53.280
or pushing something aside.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:58.160
And that is honestly
the hardest part

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.790
of my new life is juggling --

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:05.980
but listen, I'm talking to a
whole room of multitaskers.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.330
We're all juggling.

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:13.580
It's just that those are my
particular balls in the air.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.530
So that's my challenge
at the moment.

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:17.830
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:19.130
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness:
I'm a work in progress.

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:20.430
Hey.

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:21.730
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.030
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Hi.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:24.330
&gt;&gt; You referenced sharing
experiences and wanting

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:25.630
to know experiences
with reading,

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:27.910
and you shared a positive one.

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:32.380
Could you share your first or
strongest negative experience

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:34.440
with a book and how that shaped
you as a person and an author?

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.740
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Yes.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.040
I just got chills.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.340
I can tell you when it happened.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:39.640
It was last spring.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.230
I was teaching the
history of the book,

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:43.380
and one of my students
decided that they wanted

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.600
to do a project on Mein Kampf.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.280
And they wanted to do it
because they'd been to a museum

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.580
and there was a copy
of Mein Kampf in a --

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:50.920
kind of in a corner in a
museum, a Holocaust Museum.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.330
And they thought that it should
have a more prominent place

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:53.740
in the museum because it
had been so instrumental.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.040
And I said to her,
well, have you looked

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.340
and seen how many copies of
Mein Kampf we have here at USC?

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.640
So we did, and we discovered

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.940
that we had almost two dozen
copies of Mein Kampf at SC.

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.280
And I had to put in a request
for Mein Kampf to call them

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.580
up out of the stacks
in rare books.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:02.880
And when I went to pick up
Mein Kampf, I felt like --

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.180
first of all, I didn't want
to walk across the library

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.480
with this copy of
this book in my hand

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.780
because it had a certain
kind of power for me

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.080
that was very negative.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.380
And I also felt like
I had to explain

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.680
to the librarian
why I was taking it

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:11.980
out because I didn't want
them to think I wanted

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:13.280
to read Mein Kampf because
I liked what it said.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.580
And it gave me an insight
into all of the people

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:15.880
who were afraid to have a
book in their possession

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.180
because the power that
book had in public.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.480
I had never -- I could
not understand that.

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.780
I could not understand why
somebody would think having a

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.080
copy of Copernicus's
work on the revolution

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.380
of the spheres would
be dangerous.

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:23.680
And I didn't feel that
until I actually had to go

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.980
to my own university library and
ask them to go into rare books

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.280
and pull out a copy
of Mein Kampf for me.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.580
So that was my first really
chilling experience with a book

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:28.880
of power in a negative way.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.180
What a great question.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.480
Thank you for asking it.

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.780
All right.

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.080
We have two minutes.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.380
And we're going to have one --

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:36.680
we're going to try
to get both in.

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.980
All right, fast.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.280
&gt;&gt; This will be a
quick question.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.580
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness:
Speed round.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.880
OK.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.180
&gt;&gt; OK. Silly, I'm going silly.

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.480
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: OK.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.780
&gt;&gt; A couple weeks ago,
you promised us a list

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.080
of Matthew's swear words.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.380
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: I know.

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:49.680
[ Laughter ]

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.980
It's still on my list.

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.280
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.580
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness:
We will not forget it.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:54.880
We will get it to
you, I promise.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.180
Yes?

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.480
&gt;&gt; Going off the negative books,

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.780
I just was wondering what do
you think about Isaac Newton

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.080
or if you could speak
about him using, like --

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.380
Isaac Newton, and how he would
go to London to travel to get --

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.680
what you call it -- censored
books, and he did it in secret,

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.980
if you could talk a
little bit about that.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.280
&gt;&gt; Deborah Harkness: Yeah.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.580
Isaac Newton was a great
reader of banned books.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.880
He was also a terrible
defacer of books.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.180
One of the things that
Newton used to do was

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.480
to take the corner of books'
pages and he'd bend them

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.550
so that the point pointed
to the passage in the book

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:15.800
that he wanted to read.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:19.470
So you can go through Newton's
old books, and all you have --

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:22.550
they will actually let
you bend the corner down.

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:24.100
There's, like, a crease.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.710
And you can do that and
then see what it was

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:28.090
that he wanted to remember.

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:29.390
Don't do this with
library books, right?

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:31.130
[ Laughter ]

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:32.840
But that was what Newton did.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.370
So he was somebody
who was always

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:37.060
into secret forms of knowledge.

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.820
You know, one of the most
humbling things in my life was

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:43.950
to realize that sort of Newton
had devised calculus in 18 days.

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:49.220
But he had spent decades on a
single alchemical experiment.

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.870
So what we remember Newton

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:53.740
for is not necessarily what
Newton was spending most

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:58.060
of his time doing, and
that includes his reading.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:59.360
Because you would think

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.260
that what he would be doing
was reading everybody else's

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.810
scientific works.

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:04.890
He wasn't.

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:07.090
He was reading other
stuff and then coming

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:09.490
up with scientific
ideas of his own.

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:10.920
He wasn't all that interested

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.700
in what his fellow
scientists were doing,

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.860
which is why somebody like
Edmond Halley had to go and say,

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.320
you know, could we
please have the principia

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.630
out of your desk drawer?

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:21.150
Because some of us
would like to read it.

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:24.340
So he was a -- he had a very
interesting relationship

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:25.640
with his books.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.620
He also used to write in
the margins of his books

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.680
and between the lines
of his books.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.180
And when he ran out of room,
he'd turn the book around,

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.600
and he'd go the other way.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.840
So he was a crafty
old guy, that Newton.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:42.480
So if any of you are, you
know, personal book defacers,

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.160
you come from a long tradition

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.460
of great minds like
Isaac Newton.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:46.760
[ Laughter ]

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.060
Anyway, great questions.

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.360
Wonderful to meet you all.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.660
I hope I see you in
the signing line.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:51.960
Thanks so much.
