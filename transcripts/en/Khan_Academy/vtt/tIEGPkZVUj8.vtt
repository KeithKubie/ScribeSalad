00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.430
Problem 36.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.800
Use the diagram below
to answer the

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.690
question that follows.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:06.210
All right.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.530
There's my diagram.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.790
A gift box has dimensions
x by y by z.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.410
A decorative ribbon is wrapped
across the diagonals of the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.210
box, as shown above.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.550
Which of the following
expressions represents the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.190
approximate total length
of the ribbon?

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.840
All right.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.000
So let's just measure
this ribbon.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.630
So what's this length,
right here?

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.390
What's that length,
right there?

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.290
Well if we draw that side of the
box, the height is z, and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.320
the depth is y.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.775
And the ribbon goes from the
bottom left to the top right.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.720
So we can use the Pythagorean
theorem right here, right?

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.610
Because if this height is
z, then this height,

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.910
right here, is z.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.170
So this is a right triangle, and
so we can figure out the

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.230
hypotenuse using the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.500
So we could say that the length,
right here, the length

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.360
squared-- maybe I'll write it
like that-- the length squared

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.240
is equal to y squared
plus z squared.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.770
Or the length is equal to
the square root of y

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.980
squared plus z squared.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.830
That's this length right here.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.030
Now, we could use that exact
same argument on this side of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.030
the box, over here.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.600
You can imagine just, if we were
to face it-- well, if you

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.150
were to just turn it around,
it would look

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.860
exactly like this.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.870
Or if you were to look at it
from the inside of the box, it

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.570
would look like this.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.600
It looks like this is
the back of it.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.760
So if we're looking at it
from this direction,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.720
it looks like this.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.650
The height is z.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.680
The base is y.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.330
And so we just have
the hypotenuse.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.240
y squared plus z squared is
going to be equal to the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.360
length squared.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.330
Or the length is equal to y
squared plus the square root

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.300
of y squared, plus z squared.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.670
So that's this length
and that length.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.160
So, so far, if we just wanted to
add up just that length and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.310
that length, we're going to
have 2 times each of them.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.590
So 2 times the square of y
squared, plus z squared.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.930
That's the two red parts
of the ribbon.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.690
Now, what is this length
right here?

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.730
Well, same argument.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.550
If I were to just draw the base
of this rectangle, the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.230
depth is y, the width is x,
and the ribbon just goes

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.520
across it like that.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.060
So if we call this the length,
l, of this blue part, you have

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.280
l squared is equal to x squared
plus y squared, or l

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.610
is equal to the square root of
x squared plus y squared.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.610
That's this length,
right there.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.370
And then this length over here
might not look the same,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.965
because of the way that the
perspective works, but it's

00:02:46.965 --> 00:02:48.580
the exact same thing.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.820
It's the exact same thing.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.730
If this is x, this depth is y.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.720
If you were look at the box from
the top, this length is

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.740
x, the depth is y, the top
ribbon looks like that.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.880
So x squared plus y squared
is going to be

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.660
equal to that thing.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.360
So this length is also
the square root of x

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.590
squared plus y squared.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.770
So that's the square root of
x squared plus y squared.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.750
This is the square root of
x squared plus y squared.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.890
So in the total length of the
ribbon, we're going to have

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:13.750
two of them.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.380
Plus 2 times the square root of
x squared plus y squared.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.400
So the total length of the
ribbon: 2 times the square

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.540
root of x squared, plus y
squared, plus 2 times the

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.670
square root of y squared,
plus z squared.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.060
Let's see, that looks
like choice C.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.130
They just factored the 2 out,
so it's 2 times everything.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.840
Square root of x squared plus
y squared, plus the square

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.170
root of y squared
plus z squared.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.810
Right over there.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.860
Next problem.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.280
Problem 37.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.890
Use the graph below to answer
the question that follows.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:52.300
All right.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.640
We have this little drawing
of a hand pointing up.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.140
If the image of a pointing hand
in the graph above is

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.460
rotated 180 degrees about the
origin, and then reflected

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.400
across the x-axis, which of the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.420
following graphs will result?

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.590
So let's do it step by step.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.000
If you rotate it 180 degrees,
you're rotating it like this.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.610
Around the x-axis, you're
rotating it like that.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.610
So for example, this square--
we could draw it, maybe I'll

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.579
do it in a lighter color-- this
right here, this part of

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.690
the hand is going to rotate it
all the way down, so it's

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.480
going to look like that,
right there, if I

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.820
were to shade it in.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.690
And then the hand-- this part,
right here, is going to be

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.660
rotated all the way
down like this.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.780
So the hand's going to look
something like this.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.970
That's the thumb part.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.350
And then you're going to have
the finger coming out like

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.530
this, the finger part, the
finger pointing up.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.850
And then you're going to
have the other fingers.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.650
So the hand's going to look
something like that when you

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.810
rotate it 180 degrees.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.410
I just rotated around
the origin.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.770
Now, the second part
is that then,

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.390
reflected across the x-axis.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.900
So then if we reflect this
across the x-axis, it's going

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.660
to look like this.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.500
It's going to look something
like that, like right there.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.700
So that should be our answer.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.570
So which of the choices
looks like that?

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.520
Looks like choice C.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.910
Choice C looks exactly
what we drew up here.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.760
Well, the finger is closer to
the vertical axis than, I

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.650
guess, the pinky is in either
case, because we rotated

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.550
around and then we flipped.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.110
And that is choice C.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.360
Next question.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.510
Problem 38.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.930
Which of the following
nets can be folded to

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.780
form a square pyramid?

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.820
So a square pyramid-- this is
all, you're going to get some

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.350
visualization problem-- a
square pyramid is just a

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.830
pyramid that has a square
as its base, like

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.540
the pyramids in Egypt.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.840
So it has a square
as its base.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.930
So that's the square base.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.880
Let's see if I can
construct one.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.410
If I were to fold this guy up,
and then this guy up, then can

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.570
this guy be the other
side of the pyramid?

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.660
No, because if I fold this
guy up like this.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.460
So let's say, imagine,
let's fold them up.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.320
And so I have a pyramid,
so this guy

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.970
gets folded like that.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:16.320
And then this guy over
here, can he fold in?

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.150
He's going to fold straight
down and fill that up.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.360
So this guy, right here, can
fill that right there.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.800
Let me use some colors.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.910
And then if this guy,
when I fold it,

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.870
will fill right there.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.600
And then when I-- and
then this flap

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.810
won't fill in the blank.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.040
This flap won't go where
it's supposed to.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.160
This flap will just re-cover
this flap again.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.310
So choice A is not the
correct choice.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.230
Let's see choice B.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.780
So if I flip this over,
that flap is just

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.430
going to go right there.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.510
So that flap is going
to go right there.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.690
And then, let's say, this
flap is going to

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.110
go over right there.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.400
And then this flap, this flap
right here, let's see, if this

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.170
slap, this side right there is
going to be that side, so this

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.930
flap is going to go right over
on this side, just like that.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.330
And then this last flap--
remember this edge is that

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.080
edge, right there.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.770
So this last flap will
just fill in the

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:21.630
blank, right there.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.600
So it looks like B works--
will actually form a

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.610
rectangular or a
square pyramid.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.170
Let's see if these other ones
work, before I rule them out.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.800
So this flap over here, this
top flap, when you flip it

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.800
over, is going to-- you could
imagine looking at the pyramid

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.780
from the top-- and then this
edge, over here-- let me do it

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.410
in pink-- this edge over here
would flip down and

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.770
fill up that edge.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.280
But then this edge, right here,
will just, when you fold

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.210
this, will just go on top
of that same edge again.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.030
And then this over here, will
just go over on top of this

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:56.660
edge, again.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.440
So we're only getting 1/2
the pyramid, so that's

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.700
not going to work.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.160
This one.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.390
You flip this one over.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.490
It's going to look like that.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.550
Imagine looking at the
pyramid from above.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.820
Then you flip this one over.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.150
It's going to look-- let me
switch colors-- it's going to

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.100
look like this, this
part right here.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:20.390
And then this piece-- let me do
it in purple-- this piece

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.730
right here, because this edge
is going to be this edge, is

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.165
going to fill that
right there.

00:08:24.165 --> 00:08:25.900
But that's exactly where
this piece would go

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.500
when you flip it.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.760
So we're going to have an empty
space right there, so

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.820
that also doesn't work.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.400
So B is our answer.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.659
Next problem.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.789
Use the figure below to answer
the question that follows.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.450
OK, they give us a
little triangle.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.070
If equilateral triangle ABC--
well, equilateral tells us

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:47.080
that all of the slides are
equal-- represents one of two

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.280
congruent halves-- congruent
means completely sides and

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.030
angles are the same-- congruent
halves of a figure

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.880
that has AB as a line
of symmetry.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.425
So AB is a line of symmetry.

00:08:57.425 --> 00:08:59.160
And this is 1/2 the figure.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.090
So the rest of the figure is
going to look like this.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.570
So the line of symmetry, so
you'd literally just-- the

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.992
line of symmetry is going
to look like that.

00:09:06.992 --> 00:09:08.990
It's going to look like that,
and that length is equal to

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.360
that length, is equal
that length, is

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.170
equal to that length.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.730
So all four sides
are the same.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.750
Then the entire figure
is, well, all four

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.640
sides are the same.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.680
It's a little bit skewed,
so it can't be a square.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.790
It's going to be a rhombus.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.420
Problem 40.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.980
Use the diagram below to answer
the question-- well, we

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.110
know how to do that.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.330
Three straight lines
intersect to form a

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.220
triangle, as shown above.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.080
What is the measure
of angle x?

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.180
Well here, we just use a couple
of our angle rules.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.900
If you watched any of my videos
in the past, it's what

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.840
I call the angle game.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.370
Let's play the angle game.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:47.710
We have 60 degrees here.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:48.940
This is opposite to the 60.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.450
It's going to be the same angle,
so that is also going

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.970
to be 60 degrees, right there.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.950
This is 115 degrees.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.570
It is going to be supplementary
to this angle,

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.880
right here, which means
that this angle plus

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.130
115 is equal to 180.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:10.270
So if we call this x, x plus
115 is equal to 180.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.870
Subtract 115 from both sides.
x is equal to--

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.230
80 minus 15 is what?

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.880
80 minus 10 is 70.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:24.030
70 minus 5 is 65.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.910
So this angle right here
is 65 degrees.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:32.190
And this angle-- let's call that
y-- y plus 65 plus 60.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.080
And I don't want you to confuse
this x with that x.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.440
I probably should've called that
some other number, but

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.190
I'm just saying 65 plus 175 is
going to be equal to 180.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.650
That's how I got the 65.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.190
They're supplementary.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:48.020
And now let's figure out what
this angle y over here is.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:55.460
y plus 60, plus 65 has to be
equal to 180 because they form

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:55.990
a triangle.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.170
The angles in a triangle
add up to 180.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.520
So y plus-- add these
two together--

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.740
125 is equal to 180.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.840
y is equal to 180 minus 125.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.010
80 minus 25 is what?

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.180
55.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.540
So y is equal to 55 degrees.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.140
We're not quite done.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.860
y is equal to 55 degrees.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.210
Now, x is supplementary to y.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:27.980
So you say x plus 55 is
equal to 180 degrees.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.340
Well, we already know what
plus 55 is equal to 180.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.320
125.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:37.000
So we say x is equal to 180
minus 55, which is equal to

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.910
125 degrees, which is choice
C, right there.
