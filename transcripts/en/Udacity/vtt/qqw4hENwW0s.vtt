00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.460
Let's talk a little bit about asking good questions on

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.410
the forum. These are just some best practice guidelines to ensure

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.070
that you get the best answer that you're looking for.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.060
First, try searching for answers. Before posting your question on the

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.000
forum, first search to see if anyone else has asked

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.500
the same question. You also might try Google to see if

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.690
you can get an answer that way. If that doesn't

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.694
work, go ahead and start a new post. You also want

00:00:25.694 --> 00:00:27.870
to be specific when asking a question and

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.696
posting your problem. For example, if you're having trouble

00:00:31.696 --> 00:00:34.072
with the problem set question, let the course staff

00:00:34.072 --> 00:00:36.830
know what steps you've taken. So they can reproduce

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.698
the problem. State what you expected to see and

00:00:39.698 --> 00:00:43.060
what you got instead. Finally, you might want to provide

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.770
details about the machine you're using. Make sure to

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.160
use concise and informative subject headlines. Include the important

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.050
details in the subject header so others can quickly

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.990
grasp what your post is going to be about. Note that

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.860
you're limited to a hundred characters in a subject

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.730
line on Piazza. And only the first 30 to 40

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.600
characters are visible in the summary view. So make

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.990
sure to put the important keywords first. Finally, be courteous.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.950
A little courtesy never hurt anyone. If you find the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.480
solution, make sure to follow up and resolve the issue.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.180
And thank people who helped you. This brings up

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.760
another point. If you see a question that you

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.680
yourself know the answer to, feel free to chime

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.630
in and help out your classmates. Now let's talk a

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.790
little bit about what not to do. Don't post

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.460
answers to graded assignments, or even ungraded assignments on

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.360
the forum without first talking to the instructor. Don't

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.510
ask others to debug your code without giving details of

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.427
the problem that they should be searching for. Depending

00:01:45.427 --> 00:01:48.514
on your class policies, your instructor may restrict you

00:01:48.514 --> 00:01:51.300
from posting code at all. Make sure to ask

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.280
your instructor in advance before posting large sections of

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.300
code. Each class is a little bit different about

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.140
the policies around posting code and other sorts of

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.970
information. When in doubt, please ask your instructor for

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.960
specific guidelines about what is allowed to be posted.
