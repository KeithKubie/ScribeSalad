00:00:00.242 --> 00:00:03.835
- Hi, I'm Anthony Jeselnik,
a famous handsome comedian.

00:00:03.835 --> 00:00:05.563
- But this is a podcast, so being handsome

00:00:05.563 --> 00:00:07.237
really doesn't help you out that much.

00:00:07.237 --> 00:00:10.691
- This is Gregg Rosenthal,
analyst for the NFL network,

00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:11.524
for now.

00:00:11.524 --> 00:00:13.792
- I do wanna keep my job with the NFL.

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:15.210
- Impossible, you're gonna get divorced,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.891
you're gonna lose your job
and I'll probably end up

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:17.733
with your children.

00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.838
- That wouldn't be that bad
of an outcome, for them.

00:00:19.838 --> 00:00:22.626
- We talk about sports, off
the field issues, comedy.

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:25.503
- People are gonna be
excited, everywhere I go,

00:00:25.503 --> 00:00:27.482
people just go up RJVP.

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:30.267
- Yeah, RJVP is dead, now it's the JRVP,

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:32.423
the Jeselnik and Rosenthal Vanity Project.

00:00:32.423 --> 00:00:34.917
- You can download it,
subscribe, you can do

00:00:34.917 --> 00:00:35.796
whatever you want.

00:00:35.796 --> 00:00:38.163
We can't really believe that
this is happening again,

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.935
three years after the NFL
took us off their airwave.

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:43.282
- I can't believe you keep
talking about the old podcast.

00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:44.717
- I think you gotta give a little shoutout

00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:47.226
to the old listeners, just to
say that it existed before.

00:00:47.226 --> 00:00:48.646
- People move on with their lives.

00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:51.390
- Subscribe please, it'll
be better than last time.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.223
- Mm, half of it's gonna be great.
