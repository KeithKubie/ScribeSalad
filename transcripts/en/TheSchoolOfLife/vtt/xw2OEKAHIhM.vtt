00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.080
One of the characteristic flaws of our minds
is to exaggerate how fragile we might be;

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.730
to assume that life would be impossible far
earlier than it in fact would be. We imagine

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.000
that we could not live without a certain kind
of income or status or health; that it would

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.880
be a disaster not to have a certain kind of
relationship, house or job. This natural tendency

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.669
of the mind is constantly stoked by life in
commercial society, which adds to our sense

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:38.460
of the number of things that should be considered
Necessities rather than Luxuries. This kind

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.430
of society goes to extraordinary lengths to
get us to feel that we really do need to go

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.260
skiing once a year, to have heated car seats,
to fly in Business, to own the same kind of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.270
watch as a famous conductor and a jumbo-sized
fridge, and to lay claim to lots of friends,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:03.920
perfectly muscular health and a loving, kind,
sex-filled relationship. In fact, our core

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:12.079
needs are much simpler than all this. We could
in fact manage perfectly well enough with a lot less.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:17.259
Not just around possessions but across
every aspect of our lives. It’s not that

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.289
we should want to: it’s simply that we could.
We could cope quite well with being rather

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.729
poor, not being very popular, not having a
very long life and with living alone. We could

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.420
even, to put the extreme instance forward,
cope with being dead; it happens all the time.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.380
But we forget our resilience in the face of
the risks we face. The cumulative effect of

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.960
our innocence is to make us timid. Our lives
become dominated by a fear of losing, or never

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.389
getting, things which we could (in fact) do
perfectly well without. The ancient Roman

00:01:54.389 --> 00:02:00.250
philosopher Seneca had great success running
what we would now call a venture capital firm.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.090
He owned beautiful villas and magnificent
furniture. But he made a habit of regularly

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.500
sleeping on the floor of an outhouse and eating
only stale bread and drinking lukewarm water.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.660
He was reminding himself that it wouldn’t
ever be so bad to lose pretty much everything

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.230
– so as to free himself of nagging worries
of catastrophe. The realisation gave him great

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.160
confidence. He never worried so much about
what might happen if a deal went wrong because,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.440
at the very worst, he’d only be back on
the kitchen floor next to the dog basket,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.760
which was – in the scheme of things – OK.
Seneca was initiating an important move. By

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.580
continually renewing our acquaintance with
our own resilience – that is, with our ability

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.130
to manage even if things go badly (getting
sacked, a partner walking out, a scandal that

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.430
destroys our social life, an illness) – we
can be braver because we grasp that the dangers

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.300
we face are almost never as great as our skittish
imaginations tend to suggest. In the Utopia,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.440
our culture would stop continually presenting
us with rags to riches stories. It would instead

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.700
do something far kinder – and, incidentally,
far more conducive to the kind of courageous,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.610
entrepreneurial optimism our societies currently
ineptly try to foster. Our culture would be

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:30.260
continually presenting us with charming non-tragic
tales of riches to rags stories, stories in

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.280
which people lost money, partners and social
standing but ended up coping really rather

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.920
well with their new lives. We’d see them
moving out of the penthouse into a humble

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.530
cottage and having really rather a nice time
tending to a small flower-bed and discovering

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.540
tinned food. Our culture would not be recommending
such scenarios, just lessening the grip upon

00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:00.960
us of certain deep but misplaced fears that
so often hold us back from trying and  succeeding.
