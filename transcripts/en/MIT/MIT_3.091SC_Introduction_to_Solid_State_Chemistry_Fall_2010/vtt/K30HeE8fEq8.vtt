00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.140
PROFESSOR: All right, a couple
of announcements.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.930
Next week two minor
celebrations, maybe receptions

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.320
we would call them.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.720
Quiz 2 Tuesday based on homework
2, and periodic table

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.090
quiz Thursday.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.220
I provide the numbers, you
provide the letters.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.750
I guess that's how it works.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.860
And the contest ends
Friday five PM.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.150
Last day we looked at the Bohr
Model and we developed

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.150
equations for the radius of the
electronic and the orbit

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.390
of the one electron atom.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.540
The energy of the electron and
the velocity of the electron.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.000
And we found that for all
of these they were

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.610
a function of n.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.565
Quantum number.

00:01:02.565 --> 00:01:04.100
n takes on discrete values.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.140
One, two, three, and so on.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.660
We say that these
energies radii

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.480
velocities are quantized.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.800
They take discrete values.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.120
And then later in
the lecture we

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.510
started looking for evidence.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.570
And we found ourselves in an
exercise of reconciliation

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.670
with data taken by Angstrom
about 50 years earlier and fit

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.960
to an equation by J.J.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.930
Balmer.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.220
And we were part way through
that and adjourned.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.570
So I'd like to pick up the
discussion at that point.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.770
I've done a different drawing of
what's going on inside the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.480
gas discharge tube.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.730
Last day I had the ballistic
electronic here, and this is

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.820
boiling off the cathodes.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.060
The cathode is inside the gas
discharge tube and this

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.200
electron, if the voltage is high
enough, will leave the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.940
cathode and shoot across this
low pressure gas, which

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.240
contains, among other things,
atomic hydrogen.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.140
And I'm trying to depict the
atomic hydrogen atom here.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.820
Here's the proton, which
is the nucleus--

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.700
that's the sum total of the
contents of the nucleus--

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.190
and here's the lone electron
that is orbiting the nucleus

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.050
at some initial value.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.490
n sub i.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.640
Could be ground state.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.950
Doesn't necessarily
have to be.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.680
With some thermal energy this
could be n greater than one.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.820
Then we reason that if the
electron, ballistic electron,

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.520
and it's trajectory across the
gas discharge tube over to the

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.750
anode, which is charged
positively.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.330
If it collided with this
electron it could impart some

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.290
of its energy, thereby promoting
the electron from ni

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.920
up to nf, the final level.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.200
And the electron would
be up here.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.060
And for this transition there
would be an energy cost. That

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.700
energy cost is delta e.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.600
Delta e is the energy
to go from ni to nf.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.240
And so the kinetic energy--

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.230
half mv squared of the
incident electron--

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.440
is diminished by this amount.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.650
And the electronic continues
on it's merry

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.480
way at a slower speed.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.180
We assume it's mass
doesn't change.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.260
The only way we can change its
energy is to slow it down.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.020
And there's a conservation of
energy, so the sum of the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.770
energy of the scattered electron
and the transition

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.510
energy of the electron within
hydrogen must equal the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.970
incident kinetic energy of
the ballistic electron.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.010
But there's more.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.190
This is a--

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.300
no pun intended--
a one shot deal.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.840
This is ballistics, and
so the electron is

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.720
not sustainably promoted.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.370
It falls back down.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.150
And when it falls back down
we have the transition

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.710
energy now given off.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.680
Here, to promote we had
to call for energy.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.860
When the electron falls down
it gives off that energy.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.600
And that energy is given
off in the form

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.050
of an emitted photon.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.570
And it's that emitted photon and
it's that emitted photon

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.850
that ultimately gives
rise to the lines.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.390
The lines in the spectrum are
generated by the emitted

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.900
photon here.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.110
Everything else is preamble to
this event, and this event

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.300
gives rise to the
emitted photons.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.020
And I think that's about where
we got last day with the

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.830
reconciliation.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.430
So let's look carefully here.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.950
We recognize that there
needs to be

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.060
conservation of energy again.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.300
In other words, the energy of
the emitted photon, the energy

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.000
of the photon, which we know
from Planck is h times nu.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.150
I'm trying to distinguish.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.820
This, I'm making nu, the
Greek symbol nu.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.500
And I put a little
descender on it.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.180
It looks like a v, but I put
a little ascender here to

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.600
distinguish it.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.240
This is lowercase v,
as in mv squared.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.040
This is nu.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.360
So h nu, or it could
be hc over lambda.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.740
Or it could be hc nu bar.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.420
Three ways of writing the
energy of the photon.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.240
And that must equal delta
e of the transition.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.330
So let's keep going.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.010
We know that the delta e, the
transition is given by the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.260
Bohr Model.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.340
Delta e transition will equal e
final minus e initial, which

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.850
will be minus kz squared--

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.190
I'm writing this generally,
in this case with atomic

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.940
hydrogen z as 1--

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:48.130
with minus k times 1 over n
final squared minus one over n

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.220
initial squared.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.650
What we can do then is equate
these and roll them around to

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.970
isolate nu bar.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.060
nu bar, then, equals minus kz
squared over the product of

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.990
the Planck constant, the speed
of light, 1 over nf squared

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.170
minus 1 over ni squared.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:19.190
Now for the Balmer series,
that is to say the Balmer

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.060
series of lines, that turns out
to be a series where all

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.530
of the transitions end
up on n equals 2.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.130
We said nf equals 2.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:36.300
z equals 1 because we're talking
about atomic hydrogen.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.880
Then what we have is a set of
translations that go 1 over 2

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.900
squared minus 1 over
ni squared.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.460
ni must be greater than nf, so
ni must come from the set 3,

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.080
4, 5, et cetera.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.930
Furthermore, I'm going
to put z equals 1.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.290
Let's evaluate k.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:03.990
We know that's 2.18 times 10
to the minus 18 joules, or

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.570
13.6 electron volts.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.215
And we know the Planck constant,
6.6 times 10

00:07:10.215 --> 00:07:11.680
to the minus 36.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.960
And this is 3 times 18 of
the 8th all in SI units.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.890
So this gives me 1.1
times 10 to the 7th

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.870
in reciprocal meters.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:25.080
And if I put all this together
I end up with exactly they

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.240
equation that was published
by Balmer.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.910
Exactly Balmer's equation in
1885, rewritten to express it

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.300
in SI units.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.860
1 over 2 squared
minus 1 over--

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.640
I'm just going to
put ni squared--

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.250
or ni equals 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.310
This is Balmer exactly.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.760
Balmer exactly.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.610
So the assumption of this
planetary model, with all of

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.380
the restrictions that Bohr
placed on it in order to get

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.940
this set of equations,
reconciled

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.750
with laboratory data.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.090
Very, very significant.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.420
So here we are.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:17.500
Those four lines all can be
derived from the Bohr model.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.450
And here's another cartoon from
your book and showing

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.480
what I'm trying to depict here,
namely it's the falling

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.410
down, the return to the state
from which the electron was

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.650
promoted that generates
the photon.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.500
And the set of those lines
is what gives you this.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:41.030
There so there's the validation
of the sixth piece.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:45.990
So Bohr Model agrees with
Angstrom's data, but it also

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.330
suggests other experiments.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.330
Let's think about this
for a second.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.730
OK, here's another cartoons
from your thing.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.910
You know, I told you that
this thing is unstable.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.380
And in the Balmer series it
goes from n equals 2 up.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.010
But there's a ground
state, n equals 1.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:09.580
What was wrong with those
electronics in Sweden in 1853

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.520
than Angstrom could never find
any electron that would fall

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.060
all the way down to
the ground state?

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.480
What's wrong with it?

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.900
Well, here's the answer.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.830
It has to do with
instrumentation.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:26.260
So this is an example where
science goes further thanks

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.970
for the advent of new
instrumentation that allows

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.010
this to make measurements that
previous people couldn't make,

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.210
even though they were very
competent experimentalists.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:38.270
Angstrom could have found n
equals 1 series, but couldn't

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.900
see them because he was using
a photographic plate.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:46.720
This shows you the range
of sensitivity for

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.520
photographic plates.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.060
Here's the electromagnetic
spectrum.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.010
Out here you have low energy
radio waves and up here you

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.470
have x-rays and gamma
rays and so on.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.570
And the visible spectrum is
parked right here in the

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.670
middle, and here it is
unpacked for you.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.360
And it roughly runs from
400 to 700 nanometers.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.540
That's the invisible spectrum.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.700
So wavelength increasing from
left to right, which means

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.510
energy frequency in wave
number increase

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.730
from right to left.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.050
They're complimentary, right?

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:20.060
e nu, nu bar on the top, lambda
is on the bottom.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.960
Some spectra are plotted in
lambda, some are plotted in

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.550
wave number, whatever.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.070
And by the way, I want to
show you the power of

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.810
knowing a few things.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.620
I don't expect you to know a lot
of facts, but I expect you

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.840
to know a few things.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.150
Every educated person ought to
know that the visible spectrum

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.240
runs round numbers 400
to 700 nanometers.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.370
But look, I can take 700
nanometers and use this

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.220
formula and convert
it to energy.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.710
And I'm going to get something
like 3 times 10 to

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.540
the minus 19 joules.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.250
Yuck.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.300
Instead, I go in
electron volts.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.880
1.8 ev.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.790
Over here, 400 nanometers
is 3.1 ev.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.780
So round numbers, the visible
spectrum spans 2

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.980
to 3 electron volts.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.260
Our eyes are photo detectors
that operate on the band width

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.740
2 to 3 electron volts. that's
easy to remember.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.410
Those are good numbers.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:18.130
So where does that leave us?

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.860
It leaves us here.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.770
We go back and we see these
numbers, 656, 486, 434,

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.120
they're all in the
visible spectrum.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.700
So I went and I did a
little calculation.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.240
I said, well what would I have
if we'd gotten the wave length

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.830
for the transition
from 2 down to 1?

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.900
This is n equals 2 down
to ground state.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.040
If you plug in the numbers to
the Bohr model, you'd find

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.400
that that would give
you 122 nanometers.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.460
122 nanometers?

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.690
Well, 122 nanometers is going
to put you way over.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.640
It's too high energy, right?

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.000
122 nanometers is going to put
you off to the left there into

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.930
the ultraviolet, where
the photographic

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.560
film was not sensitive.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.170
So he couldn't measure
those lines.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.420
So now I'm going to end by
putting the master equation

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:09.050
that captures all of this.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.660
And the master equation
that captures of

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.850
all of this is here.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:20.170
It's that nu bar goes as r times
z squared, 1 over nf

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.710
squared minus 1 over
ni squared.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:31.150
So this is the most general form
for all 1 electron atoms.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.200
That's why I've got z squared
in there for all 1 electron

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.230
atoms.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:40.480
And this is called the
Rydberg equation.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.580
Named after another Swedish
spectroscopist at the

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.050
University of Lund.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.290
I think a Swede would probably
pronounce this something

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.810
Rydberg, but you don't
have to say that.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.560
You can just say Rydberg
and it'll be fine.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.150
And in honor of Rydberg, the
constant here is given the

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.390
symbol, capital R.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:02.380
The capital R as the Rydberg
constant and it has a value of

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.860
1.1 times 10 to the
7th reciprocal

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.460
meters in good ST units.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.030
Well, there was more
evidence for the

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.270
support of Bohr's Model.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.390
More evidence for the support
of Bohr's Model.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.190
By the way, as the detectors got
better and better we could

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.290
get more and more lines.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.820
You see these, as you get
higher and higher series

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.530
ending on higher and higher end
numbers, you move off into

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.020
the infrared.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.090
Because this is not to scale.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.210
These n equal 4, n equal 5 are
closer and closer to closer

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.800
together in terms of energy.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.360
They're farther and farther
apart in terms of spacing, but

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.510
they're closer and closer
together in terms of energy.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.930
Because they're farther
from the nucleus.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.710
You say, gee, shouldn't
it cost more

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.010
energy to go farther?

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:47.500
Uh-uh.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.350
Because you're farther from
the positive nucleus.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.040
Be careful.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.980
Don't let your intuition send
you in the wrong direction.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.830
It's all about Coulombics.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.160
Anyway, so the Lyman series
ends at n equals 1.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.370
And these are different
scientists.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.020
Paschen, Bracket, Pfund,
Humphreys, and so on.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.870
So maybe, I don't know, if
somebody hasn't claimed n

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.870
equals 214, all the lines that
end there, you know, maybe

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.760
that could be your name
on the series.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.485
As if anybody cares.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.100
Looks like this quantum
condition is validated.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.220
See this is really important
because this was the big break

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.380
away from classical theory.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:33.000
That the motion of a body,
something with mass, could be

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.720
quantized in its behavior shook
this physics community.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.080
But this reconciliation
of the data says that

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.330
assumption is valid.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:48.730
There's more that happens.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:55.210
So in 1913 in Berlin--

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.960
remember 1913 is when Bohr
published the paper--

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:03.860
1913 in Berlin there was James
Franck and Gustav Hertz.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.490
James Franck and Gustav Hertz.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.110
And they were conducting
experiments on

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.270
gas discharge tubes.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.080
Only they filled a gas discharge
tube, instead of

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.640
with hydrogen, they filled
it with mercury vapor.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.430
So gas discharge tube--

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:20.250
GDT--

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:26.010
gas discharge tube containing
mercury vapor.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.260
The same thing.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.200
Put the electrodes, connect on
a power supply, and started

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.230
varying the potential.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.610
So I'm going to show you
what they found.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.550
This is the Planck voltage,
and this is the current

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:48.180
between electrodes, or if you
like, across the tube.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.000
Between the electrodes,
or through the tube.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.630
Or if you like, tube current.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.100
Meaning from one electrode
to the other.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.110
The tube current.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.500
Well, low voltage,
low current.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.950
High voltage, high currently.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.610
They get up to a certain value
of voltage, all of sudden the

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:07.210
tube starts glowing blindly and
the current falls to 0.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.200
Then they continued to
raise the voltage.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.800
More voltage, more current,
up, up, up, up, up.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.160
And then they get to another
critical value of voltage,

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.180
even more intensity.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.960
And then the current
falls to 0.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.560
So you look at those data and
say, well, what's that got to

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.650
do with the Bohr Model?

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:31.250
Because mercury is not
a 1 electron atom.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.020
It's got a boat load
of electrons.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.370
This is not a 1 electron atom.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.530
So you say, I know what it is.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.540
It's ionization energy.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.990
Must be ionizing the mercury.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.740
So you go to the periodic table
and you look up the

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:46.430
ionization energy of mercury and
you discover that that's

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.230
10.4 volts.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.370
10.4 electron volts is the
ionization energy.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:56.470
And this first null
is at 4.9 volts.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.390
Well, 4.9 is a long
way from 10.4.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:04.250
And this second null occurs
at 6.7 volts.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.730
6.7 volts.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.490
So what's this telling us?

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:11.320
What this is telling us is that
when you get to a value

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:16.290
of 4.9 volts, you've hit a
certain value that allows you

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:21.290
to promote electrons within
mercury between one level and

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.370
the next level.

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:24.980
And those electrons are
being promoted and

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.330
then cascading down.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.510
And they're cascading down and
they're emitting in the

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.600
visible and it's blinding you.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.400
Say, OK, so what
does that mean?

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.350
Well, it means that the Bohr
Model, which is for a 1

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.330
electron atom, assumes
that energy levels

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.130
within it are quantized.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:46.760
These data indicate that on the
basis the behavior of this

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.260
gas discharge tube, there must
be quantized energy levels

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.820
inside of mercury, which means
all atoms have quantized

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.342
energy levels.

00:17:56.342 --> 00:17:57.670
You understand?

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.840
Everything is quantized.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.050
That's really powerful.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.350
It starts off with this nerdy
little 1 electron atom, and

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.900
now he's applying it
across matter.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.550
And this is gas, this is
more elaborate gas.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.750
Heaven forbid, it might exist
in liquids and solids.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.110
So that's the Franck,
Hertz experiment.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.590
So his stock goes way, way
up as a result of that.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:26.700
And they win a Nobel Prize.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.220
Here's James Franck.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.000
Here's Gustav Hertz.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.570
You know what the Hertz is.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.120
200 kilohertz, so on.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:32.690
That's Hertz.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:38.060
James Franck was at Gottingen
when he won this, but he

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:41.210
ultimately came to the United
States when the political

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.780
changes started occurring in
the thirties in Germany.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:49.100
Franck decided to seek safer
surroundings and ended up at

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.090
the University of Chicago, where
there is to this day the

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.400
James Franck Institute
of Physics.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.310
Very, very high-end physics
institution.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.350
So this is good.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.320
But all good things
come to an end.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:09.000
So 1913 was a bittersweet
year for Bohr.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.180
Because he got some good news,
but he also got some bad news.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:17.670
So now I want to move over to
limitations of the Bohr Model.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.370
Limitations of the Bohr Model.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:24.460
So I know what you're going to
say-- well, it only talks

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.430
about 1 electron atoms, so
that's a limitation.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.120
No, there's more to
it than that.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.340
Even the 1 electron atom model
doesn't capture everything.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:37.350
I'm going to summarize
the limitations.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:42.160
I'm going to show you three,
and they all fall under the

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.520
general umbrella of
fine structure.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.320
Fine structure.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.100
In other words, the Bohr Model
is good, give us the big

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.530
lines, but when you start
looking more carefully it

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.090
fails to capture some
of the physics.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:57.450
So first of all, let's go back
to some earlier data.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.460
1887.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.940
1887, there were already data
out there that were going to

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.020
give heartburn to
the Bohr Model.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.650
And those data were taken
by Michelson and Morley.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.900
Michelson and Morley.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.820
Everything I've taught you so
far, with one exception, has

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.680
been European science.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.870
Americans were not active in
science because this was a

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:19.560
young country.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.800
We were really good engineers
because we were blockaded by

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.670
the rest of the world.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.550
We had to live by our wits--
that's where you get the term

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:28.420
"yankee ingenuity." Science
was hifalutin stuff.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.560
We didn't have time for it.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.200
But towards the latter half of
the 19th century, we started

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.012
moving into fundamental
science.

00:20:35.012 --> 00:20:38.770
The first American to win the
Nobel Prize was Michelson.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:43.040
Michelson was doing work at
Case in Cleveland, which

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.130
eventually became Case Western
Reserve University.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:51.740
So he was at Case in Cleveland
and he was studying optics.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.720
And he was a brilliant
experimentalist. In fact, he

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.270
made the first reliable measure
of the speed of light.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:04.470
Back before 1900.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.720
What they were doing is they
were looking at Angstrom's

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.230
lines and they noticed
something peculiar.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.990
If you take a look at even this
drawing, you notice the

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:14.830
red line is a little bit
fatter than the others.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.230
Now you might just say, well,
that's just the artist taking

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.480
liberties and somebody didn't
catch it in proof reading.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.670
But in point of fact, what he
found was that if you look at

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:31.440
that line, which is really the
line for the 3-2 transition--

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:36.890
the 3-2 transition in
the Balmer series--

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:41.480
what you find is that if you
look at the photographic plate

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.980
more carefully, you find that
this thing in fact is a pair

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.010
of lines, but very, very
closely spaced.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.890
This is known as a doublet.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:57.200
Two lines very closely spaced,
centered at 656 nanometers.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.500
And with his interferometer he
gets super, super good data.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.970
And he could split
the doublet.

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.130
Well, what's that
mean for Bohr?

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.180
Bohr has no way of
explaining this.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:12.000
If you look at the Bohr Model,
you've got n equals 2, you've

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.230
got n equals 3, alright?

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:19.230
So this is energy 2,
energy 3, right?

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:23.380
And so when the electron falls
from 3 to 2, we get a photon

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.920
of a certain value.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.750
It's going to be nu 3 to 2.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.800
That's the frequency or wave
number, what have you.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.530
Now, the fact that you've got
a doublet here means that

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:38.600
there must be two transitions,
but darn close.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:43.410
There's either a 3 and a 3
primed, or there's a 2 and a 2

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:47.790
primed, but it's not
simply 3 and 2.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.260
So that piece of information
runs

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.670
counter to the Bohr Model.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.250
Bohr Model is silent about it.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:56.040
It gets the big picture, but if
you look more carefully it

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.300
can't capture the doublet.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.950
And Michelson ultimately
gets the Nobel Price.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.940
And I think I've got him here.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.960
There he is.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.430
The Nobel Prize.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.240
By the time he got the Nobel
Prize he was at the University

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.620
of Chicago, but he did the work
that won the Nobel Prize

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.000
for him at Case.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.430
So sometimes when you see even
Millikan, Millikan did his

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.250
work at University of Chicago,
but eventually took a position

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:22.320
at Caltech.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.460
So the Nobel Prize says, Robert
Millikan, Caltech.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.035
But he didn't do that
work at Caltech.

00:23:27.035 --> 00:23:28.750
He did it at Chicago.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.320
Anyways, you can go to
the Nobel website.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.920
You can read about
these people.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.540
And what's really cool is when
you win the Nobel Prize-- you

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.700
notice I didn't say if--

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:42.020
I say, when you win the Nobel
Prize, what you do is you get

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.330
on an airplane, you go to
Stockholm, and then you go and

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.310
you have dinner in this
beautiful hall.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:51.070
I've been there and it's
gorgeous, gilded and so on.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:54.370
Very nice kitchen, excellent
wine list. And--

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.540
yes-- and you can go there
and they serve meals.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:02.620
the menu is taken from previous
Nobel Prize dinners.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.480
So you can sit and--

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.830
whatever it is, it could be the
Nobel Prizes of 1927 and

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.560
that's what's going to be
on the menu today--

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:15.660
and after the dinner they have
a presentation ceremony with

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:16.870
the King of Sweden.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.730
You get your Nobel Prize,
and then people

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.750
listen to your lecture.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:24.750
And those Nobel lectures are
really, really expository.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.750
So if you want to go and read
the Nobel lecture that

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:31.320
Michelson gave on the occasion
of winning the Nobel Prize,

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.570
you'll probably learn all
of about this and more.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.680
It's really, really good,
so go there and read.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.010
Now back to the story.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.800
Second problem with
the Bohr Model.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.520
1896--

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.850
see, all this data had
been accumulating--

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:51.330
1896, there was a postdoc
by the name of Zeeman.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.430
Piet Zeeman.

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:55.530
He was a postdoc at Leiden.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:58.400
Leiden in Holland
under Lorentz.

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:07.400
You'll learn about the Lorentz
force when you study 802.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.010
What he was doing--

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.940
again, gas discharge tube.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:17.080
So this was gas discharge tube,
and what Zeeman was

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.195
doing on his postdoc was
in a magnetic field.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.420
These people were doing all
sorts of experiments.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.400
They were trying to block out
the whole experimental space.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.470
So one guy, his specialty
is high energy.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.990
One guy's specialty
is low pressure.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.620
These people are taking a gas
discharge tube and putting in

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.920
the jaws of a powerful,
permanent magnet and then

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.390
measuring the spectrum.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:44.690
And what he found was that
for certain lines,

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:47.130
this was the rest--

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.460
b, I'm going to use as
magnetic field--

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.650
in the absence of
applied magnetic

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.330
field you have a line.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.050
And this is not a doublet,
triplet--

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.270
it's just a plain old line.

00:25:58.270 --> 00:25:59.770
Well behaved line.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:03.040
But when they take that gas
discharge tube and put it into

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:09.660
a magnetic field, they see
a plurality of lines.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:14.940
And furthermore, the spacing--

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.500
I'm going to use c here--

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:20.990
the spacing in the lines is
proportional to the intensity

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:22.550
of the magnetic field.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.100
No magnetic field,
single line.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.250
Modest magnetic field,
modest amount of what

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:29.960
is called line splitting.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.770
So a modest amount of
applied magnetic

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.220
field, modest splitting.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.270
Intense magnetic field,
intense splitting.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.160
Bohr Model is silent
about that.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.340
Because you know, if you've got
different lines, it means

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.910
you must have different
energy levels.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:51.180
It's as though the energy level
diagrams opens up in a

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.780
magnetic field.

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:56.420
The Bohr Model can't
account for that.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:02.190
And parenthetically, they got
the Nobel Prize, too.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:03.560
So there's Piet Zeeman.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.810
Got his PhD in 1896.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:08.330
He's got his Noble
Prize, 1902.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.010
He's off to a good
start, I'd say.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:11.580
And there's Lorentz.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.040
Two of them.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.700
We'll get to him in a second.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:20.070
So third piece of bad news
for the Bohr Model.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:23.560
And that comes, again,
in 1913 in November.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.050
In November of 1913 there
was a man by the

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:32.340
name of Stark in Germany.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.300
And Stark was doing analogous
experiments.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.710
He was studying gas discharge
tube in electric fields.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.450
Obviously, you've got an
electric field across the

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:50.370
electrodes to excite
the electrons.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.720
But he's taking a whole gas
discharge tube and putting it

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.050
between flights and then
applying an electric field.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:57.150
And what did he find?

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:58.680
He found the same
sort of thing.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:07.940
He got line splitting in an E
field, and furthermore that

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:12.443
extent of splitting, extent
dependent upon the intensity.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.360
E intensity.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.150
So no field, no splitting.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.200
Modest field, modest
splitting.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.990
Intense field, intense
splitting.

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:26.230
Well, again, that's a headache
for the Bohr Model.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:31.120
So this is all three problems,
and it's all under aegis of

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.820
fine structure.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.630
So we know the Bohr Model
has its limitations.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:36.460
OK, Stark.

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:38.580
I know he's got his
Nobel Prize.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.830
There he is.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:47.060
So 1913 ends on a sour note.

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:48.640
But people don't give up.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:56.440
1916, Arnold Sommerfeld
in Munich.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:00.270
He was a professor of physics
and he proposed modifications.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.110
Modifications to Bohr Model.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.450
It's a patch, we would
call it a patch.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.570
going?

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:10.790
To put a patch on
the Bohr Model.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:11.520
And what's he going to do?

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.590
What's the gist of his idea?

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:18.990
Well, he retains the planetary
structure.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.910
He liked that idea--

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:23.570
nice orbits, so on.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:27.370
But he took a page out
of Kepler's book.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:31.050
The planets in the Kepler
model, when they revolve

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:33.475
around the sun their orbit
is not circular.

00:29:33.475 --> 00:29:35.300
It's elliptical.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.150
So Sommerfeld said, why don't
we give that a try?

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:45.710
What if we said the electronic
orbit can be

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:49.835
elliptical or circular?

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:54.850
And he was quite specific.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.660
He said, suppose--

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:03.980
and this, again, is not to
scale, but to emphasize this

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:09.090
is going to be elliptical or
circular, but very, very mild

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:10.550
eccentricity.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:14.380
What I'm going to draw for you
is extreme eccentricity to

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.060
make a point.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.990
But suppose we had the circular
orbit as I'm drawing

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:24.680
it now, and then we had an
elliptical orbit that is

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.640
centered on that circle.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.960
So it's mild eccentricity.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.130
We might have another one--
let's do one more.

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:34.790
This is good enough.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:37.740
The gist here is that we have
a circular orbit and an

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:41.690
elliptical orbit, but
the bandwidth here

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:43.780
is very, very narrow.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:48.240
So this is very, very thin.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.570
And it's sort of like
an egg shell.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:53.550
So if I asked you, what's
the dimension of an egg?

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:55.770
You'd say, well, it's
dimension of the

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:56.390
surface of the egg.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:57.900
Then I'd say, but the
egg shell has

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:58.970
some thickness, right?

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.580
But that thickness is relatively
small in comparison

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.550
to the total dimension
of the egg.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:04.750
So an analogy.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:09.040
He said that the range of
distance from the nucleus,

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.440
whether it's circular
or elliptical,

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.580
is very, very narrow.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:17.200
So we can say the set of
circular and elliptical orbits

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.690
lie within a shell,
as in egg shell.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.890
So this is a shell model.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:26.170
It's a shell model.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:31.070
So now how do you designate
the different orbits?

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:32.740
You've got some that are
circular, some that are

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:33.530
elliptical.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:35.560
He needs to distinguish them
and he needs to be able to

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.270
label them.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:40.600
So he introduces new
quantum numbers to

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.050
allow us to name them.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:46.320
So let's go and take a look at
the quantum numbers that

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.670
Sommerfeld gave us.

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.140
So he starts off with n.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.410
He retains that from the Bohr
Model and he calls that the

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.280
principal quantum number.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.740
And it's primary attribute
is size.

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:03.900
It captures the distance, the
principal r from the nucleus.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:08.910
And it takes values 1, 2, 3,
all the way up to infinity.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:12.650
So n equals 1, small radius.

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:15.560
n equals 10, large radius.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:19.050
Oh, by the way, there's another
numbering system.

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:23.880
This is what we use, but the
spectroscopists use letters.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.910
The spectroscopists
use letters-- why?

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:28.220
Because remember the
Balmer series?

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.480
Everybody was hooked on the
Balmer series and it ended up

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.330
being n equals 2.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:33.050
And then later with better
detectors we find

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:34.320
there's an n equals 1.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.060
So the spectroscopists
said, we're going

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.150
to get fooled again.

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:38.730
So we're going use letters.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:41.420
And we're going to start
with the letter k.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.680
It's in the middle
of the alphabet.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.210
That way if we discover even
lower energies, we've got some

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.220
head room here, we
can label those.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.090
But we never found any.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:53.960
So if you go over to Building
Thirteen and you do some x-ray

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.220
refraction and you use the
line that emanates from a

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.150
copper target, n equals
1-- it's called the k

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:01.420
alpha line of copper.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:02.270
To this day.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.030
So k, l, m, and so on.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.620
You can't get to infinity,
obviously.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.720
You know, I didn't think
this thing through.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.830
Now the l.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.210
l is, what's his name?

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:14.060
Sommerfeld.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.830
And it's called the orbital
quantum number.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:18.170
Why?

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:21.480
Because he said that the
electron is in an orbital

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.520
instead of an orbit.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.400
Orbit is Bohr, orbital
is Bohr-Sommerfeld.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.950
And it speaks to the shape.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.300
Somehow, I've got to distinguish
between elliptical

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.470
and circular.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:39.260
And it takes values 0,
1, up to n minus 1.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:43.480
So the n number controls
the range of l.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.100
And again, the spectroscopists,
they're real

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.280
number weenies, they're afraid,

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.580
so they use s, lowercase.

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.360
See this is uppercase,
this is lowercase.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.070
s, p, d, f.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:59.480
For sharp, this is the sharpest
line from the l

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.860
equals 0-- then the principal
because as you go to z they

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.050
all seem to converge and
look like hydrogen--

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:10.260
d is diffuse, f is fine, and
then after that they ran out

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.460
of ideas so g and h.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:17.820
So you'll talk about the one
s-orbital, meaning n equals 1,

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.680
l equals 0.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:24.100
And there are some values
here for shapes.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.730
I'm going to put that
right above it.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:29.420
When l equals 0, l equals
0 means you

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.610
have a circular orbit.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:36.010
And when l equals 1
it's elliptical.

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:43.820
And when l equals 2 it's much
more complex, and we'll just

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:44.700
leave it at that.

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.710
1, 2, and 3.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:48.440
So there's l values.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.390
And then m is the magnetic
quantum number.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.386
And it talks about
orientation.

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:02.870
I'll show you what I mean
by that in a second.

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:06.090
The values are governed by l,
which is governed by n.

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:10.330
Starts at l, l minus 1, goes
down through 0, goes to minus

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:13.300
values and ends at minus l.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:17.155
So for example, we could do
something like this--

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:25.010
when n equals 1, then l most
equal 0, so therefore

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.830
m must equals 0.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:30.330
So this means for n equals 1,
it's only a circular orbit and

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.760
this thing is going to be immune
to line splitting in a

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.140
magnetic field.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:41.480
When n equals 2, l can equals
0 or l can equal 1.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.050
When l equals 0, m equals 0.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:45.480
That's boring, that's
circular.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.600
But here's another
possibility.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.580
And that is, when l equals
1 then m can equal 1,

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.020
0, and minus 1.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.160
Now I said it has something
to do with orientation.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.960
Most of quantum mechanics
doesn't translate into the

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.970
Cartesian world, but this one
does, mercifully, and I think

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:05.320
it's a cute analogy.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:09.060
If I were to tell you that
I've got three different

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:12.160
quantum numbers and I've got an
elliptical thing-- and one

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:16.400
way to think, see, the number 0
looks like a circle and the

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.910
number 1 has some asperity
associated with it, so you can

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:21.330
think of that as the ellipse--

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:27.020
so I know that I can, with no
prior knowledge of where the

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:31.100
true origin of the universe it
is, I can arbitrarily define a

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.800
set of rectangular coordinates,
orthogonal

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.270
coordinates, x, y, and z.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:40.260
And that means I could put one
orbital here, one orbital

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.640
here, and one orbital here.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:47.010
So those are three orthogonal
orientations, which I think is

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:50.620
consistent with the fact that
m takes on three values.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.230
OK, that's cute.

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:57.720
So that's as far as
Sommerfeld went.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.960
I'm going to go and do something
as a retronym.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.530
I want to get the fourth quantum
number up here now,

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:04.670
but we're going to
pause the story.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:08.690
We're going to fast forward to
1925 so I can get the last

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.020
quantum number up here.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.120
And that's called the
spin quantum number.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:18.680
And it takes values plus
or minus a half.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.990
Where did that come from?

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:25.950
Well, in 1922--

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.250
oh, you know everybody's getting
Nobel Prizes and I

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:35.060
didn't give Niels Bohr his
proper recognition.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.450
He gets the Noble
Prize, as well.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.200
Oh, when Sommerfeld turned 80,
they had a symposium in his

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:44.480
honor and they published
a book.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.490
And the book had papers and
well-wishes, papers that were

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:49.140
given at the symposium.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.720
And in the front they had
Sommerfeld's picture and they

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:58.450
also had this twin picture,
this diptych.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:01.490
So on the right is Sommerfeld,
and on the left is the same

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:03.630
picture but they've
morphed it.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:05.870
Now remember, there's
no Photoshop.

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:08.290
Horrors, there's no Photoshop.

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:09.190
Can you imagine?

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.240
So how could they do this?

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.120
They had to take the negative,
which was a photographic

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.690
plate, and when they were
printing the negative using a

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:19.740
light box they had to hold the
negative on an angle to get

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.340
the distortion.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.340
And in holding it on an angle
to get the distortion, they

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:27.720
turned this image into something
that was a little

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.610
more spread out.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:33.470
And the caption that went with
this, "To Arnold Sommerfeld,

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:37.400
who taught us that the circle is
the degenerate form of the

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.520
ellipse." Now that's
geek humor.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.720
I mean, they laughed.

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.200
They thought that was
so funny, hahaha.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.210
You know.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:47.320
They were having a great time.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.970
It was Germany, and
nineteen twenties.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:52.640
And there he is.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.550
OK, so now let's go to 1922.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:56.250
This is the Stern-Gerlach
experiment.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:57.990
Very interesting experiment.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:00.110
This is really physical
vapor deposition.

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.500
Over here I've got a
crucible and it's

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.240
full of molten silver.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:08.280
So Stern and Gerlach were
studying the magnetic behavior

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.090
of liquid metals.

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.690
So what they were doing
is they had this--

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:15.720
over here you see it's red
even though it's silver,

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.290
because this is that about
1,000 centigrade.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.200
Silver melts at about 960.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.000
Everything, I don't care what
it's color is at room

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.340
temperature, at 1,000
degrees it's red.

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.200
It's called red hot.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:26.590
All right.

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:29.370
So this is red hot silver and
there's a vapor here and

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:32.010
there's a slit and the silver
atoms come out of the slit.

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:35.290
And they go across over here to
a substrate and then they

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:36.970
pause it on the substrate.

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:40.040
So making little band of silver
on the substrate.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.150
And furthermore, he
sometimes put them

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.700
through a magnetic field.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:49.190
So he's got a slit here that
narrows the beam, and then he

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:53.730
sends it through a magnetic
field that is asymmetric.

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:54.570
It's divergent.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:55.330
Can you see here?

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:56.280
Look at the end.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.030
The south pole as a tip
and the north pole is

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.670
this arc, this cup.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.920
So the field lines don't go just
directly from tip to tip,

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.910
they go from tip off
to the side.

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:08.210
So you can see the divergence
of the magnetic field.

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:11.910
And so he looked at what kind
of deposits he got as a

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:17.460
function of the magnetic
field.

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.470
Here's what the observed.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:22.250
Very puzzling.

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:24.020
The whole thing was about
Maxwell's equation.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.183
So he's got a silver beam.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:35.330
And when it went directly from
the furnace to the substrate

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.200
he just got the shadow
of the slit.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:44.490
And they have the split
crosswise with respect to the

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:45.910
divergent magnetic field.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:50.750
So if you look at the substrate
you just see a band.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.590
So this is a band of silver and
you can imagine there was

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.260
a slit out here and it just cast
a shadow and that's the

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.650
band of silver.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:01.340
This is PVD, physical vapor
deposition of silver.

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:05.580
Now when b is not equal 0,
what would you expect?

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.160
You'd think the beam
would bend, right?

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.610
So what do you think happens?

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:11.100
The beam bends up?

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.910
The beam bends down?

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:16.790
Or beam bends to the right
or to the left?

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:17.560
Think about it.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.870
I don't want to hear
your answer.

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:20.710
Think about it.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.070
What do they observe?

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:27.050
What they observe is, if this is
where the original one is.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:28.970
Two.

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:31.100
The beam splits in two.

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.670
And it gets two deposits,
one above, one

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:36.520
below, of equal intensity.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.700
That's a problem.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:39.940
Beam splitting.

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.605
But now it's a beam of matter.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.670
Beam splitting.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:52.230
Boy, they had them scratching
their heads on that one.

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:55.570
No way to explain that.

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:57.830
So along come a couple
of graduate students.

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:00.270
1925, couple of graduates.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:03.230
So this is 1992 in Frankfurt.

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:08.070
1925, two graduate students
in Leiden, again.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:11.000
Gaudsmit and Uhlenbeck.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.960
They're just like my TA's.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.740
Grad students.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:22.000
And they looked at this thing,
I don't know, maybe sitting

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.180
around over a beer one night,
and they said, you know, so

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:28.700
far what we've been saying is
the electron revolves around

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.230
the nucleus.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:33.400
And sometimes it revolves in a
circular orbit, and sometimes

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.920
it revolves in an elliptical
orbit, but here's

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.280
the electron revolving.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:41.590
And they said, what if in
addition to revolve, the

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:45.320
electron rotated so that
it's going like this?

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.570
[GESTURES]

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.580
But there's two choices.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.310
It can be going like this, or
can be going like this.

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:55.730
[GESTURES]

00:42:55.730 --> 00:43:00.880
Now, it's a charged species and
it's rotating, which means

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.670
that it's going to have
a magnetic moment

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:05.580
depending on rotation.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:07.120
And now I'm going to
send it through a

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.550
divergent magnetic field.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:12.170
Doesn't it follow to reason
that if I put it through a

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:15.320
magnetic field and I've got some
of them doing this and

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.460
some of them doing that,
they're going to go in

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:18.550
different directions?

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:20.380
Opposite directions?

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.150
And what do you think
the numbers are?

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:25.420
If I give you Avogadro's number
of silvers, you think

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.630
I'm going to get a dominant
clockwise and a minority

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:29.980
anti-clockwise?

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:30.560
No.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.180
We're going to get
equal numbers.

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.520
Some are going to spin like
this, some are going

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.340
to spin like that.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:36.320
And you're going say, but
electrons don't spin, they're

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.150
not doing this.

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:42.050
But if you model them as though
they are doing this,

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:44.690
you get those results.

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:46.930
Those results make sense.

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:51.530
And so they introduced the
spin quantum numbers.

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:54.675
And I think these are the ones
that have been erased.

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:58.270
Such is education.

00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.550
OK.

00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:59.080
So you know it.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.750
S plus or minus a half.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:03.060
By the way, Gaudsmit and
Uhlenbeck were here during

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:04.260
World War Two.

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.900
They worked in Building Four.

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.270
You go down the corridor,
Building Four just off the

00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:11.140
Infinite Corridor, there's a
plaque there for the Radiation

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:11.780
Laboratory.

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:13.180
That's where they worked,
in the Rad Lab.

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:16.150
That's where radar was
first engineered.

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:17.630
There was work in the
UK, there was

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:18.570
work in other places.

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:22.050
But this is the Radiation
Laboratory, started here and

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:24.300
they were both here
at the time.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.440
OK, well, I think that's a--

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.090
So this is a plate
from the paper.

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:32.692
No magnetic field with
the magnetic field.

00:44:32.692 --> 00:44:35.870
And by the way, why did
they choose silver?

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:39.670
They chose silver because it's
atomic number is 47--

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:41.240
it has an odd number
of electrons.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.270
You're going to learn later that
you get two electrons in

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:45.780
an orbital, and if you have
two electrons, one will be

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.660
spin up, one will
be spin down.

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.020
There's no magnetic moment.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.720
So they were clever about
choosing an element that had

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:56.360
an odd number of electrons so
that there would, at the end,

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.260
be an unpaired electron.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.920
And there's Otto Stern
with his Nobel Prize.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.310
And he came to the United
States, as well.

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:05.530
And you're going to see the
ascendancy of American Science

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:07.940
as people flee Europe up in
the nineteen thirties.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:10.630
And America is the beneficiary,
and then you see

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:12.340
American science rise.

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:15.570
But for now it's European
science.

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:17.370
OK, so I'm going to talk a
little bit about hydrogen and

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:18.760
transportation.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.780
And we're going to talk about
the Hindenburg because it was

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:21.940
full of hydrogen.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.470
And to give you a sense of
scale, this is what a 747

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:26.960
would look like and is what the
Titanic would look like.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.880
It was almost as long
as the Titanic.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.920
It was built in Germany by
the Zeppelin company.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:37.490
And the Titanic, the Hindenburg
rather, was LZ129

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:38.080
serial number.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:42.120
That's Luftschiff Zeppelin.

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.090
Airship Zeppelin.

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:44.810
135 feet in diameter.

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:47.860
804 feet long.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.170
How long is a football field?

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.510
So that's a big boat.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:46:00.590
Seven million cubic feet of gas,
giving you 112 tons of

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:01.480
useful lift.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.950
You ever have to lift something
very heavy, there's

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:05.200
your sky crane.

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:10.010
So why are they using
hydrogen?

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.620
Well, when the Nazis came to
power in Germany, Congress

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.200
passed the Helium Control Act.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.480
The dominant supplier of helium
to the world was the

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.520
United States.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:21.190
Helium comes from helium
wells in the earth.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:25.410
And so as of 1933 the United
States refused to sell Helium

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:29.850
to Germany, so the engineers
were forced to use hydrogen.

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:32.690
Next best thing.

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:33.640
Here are some posters.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.550
"Only 2 1/2 half days to
Europe." And here one, a

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:37.490
German one.

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:39.960
"And now over the North
Atlantic." That's Manhattan.

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.280
That's the lower tip
of Manhattan.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:45.710
There's the Chrysler Building,
look at that.

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:46.960
Now look at that picture,
isn't that magnificent?

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:52.170
10 transatlantic
flights, 1936.

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:55.080
1002 passengers.

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.220
Cruising speed, 78
miles an hour.

00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:59.650
Took two and a half days.

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:02.940
By the way, 100 feet
in diameter--

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.440
when people traveled, they
traveled in style.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.390
They had a ballroom there
and a grand piano.

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:09.550
People didn't sit like this.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:09.950
[CROUCHES]

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:13.230
With a plastic knife and fork.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:16.480
That's progress, right?

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:21.040
Two and a half dancing,
tux, tails, champagne.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.150
Now, like this.

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:24.920
[CROUCHES]

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:27.020
May sixth, 1937.

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:30.520
Arrival of first flight to
the U.S. while docking in

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.340
Lakehurst, New Jersey.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:33.370
Why were they docking in
Lakehurst, New Jersey?

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:36.370
If you go to the top of the
Empire State Building, look

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:39.980
and you will see at the
corners moorings.

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:41.770
Moorings sticking out.

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:46.400
The plan was to dock airships at
the Empire State Building.

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:50.150
So you'd come in from Europe,
you'd dock at Fifth Avenue,

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:53.010
get on the elevator,
and there you were.

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:55.990
When they tried to dock the air
currents were so violent

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:57.690
that they couldn't safely
dock the ship.

00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:00.780
So then they moved across to the
fair grounds at Lakehurst,

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.960
New Jersey, where obviously this
mooring is much closer to

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.980
the ground than the top of the
Empire State Building.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:07.810
The wild currents,
they're bad, but

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:08.970
they're manageably bad.

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:12.680
At the top of the Empire State
Building, impossible.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.720
There's another image.

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.410
So what happened?

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:19.270
It did not explode.

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:21.430
It did not explode.

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:22.650
It couldn't explode.

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:25.580
Seven million cubic feet of
hydrogen to explode requires

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:29.040
seven million cubic feet of
oxygen instantaneously.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.170
And air is 20% oxygen.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:36.910
So it was a very violent fire,
roman candle from the point of

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:38.490
egress of the hydrogen.

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:43.050
Most of the people on board
walked off the Hindenburg.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:45.770
Most of the people walked off
the Hindenburg uninjured.

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:51.110
They think it was electrical
discharge in the vicinity of a

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:52.400
hydrogen leak.

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:56.000
Recent research has indicated
the skin was made of resin

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.700
finished with a lacquer dope.

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:00.380
And then to make it shiny they
put aluminum powder.

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:03.680
And why they put iron oxide on
the inside I don't know, but

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:07.610
this is what NASA uses for solid
rocket motor grains.

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:10.620
So when this thing catches
fire, this is a thermite

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:12.495
reaction and could
be very violent.

00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:17.280
And this spelled the end
of rigid error ships in

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.290
commercial air transportation.

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:22.840
Now this a U.S. Navy airship
filled with helium.

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.420
And there was a small gasoline
fire, look what happened.

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:26.735
Again, it was the skin.

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:33.580
That's a blow up of that one.

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:35.280
So I looked at that and I
thought, geez, that looks

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.540
Lichtenstein, doesn't it?

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:38.940
You know this one?

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:39.520
This one.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:40.470
Look at that.

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:42.560
Look at that.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.430
So you know, I can be an
artist, too, right?

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:47.450
OK, I'm going to tell
you one more story.

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:49.140
Another Niels Bohr story.

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:53.660
So in 1896 there was a guy,
and astronomer at Harvard

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:55.530
called Pickering.

00:49:55.530 --> 00:50:00.190
Pickering at Harvard, 1896, and
he was studying the lines

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:01.360
in star light.

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:05.910
And he attributed to some of
the spectra that he was

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:11.480
getting, he said he was seeing
atomic hydrogen in star light.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:15.300
And then there was a fellow
in London called Fowler.

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:19.750
And Fowler, in 1912, reproduced
the experiments in

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:20.235
the laboratory.

00:50:20.235 --> 00:50:25.640
He put gas in a tube and got
the same thing in the lab.

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:31.680
So this guy's at Harvard and
the other guy is at London.

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.220
Well, Bohr looks at this
stuff and he says,

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:34.820
you guys are wrong.

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.435
You guys are wrong--
your lines are off

00:50:36.435 --> 00:50:38.540
by a factor of 4x.

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:41.280
You've got the right series, but
you got the wrong element.

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.860
What you guys are looking
at is helium plus.

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:46.455
You're not looking at hydrogen,
and you know, from--

00:50:46.455 --> 00:50:48.100
it goes to z squared.

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.370
So the lines are going to be
shifted by factor of four

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:52.670
because this z is equal to 2.

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:55.120
So Fowler was a pompous ass
and he didn't like being

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:57.190
called on his bad science.

00:50:57.190 --> 00:51:00.360
So he does a calculation and he
looks more carefully and he

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.760
says, Bohr, you're wrong.

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:06.260
In fact, our lines are
off by 4.0016.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.440
Now don't laugh.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.130
The reason is the spectroscopy
was so precise that they could

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.530
go to five significant
figures.

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:16.730
So Bohr says, hmm.

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:18.670
And he goes back and he says,
you know, we've been doing all

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:22.040
these calculations with a one
electron atom just neglecting

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:22.980
the center.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:25.990
So he redoes the calculations
for the entire Bohr model,

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:29.430
including considerations of the
mass of the nucleus and

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:32.260
the mass of the electron in the
form of the reduced mass.

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:37.740
The reduced mass is-- you're
learning this in--

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.020
the reciprocal of the sum
of the reciprocals.

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:43.890
And when he does that, he gets
that the value of the line

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:49.730
shift should be 4.00163.

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:52.190
So he says, you guys
are wrong.

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:55.050
It should be 4.0016.

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:57.500
You got 4.0016, you idiots.

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.750
You're looking at helium plus.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.300
That was Bohr.

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:04.840
Did not want to get into
an argument with Bohr.

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:05.850
All right.

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:07.530
Have a nice weekend.
