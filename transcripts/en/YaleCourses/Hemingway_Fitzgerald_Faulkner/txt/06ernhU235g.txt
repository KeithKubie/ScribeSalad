Speaker 1:          00:01          Oh, last time we talk about the, uh, the kind of odd presence of race in the great Gatsby. Um, even though there's no African American character in great Gatsby, um, there's a kind of undercurrent of illusions to raise, um, especially in that seemingly with two of his scenes when I'm naked and gas via going into town and Gatsby's car and they see this other car with three m to black men and white black woman in the condo and buy what she'll fill. So that's a kind of very odd gratuitous reference. Um, and I just want to, um, pick up on that and push that a little further, uh, because they actually is kind of a more important, uh, connection, uh, of African American music actually being very important element. I would say the jazz is, you know, started out as an is still very much, um, African American music.

Speaker 1:          01:01          So I'm Fitzgerald has written than as they, this is afterward Greg Gas Bay, but 1931 as a called echoes of the jazz age. Uh, and he says it was an age of miracles. It was an age of odd. It was an age of access and it was an age or set higher. So a lot of those terms, miracles. Um, there's, um, you've guys probably know this, there's a very strong, um, kind of, um, religious language. A language of Christianity is son of God, religious language in the great Gatsby and miracles would be within that domain of religious delusions. Um, but obviously, uh, with uh, being remapped onto a secular context, um, but, um, certainly gas, but you're someone who would believe in miracles, the miracle of turning time back and completely erasing the few years of, um, bases life. Uh, that's the miracle that really, um, that he wants to achieve. Um, so miracles what Fitzgerald associates with the jazz age very much as a fairing in to have the great Gatsby access.

Speaker 1:          02:16          We know about, um, and age of art as well. Um, and there's actually an illusion in when it goes to, um, guest ways piloting the music that was playing. Um, it's actually, uh, the jazz history of the world. So lots of cross references basically kind of a weapon. Uh, web of musical web has been a vote and into the great Gatsby with jazz being the, the genetic ground of that Web. Um, so because with the talking and jazz is really what's important to the 1920s, not just to Fitzgerald but to the entire decade. So, um, just want bring up some of the employment figures, um, the piece called, what did I do to be so black and blue? That's when specially resonant peak. Uh, it started out with, um, fast Waller singing it in, in this behaving. Um, and then, um, it was picked up, both played on the trunk but, but also sung by Louis Armstrong.

Speaker 1:          03:20          Um, and Oh, oh, oh, uh, and um, and then this is an illusion, uh, to, uh, Louie Armstrong. Um, there's this illusion to Louis Armstrong and Ralph Ellison's invisible man. And, um, for some reason that is not showing up here. So I will, I must, must have raised that when I was, um, getting ready for this. So I'll just read this to you. This is the opening of Ralph Ellison's invisible man. Um, then somehow I came out of it sending hastily from this underground of sound to hear Louis Armstrong in recently asking, what did I do to be so black and blue? So it very much is something that started out in music and then cross over into their Azure. Uh, and basically it was kind of the, um, under the line, uh, concede for Ralph Ellison's invisible man. I'll put this back on the PowerPoint when I, uh, posted to the website.

Speaker 1:          04:34          Um, oh, it's right here. Um, I can view this way your tricks on me. Okay. So this is the passage. Um, and we can um, talk about, um, music as I'm furnishing a kind of prometric spectrum to, uh, to a linguistic medium. Right? You know, we don't, um, thing of language necessarily, um, as having colors. Um, but language very much has colors in the way gas page, very, very striking. Um, Lou Lou Garden, yellow music, the blue honey of the Mediterranean, um, numerous instances of color have being used in very abstract ways, um, to describe the as as kind of operation basic operation of the linguistic medium. So, um, so based on, on this, uh, the kind of the cross mapping of music, uh, onto the, onto the language, um, and, and, and the generation of color as well. I mean, you know, it's kind of very, very odd.

Speaker 1:          05:40          Um, bad. Um, sight and sound are being combined in this kind of cross mapping. So I want to bring those back to the word that we heard last time from as well. Perkins. Um, his complained really that the great Gatsby is very vague, that not enough physical details, not enough info really about gas bay. Um, and uh, last time we talked about it in terms of what I would call counter realism, um, and, um, today I'd like to talk about that, that sensation of vagueness. Um, I let him talk about that in terms of process mapping of sight and sound, because this is not something that we do all the time. It's not common usage. Uh, it can create impression of pregnancy even though once we get used to it, you know, it's just a wonderful, um, um, strategy that Fitzgerald is using. Uh, so the three headings that I like to, um, use, uh, for this kind of cross mapping is first of all, uh, all Trey feel with colors.

Speaker 1:          06:47          We've already seen a little bit of that, uh, when Fitzgerald was seemingly a talking just about sound. Um, but colors, um, operative, uh, in those descriptions. Um, and then the kind of upwards of that visual feel with Sam or with noise, lots of noise. There's same exactly symmetrical to that, but um, happening on the um, visual. And um, and then the, the third really this is the kind of the central structure that I like to, um, talk about today, um, is this kind of visual auditory coupling as the medic cubs. And so first of all, we see, um, two characters in the same visual or the same auditory tableau to people seemingly accidentally being paired together. We just see them together. That's the visual impact of that image. And it turns out that that visual logic, that visual mode of association actually has the medic implication.

Speaker 1:          07:53          So the visual, auditory coupling turning into a thematic couplings are very complicated structure. But I do think that this is something that a Fisher works very hard to create. And this is one of the two just, just miraculous. It was, I would say, um, um, uh, architecture, architectural features of the novel. Um, so, um, first let's just think about the auditory field with colors. Um, and this is, uh, actually just still had guessed based party and nick talking about, um, what he hears there, but something else as well. Um, the lice grows brighter as the earth lodges away from the Sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and opera of wizards pitchers are key hire. Um, so it is really hearing the music. This is the occasion when the jazz history of the world is being clear. Um, but it seems that it's impossible to talk about qualities of sound, uh, without thinking of visual images and not even visual images, uh, of the people who were there.

Speaker 1:          09:06          Although they are, certainly, there are plenty of descriptions of those people, but right now, um, is uh, very, very, uh, cosmic vision, uh, after world of Verges, away from the sun is on that kind of cosmic scale, astronomical scale, um, that the yellow cocktail music is pitching into. Um, so that really the cosmic reference is coming out of nowhere. It was very surprising. Um, and I'm not sure what to say about it. And other than that, it seems very deliberate on, on fish show up high. So once again, um, lots and lots of really interesting details in packed moments, um, that invited basically compel us to give interpretation too. Um, so this is one end of the spectrum. All the we feel with colors. Um, and so let's go to the other end of the strap spectrum, the visual optical feel with noise. Um, and this is once again, very early, uh, when it goes to the big hand in household for the first time.

Speaker 1:          10:17          Um, and this is, um, he sees these days is his cousin. He hasn't seen her for awhile. Um, the first image, um, that he has of days. It's actually not a daisy alone, uh, but she's on this couch with another young woman. The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch and wished to young women were Boyd as though upon an end code barroom balloon, sorry. They were both in weight and addresses with wrestling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after the short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few and no one's listening to the Webinar and snap of the curtains and the groom of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom. As Tom, you can shut the real windows and the code when died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women balloon slowly to the floor, um, is an amazing image.

Speaker 1:          11:27          Uh, and it's that this has a lot about if you can and household, it says a lot about things. Uh, basically is really an, uh, uh, visual, uh, allegory for the entire novel. Um, the entire novel, the Great Gatsby can be seen as they say, ballooning, ballooning up and taking flight. Uh, going back to that earlier romance, um, with, um, with gas may, uh, but really is just a very racial trail and she's going to be brought down to earth by Tom. Um, so it's a really interesting that, um, there should be this, uh, intensification of what my seeing a very neutral or very casual, a visual image into something that carries tremendous. The medic wait, right? This is basically the whole story of the great Gatsby. It's been encapsulated, encapsulated in this one visual image. Um, and what allows this visual image to have such tremendous thematic way, it's actually an intrusion of Sam into that, into that image.

Speaker 1:          12:43          Um, if they had not been solved, it would not have been so pregnant with meaning. And the sound has to do with the whip and snap. We got the curtains. Um, it's just remarkable words to use. Curtains, you know, they don't make sounds like a web or, um, they don't make snapping songs. Um, so clearly this is the super imposition of something else. Much more, uh, brutal, much more violent images being super imposed on the tree image. Images being super imposed upon the otherwise very benign and very harmless submit by the curtain. Um, so or rarely the whip and the snap, uh, already behaving to auditory grant for the appearance from Thailand of Buchanan, so that when here finally appears towards the end of the passage is almost not surprising, even though he doesn't show up until the last sentence of the passage. The snap and whip of the curtains are ready.

Speaker 1:          13:49          Um, carry a senator. So, you know, it's really interesting that Tom Buchanan is a very physical man. He is, we know him by his physical attributes, his body filling up every inch of his clothes, his riding boots and so on, a very visual figure. But nonetheless, fisheries is careful to give an auditory dimension to Tom. And then the final, all the trade, but he does is to bring down shut, do rear window. This is not the rear door, but as the rear window, almost as though somebody is trying to get into his house by the back door or the back window. Um, and Tommy Canon is shutting that right then and there before any action is taken place. So, you know, this is a forecast. The rest of the novel, um, is um, basically it's just a capsule summary of everything that we need to know about the great Gatsby.

Speaker 1:          14:37          Um, so, um, just to see how carefully crafted this is. Um, because this is already made because this comes to us readymade um, we don't notice how, how much, um, craftsmanship actually goes into that passage. So I just wanted to show you a visual image that is almost similar to theirs up for by very famous painter. Um, and they, um, and this is a picture of car both where's Mr is reclining. Um, we also see the curtains in there, but we just know that those curtains are not going to make a noise like a web or they're not going to be making, um, with whipping or snapping sound. So this is in contrast to his Gerald. This is a visual feel without noise in this completely visual. Um, it doesn't carry the auditory signature and auditory manners that as encoded in Fitzgerald, very careful coupler of sight and sound in his disruption.

Speaker 1:          15:45          Um, so, um, we also know, uh, that they see those in the by herself, right? So it's very, very important that she and Julien Baker, the first Glennon's that we have is after two of them on that enormous couch. Um, and both occupants of the visual field that is carries noise. So that is the first common thing between Jordan Baker and they say less. Go onto see if that visual auditory counseling, uh, what does that mean in thematic terms, how that Stan translate into futures of the plot. That may be, we'll also bring the two of them together. Um, so I'm telling you what I'm going to argue with. It's just the outline of the lecture and then we'll do the same thing, uh, with Gatsby and like as well. But let's just, there's, um, just move on to Jordan Baker. Um, and um, last time we talked about the importance of, uh, the car of as base Rose Rose.

Speaker 1:          16:52          Um, and the car would really is a key player and a great Gatsby and all kinds of contacts. So it turns out that, um, join Baker, uh, one very important aspect of a relation to Ashley revolves around, um, the car. It was that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car is started because she passed so close to some working room than offender flicks a button on one man's coat. Will Rogen driver I protested. Either you are to be more careful or you on to drive at all. I am careful. No you're not. Well other people are, she said later there was I got to deal with it. They'll keep out of my way. She assisted it takes two to make an accident. So this says a lot of other motivation between nick and Jordan Baker and why it might come to nothing.

Speaker 1:          17:56          Um, so, you know, the Ashley lost of little local allegories or the entire plot all the way throughout the great Gatsby and um, and the fact that she is, um, a bad driver who's counting on other people being careful of to prevent accidents from happening, that is not a good basis to get into the marriage with. And next thing is to know that. So I mean this is really one of the many signs that this is not going to come to anything. Um, but well, it's also interesting I think about this particular um, image of Julien Baker coming by way of her relation to the automobile is a notion of accountability that is perhaps not just limited to Jordan. Baker herself is really an account, uh, an explanation of why things go wrong and one's responsibility once input, once contribution to the fact that something is going on wrong.

Speaker 1:          19:05          And for Jordan Baker Accountability is almost always written over to the other side. If there's an accident is because the other person isn't a good driver. That's why there's an accident taking, not taking into account at all. The fact that she's also a bad driver. I'm just right that it takes two to make an accident. Um, but the, the explanation there's she's looking for is that in the other person's fault. Um, and we'll see that there are other characters in the novel who share that understanding of accountability. Um, kind of a straight attribution of thought to the other side. Um, so let's see, um, what they say, how they say relates to the car and it turns out this year also as a very extremely non trivial relation to the car. Um, this is, well they are leaving that um, terrible scene in New York when basically Gaspe is just falling apart.

Speaker 1:          20:10          Um, but he's, Tom, um, allows him to drive these back. So nick that Gatsby and daisy in the car, this is gas. Me telling me what happened when we left New York. She was very nervous and she thought it was there either to drive. And this woman rushed out of, just as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but they seem to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Nazy turned away from the woman toward the other than car, and then she lost her nose and told back. So as the death of motto at the hand of Daisy, and, um, it is not intentional and I think that this says a lot about these Z. Um, Fitzgerald is not portraying I'm a bad person really. Um, she is a bad driver because she's lost her nerve.

Speaker 1:          21:17          Um, and we really have to be pretty careful, um, in our assignment of blame. Um, I think that Jordan Baker is a very, almost too clear assignment of blame in putting it squarely, um, or the other person's site. Um, and the first Arrow is actually quite now for, um, about, um, seeing what kind of woman Bec is another very brief person. Um, and she's not a very feisty person. She doesn't have steadily is the, that stood in as of nerve. Um, and she'll do Susan the nerve at a critical moment and both at this very critical moment. But also, uh, in the kind of abstract way, uh, when gas being needed her to stand by him, which is really not there for him. Um, so this is the kind of person she is and it comes out most dramatically, um, in her handling of the car.

Speaker 1:          22:14          Um, but it also comes out in a way that she handles other affairs of life as well. Um, so in all those ways we see the same kind of logic that we saw last time that it's very important. Human attributes are rooted, are channeled through, um, our relation to objects, bases, relation to the car says a lot. How about how she would behave you another go strictly human contacts of interaction. Um, so John Baker and they say we're joined together at the very beginning, uh, by virtue of that visual tableau. And it turns out that it actually is a very deep connection. They, they're both bad drivers, uh, although for bad reasons. So, you know, we have to be careful as well. They're both bad drivers. But in the case of Jordan Baker, she's just much more cavalier about the whole thing. Whereas Stacy is just not, it's just incompetent and not very skilled and lacking earth.

Speaker 1:          23:14          Um, so let's turn on turn back now to another coupling. Um, and you guys will notice that I'm not talking about, um, Gatsby and daisy, the most obvious couple and the great gas where, uh, but I want to talk about that a couple of, uh, in a roundabout fashion actually by way of Nick and Gasper. And I just want to go back to one various more point that we talked about much earlier. Um, and which is about the legacy of Whoa, Whoa, one, right. So we know that nick and Gas Bay have this in common. They both fought in world war one, and, um, they both name the, the, the, the, the unit that they were in. Um, so nick was in the nine machine gun battalion and gets me, was in the seventh infantry, um, very precised in naming the number of that unit. So erratic.

Speaker 1:          24:11          We know that there's a prior connection, uh, between the two of them. And I would argue that they also have an ongoing connection as well because they are both very, very, uh, sensitive to responsive to and captivated by a certain quality of sound that resize and daisies boys. So, um, it's very, very hard that Neko is, has no romantic attachment. Two days there should be captivated and almost exactly the same way that Gatsby is captivated. It doesn't actually take a romantic attachment for it to be completely within the powers of a certain quality of voice. So like talking about these boys, it was the kind of voice that ear follows up and down as if each speech isn't an arrangement of nurse that will never be the way the Gan her face was sad and lovely with Bray things and the right eyes and the brain passionate mouth.

Speaker 1:          25:15          But there was an excitement in their voice that men who had care for her found difficult to forget this thing. Compulsion of wisdoms less than. Um, when we look at the visual description of daisy, um, it's not very striking. Fitzgerald using very frigid and narrative was to talk about, they say the face is sad and lovely. Would break things and almost no actual description of the fear of the physical features on Daisy's phase. So it actually is a kind of variable, very, um, image of days as we know that supposedly she's beautiful, but we don't actually know in what way she is the exact features that renderer beautiful. Um, it is a voice that gives a very accent rendition of, they say it is voice to know the can forget. Nobody who cares about her can forget. Um, and in this case it is really the intonation of mortality rate and I think that for us, um, well I mean now we can capture as bubbles, legion sound calling mixed that less, uh, of a, a kind of internationally on mortality.

Speaker 1:          26:31          But, um, it's just, just avoids the, you're here for that one law and, and you'll never hear it again. You do have the sense that it's just that one time and uh, it will, uh, never again be heard again. You go to a concert that's not being recorded, then you just know that this is it. Um, you know, once it's gone, it's gone. Um, and so that partly accounts for the compulsion that comes from Daisy's voice, um, that, um, it both is integration of all the hurt and mortality and this an intonation and mortality on the part of the person who is listening to her. Um, let's look at one other description of this voice coming from neck. Uh, this is something that we actually read the, but I just started, would read it again for a moment. The last sunshine fell out of romantic affection of Ohio glowing phase before has compelled me forward.

Speaker 1:          27:30          Breathlessly as I listen, that glow faded each light discerning, more lingering regret, pleasure than meaning of the lesson street at dusk. Um, and this was actually in the context of, um, nick, this is the visit to be Canon Household, um, and make us just about to found out about toms affair with myrtle. Um, so in some sense to count the fading light is also, um, uh, kind of, uh, created, uh, or perhaps even an rate of, uh, the randomly feeling light. Even in the course of that evening. As the phone rings, all the light goes out, uh, of everyone's face. Uh, and so, uh, it's, it's, it's, um, it's, it's the, it's the quality of sound that registry that registers with dramatic development in that, in that episode. Um, so let's look up. So you know, as I said, really, you know, doesn't have a deep relation to today's eight, uh, but he has a very deep relation to Daisy's voice.

Speaker 1:          28:36          Um, and gas me who was a very deep relation today say also has very deep information to please. It's for us as well. Um, and this is the moment, uh, when he's meeting daisy after all these years and next house. Um, and uh, we'll read that passage a little later. Um, but they conjectures that has been killing her in his heart for so long that this is actually not the big moment for him. This is actually the moment of the led down that here is this woman who's been waiting for that you guys doing everything building up his whole life towards this moment. Um, and it's a kind of a let down. Um, and so he niggas notice and in Gaspe and then something else happens as I watch him, he adjusted himself visible way. His hand took hold of hers and as she says, something low in his ear, he turned toward her with a rush of emotion.

Speaker 1:          29:39          I think that voice held him most with is fluctuating feverish one because it couldn't be over dreamed that voice was Adele, this song. So everything else about days, they actually could be an is overtrained and Gaspe almost no staff that he's project that much, too much on two days. There was no way she can live up to all the projections about those years that he's been involving her. And um, so she, no one, no human being is not just the days that you can live up to that kind of massive projection and the politics of gasping. No European can. But one thing about daisy can stand up to that magnification. Emotional annification application on a part of daisy of gas made and that is the voice. Um, every time, anytime he hears his voice, he's captivated, captivated by her, over the law. Again, as a, everything has really starting right at that moment.

Speaker 1:          30:51          So the voice for the Esa, um, captures the possibility of fresh beginning. Um, it seems to have content and is themes to have arrived in the moment and where, uh, gets bits, find the solution with asa and then that he hears that voice again. And it's almost as if there's a fresh start. And this is really what Fitzgerald talks about, about the new world and the fresh green grass of the new world. The very end of the great Gatsby is that some people actually have the capability for endless new beginnings. You know, your thing that they've come to the anode Europe, uh, and all that, the come to the end of the dream and all of a sudden they're selling up all over again. Um, and that's really was impressive about gas bay. Sad and pathetic about Gatsby as well, but also impressive is that he can always start again, that passion for gas.

Speaker 1:          31:46          You can always start afresh, um, because of the quality of these staff. But guess what, it's not so captivated. Also blindly in love that he doesn't know what is in that voice. What constitutes that for us or what gives the voice is magical power. So this is actually a surprisingly, uh, cleared I evaluation of basis, voice from gas vapor. The voice is for money. He said like, that was it. I never understood before. It was full of money. That was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell. And then the jingle of it, the symbol song of it, hi in a white powers, the king's daughter, the so usually people who are madly in love and not so great and analyzing the nature of the object that they have in a kind of surprising move, gasping actually is very analytical here and completely right. Um, that, that really is the power of the easy.

Speaker 1:          33:01          That in some sense she used to go and go in a very literal sense that it is to go, that makes for that Goldman's of the say, um, that, uh, that's really what creates her, that gives her initial, uh, magic over a gas bay when he was just a poor young boy. Um, and that's what makes of continue magic of they say that yes, this is an Asian miracle, um, as, um, as as Fitzgerald assess and, um, about jazz. Um, but it is an Asian miracle, um, underwritten by two miracle creating power of gold. Um, this is really what the novel is about is um, this, this magic in as well. Um, but it's coming from a basically an inanimate nonhuman source. Um, and I'm a human being can quite often be the creation of that miracle working substance goal. Um, so, um, so far we've seen the two of them, uh, being completely catch captivated by, by this, his voice.

Speaker 1:          34:13          Um, but nick and gas may also have something else in common as well. Um, and in that, even though sung is what keeps them going for a good part of the novel, um, Ashley at some point, Sam is also extinguish for them. So let's look at the mode by which song is being extinguished for each of them. Um, and not surprisingly, those come at the end of the novel because when sound and sustain, which that's also a signal that novel was coming to an end. So here is um, nick actually watching Tom and daisy after the accident when Tom Daisy back in the house, um, and nick is outside and so he's watching the two of them and all I can see is this visual tableau of Tom and they see it but he can hear what they're saying. Um, and I think we can really actually get them more dramatic moment when you can only see but not here they say.

Speaker 1:          35:09          And Tom was sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table with a plate of coal fried chicken between them and two bottles of our, he was talking intently across the table at her and his earnestness, his hand had fallen upon and covered her own once in awhile. She looked up at him and nodded in agreement there weren't happy and neither of them had touched the chicken, all the gale. And yet they weren't unhappy either. There was an unmistakable heir of national intimacy about the picture and anybody with us then that they were conspiring together. So this absolutely is the happy ending and heavy quotation marks, uh, for daisy and Tom, the reconstitution of that marriage, um, that had come under so much threat from both sides, modal and Gatsby. And this is another way in which mother and Gatsby, um, uh, linked together. They're both people are coming from a different social circle, um, trying to destroy that marriage.

Speaker 1:          36:22          Um, they are not successful. The marriage survives. Um, and this is the comedy. This is the happy ending for Tom and daisy and the nature of that comedy. And obviously I'll be, and ironic here, the nature of the comedy, um, is that, uh, it's just the two of them. So, you know, really the marriages between the two of them are even her cousin can only watch, uh, but cannot actually here what has been said between the two of them. Um, so this is, um, a happy moment for Tom and daisy that for NEC has to the experience as silence, uh, from the part of Basie and from Tom. He so used to hearing her voice in this one, um, instant. He is not hearing those always alarmed. That's because she's talking to Thomas was not talking to nick. So, um, let's look at a comparable, a symmetrical moment of sound being extinguished, uh, by gas.

Speaker 1:          37:25          This is a truly unforgettable moment. And uh, once again, the, the other objects that uh, within, um, all the artists that are important in the first part of the great Gatsby actually come back and play a very important one. So the snow, the establishing of staff for gas and towards the end of the great Gatsby actually comes by way of telephone. Um, nothing coming through to him from the telephone. He was waiting for obviously for the coffin. Daisy, no telephone message arrived, but the Butler when without sleep and waited for it until four o'clock, until long after there was anyone to give it to. Evan came, I have an idea. The gas himself didn't believe it would come and perhaps that you no longer care if that was true. He must have felt that he had lost all warm, well paid, a high price for living too long with a single dream.

Speaker 1:          38:28          He must've looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves. And should I say a little road to has claim arose is, and how raw the soundbite was upon us. The ghastly created grass. Um, we see the fairy carefully plan transition from the silence of the telephone once again to us frequently visional tableau. Um, so this is exactly symmetrical to the seen, witnessed by nature, um, the suspension, uh, non appearance of sad, um, and then the domination of the visual field. And now finally, business or visual feel without some, it hasn't been the case before. It's been a visual field with Sam here is low. And when we get the visual feel without sa and all of a sudden it's a protest field, we don't tend to think of the rose cause a very core task thing. But when you're bad up close to the rose, when you're saying it and such, my new futures, the rose becomes a very grotesque, unbearable to look at really.

Speaker 1:          39:44          Um, and that's really what the world is for, for, for gasping at that point. So, um, right now we've, um, talk about the two of them. Um, Nate and gasp as if they were almost exactly of like, right. You know, they just seem, this is very strong symmetry between the two of them, but honestly this is really non exactly. I experienced those two characters either as we read the Great Gatsby, the two of them, and also exactly like that they are so that they are interchangeable. Um, so, um, I want now to start another, uh, train of thought that actually points to a difference. The train neck and gas bear, um, nick against bit, um, have, uh, very important common grog up to a certain point and then they dive for church after that, after the point. So as Trey's, the divergence between the, it turns out that Sung is extinguish, uh, for nec in Jude Romantic scenes, not hearing daisy talking to Tom.

Speaker 1:          40:48          That's one moment, but there's another one, not as dramatic, but equally consequential for him. Um, and actually it also comes by way of a phone conversation. So at least there's that cemetery between [inaudible] and gas. Me as well. Um, but here's a, they talking to John Baker. Suppose I don't go to Southampton and this is after they accident. Uh, so those, I don't go to Southampton and come into towns after afternoon. No I don't think this afternoon very well is impossible this afternoon. Various, we talk like that for awhile and then abruptly we weren't, sorry we weren't talking any longer. I didn't know of us hung up with the shop clip, but I know I didn't care. So here too is a phone conversation that simply turns into the kind of non conversation and then silence descending on the two of them. So it seems this thing obviously is very free, close to the silence or telephone for guests with, but there is a crucial difference.

Speaker 1:          42:04          Nick had conjecture earlier that gas began care if the phone call came or not. But that's obviously not true. How will he not care? It was devastating. It was devastating. But there was no phone call from, from, from, from, from daisy. But this is the moment when nick truly doesn't really care. And he doesn't care because of who he is. So now we've come to a very important providing of the ways between nick and Gatsby. Gatsby is someone who actually cares so much. There's almost as if there's no reason for them to live after that moment. Um, and so, you know, it's fitting that he should die right then and there. Um, the pilot was kind of reflecting his psychology, um, but make to someone who doesn't care and who survives in some sense because he doesn't care. So here's a moment to go back to, um, Sunday that Fitzgerald and Hemingway actually have in common.

Speaker 1:          43:07          We talked a lot about the logic of substitution and having weight and especially the [inaudible] horse being the substitute for the picador, uh, when a ball is charting. Um, so there's a very important, largely goes up to tuition in Hemingway. And it turns out that there's also a logic of substitution in the great Gatsby as well, is if only because the worst substitute is actually use by Fitzgerald, um, once again in seemingly with two of those contacts. So this is the family history of neck caraway. The actual founder of my life was my grandfather's brother who came here in 51 send a substitute to the civil war, has started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today. Okay. This entire passage, when we first read it seems to nothing to do with the rest of the novel. You know, why would we care whether or not back one generation and now even his grandfather.

Speaker 1:          44:18          But it's when his uncle great uncle, um, uh, send a substitute, didn't fight. So this actually has a lot in common with the Hemingway story. This is some one who doesn't fight his own battles and as a substitute to fight for him and to suffer with him in the civil war. Um, and um, and then as a consequence of surviving because of not having died in, so while being able to found a very successful hardware business. So all these details about Nick's family history at the moment when it appears very early com, first opening pages of the Great Gatsby, um, seems simply just to stand there and to be doing nothing. And it's only in hindsight that, um, we can imbue meaning. We can retrospectively impute and meaning to our original seemingly gratuitous detail. Um, and it really has to do with the vital difference between Gas Bay and Nick.

Speaker 1:          45:21          And here is this moment when just before, uh, gas phase captivated by and pieces was again, this is the moment of this illusion but also we illusion, um, than, than it gives no listening and gasping. Uh, there must have been [inaudible] even that afternoon when there is a, is a Moo Shu sure of his dreams, not through home, fall through because of the colossal vitality, obviously illusion. It had gone beyond the, beyond. Everything hits from ind himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge with American store up in this ghostly hot. So this is really why gas bay is what he is, is that he has this enormous storage capacity in his goes late, hard and it was store on daisy will be stored there forever.

Speaker 1:          46:30          It almost doesn't matter who, who she is, what she really turns out to be. And what he finds, what he realized, we finally realized is what she is. It almost doesn't matter. It has no relation to reality at all off because it is strictly a dream about days, a bad gas, the histo in his own heart and mind. So the colossal vitality of illusion in Dallas. What death is about daisy and gas base. Oh mine. And what enables gas bay today deathless to some extent as well in spite of his physical biological that um, with nick is the other way around. So just want to read you, um, why he doesn't care. Um, and why it turns out that his family business is the, is the hardware business. Um, it is someone who can never be hurt by anything that happens. Uh, 10 [inaudible] was [inaudible] is honors.

Speaker 1:          47:29          She wasn't able to enjoy being at a disadvantage and given this on willingness, I suppose she had begun dealing and subterfuges when she was very young and all that to keep that cool insulin smile, turn to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her heart Shaunti body. We have seen gas may and very analytical about these, right that she is, the voice is full of money and here is performing a comparable analytic operation on children Baker that she's just encapsulate as honest. You can bear to lose. She would do anything she can to and he is rape that rate about joining. And that's why, you know, the marriage is not going to take place. But one of that is not even that she's nice, such a great marriage companion. Um, it is that they really doesn't even care enough to be hurt by that realization.

Speaker 1:          48:33          Um, he is insulated by the emotional hardware that has been his family's business for these two generations. Um, and so that's why the family history is so important to nick and why he really needs a substitute, uh, because he is simply incapable of feeling the kind of apps to see that gaspy is capable of feeling, nor is he capable of feeling the devastation that as beer is capable of feeling. Those two go ahead and hand. You get ecstasy, you get those Asian, um, and nick is not capable of either. Um, and that's why he's such a good, such good friends with, with Guzman was always standing by gasping because he really needs that in direct experience of what it feels to be in the gas space mind. And to have that ghostly hard with his mere was storage capacity. Um, so anyway, um, this is, um, um, of kind of Fitzgerald's way of encouraging us to think about different constellations, right? Different configuration, different constellations of characters, um, and nick and Gatsby and not the most obvious couple. Uh, but it turns out that actually the whole story of the great Gatsby can be taught by looking at this nontraditional couple. Uh, and I'll encourage you in session two. Think of other nontraditional couples as well, and we'll turn to a fist to Faulkner. That's weak.
