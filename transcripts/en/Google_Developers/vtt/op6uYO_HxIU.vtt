ISAAC COHEN: OK, awesome.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.250
So first off, thanks so much to
everybody who's put on tonight.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.000
It's been awesome.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.590
The DJ's killing it.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.235
Like, everybody googled--
these places are amazing.

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:21.610
If you haven't already, I
recommend you go try the bidet,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.700
because those
things are so crazy.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.360
Oh, my god.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.943
Life changer.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.460
Too much, yeah.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.860
OK, so I think Elizabeth
mentioned a few things

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.280
at the beginning
about what I do.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.450
I'm Isaac.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.140
I work as an experience
engineer at Leap Motion.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.530
And so what that means
to me is somewhere

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.530
between evangelicist and
reckless creator, or something

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.030
like that.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.630
Because what I do
is not so much try

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.840
to tell people that
our technology is cool,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.200
but just be so in love with it
that I can't help but share it.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.120
I feel really bad
for other people

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.720
who are evangelicists and have
to talk about a technology

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.340
that they don't
really care about,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.560
because for me
it's actually crazy

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.864
how much I love what I do.

00:01:22.864 --> 00:01:25.030
I'm trying something a bit
different with this talk,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.150
and actually wrote a speech
instead of just winging it,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.010
so I hope it still sounds OK.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.520
But if it really fails, then
I'll just make something up.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.060
OK.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.740
Oh, the lights.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.140
Perfect.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.640
OK.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.580
So I'm Isaac, and I'm
an experience engineer

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.730
at Leap Motion.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.430
I work exploring the newly
discovered relationship

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.750
with our hands.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.450
I'm intensely interested in
communing with digital nature.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.169
And the tools that I use
are three.js, Web Audio API,

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.230
and most of all, Leap Motion.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.700
Most of what I've
done can be found

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.690
at cabbibo.com, where
I've been working

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.270
on constructing my own
personal ice kingdom.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.230
Unlike our previous speakers,
I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.210
When they started talking
about state machines,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.400
I was totally lost,
and my understanding

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.310
of equivalence rigorously
stops at two equal signs.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.205
Don't worry, though.

00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:37.580
There's a reason you've been
asked to sit here and listen

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.510
to me for the next 30 minutes.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.840
It's because I'm addicted.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.390
To coffee.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.450
I love coffee.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.080
Every day, it's the first
thing that I consume,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.730
and many days it's the last.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.780
I don't consume it because
it's the hardest drug I use.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.520
I don't consume it
because it makes

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.120
me feel like a
mental triathlete.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.020
And I don't even
consume it because it

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.100
tastes like the delectable
blood of an angel.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.250
No, I love coffee
because I love milk.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.110
I also cannot pronounce my I's,
so it might sound a lot like

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.860
"melk."

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.990
I love that milk is a different
consistency than coffee.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.440
I love that is differently
colored than coffee.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.250
And I love that when I
delicately combine the two,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.630
it creates the most beautiful
pattern I have ever seen.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.900
It's actually to the
point of obsession.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.660
I never get hot coffee.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.920
It makes the milk
dissipate too quickly,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.780
and isn't as likely to
come in a clear glass.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.670
Regular iced coffee
isn't even enough.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.020
I need cold-brewed,
condensed, New Orleans

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.040
ice-styled iced coffee.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.770
Only its viscosity
will satiate me.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.440
At the coffee shop I go to,
they make sure they never

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.240
put the milk in
themselves, and always

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.250
give me the container
to pour it drop by drop.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.180
People can't tell if
I'm super-conscious

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.850
of my milk consumption,
or just straight-up weird.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.070
The latter is obviously
the true statement,

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.520
but it's mostly just
because I can't get over

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.250
the mystical nature of chaos.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.380
It's kind of funny how this
turbulence brings me peace.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.750
It's such a lonely
joy, after all.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.210
Its haunting dance
into nothingness

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.190
is somehow melancholy
in my mind.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.650
I think a bit could be
because, to me, it's

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.750
a firm reminder of the
unshakable arrow of time,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.810
or vacuum of space, which
are in many ways terrifying.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.330
But it's just so damn beautiful
that it can do nothing

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.700
but calm me.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.670
Maybe it's because I can't
unmix the milk and coffee.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.160
Maybe it's because when
I mix the two today,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.030
they will look
completely different

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.470
than they do tomorrow.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.330
That one magical tendril that
I witnessed on the first drop

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.500
might be replaced with a
dendrite appearing only moments

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.400
before the completion
of the sepia solution.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.360
Maybe it's because any other
individual touching the glass

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.780
will create a totally
different pattern.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.310
They will never see the
same turbulence that I do.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.750
Maybe it's because each
and every experience

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.070
is only a single moment
and a single branch

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.870
of infinite possibilities,
unique and miraculous as it is.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.920
Or maybe it's just the
fact that after it's mixed,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.290
I get to take that
first sweet sip,

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.030
and feel the delicious
nectar of caffeine

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.005
flowing through my
drug-addled veins.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.250
I hope it's the
turbulence, though.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.070
This would be a much
more interesting talk

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.240
if it wasn't predicated on
a deep, physical addiction.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.750
Either way, that moment
when I watch the milk mix,

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.820
I find myself in a happy place.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.360
For that moment, rent
is not important.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.940
That giant "Keep Calm
and Carry On" poster

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.210
that is now the centerpiece
of our living room

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.970
doesn't bother me so much.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.841
And I forget how late I am
to my 9 o'clock stand up.

00:06:04.841 --> 00:06:07.750
I find the turbulence
in that cup beautiful,

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.820
and that beauty makes me happy.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.070
Not in an urgent way,
in an important way.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.340
I want that peace all the time.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.120
I want to go to my happy
place 10, 11, 12 times a day.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.710
And I've tried doing
that with coffee before.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.570
It was a mistake.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.710
Luckily, as artists--
as I believe

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.160
each and every one of us are--
we can create that happy place,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.010
and we can go to it
any time we want.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.460
As magicians, every
time a silly client

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.210
tells us to use lime green
to make the text pop more,

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.230
we can just load up a web
page, and experience peace.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.840
Experience turbulence.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.810
Here's the thing about
turbulence, though.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.040
To get the detail
you see in coffee,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.780
you need infinite
computing power.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.000
To get each precise flume
and dexterous wrinkle,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.460
you need to get all the
way to the atomic level.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.790
We can get close, but
we can't be exact.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.870
Sure, you have scientists
doing brilliant work

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.060
on subjects like
Rayleigh-Benard convection,

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.830
but even in their brilliance,
they fall well short

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.030
of exact replication.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.240
The butterfly
effect, as we've all

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.200
learned from the brilliant
scientist Ashton Kutcher,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.205
is quite a powerful one indeed.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.510
And he just looks so
good in that picture.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.220
Floating point error
is painfully inaccurate

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.610
when compared with nature's
uncertainty, Planck's length.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.970
In the end, if I
believe that turbulence

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.680
is the most
beautiful art, nature

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.570
is the most beautiful artist.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.580
It can not only
create turbulence,

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.800
but the snow-dappled mountains,
the powerful rushing rivers,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.950
and every
heart-wrenching sunset.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.320
Nature is awesome.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.340
Nature is so awesome, in
fact, that I've seriously

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.570
considered giving up computers
to become a gardener.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.560
They are the
artists, in my mind,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.520
who have chosen
the truest medium.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.650
Anyone who has spent
time in the bonsai garden

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.190
over by Lake Merritt
will certainly agree.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.520
The twists are more elegant
than any Bezier curve could

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.910
hope to convey, and the sheer
detail of the turtled bark

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.320
makes even the most
processor-intensive physics

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.169
simulation look like
a crayon drawing.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.669
Any one of us could
spend our entire life

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.919
trying to create
that turtled bark

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.330
and still fall dramatically
short of our goal.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.990
Hell, all of us in
this room together

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.440
could combine our superpowers
and attempt to conjure a tree,

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.055
and nature's shaders would
triumph without competition.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.660
If we were physical
artists, on the other hand,

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.470
we could use the physical
nature of our work

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.210
in order to introduce some
of the beauty of chaos.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.640
Back before I understood
computers gave you superpowers,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.080
I used to just spray
paint on vegetable oil,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.220
splatter it on a canvas,
and call that texture art.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.580
And it was, in many ways,
more than what I create now.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.140
At an even higher
level, I tried to sample

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.740
the texture of an elephant's
hide or a toad's skin.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.846
Sampling nature in this time
was many times beautiful.

00:09:33.846 --> 00:09:37.660
It felt profound to watch
the flow of the Voronoi

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:42.430
cells of a dragonfly's wing
slowly unfurl into existence

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.950
as I painstakingly
etched them into metal.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.130
But even this was a step
away from the original.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.140
Even this was a simulacra.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.900
The further away I got from
milk mixing with coffee,

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:02.660
the more I gave me creative
power, and nature, less.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.460
By doing this, I had to exert
my own will upon the art

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.150
that I was treating,
and that meant

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.260
that nature was doing less
work, and I was doing more.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.040
Since I'm lazy, and
since we've established

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.670
that nature is a much
better artist than I am,

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.090
creating in this
way is ridiculous.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.100
I was trying to say the
thing that I could both posit

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.830
and execute was better
than a trillion years

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:31.450
of artistic honing,
generations upon generations

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:35.535
of evolutionary pruning, a
masterpiece older than time

00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:36.035
itself.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.870
The closest I could get was
mimicry, or possibly borrowing.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.120
I could not understand how
the paint mixed with the oil,

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.630
but I could see that when
I haphazardly threw them

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:54.760
on the canvas, it created
something that felt important.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.940
I could not make
the elephant itself,

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.190
but I could trace a
picture of its skin,

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.740
taking from nature what I
could not create myself.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.540
In this way, to be good
artists, to be good creators,

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.230
we do not need to
be good makers.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:14.260
Rather, we need to
be good thieves.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.750
The Voronoi cells, the
elephant's texture,

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.420
and the swirling paint
mixture were, after all,

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.040
the creation of nature.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.530
And for me to harness it
in my work and call it

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:27.840
my own was to steal it
from the world itself.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.070
This may seem like
a cardinal crime,

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.500
but as we've established,
anything less is preposterous.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.930
What we do is another
step away from nature.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.530
Typically, when
creating a program,

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.490
the functions we
create and the tasks we

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.950
accomplish have nothing to do
with the logarithmic structure

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.390
of fern, or the Fibonacci
arrangement of flower petals.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.930
It's all about
paragraph tags and hrefs

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.180
and target equals
underscore blank.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.520
We are the ones that place
these tags on the page.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.610
We are the ones who create
functions and methods, objects

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.050
that use objects,
and as we build up

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.210
this shoddy tower
of Babel, we tend

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.980
to forget how much more complex
the system of an ecosystem is,

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.600
and how much less
energy it would

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.000
take to destroy our work
than that of nature.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.280
Even when we create
recursive function,

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.040
and use math as the
language of nature,

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.850
adding one more
layer of complexity

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.525
can easily crash our
computer, limiting our detail

00:12:28.525 --> 00:12:31.700
to quite childish standards.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.770
Let's not even begin
to talk about the fact

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.610
that we are limited to
two-dimensional space,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.580
and that no matter how
many DPI your screen

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.920
is, it still crude compared to
even the smallest grain of sand

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.750
under the examination
of our retinas.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:50.810
In this way, our medium is
quite pathetic by any measure

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.970
of detail.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.750
Even if we are to sample nature
as a background or a texture,

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.675
we are limited by pixels,
memory, and rendering power.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.520
Instead of the rugged
shape of an elephant's ear,

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.660
we have to make
spheres and cubes,

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.860
and make sure that the
subdivisions are only

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.420
of a certain amount,
otherwise our rendering time

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:18.060
will drop beneath the already
pathetic 60 frames a second.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.510
Even AlteredQualia's and
Mr.doob's bump-mapped face is

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.700
dramatically less detail
than anybody in the crowd's.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.690
This is not to say it
is any less amazing.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:34.740
I think all of you can agree
that is actually absurd.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.670
It is just to say that whenever
we do anything in our medium,

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.560
we will fall short.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.560
When we try to mimic movement,
when we try to create geometry,

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:53.510
and most of all, when we
try to imitate turbulence.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.530
I hope this is disheartening.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.190
It means that we have
a long way to go.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.190
Our struggle may
not be comfortable,

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.830
but if we can somehow emerge
victorious, what a victory

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.080
it will be.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.990
Our medium is young.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.444
But if we can help it grow,
and if we can use it to create,

00:14:11.444 --> 00:14:12.860
it means that we
have accomplished

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.140
something beautiful.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.680
And that accomplishment
should make us happy.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.630
As well, there
are certain things

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.940
that are part of our
medium that no other medium

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.570
can claim to possess.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.550
There are certain
parts of our medium

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.730
that give us a fighting chance.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:35.610
First off, in our medium,
stealing is in most cases

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.270
not destructive.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:39.610
Because replication
comes for free,

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.970
sharing and utilizing
others' code

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.260
is widely accepted and expected.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:49.130
Coding is just socially
acceptable thievery.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.510
This is not to say should go
out willy nilly and jack IP,

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.970
just that sharing is caring.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.790
You can see communities
arise from this sharing,

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.830
and it makes everyone
involved more mighty.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:07.700
The best example of this
that I know is three.js.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.350
Because of one man,
Mr.doob's, fervent dedication

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.890
to creating a
useful library, many

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.560
other of the power players
of the WebGL community

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.180
have joined in in making a tool
that lets even someone like me,

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:24.450
who has no idea what they're
doing, create something.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.410
It's more than
just that, though.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.850
Others have let Mr.doob
call their work his own.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:36.420
In this way, AlteredQualia,
bhouston, zz85, gero3,

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.410
WestLangley, and
many, many others

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:43.820
have added to the community
with selfless dedication.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.980
With each additional commit
comes more complexity,

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.665
more substance, and
more code to steal.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.040
It may be difficult to
steal directly from nature,

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.100
but in this way we can create
complex enough networks

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.010
of thievery that
the stealing itself

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.980
becomes its own organic being.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.750
For the demo that
I will show you,

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.140
I've stolen so much
work from so many people

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.790
that there's no
way that I can have

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:13.550
claimed to create it myself.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:17.190
I've only selected a
mix of others' works,

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.870
and put it together in a way
that I've not seen before.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.500
All work we do is not our own.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.520
It is that of our community.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.540
Even in the unlikely chance
that you've built something

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.800
using no libraries, the
work that the V8 engine does

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.260
in order to compile your
code, and even more,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.200
the work that Intel or NVIDIA
has done in order to render

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.930
your program, trumps
any contribution

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:42.850
that you could make
to the overall success

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.940
of your application.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.790
Any time you think you have
made something, you are wrong.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.950
You have channelled
organic power

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.730
of communities,
corporations, and people

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.520
in order to manifest a
creation of humanity.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.990
I can't explain exactly
why, but the miracle

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.130
of these different
components coming together

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.980
every time I refresh
my browser makes

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:14.230
me think of the mixing of milk
in coffee that I love so much.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:17.780
Suddenly, my messy room,
the deadlines coming up,

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:21.140
the fact that rent
was due two days ago

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.920
doesn't matter so much, and I
start drifting in mental space,

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.510
marveling at the smallness
of my own accomplishment

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:33.910
as I consider how
magnificent our species is.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.790
I forget the urgent and
remember the important.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.940
It doesn't just stop at the
channelling of humans, though.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.080
Our medium has something
else that is spectacular.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.860
Variables.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.390
Although I will never be
able to make a face that

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.990
is better than the one
that nature can make,

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.380
there's something
else magical I can do.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.770
I can change the skin color.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.850
I can even change the
color of the lights that

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.890
shine upon the skin.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:08.140
And I get to do all of this
with a single keystroke.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.530
In this way, I can
create an object

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:15.690
that maybe has less detail, but
has more self freedom than that

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.960
which is created by nature.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.910
Although this goes a bit against
letting nature do the work,

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.540
there's something
special about variables.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.060
They can be controlled
by another manifestation

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.480
of nature-- data.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.530
In my mind, data is
our most fierce weapon

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.860
in the creation of
that which is organic.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.490
Because it is so
expansive, it allows

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.750
us to pass through one
piece of nature to another.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.770
Although this
manifestation usually tends

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.170
to be a one to one
correlation-- say,

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.590
placing population
data on a globe--

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.830
there's nothing to say
that we can't recklessly

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.010
link two uncorrelated
phenomenon.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.160
imagine a faces whose
features are distorted

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.900
by the number of endangered
animals per geographic unit.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.920
I'm sorry I didn't
have time to make this,

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:05.500
but I hope that you can concede
it is at least possible.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.100
In this way, we
can begin to create

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.360
works which utilize
data to create

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.910
an interface between the
natural world and arts.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.580
By figuring out ways
to get real-life data,

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.670
we get to make real-life
applications-- real-life art.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:27.000
There are so many sources
of real-life data.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.900
To me, there's
obviously infinite,

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.470
but there are two that are the
most important-- what I hear,

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.050
and what I see.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.300
I'm not yet able to rig my eyes
and ears up to a Thunderbolt

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.470
cable, but in the
meantime, there

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:46.320
are two ways that I can begin
to access these senses-- the Web

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.640
Audio API and Leap Motion.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.630
The Web Audio API is
great, because any time

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.760
I want to link audio frequencies
to parts of an application,

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.160
all I need to do is create a
stream, create an analyzer,

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.910
and call an analyze
function on the update loop.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:15.340
That's all it takes to get
access to natural data.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.880
The Leap Motion is great
for a similar reason.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.480
All I need to do is create
a controller, connect it,

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.440
and now I have access to
something that I can see,

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.410
something as fluid and
authentic as the movement

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.200
of my own hands.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.570
Because of this
simple access to data,

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.880
I get to start doing
strange things with code.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.220
I get to start saying,
OK, make a face,

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:42.240
but also deform it based
on the sound of my voice.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.990
Oh, and also, so that
when I see my hand turn,

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.840
make the colors change.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.210
Suddenly, something
that I've stolen

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:55.050
comes to life by funnelling
data from one place to another.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.910
Although I tend to
fetishize the aesthetic,

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:04.680
this fluid data is more
than just a visual nicety.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.370
I've seen interfaces that
feel more playful and organic

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.710
than any I'd experienced
pre-Leap Motion and pre-Web

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.030
Audio API.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:17.780
I've seen things created that
were never before possible.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:23.034
I myself learned to 3D model
and made a mug overnight.

00:21:23.034 --> 00:21:26.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.180
AUDIENCE: Lovely.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.138
ISAAC COHEN: Thank you.

00:21:30.727 --> 00:21:31.560
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

00:21:35.781 --> 00:21:40.160
It's because all I had to do
was reach my hand in the space

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.190
and use the senses
that I love so much.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.520
Because many minds more
brilliant than mine defined

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.930
a way to mine the data, I get
to lovingly thieve their work

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:55.130
through robust and simple APIs.

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:57.750
They make the data
easy to thieve,

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:03.540
and as creators, that is the
kindest thing we could ask for.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.080
Additionally, because of
their nuanced connection

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.200
with natural data, programming
in with the Web Audio API

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.520
and Leap Motion becomes a
pleasure rather than a task.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.630
Although mimicking the
binary click of a mouse

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.540
may be less than ideal,
new interfaces that deal

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.350
with flow and movement,
and the full spectrum

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.840
of human capability
become possible.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.540
Because I can make frequency of
my voice control scroll rate,

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:33.080
or use the position of my hand
to control the camera movement,

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.410
I can readily change one
piece of data to another.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:43.440
And this flow, in my mind,
is miraculous thievery.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.400
It is because in our
medium, there are no units.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.550
Creating a 100
foot sculpture only

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.120
means multiplying scale by 100.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.990
Linking gravitational potential
to note frequency only

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:59.350
costs a single line of code.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.610
If I want to change
from XYZ to RGB,

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:06.190
there's absolutely
nothing stopping me.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:11.552
And that is where
WebGL steps in.

00:23:11.552 --> 00:23:13.010
For a meet-up on
WebGL, I think you

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.980
might think I would mention
the technology earlier

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.480
than two-thirds of the
way into the speech,

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.340
but I hope that everything
up to this point

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.420
will still apply
to your creation,

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.080
even if you never
end up using WebGL.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.640
That being said, you
should use WebGL.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.180
You should use it because
3D is ridiculously awesome.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.420
You should use it because you
can make an entire presentation

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.090
in it, and it doesn't
take that long.

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:41.579
But the biggest reason, to
me, that you should use it

00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:42.370
is because shaders.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.220
Also, it did take that long.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.950
Now I only learned that shaders
are the truth and the light

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.270
about two months ago, so
please take the following

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.470
with a grain of salt.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.790
I'm feverishly studying how
they work and what they can do,

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:01.920
but that being said, it's
only been two months.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.410
This should give
you a lot of hope,

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.830
though, because if
I can learn anything

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:09.840
about shaders in two months,
it means you can, too.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.650
I'll try to talk
about this a bit.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.690
It's a bit too much
to talk about quickly,

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.520
but I'll give you
resources, too.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:23.250
In the end, WebGL shaders
do two things-- XYZ and RGB.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.480
XYZ is referring to a
vertex shader, which

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.740
positions every single vertex
in a geometry, which you can see

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:32.900
here as a cube, and RGB
refers to a fragment shader,

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.160
which colors every
pixel in that object.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.460
Together, the two can
deform and color any shape

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:46.000
until it looks nothing
like the original.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.350
We could do a full speech just
about deforming and coloring

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.940
a cube in interesting,
ways and I'm

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.060
sure that if you
searched on the internet,

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.670
you could find
exactly that speech.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:00.780
But we've got to remember what
we're here for is the coffee.

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:08.570
To get there, we need
to do a few tricks.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:11.780
Because we can sample
textures into vertex shaders,

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:15.600
we can easily
exchange XYZ with RGB,

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.330
basically placing
particles based

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.887
on the RGB value of a texture.

00:25:20.887 --> 00:25:22.970
Now, I'm going to start
with just a picture, where

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.640
we take the RGB
values of the picture

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.100
and place them around based
on the value of those three

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:30.960
objects.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:39.040
So R becomes X, G becomes
Y, and B becomes Z.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.620
Here we can see the pixels
and colors turn to positions,

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:47.360
and see that although
there are these deep reds,

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:53.530
yellows actually have value
that contains R, G, and B.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:56.664
So it reveals something
fundamental about this picture

00:25:56.664 --> 00:25:58.080
that we may have
not known before.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:06.080
We can take this a step
further and sample a texture

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.220
that we've created with
the fragment shader.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.730
In this way, we can color
each texture of a shader,

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.720
as we've done randomly in
the middle, giving values

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.790
from negative one to
one for R, G, and B,

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:23.500
and then placing each
particle as it corresponds

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.230
to its pixel in
three-dimensional space.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:33.500
Then, by chaining together
vertex and fragment shaders,

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.560
we can create one
fragment shader that

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.570
talks about position,
and one fragment

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.660
shader that talks
about velocity.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.250
Once we link all
this through, we

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:47.930
can do something spectacular-- a
physics simulator done entirely

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:50.470
on the GPU.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:54.030
What is so special about this
is that all the calculations

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:55.570
happen in parallel.

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:59.340
In this gravity demo,
every single particle

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.860
is in an acting
gravitational force

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.580
on every single other particle.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.970
We're talking
millions and millions

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:08.860
of calculations every frame.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.310
We're talking, instead
of hundreds of particles,

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.560
you have thousands,
even millions.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.470
Now, I should have spent
the entire speech trying

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.010
to explain this, but
there are already

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.430
a few brilliant examples
that you could look at.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.800
Mr.doob's sporel demo, which
was part of the Google Christmas

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.750
experience, is a great
example, and he's

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.380
released all of his code.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:37.450
Zz85's sparks.js is
absolutely sublime.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:41.660
Zz85 also does a flocking
demo in the three.js examples,

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.930
so check that out.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:47.230
And as well, Soulwire's
straight WebGL GPU particles.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:49.690
The tasks that they are
doing are all different,

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:51.790
but if you closely
examine them all,

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.870
you will learn
dramatically more about GPU

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:58.660
then I can hope to
explain in a short time.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:02.670
However, with their knowledge
aptly and lovingly stolen,

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.690
I can move on to the
Holy Grail, turbulence.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:13.760
To make my turbulence, I use
something called curl noise.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.950
It is not actually
fluid dynamics,

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:18.460
and I've been told
by few math PhDs

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.270
that it's a sin to
even call it mimicry.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.050
It's smoke and mirrors.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:25.850
But then again,
we are magicians.

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:28.910
Now the most beautiful example
I've ever seen of curl noise

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:31.060
was from the astute
creator Eddie Lee

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:35.890
in his demo Artifacts,
as you can see here.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:37.660
Eddie Lee's is a
straight-up mastermind,

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.130
and if you've ever
played Kyoto or Lotus,

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.195
I'm sure that you
will understand why.

00:28:42.195 --> 00:28:45.230
He elegantly navigates the
issues I've discussed with

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:49.060
digital creation, both by
creating authentically organic

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:54.270
shaders, or by buying
wholeheartedly into the fact

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:56.430
that his creation
cannot be natural,

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:57.855
and making it playfully simple.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.340
Additionally, he's
awesome because he

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.470
let me steal his code.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:10.580
He showed me how to mimic
my turbulence, my happiness.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.470
I didn't just steal
code from him,

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:17.460
he gave it to me-- free of
charge and out of kindness.

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:20.510
With this code in hand,
I was off to the races.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.080
After hectically slapping
together shader code

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.710
into zz85's GPU
particle simulator,

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:29.750
I refreshed my page--
and nothing happened.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.760
I did it again,
and again nothing.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.600
After multiple more
hours of frustration

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.470
that can only be
known by someone who's

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:41.190
tripped on a shoelace moments
before finishing a marathon,

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:45.250
I finally asked one of my other
idols, Reza Ali, for help.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.600
Being yet another brilliant
mind and another gracious soul,

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.740
Reza sent over his
curl noise, code

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.050
which made me realize that
I'd used an equal sign instead

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:55.860
of a plus equal
sign for the most

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.325
vital part of the equation.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:06.820
I told you, I know
nothing about equalities.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:10.730
But with that bug fixed, I
crossed my fingers, refreshed

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:14.735
my browser, and there it was.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:21.600
My very first turbulent system.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:26.270
And by mine, I mean Mr.doob,
AlteredQualia, zz85, Eddie Lee,

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:29.730
Reza Ali, and probably many of
the people sitting in this room

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.660
right now.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.120
Sure, it was no milk in coffee.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.030
And I know now that using
more optimized code,

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.370
I could get 10 times
more particles.

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:44.620
But it was a start, and
that alone made me happy.

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.550
I really think that this
could have been enough for me.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.885
If I committed my changes,
shut down my computer,

00:30:49.885 --> 00:30:53.670
and went to sleep, it would have
been more than enough creation

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:57.460
to gratify my gluttonous
desire for the important.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:03.930
But if I stopped, it would just
be a frail imitation of nature.

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:07.430
It would be dots algorithmically
moving around the screen.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:10.700
And as happy as I was with
those small white squares,

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:14.590
it is after this point
of initial implementation

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:18.340
that our medium begins to shine.

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.970
This piece of code is
in my engine forever.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:23.820
Now I get to play.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.330
Now I get to create
my happy place.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.280
Now I finally get to explore
in a way that was never

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.900
possible in the physical world.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.150
That sunset, though
heart-wrenching,

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:36.270
only happens once a day.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:39.560
It will never be the beautiful
turquoise and magentas

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.190
that I can so lucidly
imagine it to be.

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.970
Although I can watch the
glowing ball from far away,

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:51.040
I can never reach
out and touch it.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.360
Yes, we are stuck in simulation.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.880
We are perpetrators
of imitation.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:02.990
But in that imitation, in that
mimicry, comes a new truth.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:05.900
It is a hyper-reality we create.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.230
That sun can not
only set in the east,

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.640
but it sings to us
if we only will it.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.600
The stars are no longer
a diamond curtain,

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.950
but a playground.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:21.500
We can explore and experience
that which is not possible.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.810
Nature may be a
brilliant artist,

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:26.720
but if we choose to create
with its infinite power,

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:31.330
we have to take on the
shackles of physicality.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:35.530
Now, with WebGL, with access
directly to the senses,

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:38.870
we can begin to cast
those shackles off.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:43.530
I'm no longer limited
to my flesh self,

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:48.590
and I can finally come to
you as Cabbibo, the ice

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:52.430
mandala of the northern kingdom,
floating in the darkness.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.800
Nature may want to keep me
here on this earth, harnessed

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.940
by my decrepit human form,
but I refuse that requirement.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.150
I will create a
universe where I can

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.840
fly through the stars with
the flick of my wrist,

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:15.800
watch eons unfold with each
with each harmonious "ohm."

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:21.260
I will reject common sense to
make the impossible possible.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.475
I will create.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:34.470
I will leave you now with
one more of our creations.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:38.520
Please sit with me, and as
you watch its life unfold,

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:44.880
meditate on what is important
to you and what makes you happy.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.350
Think about what you will
do as a miraculous creator,

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:51.860
and how you can harness the
power of the entire human race

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.990
to manifest your creation.

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:59.340
As I fly you through our
slowly dissipating universe,

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:04.330
remember that although we will
always be painfully limited

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:08.310
as humans, we together
have made something

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:12.080
that allows us to
be so much more.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.690
Without further ado, I give
you "We Over" by Holy Other.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:37:57.390
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:58.502
ISAAC COHEN: Thank you.

00:37:58.502 --> 00:38:06.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.910
ISAAC COHEN: And
check these out, too.
