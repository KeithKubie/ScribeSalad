00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.630
 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.970
One thing that makes humans
unique in the animal kingdom

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.340
is our unparalleled use
of complex language.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.600
And it's a gene on chromosome 7,
known as FOXP2, that plays

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.800
a vital role in allowing
this to happen.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.860
 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.740
Humans have a characteristic
form of FOXP2 that evolved

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.420
around 200,000 years ago.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.350
And some people have speculated
that it's this

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.190
uniquely human version of the
gene that led to the evolution

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.480
of our complex language.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.820
Now, the case is almost
certainly more

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.380
complicated than that.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.730
But there's a similar form of
the gene that exists in

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.280
songbirds like this canary.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.370
Now, when the birds learn the
new song, well, the gene comes

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.620
into action.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:33.090
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.510
We clearly don't fully
understand the role of FOXP2

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.520
in humans or in other animals.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.980
But what we think at the moment
is that it plays an

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.620
important role in
neuroplasticity, and that's

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.350
the ability of the brain
to change over time.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.840
And it's neuroplasticity that
allow songbirds like the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.400
canary to learn such
impressive songs.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:34.945
