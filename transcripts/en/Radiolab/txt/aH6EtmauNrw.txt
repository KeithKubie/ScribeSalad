Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radiolab from W N y. S. E. N. P. Are you ready Robert? Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radiolab, the podcast, the podcast today on radio lab. We are the, well, I'd actually don't even know what we're doing. I know we're revisiting some old questions, but you've kept me in the dark. So what are we doing today on the podcast? Well today we're going to chicken with who? Who's here? Somebody who you might remember actually. Oh, Hi Robert. How are you doing? Can you just tell me who you are? Just say I'm Josh and where you are and what you do and style. I am Joshua Green. I am an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard University. And, and you may remember second grow and in the morality show. Sure. I mean Josh was the guy with the moral puzzles.

Speaker 1:          00:53          I study moral judgment and decision making. Are you going to get into the hole baby? Would you kill your baby question? Yes, exactly. Exactly. So for those of you who need to follow this in that earlier radio that we described, the last episode of the TV show Mash, it's wartime isn't any patrol coming down the road. You are hiding in the basement with some of your fellow villagers. Let's kill those lights. And the enemy soldiers are outside. They have orders to kill anyone that they find quiet. Nobody make a sound until the [inaudible]. So there you are here

Speaker 2:          01:26          huddled in the basement, all around your enemy troops and you're holding your baby in your arms, your baby with a cold, a bit of a sniffle, and you know that your baby could cost at any moment. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:43          they hear your baby, they're gonna find you and the baby and everyone else, and they're going to kill everybody. And the only way you can stop this from happening is cover the baby's mouth. But if you do that, the baby's going to smother and die. If you don't cover the baby's mouth, soldiers are going to find everybody and everybody's going to be killed, including you, including your baby, and you have the choice. Would you smother your own baby to save the village or would you like your baby cough? Knowing the consequences and, and, and, and, and, and it may clear for me why, where we're going with this, Robert, like, I don't know. You asked me a question at the time and how many people chose to kill their baby? About half. Wow. That's not bad. What do you mean slept? You're in favor of killing the baby.

Speaker 1:          02:35          Well, what would you do? Me, I would never, I would, I wouldn't even consider kill the baby. You would, the village will go on to have a hundred babies. Your babies. Just one. My baby is my world, my babies, my universe. So you're going to erase all those people based on your one child. First of all, the audience should know that [inaudible] not does not have a child of his own. Yes. Okay. Now, now we have the benefit of time passing. Yeah. Just out of sheer curiosity, now that you have a child and you've looked into that child's face over and over and over again, I'm just curious, would you, is there any other reason why you're doing no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm going to know you and that young people shouldn't worry, but just out of curiosity, what would you do? But I killed the baby when I your baby, not a baby. You are baby

Speaker 3:          03:27          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          03:29          Would you like to see a little picture of him? No, I don't want to see a photo. I know what a meal looks like for crying out loud. So just,

Speaker 4:          03:36          no, see, here's, I, I have thought about this actually because people send us emails about this for some reason. Um, um, I don't really know. I mean the thing is though, I mean now there's not just like an abstract baby, but it's my baby. Well that does change everything obviously. So I'm kind of in a place where I don't really know that frankly, don't know. Wait, let me just think about this. I Dunno. It's kind of an impossible question cause like in order to answer it truthfully, which is I would not kill my baby, I'd have to sacrifice a principle, which is like not as important to me as my baby. But almost

Speaker 1:          04:18          that principle being,

Speaker 4:          04:20          well it's sometimes you have to sacrifice something very dear for the greater good. I just think that's a really, I mean, not to get all communistic on you, but that's a really important idea to me.

Speaker 1:          04:31          And in this case, by the way, the, the calculus of what is about to happen, if the baby cost is really not known to you.

Speaker 4:          04:37          Well, I mean, if you, you know, if you're the philosopher king and you give me two options, one is to kill my baby, to save the village or to allow my baby to live, in which case everybody dies. If those were the only two options, then I still feel like you kind of have to kill the baby.

Speaker 1:          04:53          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          04:53          but I don't think I could do that. I don't think any father could do that. So th my sort of pathetic answer at this point is I can't kill my baby, but then I can't sacrifice the village. So I think I would just, um, like close my eyes and wish I was [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:09          where else?

Speaker 5:          05:11          So the idea is that, you know, when you think about this case, on the one hand you have an intuitive emotional response that says, no, this is terrible killing a baby or killing my own baby. Even worse, at the same time, a different system within your brain is saying, look, this is horrible as this is, this is a sensible thing to do. It's the only sensible thing to do because if you do nothing, everyone will die. Whereas if you kill the baby, then at least you and the other people can live. And uh, w what the evidence suggests is that these two competing moral perspectives are really grounded in different parts of the brain. The, and the competition is not been resolved.

Speaker 1:          05:42          That's where we were the last time. Right? Now I want to step forward for a second and think about it a little more deeply. All right. If our sense of right and wrong comes from like these competing brain systems. Let me revisit the question. Are Our brains built

Speaker 5:          05:58          to fever? Certain outcomes. Let's suppose that you are walking alongside a lake and you see a girl drowning right in front of you and she's screaming for help, but you're wearing a very expensive suit. Should you jump into the lake and saver? No, no, of course. Of course you should. Yes. You mean like the suit is the only thing that's preventing me from doing that? Yeah, but now suppose you're walking down past your mailbox and there's a letter in the mailbox, which is please give us $1,000 so we can help save girls on the other side of the globe. Girls, you'll never meet girls who screams. You'll never here, but there are girls in trouble on the other side of the world. Go help them. And so wait until the, the equivalence is that you jump into the lake. You say if the girl who's drowning one-on-one or you send the check and you save the girl who is in peril, a girl, not that girl, a girl somewhere on the other side of the globe.

Speaker 5:          06:51          So the question that go to Josh, if you didn't give the thousand dollars, would that make you a bad guy? Well, there is something funny about these cases, right? That, that most of us say that of course you have to rescue the drowning child, but you know, it's, you're not a saint if you don't give your money over to, to, to save the children on the other side of the world, but you're certainly not a terrible person or so it seems to us. And so, yes, there's this, there's this, uh, putting aside whether it's a good or bad, whether you're a good or bad person, how do you explain the difference? Well, I think it makes a lot of evolutionary sense. Uh, that is, you know, a lot of our social emotional responses are geared towards life in the kind of environment in which our ancestors evolved.

Speaker 5:          07:34          And it makes sense that we would have a moral buttons so to speak. They get pushed by the kinds of things that our ancestors might've encountered cause tens of thousands of years of evolution have have essentially been quietly tugging at your heart in both in those kinds of seats actually. Exactly. Where is the idea? The idea of spending a minimal amount of money to save the life of some stranger on the other side of the world that you've never, that you're never going to meet. Um, that's a totally new modern phenomenon. It's not something that our emotions are our prepared for. Well now doesn't that leave us in a funny place because I think it does. What happens if the most important questions that we face as a species or as a group involve thinking abstractly those problems, pollution, global warming and things like that. Those aren't really local problems.

Speaker 5:          08:24          They're global problems. Exactly. This is, I think that gets right at the heart of the matter and this is why I do this research. I think that the kind of thinking that we apply to those problems, what we call common sense is really hunter gatherer or common sense or at least a lot of it is. And uh, if we're going to face these big problems that were our minds were not designed by evolution to handle, then we have to learn to turn off parts of our brain that are getting in the way and turn on other parts that may seem like the wrong parts to be using. So he's saying that we should tamp down primitive

Speaker 4:          08:56          emotional instincts that are in our reptile brain. Let those instincts say, don't kill your baby like that stuff. And then we should, we should amp up somehow the, uh, the part of us that thinks more abstractly about the greater good and about people that aren't right in front of it.

Speaker 1:          09:12          Yeah. So, so if you're sitting there with a soda can in your hand and you think, oh, I guess I can just throw this on the street and you'll get clank, clank, clank of the clinic, your primitive parsing. Well, I can get away with that cause no one's seeing it. But of course the calculating part would say, well if we all do this then the world will be full of trash. And it's problems like that that in order to solve that, you have to think abstractly

Speaker 4:          09:32          why that's interesting. Because we might be, I mean, I think he might be wrong. I mean, cause we didn't countered this already. He's asking us to rely on a part of our brain that, you know, is not exactly Hercules'. Do you remember the thing we talked about in the, in the show is that Soren, was it the, the choice show, uh, with the Bobby Shiv. Can we get that audio and throw that into the mix?

Speaker 1:          09:54          I'm a Baba share. I'm a professor here at, uh, the Stanford Graduate School of Business in marketing. A lot of my research it has to do with the brain and tricking people. Oh yeah, absolutely. So Robert, I want to tell you about one particular experiment that he did. So the experiment is pretty straight forward. There's like this, you got a bunch of subjects together. He said, okay, I'm going to give you all a number, the number on a little card. You're going to read the number and I want you to commit that number to memory. Take as much time as you want to memorize the number, and then he says, you'll know going to walk to the next room and recalled the number and that's what subjects think test subjects think that they're going to be doing so they know they're going to be in one place. Getting a number of going into another place and reciting that number. That's right. That's all they know. That's all they know, but they don't know is that not everybody is getting the same kind of number. Some people get a seven digit numbers. Some people get a two digit number that I can do. By the way, I think I can do two digit.

Speaker 4:          10:46          No, I doubt it. All the subjects have to do is they've got to memorize a number of walk out of room one down the hall of room to then recite their number. Now just imagine you and me person with a two digit number in their head and was walking out of room one. Two is my number. I can definitely remember this down the hall, the same time someone with seven digits in their head and two eight, nine walks down the hall. Now here's where the trickery comes in as they're walking down the hall, mid memorizing. All of a sudden, excuse me, they pass a lady in the hallway and she's holding something up to you, but would you like a snack? Um, she says here, have it have a snack. Just as our, as our way of saying thanks for participating in this study. You can have one of two snacks. You choose between a big fat slice of chocolate cake or be a nice bowl of fruit salad. Meanwhile, they've both got these numbers still in their head. Now here's the weird thing. When they finally make their choice, what would you like? Some yummy cake or some healthy fruits and the people, this is crazy. The people with two digits in their head. You know, I love cake, but I think I'll take the fruit. Almost always choose

Speaker 1:          11:54          the fruit healthy. Whereas the people with seven digits in their head almost always choose the cake. You know the cake. I want the cake and we're talking by huge margins here. It was significant. I mean, this was like in some cases a 20, 25 30 point difference. The, the lesson we took from that, which is the lesson you are not telling me now, is that your rational system, the hope of humankind, part of your brain is very, very suggestible week and almost barely struggling to manage the situation. Give us something too much to do. And Oh man, it just, it each week cake.

Speaker 5:          12:32          I would take a very different lesson from that study. Imagine if you told those people who say, look, here's how your mind works. When you have to remember, remember a long number, it's going to clog up your memory and it's gonna make it harder for you to resist the temptation to have chocolate cake instead of fruit salad. Um, but I'm telling you this now, you're armed with the truth about how your own mind works. Here's a long number. Go right now. How many of those people are going to be able to resist the chocolate cake? I think a lot more of them are

Speaker 1:          13:00          right. Has anyone done that? Has anyone said, okay, I'm sending you down and that is going to be this siren seductive. Take handling a temptress and let's see if you can resist it. Has that ever been done?

Speaker 5:          13:10          It hasn't. I don't know if it's been done, but I'm willing to place bets on how that will turn out. That is that we can recognize the quirks and the flaws and the inconsistencies in our cognitive systems and do something better. That makes more sense.

Speaker 6:          13:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          13:24          does that, does that a, is this just blind optimism hiring or does he have evidence to support this?

Speaker 5:          13:30          Well, one thing that gives me hope is something called the Flynn effect, the Flynn effect. So the Flynn effect is something that was noticed by a philosopher now, political scientist named uh, Jim Flynn. I knew it was going to be Flynn. Yeah. Who is really surprising if his name was [inaudible]. That's right. Know that they, they, they, they line these things up so that they make sense of the Flynn effect, the Flynn effect. What Flint noticed is that over the course of the 20th century, IQ scores kept going up and up and up in the industrialized world. So much so that by his estimates, a person of average intelligence in 1900 would register somewhere near the line, uh, for mental retardation, by present standards. Um, how could this be same test by the way. So everything, I mean, that's why it's a bit complicated because the tests have changed and the norms have changed, but doing your best to control for all of that. By his estimates, we have gained about 30 IQ points as a society in the last hundred years, which is enormous. Now, there are a lot of people who would say, well, the IQ test really doesn't really tell you that we're getting smarter or really different Bot.

Speaker 1:          14:39          If you ask Josh, well, why would we be getting better at the IQ test? He says that in the last hundred years

Speaker 5:          14:46          people learn how to think abstractly,

Speaker 6:          14:51          crude oil,

Speaker 5:          14:52          palm dirty things that we take for granted. Like thinking about abstract things like a market where a market is not a particular place with fruit stands, but a more abstract space so to speak, in which goods and services are exchanged for money.

Speaker 7:          15:07          He's to fit these [inaudible] toe to bed, five to 10 Havi. I'll bet

Speaker 1:          15:15          things like that have become part of the our cognitive Boucher meaning, and I think this is how Josh would argue with these are deeply abstract occupations mean natural gas to try to figure out patterning and numbers and future values,

Speaker 5:          15:34          crude oil, natural gas, edit it. I think Josh [inaudible] it can change you. Cultural Evolution essentially has given us much higher iqs when it comes to thinking about a lot of things. Wow. So you're saying that we are learning to exercise our rational systems. It's not that we're growing any new brain cells, we're making a whole new set of connections. It's just that what we've got, we're just making more muscular. Exactly. It's like learning to play an instrument. Right? I mean, when you first start playing guitar, you're totally useless. It sounds like a dying animal, uh, end, but you know, give it a, give it a couple of years and it can sound great. And basically we're, that's a very specific sort of motor skill, right? But being better at abstraction and thinking about right and wrong in a new way. That seems, that seems what you're saying is kind of down.

Speaker 5:          16:22          Well, I mean, you think that you can exercise yourself into being a better man and a better woman and a better speaker. I think that's right. I think that we can learn to play our dorsolateral prefrontal cortices better. At the end of the day. You think that the pressure of dealing with these big abstract problems will eventually change our minds? Well, I hope so. I mean, the problem is that as a species we tend to learn from trial and error. Um, the problem with issues like nuclear proliferation and global warming is that we only have one earth and it are, what I hope is that if we have to learn the lesson from some kind of trial and error, the errors are not so big that we don't get another chance. But I also think that there's reason for optimism, or at least you hope think. Yeah. At least I hope you know. But I mean, I may just be because I'm an optimistic person. I mean, I might just sort of throw up my hands and say, forget it. I'll go do something else, enjoy my time before we kill ourselves. But, um, I think that, you know, I the, it makes sense. It's worth a shot to see if we can teach ourselves to live happily on a, on a, on a small planet.

Speaker 8:          17:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          17:27          I heard you. The teacher. Wow. Yeah. I'm pretty pretty. Pretty. Dantic Huh? Teach in the world. No, no. I kind of mean, I certainly think anyone normal but be rooting for you. Absolutely. Thanks. I appreciate that. There are a lot of abnormal people who root for me, but I hope [inaudible] Josh Green is an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard University written these ideas in an essay in a volume called what's next edited by Max Brockman and hey, did you, when you were talking with him, did you ask him about his babies? What would he kill his babies? You know, I should, I forgot any case. We should. We should wrap it. Yeah. He killed this baby cause the, the, we have to see our funding, right?
