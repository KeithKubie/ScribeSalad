00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.600
PROFESSOR: This is
Dr. MATLAB, lecture 3.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.690
If you're using MATLAB on the
command line for enough time,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.720
you realize that you really
want to save a bunch of commands

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.370
in a file and then execute
all those commands in one go.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.770
This helps you so that
if you have typos,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.010
you can correct the typos
without introducing new ones.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.160
It also allows you to
create large pieces of code

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.340
that call each other and really
have complicated projects.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.680
To see how this works,
we need an example.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.560
What we'll do is generate
the Fibonacci sequence.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.730
So in the Fibonacci sequence,
the first two terms are 1.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:01:03.030
And then each term is the sum
of the previous two, like that.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.239
Notice that this will
create a new term

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.704
in f that will be the
sum of the very last one

00:01:08.704 --> 00:01:09.870
plus the second-to-last one.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.520
Here it created 2,
the sum of 1 plus 1.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.380
If we run that
command again, it will

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.190
generate 3, and then 5, and
then 8, and then 13, et cetera.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.220
So now I want to take these
three important lines--

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.420
this one, this
one, and this one--

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.030
and create a file that
will do all of this

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.160
and put this line
inside a loop so that it

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.740
does that, say, 20 times.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.730
To do that, I open
the History browser.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.498
I want it to be docked.

00:01:53.498 --> 00:01:56.180
And it's docked.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.502
And here I find my commands
that I issued here.

00:02:00.502 --> 00:02:03.560
I'm going to select all of
them, the three commands,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.160
right click, and copy.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.710
So now I've copied
these three commands.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.645
Over here, I can
open a new script.

00:02:14.546 --> 00:02:16.940
The first thing I want to
do is get rid of this bar

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.240
because it uses up a
lot of important space.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.930
So now I have a bit
more space, and I

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.210
can close this command
history because I

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.770
have copied those commands.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.160
And now I'm going to paste.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.660
After I've pasted
this, of course,

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.950
I need to clean up a bit.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.370
So I'm going to add semi-colons
at the end of these commands

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.070
because I don't need
to see the output.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.500
And I'm going to
add a for loop that

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.750
will calculate the first
20 to the next 20 terms.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.520
So I'm going to
have 22 in total--

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.190
two from here, and then
another 20 from here.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.010
At the end, add a
Tab character just

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.900
for alignment to
make it easy to read.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.870
And now at the end, I will
just display f like that.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.020
Because everything
else is suppressed.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.350
I need to save this.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.090
I need to select a
place to save it.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.570
The default is in
Documents, Matlab.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.220
I want to save it
in a different place

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.560
to demonstrate what the path is.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.190
So to do this, I
open a new folder.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.358
I will call it
Scripts, for example.

00:03:29.358 --> 00:03:32.110
So now this script
is under Matlab.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.770
And then in Scripts, I
will call this file Fibbo.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.020
It already is an M file,
which is the extension

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.360
that you need to have.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.290
Fibbo stands for Fibonacci.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.630
And I save it.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.360
And now I go to my command
line and I try to run it,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.590
and it doesn't run.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.600
And the reason it
doesn't run is that Fibbo

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.230
is sitting inside a
subdirectory of Matlab.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.575
And my current directory,
found by typing CD, is Matlab.

00:03:59.575 --> 00:04:01.580
So I'm sitting in Matlab.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.230
Fibbo is sitting in Scripts,
which is inside Matlab.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.560
We can see this by looking
at the current folder.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.310
So here's the current folder.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.120
Under Scripts, there's
Fibbo, but we are not there.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.890
We're up here in Matlab.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.510
So there's two ways
we can solve this.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.450
We can either change
directory to Scripts--

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.130
for example, by
double clicking here.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.600
Now our current
folder is Scripts.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.860
Now if we go here
and call if Fibbo,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.112
it works, and it
calculates the 22 terms

00:04:37.112 --> 00:04:38.195
of the Fibonacci sequence.

00:04:41.095 --> 00:04:43.220
We could have also done
this from the command line.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.650
Here I'm going to
go back to MATLAB.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.840
And I can say change directory
scripts, Tab completion.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.050
And now I'm in Scripts,
and I can call Fibbo again.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.340
Another thing I could do--

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.870
going back to MATLAB--

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.070
is to add scripts to the path.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.800
What is the path?

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.180
Let's see.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.897
So if I type path, I get
a list of directories,

00:05:08.897 --> 00:05:10.480
a long list of
directories that Matlab

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.590
uses in order to look for
the commands that I issue.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.090
All the commands
that you issue will

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.240
have to be in one of these
directories for MATLAB

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.560
to look at them, or in
the current directory.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.030
So you see that the Matlab
directory, the Documents Matlab

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.010
directory, is
always in the path.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.480
That's a default.
But you can add

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.100
to the path whatever you want.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:44.501
So for example, I can
add add path scripts.

00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:46.750
Now that I've done that,
let's look at the path again.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.815
Scripts is in there.

00:05:51.815 --> 00:06:00.130
And if I try to run Fibbo, then
it works even though I'm here.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.860
The way I've written it,
it will look in Scripts

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.850
as a relative directory and
not as an absolute directory.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.730
If I want an
absolute directory, I

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:27.760
would have had to say add path
slash Users slash Documents

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.352
slash Matlab slash Scripts.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.940
This is a different path
because this is the exact one.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.780
Let's look at the path now.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.260
Here we have the absolute
and the relative scripts.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.755
At any case, if you want to see
whether Matlab can see a file,

00:06:45.755 --> 00:06:54.490
you can type which Fibbo,
and then MATLAB tells you,

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.820
if it sees it, which file
it actually is going to.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.450
So if you have the same file
name in different directories,

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.940
both of which are in
your path, the first one

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.400
that Matlab encounters will
be the one that MATLAB calls.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.620
Let's do one more thing.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.100
So let's see what happens when
we actually hide something.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.530
This can be
potentially dangerous.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.890
Let's open a new file.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.430
And we'll say-- it
doesn't do much.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.500
Let's say it says x equals 1.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.940
And we're going
to save this file,

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.070
but we're going to be a
bit insidious about it,

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.361
and we're going to call it Sin.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.580
And we're saving it in
the Matlab directory.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.200
So we're saving a file called
Sin in the Matlab directory.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.230
And now if I do sin of 3,
I get a very strange error.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.062
Notice that it's a function.

00:08:01.062 --> 00:08:02.520
But if I would have
called it sine,

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.145
I would have gotten
the 1, because that

00:08:04.145 --> 00:08:05.820
would have been the script.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.870
So you have to be careful
with things like this.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.560
And I would recommend
not having such a file

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.040
in your current folder.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:32.321
You can also execute a file from
the graphical user interface

00:08:32.321 --> 00:08:33.320
by clicking this button.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:42.500
If that file is not in the path
and not in the current folder,

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.000
Matlab will ask you whether you
want to change folders or add

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.060
it to the path.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.750
And you can answer whatever
makes sense to you.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.040
For a function, you need
to add the keyword function

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.560
in the beginning of your file.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.415
Function f to c.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.440
So let's write a function that
accepts Fahrenheit and converts

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.960
it to Celsius.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.920
So return value, name
of the function, input.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.770
And now we want to
say something like b

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:30.305
equals n minus 32 times 5/9.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.620
Now v becomes this number.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:44.020
And that is the conversion
between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:48.880
So this value v will be returned
to whoever calls this function.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.100
We need to save it.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.910
MATLAB already suggests f to c.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:58.470
And we can put it inside
Scripts next to Fibbo.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.914
Now we can write it
as a function f to c.

00:10:01.914 --> 00:10:03.300
We need to give it an input.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.610
If we don't give it an
input, we get an error.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:10.290
So if we type 32, we get 0.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:17.060
If we type 101, we get
this as a function.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:26.570
You can either end your
function in the file or not.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:31.820
This mostly affects the behavior
when you have sub-functions.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.309
And will talk about
this in the future.
