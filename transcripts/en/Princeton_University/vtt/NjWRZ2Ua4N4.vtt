00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.960
KEVIN HAYNE: Spring break
is an amazing opportunity

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.350
to be able to go abroad
and have the material

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.060
in your course come to life.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.800
JANET MONGE: Kenya and East Africa
is the origin of our lineage,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.260
so these environments are
really key to understand humans

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.370
in total.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.280
WENDY HELLER: Venice is both
permanent and fragile,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.040
and we want them to understand
it from all those aspects.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.920
KEVIN HAYNE: I got to know these
professors on a new level,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.260
rather than just on the
classroom experience.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.080
SCHUYLER KEAN: I've gotten different
perspectives on nature,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.460
on humans, on politics,
from being on this trip

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.710
with these people, and it's
brought me closer to them.

00:00:45.093 --> 00:00:47.405
[CHATTER]

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:48.780
WENDY HELLER: So the
library's where

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.510
I did a lot of my
dissertation research.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.980
The entrance is right there.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.580
We chose to focus the 
course on Venice,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.280
because it is just such an
exciting and beautiful city

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.520
with a very rich history.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.190
And since Professor Reuland
and I have both worked here

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.430
for our research, we felt
that we wanted students

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.950
to come to know the city
from all of its aspects.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.460
Not just as scholars,
but as human beings.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.840
And to embrace the culture in
the way that we've embrace it.

00:01:18.302 --> 00:01:20.010
SOPHIA FEIST: Studying
abroad, especially

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.810
as part of a Princeton class,
just expands your worldview

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.070
in a really profound way that
is really impossible when you're

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.580
looking at images in
books and learning very

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.407
theoretically about a subject.

00:01:34.407 --> 00:01:36.240
When you actually get
to communicate with it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.422
and see it in person,
you remember a lot

00:01:38.422 --> 00:01:40.380
of what you learned in
the class better and are

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.510
able to put it into
context, and not

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.000
just through the guidance
of a teacher or a book.

00:01:47.434 --> 00:01:48.850
JAMIE REULAND:
Venice's history is

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.850
a very modern history in a way.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.295
It's a very
contemporary history.

00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:55.410
It brings up really
contemporary issues.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.790
We're facing environmental
catastrophe on an unseen scale

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.300
today, and so thinking about
just a single city that

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.660
creates beauty on
ground that's not solid

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.600
when there's a real realization
that the foundations are not

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.020
stable I think is a really,
really interesting and really

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.290
contemporary and relevant issue.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.620
KEVIN HAYNE: When I saw this
course on Venice that actually

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.190
has the opportunity to go there,
I immediately jumped on it.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.270
I really felt that I got to know
Professor Reuland and Professor

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.980
Heller on a new level,
rather than just

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.740
on the classroom experience,
which was something very, very

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.100
unique.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.240
WENDY HELLER: We brought them
to Venice during spring break

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.330
so that halfway
through the semester,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.080
they could see that this is a
real place, that it was three

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.600
dimensions, that the frescoes
that we saw on PowerPoint

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.090
are on walls of churches.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.520
So that we could go
into the Accademia

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.100
and see the Carpaccio's
"Saint Ursula"

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.630
cycle being restored,
and hear a lecture

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.810
from the experts who know
about the restoration.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.200
This is something they
can't do on video,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.910
they can't do on YouTube.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.400
What's so special is to
get Princeton students

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.000
and let them see the
city through our eyes,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.300
and then they will show it to
their students, their children,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.620
their partners, and it will
always be a part of them.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.360
So that's part of
the joy of teaching

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.250
at a place like
Princeton, is being

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.870
able to share that
with our students.

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.310
JANET MONGE: The human
evolution class is a class

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.930
that's designed to really give
a full frame, essentially,

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.490
of human evolution from
their first appearance --

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.340
probably about 6 or
7 million years ago --

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.790
up to the present.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.900
The students who came to
Princeton Mpala program

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.750
for spring break are a
subset of our students

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.150
that are really interested
in delving deeper

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.590
into that pre-history.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.020
We've been able to sample
many different aspects

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.310
of human evolution while we've
been here, and up to, really,

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.800
some of the challenges
of modern times as well.

00:04:18.704 --> 00:04:20.370
VIVIAN UFONGENE: I
personally have never

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.710
traveled outside of the
United States before.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.020
I think being able to
travel abroad and actually

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.270
be able to see the things
that we're learning about

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.060
is unimaginable.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.370
I had no idea what an
excavation site looked like

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.460
or what a 2 million-year-old
fossil looked like.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.619
It was just something
you have in your head.

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:38.785
You can never really see it.

00:04:38.785 --> 00:04:44.100
And I think that is exponential
in terms of learning ability.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.100
SCHUYLER KEAN: I chose to take
this class because, again, I'm

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.920
an anthropology
major, and I'm doing

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.510
a certificate in archaeology.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.300
So of course human
evolution is something

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.390
that would really broaden
my understanding of not only

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.720
human evolution, but what it
means, in a sense, to be human.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.135
That's a really important
part of anthropology.

00:05:03.135 --> 00:05:04.760
DINO J. MARTINS:
Coming to Mpala allows

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.630
the anthropology
students to think

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.220
about our role in the
world and in the universe

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.380
and in the ecology
of the savanna,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.240
given that we're one
of the species that

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.460
has come out of the
African savanna

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.710
and gone on to be so successful.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.350
It's wonderful for me
to see, as a scientist,

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.860
that the students became
engaged and inspired,

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.375
that that sense of wonder
was really sparked,

00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:34.260
and that it allowed them to put
the lessons from the classroom

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.730
into a broader context
in terms of a life lesson

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.860
and an experience
that will go forward

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.305
in shaping their future.

00:05:42.305 --> 00:05:43.680
PABLO BICKENBACH:
Things are very

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.760
different when you're actually
in the field living it.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.710
One thing is when you
read it from a textbook

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.690
or when a professor delivers
a lecture using slides,

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.850
but a very different thing
is being in the place

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.560
and getting the feel
of it, experiencing it,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.570
and really seeing how
things are in real life.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.728
That's just the best
way of learning.

00:06:06.728 --> 00:06:10.955
[SINGING]

00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:12.830
JANET MONGE: It's really
key for the students

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.820
to ground a lot of their
thoughts and studies

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.060
in this part of the world.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.050
It's been an earth-changing
experience for them,

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.750
because of course, you
get to actually walk

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.840
where our ancestors walked,
think about the things

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.840
and look at the environments
that our ancestors did.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.270
Never having been in this
situation or anything

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.060
like this kind of
situation, it really

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.880
is a mind-altering
experience for them,

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.100
and an experiment for
them to really conceive

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.120
of this in those terms.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.470
