00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.250
- [Instructor] One cannot
compare the running speed

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.990
of the cheetah with other mammals.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.760
They underlined other mammals.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.670
So let's think about what's going on here.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.320
They say, one cannot compare.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.540
Now what are the things
that they're saying

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.920
one cannot compare?

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.950
So they're saying the
running speed of the cheetah,

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.030
that's one of the things they're saying

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.120
that you cannot compare,
and then they're saying

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.320
you cannot compare it with other mammals.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.530
So is this a reasonable
comparison right over here,

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.260
comparing the running speed of something

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.720
with other mammals?

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.830
Well, you're comparing a speed
with animals right over here.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.880
That doesn't make sense.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.140
Now it might be hard to spot,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.470
because you might say okay,
would I compare the cheetah

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.580
with other mammals, and
that would make sense

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.500
if the sentence was one cannot compare,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.860
if it just said the
cheetah with other mammals,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.693
then this would make sense.

00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:49.960
You're comparing one
mammal to other mammals.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.720
So that would have been
a reasonable comparison.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.080
But that's not what's going on here.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.650
We're saying the running
speed of the cheetah

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.140
with other mammals.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.900
So really what the author,
the person writing it,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.520
is saying one cannot
compare the running speed

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.480
of the cheetah with the running speed

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.410
of other mammals, or with
the speed of other mammals.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.080
With, so I would insert there, the speed,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.010
or the running speed, of other mammals.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.300
You're comparing speed to speed.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.120
Now which of these choices
have something like that?

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.280
So I definitely wanna, I
definitely wanna change things.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.330
One cannot compare the running speed

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.020
of the cheetah with that of other mammals.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.580
Yeah, I mean that seems reasonable.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.590
Instead of saying the
speed, we can say that.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.500
So one cannot compare the running speed

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.470
of the cheetah with that of,
with that of other mammals.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.660
So that being the speed of other mammals.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.910
So that, this one seems pretty good.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.460
One cannot compare the running speed

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.430
with any other mammals.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.480
Well, no, here you're still
comparing speed to mammals.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.417
That's strange.

00:01:55.417 --> 00:01:57.600
And then here, you're
still comparing speed

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.300
to all other mammals.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.470
Cannot compare the running
speed with all other mammals,

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.303
so it doesn't make sense.

00:02:04.303 --> 00:02:06.090
You're comparing a speed to animals,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.123
so definitely like that one.
