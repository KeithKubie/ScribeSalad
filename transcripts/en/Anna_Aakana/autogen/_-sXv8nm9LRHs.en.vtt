00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.960
Have you ever had this happen?

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.060
Where one night:

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.300
Oh my god, everyone is hanging out without me. 
Why wasn't I invited?!

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.700
And then the next:

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.180
Oh my god, why did I agree to hang out with everybody?

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.220
Ugh. Why did they invite me?

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.380
The struggle is real and completely contradictory.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.960
But lately I have been painfully self-aware that I am being excluded from things.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.720
Like, the other day I opened my FOMO app and noticed that some friends went bowling and didn't invite me,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.280
[gasp]

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.980
and I immediately went into a spiral of inferiority and shame and felt like I was 8 years old again.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.560
[laughter]

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.620
But the thing is, I don't even like bowling.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.540
If they had invited me, I probably wouldn't even have wanted to go!

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.220
But did that stop me from crying and convincing myself that I'm a worthless heap of trash?

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.920
No.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.100
And then last week, I was talking to a friend,
when she asked,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.880
- Hey, are you going to Melissa's party?

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.400
- Oh I didn't know she was having a party.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.100
- Yeah, you didn't get the invite?
- No.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.120
- Check your spam, I'm sure it went into your spam.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.320
- Nothing.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.200
- Facebook?

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.080
- Nada.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.540
- Insta DM?
- Zilch.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.400
- Text?
- Nope.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.600
- Smoke signal?
- Nothing.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.600
- Huh.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.260
Well, I'm sure you could come. She probably just forgot to invite you. It happens.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.580
- Yeah.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.560
There are a few things you can do when you feel left out.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.840
I mean, if you feel like a friend is intentionally excluding you,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.220
yes, that probably warrants a conversation to find out what's wrong.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.320
- Why didn't you put out the smoke signal for me?

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.360
- Because it's an archaic way to communicate. I can't build an entire fire every time you wanna hang out.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.980
I mean, invest in string and a can.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.040
But sometimes, friends just hang out without you.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.780
And in my case, I have to accept that when I feel left out,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.040
this has way more to do with my own insecurity than my friends actually trying to hurt my feelings.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.500
And I have been asking myself,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.160
"Why, when I see my friends hanging out without me, is my first thought:

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.000
They hate me.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.540
They've hated me this entire time.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.400
So a few days ago, when friends made plans to go to a movie in front of me,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.640
without an extended invite,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.720
I took a deep breath, and I thought to myself,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.960
I'm happy for them. You know what?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.320
They're gonna have a good time. And if I'm really being honest with myself,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.040
I don't even wanna go to a movie!

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.480
I want to go home and spend some time with a book.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.120
Wait, did I say that out loud?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.740
I'm Anna Akana, and you're coming to Becca's party, right?

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.900
