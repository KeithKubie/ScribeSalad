00:00:07.072 --> 00:00:11.132
How do you get what you want
using just your words?

00:00:11.132 --> 00:00:15.653
Aristotle set out to answer exactly
that question over 2,000 years ago

00:00:15.653 --> 00:00:18.152
with the Treatise on Rhetoric.

00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:19.993
Rhetoric, according to Aristotle,

00:00:19.993 --> 00:00:24.013
is the art of seeing the available
means of persuasion.

00:00:24.013 --> 00:00:27.143
And today we apply it to
any form of communication.

00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:29.582
Aristotle focused on oration, though,

00:00:29.582 --> 00:00:33.623
and he described three types
of persuasive speech.

00:00:33.623 --> 00:00:35.713
Forensic, or judicial, rhetoric

00:00:35.713 --> 00:00:38.753
establishes facts 
and judgements about the past,

00:00:38.753 --> 00:00:41.314
similar to detectives at a crime scene.

00:00:41.314 --> 00:00:43.714
Epideictic, or demonstrative, rhetoric

00:00:43.714 --> 00:00:46.134
makes a proclamation 
about the present situation,

00:00:46.134 --> 00:00:48.384
as in wedding speeches.

00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:52.064
But the way to accomplish change
is through deliberative rhetoric,

00:00:52.064 --> 00:00:54.253
or symbouleutikon.

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:56.164
Rather than the past or the present,

00:00:56.164 --> 00:00:59.164
deliberative rhetoric
focuses on the future.

00:00:59.164 --> 00:01:01.254
It's the rhetoric of politicians

00:01:01.254 --> 00:01:05.085
debating a new law by imagining 
what effect it might have,

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:08.106
like when Ronald Regan warned
that the introduction of Medicare

00:01:08.106 --> 00:01:11.274
would lead to a socialist future 
spent telling our children

00:01:11.274 --> 00:01:16.135
and our children's children what it once
was like in America when men were free.

00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:19.465
But it's also the rhetoric of activists
urging change,

00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:21.995
such as Martin Luther King Jr's dream

00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:24.195
that his children will one day live
in a nation

00:01:24.195 --> 00:01:26.905
where they will not be judged
by the color of their skin,

00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:29.255
but by the content of their character.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:33.117
In both cases, the speaker's present
their audience with a possible future

00:01:33.117 --> 00:01:37.064
and try to enlist their help
in avoiding or achieving it.

00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:39.435
But what makes 
for good deliberative rhetoric,

00:01:39.435 --> 00:01:41.465
besides the future tense?

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:44.923
According to Aristotle, there are three
persuasive appeals:

00:01:44.923 --> 00:01:46.066
ethos,

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.025
logos,

00:01:47.025 --> 00:01:48.477
and pathos.

00:01:48.477 --> 00:01:52.145
Ethos is how you convince an audience
of your credibility.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:56.856
Winston Churchill began his 1941 address
to the U.S. Congress by declaring,

00:01:56.856 --> 00:02:01.244
"I have been in full harmony all my life
with the tides which have flowed

00:02:01.244 --> 00:02:05.615
on both sides of the Atlantic
against privilege and monopoly,"

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:09.776
thus highlighting his virtue
as someone committed to democracy.

00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:12.686
Much earlier, in his defense 
of the poet Archias,

00:02:12.686 --> 00:02:16.367
Roman consul Cicero appealed to
his own practical wisdom

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:18.657
and expertise as a politician:

00:02:18.657 --> 00:02:21.538
"Drawn from my study 
of the liberal sciences

00:02:21.538 --> 00:02:23.828
and from that careful training
to which I admit

00:02:23.828 --> 00:02:27.407
that at no part of my life I have ever
been disinclined."

00:02:27.407 --> 00:02:30.736
And finally, you can demonstrate
disinterest,

00:02:30.736 --> 00:02:33.866
or that you're not motivated 
by personal gain.

00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:37.247
Logos is the use of logic and reason.

00:02:37.247 --> 00:02:41.138
This method can employ rhetorical devices
such as analogies,

00:02:41.138 --> 00:02:42.177
examples,

00:02:42.177 --> 00:02:45.177
and citations of research or statistics.

00:02:45.177 --> 00:02:47.728
But it's not just facts and figures.

00:02:47.728 --> 00:02:51.148
It's also the structure and content
of the speech itself.

00:02:51.148 --> 00:02:54.907
The point is to use factual knowledge
to convince the audience,

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:58.577
as in Sojourner Truth's argument
for women's rights:

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:02.597
"I have as much muscle as any man
and can do as much work as any man.

00:03:02.597 --> 00:03:06.788
I have plowed and reaped and husked
and chopped and mowed

00:03:06.788 --> 00:03:09.939
and can any man do more than that?"

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.472
Unfortunately, speakers can also 
manipulate people with false information

00:03:14.472 --> 00:03:16.939
that the audience thinks is true,

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.589
such as the debunked but still widely
believed claim

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:22.247
that vaccines cause autism.

00:03:22.247 --> 00:03:25.602
And finally, pathos appeals to emotion,

00:03:25.602 --> 00:03:29.639
and in our age of mass media,
it's often the most effective mode.

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.208
Pathos is neither inherently good nor bad,

00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:35.309
but it may be irrational 
and unpredictable.

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:37.868
It can just as easily rally 
people for peace

00:03:37.868 --> 00:03:40.259
as incite them to war.

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:41.703
Most advertising,

00:03:41.703 --> 00:03:45.609
from beauty products that promise
to relieve our physical insecurities

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.919
to cars that make us feel powerful,

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.419
relies on pathos.

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:54.728
Aristotle's rhetorical appeals 
still remain powerful tools today,

00:03:54.728 --> 00:03:56.799
but deciding which of them to use

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.372
is a matter of knowing 
your audience and purpose,

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:01.629
as well as the right place and time.

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.369
And perhaps just as important is being
able to notice

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:08.490
when these same methods of persuasion
are being used on you.
