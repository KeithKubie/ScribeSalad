00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.517
This lecture is going to be
very dependent upon the

00:00:04.517 --> 00:00:08.119
PowerPoint
slides, because if I take the

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.384
time to draw the cycles on the
board,

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:13.141
we'd be here forever.

00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:17.076
So I would say sit back and
relax because you

00:00:17.076 --> 00:00:18.455
have the slides.

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:20.094
They're on the Web.

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:24.635
And try to focus on what the
take-home message is.

00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:28.460
OK, but before we go on to
biogeochemical

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.715
cycles, I want to just briefly
review some of the things that

00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:36.659
we
learned in the second lecture.

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:39.500
I got feedback from many of
you,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.617
actually, on the things that
were difficult to understand

00:00:43.617 --> 00:00:46.006
from that
lecture, and those are

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:48.746
important for understanding
these cycles.

00:00:48.746 --> 00:00:51.960
And the
one thing that some people were

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.333
confused by was this anaerobic
respiration.

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:59.500
Remember, I drew this on the
board, and it showed a lot of

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.204
reduction reactions.

00:01:01.204 --> 00:01:04.272
And I think that was confusing
for

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:07.103
some people,
so let's just go over that very

00:01:07.103 --> 00:01:07.630
quickly.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.551
You've learned
in Graham's lectures,

00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:13.361
and in my lectures,
that aerobic

00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:16.492
respiration,
respiration of organisms where

00:01:16.492 --> 00:01:19.713
there is oxygen,
that oxygen is the terminal

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:22.453
electron receptor here in that
electron

00:01:22.453 --> 00:01:27.000
transport chain and it's
reduced to water.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.110
So in aerobic environments,
when organisms respire oxygen

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.763
it's
reduced to water.

00:01:32.763 --> 00:01:35.577
If there's no oxygen around,
the organisms,

00:01:35.577 --> 00:01:38.355
and in
this case it's always bacteria,

00:01:38.355 --> 00:01:40.872
look for the next
thermodynamically

00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:42.833
favorable electron acceptor.

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:45.495
And so, whatever is dominant in
that

00:01:45.495 --> 00:01:49.363
environment and is most
thermodynamically favorable,

00:01:49.363 --> 00:01:50.402
they'll
use.

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:54.327
So, the sulfate reducing
organisms use sulfate and reduce

00:01:54.327 --> 00:01:55.090
to
H2S.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.373
Denitrifying organisms use
nitrate and reduce it

00:01:59.373 --> 00:02:04.000
to these forms of reduced
nitrate or reduce nitrogen.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.153
And we talked about iron
bacteria Fe plus three,

00:02:07.153 --> 00:02:09.313
and reduce it to
Fe plus two.

00:02:09.313 --> 00:02:11.306
Some can use manganese,
etc.

00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:14.683
Whatever's there,
and it's thermodynamically

00:02:14.683 --> 00:02:16.300
favorable, they'll use.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.321
OK, so that
clarifies that.

00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:21.711
Some of the people said,
you kept talking about

00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:22.376
symmetry.

00:02:22.376 --> 00:02:24.663
You kept talking about
symmetry.

00:02:24.663 --> 00:02:28.078
I didn't see any
symmetry, and in hindsight I

00:02:28.078 --> 00:02:30.569
can understand why,
because I just

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.000
threw that out and I didn't
really point it out.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.972
So what I was talking about was
as we went through these

00:02:38.972 --> 00:02:42.140
processes, you
see here, these elements,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.400
sulfate and nitrogen,
nitrate, are being

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.969
reduced.

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:49.958
There are other processes,
particularly chemosynthesis in

00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.357
which
these reduced compounds,

00:02:52.357 --> 00:02:55.360
here's H2S and ammonia are
being oxidized.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.266
So
that's the symmetry that I was

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:01.000
talking about.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.556
And if you didn't have that,
if all the organisms were

00:03:04.556 --> 00:03:07.652
reducing things,
the whole system would run

00:03:07.652 --> 00:03:08.002
down.

00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:10.663
You have to have organisms that
are

00:03:10.663 --> 00:03:12.183
also oxidizing things.

00:03:12.183 --> 00:03:15.083
And that's a key component of
all of these,

00:03:15.083 --> 00:03:17.622
or
not all of the biogeochemical

00:03:17.622 --> 00:03:20.331
cycles, but particularly the
cycles

00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:23.506
of nitrogen and sulfur,
which have this redox

00:03:23.506 --> 00:03:24.228
chemistry.

00:03:24.228 --> 00:03:29.109
So that's
the symmetry that I was talking

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.000
about.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.537
OK, now so let's talk about how
we think about biogeochemical

00:03:35.537 --> 00:03:36.460
cycles.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.595
Can you see the slide in the
back?

00:03:39.595 --> 00:03:42.160
Try to turn the lights off?

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.042
That
was a double question.

00:03:45.042 --> 00:03:48.225
Can you see the slide in the
back?

00:03:48.225 --> 00:03:48.611
Yes?

00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:49.383
OK.

00:03:49.383 --> 00:03:54.908
So this is a generic map of the
components of biogeochemical

00:03:54.908 --> 00:03:55.845
cycles.

00:03:55.845 --> 00:04:01.213
And we can think of the earth
as a giant chemical factory in

00:04:01.213 --> 00:04:04.460
the sense
that has what we call

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.229
compartments,
or reservoirs,

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:11.038
or pools of
a particular element.

00:04:11.038 --> 00:04:14.713
Or it might be water that we
are

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:19.056
analyzing, and then there are
fluxes between these pools.

00:04:19.056 --> 00:04:21.272
So here's a
flux, an arrow.

00:04:21.272 --> 00:04:25.569
So typically these are
diagrammed with boxes and arrows

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:26.971
connecting them.

00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:31.000
And you don't have to use all
of these boxes.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.545
It could be we are just looking
at land, atmosphere,

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:35.240
and ocean.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.117
I
mean, you can construct

00:04:37.117 --> 00:04:39.311
whatever model you want for
these.

00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:42.364
And these
are just some useful conversion

00:04:42.364 --> 00:04:46.458
factors for the amount of things
that we're going to have

00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:48.857
flowing between these
compartments.

00:04:48.857 --> 00:04:50.127
And
here, again,

00:04:50.127 --> 00:04:53.940
this is something we defined
earlier when we were talking

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.281
about productivity.

00:04:55.281 --> 00:04:58.528
The mean residence time of,
say, an element,

00:04:58.528 --> 00:05:02.672
say, carbon in the terrestrial
biomass, is the pool size,

00:05:02.672 --> 00:05:05.163
the
amount of carbon that's there

00:05:05.163 --> 00:05:07.704
divided by the mean flux in or
out

00:05:07.704 --> 00:05:09.031
of the pool,
OK?

00:05:09.031 --> 00:05:12.125
It's exactly the same concept
we

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:13.625
talked about for carbon.

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:16.375
And then the fractional
turnover, one over

00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:19.382
the mean residence time is
simply the fraction.

00:05:19.382 --> 00:05:22.544
If we're talking
about carbon again in trees,

00:05:22.544 --> 00:05:24.875
it's the fraction that's
removed

00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:26.192
per unit time.

00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:29.769
OK, so you can see that when we
talk

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:34.166
about mean residence time of an
element in one of these

00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:37.383
reservoirs,
if the whole system is in a

00:05:37.383 --> 00:05:39.537
steady state,
in other words,

00:05:39.537 --> 00:05:42.951
if the amount
in a reservoir is changing,

00:05:42.951 --> 00:05:46.382
the flux in is going to be the
same as the

00:05:46.382 --> 00:05:47.746
flux out, right?

00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:48.939
You know that.

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:51.920
Just like a bathtub,
if you have

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.613
water flowing in,
water flowing out,

00:05:54.613 --> 00:05:57.459
the level will say the same if
the

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:03.000
flow rate and is the same as
the flow rate out.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.486
But often in nature,
you don't have that exactly.

00:06:06.486 --> 00:06:08.230
And if you don't,
the

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.702
size of these reservoirs is
either increasing or decreasing.

00:06:12.702 --> 00:06:15.711
So when
you're analyzing these systems,

00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:18.689
your most of the time trying to
get the

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:22.232
very rough estimate of mean
residence time.

00:06:22.232 --> 00:06:25.758
So if the flow in
and the flow out isn't the

00:06:25.758 --> 00:06:29.151
same, you can either average
them and use that

00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:31.917
as your flux,
or you could define your

00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:36.984
residence time with respect to
the flow in or the flow out.

00:06:36.984 --> 00:06:40.507
So, these are just gross
approximations.

00:06:40.507 --> 00:06:44.199
What we want to understand is
the residence time

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.932
thousands of years,
millions of years,

00:06:46.932 --> 00:06:49.000
days, rough approximation.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.563
And the other thing I want to
say before we go on,

00:06:52.563 --> 00:06:54.759
is that all of
these cycles,

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:58.600
we're going to talk about them
element by element:

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.769
phosphorus, carbon,
whatever.

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:03.636
But they're all tightly coupled
in

00:07:03.636 --> 00:07:04.441
the system.

00:07:04.441 --> 00:07:07.004
And we'll bring that up again
later.

00:07:07.004 --> 00:07:08.908
Before we go on,
let's

00:07:08.908 --> 00:07:13.540
just look at the solar energy
budget, which is driving this

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.396
whole
system, mostly,

00:07:15.396 --> 00:07:19.452
there is some geothermal
energy, energy from the

00:07:19.452 --> 00:07:24.253
Earth's, the magma that is also
driving biogeochemical cycles.

00:07:24.253 --> 00:07:28.918
But
the solar energy is the primary

00:07:28.918 --> 00:07:30.000
driver.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.601
And if you say that the total
energy from the sun is 100%,

00:07:34.601 --> 00:07:37.295
it's that
energy that is used in

00:07:37.295 --> 00:07:41.139
evaporation, and winds,
and photosynthesis that

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:44.882
is the important component
driving the cycles.

00:07:44.882 --> 00:07:48.595
And you'll see that
photosynthesis is a tiny

00:07:48.595 --> 00:07:49.301
fraction.

00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:52.283
The energy that plants harvest
is a

00:07:52.283 --> 00:07:56.423
tiny fraction of the total
energy that is driving the

00:07:56.423 --> 00:07:57.855
Earth's system.

00:07:57.855 --> 00:08:02.093
And yet, this photosynthesis,
which is the basis of the

00:08:02.093 --> 00:08:06.455
biosphere, has
an enormous effect on the

00:08:06.455 --> 00:08:09.000
conditions on Earth.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.287
That's an interesting
nonlinearity of the system.

00:08:12.287 --> 00:08:15.506
OK, so let's start
with the geological cycle,

00:08:15.506 --> 00:08:18.452
which is the slowest moving,
people don't

00:08:18.452 --> 00:08:22.380
even think of it as a cycle
because while we are on Earth we

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.920
don't see
rocks flying through,

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.906
well, sometimes you see rocks
in a

00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:32.014
landslide or whatever,
but for the most part you don't

00:08:32.014 --> 00:08:34.308
think
of rocks as cycling.

00:08:34.308 --> 00:08:35.312
But they do.

00:08:35.312 --> 00:08:39.171
And if they didn't,
the system would run down much

00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:40.383
faster than it is.

00:08:40.383 --> 00:08:43.183
And we've all
heard about plate tectonics,

00:08:43.183 --> 00:08:45.768
that the surface of the Earth
is made up

00:08:45.768 --> 00:08:48.378
of these plates that are slowly
shifting.

00:08:48.378 --> 00:08:51.185
And when they shift you
have earthquakes,

00:08:51.185 --> 00:08:53.274
like we've had recently a lot
of.

00:08:53.274 --> 00:08:56.184
And also, you
have volcanic eruptions that

00:08:56.184 --> 00:08:58.692
bring material from the inside
of the

00:08:58.692 --> 00:09:03.000
Earth up to the surface and it
overflows.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.374
And that's part of this
geological cycle.

00:09:06.374 --> 00:09:09.350
So, here's a really
oversimplified,

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.460
when the geology professor in
our department saw that

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.704
ever showing this he had a
heart attack by how simplified

00:09:17.704 --> 00:09:18.159
it is.

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:20.869
But
it's just so you get the idea.

00:09:20.869 --> 00:09:23.919
When he started editing it,
there are so

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:27.139
many arrows you can never cope
with that.

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:29.150
But just get the idea.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:33.473
There's geothermal energy
coming in from the inner core of

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:36.220
the Earth
where you have magma.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.544
Think volcanic eruption,
lava, which

00:09:39.544 --> 00:09:41.871
ultimately becomes surface
rocks.

00:09:41.871 --> 00:09:44.634
And they're eroded by
weathering by

00:09:44.634 --> 00:09:48.343
rain, and then elements from
that go into the soils.

00:09:48.343 --> 00:09:51.683
Soils eventually
become sedimentary rocks.

00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:54.816
We're talking over really,
really long

00:09:54.816 --> 00:09:58.550
time periods,
which become metamorphic rocks.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.029
Some of those
are uplifted,

00:10:01.029 --> 00:10:05.000
and some of them are melted and
become magma.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.652
But it is a cycle,
a very, very slow cycle.

00:10:08.652 --> 00:10:13.399
In fact, somewhere I read
70%, you do not need to know

00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:13.828
this.

00:10:13.828 --> 00:10:16.057
This is not geology class.

00:10:16.057 --> 00:10:18.904
But just
so you have an idea,

00:10:18.904 --> 00:10:23.000
75% of the rocks now on the
surface of the

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.595
earth have been uplifted.

00:10:25.595 --> 00:10:29.332
So it's almost as if the Earth
is,

00:10:29.332 --> 00:10:33.237
on average, maybe halfway
through a cycle.

00:10:33.237 --> 00:10:35.999
So, this erosion here,
and

00:10:35.999 --> 00:10:42.664
weathering, as we talked about
last time is critical for making

00:10:42.664 --> 00:10:46.664
nutrients available to the
biosphere.

00:10:46.664 --> 00:10:51.755
And the force of this
weathering is incredibly

00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:52.664
powerful.

00:10:52.664 --> 00:10:58.405
One number that I found in one
textbook that I never knew

00:10:58.405 --> 00:11:02.664
before is that Niagara Falls is
eroding at 3

00:11:02.664 --> 00:11:04.437
feet per year.

00:11:04.437 --> 00:11:09.250
The cusp of the falls from the
water

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.213
is moving back 3 feet per year.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:13.360
That's fast.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.277
Another little factoid
when I gave this lecture one

00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:22.250
year, students asked what is
going to burn

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:27.049
out first on the Earth,
the sun or the geothermal

00:11:27.049 --> 00:11:27.750
energy?

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.539
And of
course I had no idea.

00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:32.755
This will be over someday.

00:11:32.755 --> 00:11:36.815
The Earth is going
to be history because without

00:11:36.815 --> 00:11:39.634
the sun and without the
geothermal

00:11:39.634 --> 00:11:42.072
energy there's no source of
energy.

00:11:42.072 --> 00:11:44.725
So I went to my colleagues in
this

00:11:44.725 --> 00:11:48.487
department, Earth Atmosphere
and Planetary Sciences,

00:11:48.487 --> 00:11:51.899
and said, which
is going to burn out first?

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:54.908
And they said,
roughly the same time.

00:11:54.908 --> 00:12:00.000
And we have about 2 billion
years, so not to worry yet.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.346
But it is, we are only here for
a period of time.

00:12:03.346 --> 00:12:05.517
So, that's the
geologic cycle.

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:09.063
Now, let's move onto the water
cycle, and then we're

00:12:09.063 --> 00:12:12.397
going to go through the element
cycles of nitrogen,

00:12:12.397 --> 00:12:14.100
phosphorus, and
carbon.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.130
But the water cycle is
obviously important in carrying

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.398
those elements through their
cycles.

00:12:20.398 --> 00:12:22.664
And the cycle is actually
fairly

00:12:22.664 --> 00:12:23.816
well understood.

00:12:23.816 --> 00:12:27.198
I say fairly because not all of
these things,

00:12:27.198 --> 00:12:31.731
when you're talking about
global averages of things it's

00:12:31.731 --> 00:12:33.253
very difficult.

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:39.076
But the weather service is very
interested in the global water

00:12:39.076 --> 00:12:39.571
cycle.

00:12:39.571 --> 00:12:42.737
So there's been a lot of
study done.

00:12:42.737 --> 00:12:47.000
So in terms of reservoirs,
these numbers in black

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.120
are the amounts of water in a
reservoir.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.120
And the numbers in blue
are the number of fluxes

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.399
annually of the amounts of water
moving

00:12:57.399 --> 00:12:59.623
from one to another.

00:12:59.623 --> 00:13:04.256
So, there is a lot of water in
groundwater.

00:13:04.256 --> 00:13:09.543
There's a lot of water in ice,
and there's a lot of water

00:13:09.543 --> 00:13:10.935
in the oceans.

00:13:10.935 --> 00:13:15.907
And there's very little water
in the atmosphere.

00:13:15.907 --> 00:13:18.416
These are the annual fluxes.

00:13:18.416 --> 00:13:22.270
So you can see,
if I animated this right,

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:27.086
so 111, these are in terms of
square kilometers of water,

00:13:27.086 --> 00:13:29.261
that's a lot of
water.

00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:32.391
So, 111 minus 71 gives you 40.

00:13:32.391 --> 00:13:35.000
So that's the rainfall.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.104
This is the evapotranspiration,
and the net result is 40,000

00:13:39.104 --> 00:13:41.422
that is
flowing into the oceans.

00:13:41.422 --> 00:13:44.599
And in the oceans,
here's the evaporation and

00:13:44.599 --> 00:13:48.438
here's the rainfall going in
with just a net of 40 that's

00:13:48.438 --> 00:13:51.118
transported
from the oceans to land.

00:13:51.118 --> 00:13:54.198
So you have 40,000 going into
the oceans,

00:13:54.198 --> 00:13:57.879
and 40,000 coming back,
fairly nicely balanced.

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.000
That's good.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:09.478
And so, let's just use this as
an example to say,

00:14:09.478 --> 00:14:17.787
what's the residence
time of water.

00:14:17.787 --> 00:14:23.893
Let's just calculate this.

00:14:23.893 --> 00:14:30.000
We can just approximate.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:41.105
So the mean residence time is
equal to the pool size divided

00:14:41.105 --> 00:14:45.403
by the
flux, right?

00:14:45.403 --> 00:14:50.609
So what's the pool size?

00:14:50.609 --> 00:15:00.223
Well, how much water
there in the ocean?

00:15:00.223 --> 00:15:06.552
Thank you.
1.35 times 10^9.

00:15:06.552 --> 00:15:27.000
And,
what's the flux?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:35.030
Well, we have 425,000
evaporating and we have 40 going

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.787
here.

00:15:35.787 --> 00:15:42.000
So, I
would add this and that so it's

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.451
balanced.

00:15:43.451 --> 00:15:51.642
So, I would use 425.
4.25 times 105 equals just

00:15:51.642 --> 00:15:57.000
roughly how many years?
3,000

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.090
years roughly.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:04.615
So we would say the residence
time,

00:16:04.615 --> 00:16:08.361
the average molecule,
the average water molecules

00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:11.844
floating through
this system would spend on

00:16:11.844 --> 00:16:15.075
average thousands of years in
the oceans

00:16:15.075 --> 00:16:19.109
before it would evaporate and
get back into the system.

00:16:19.109 --> 00:16:22.150
So you should
now think about what the

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:25.073
average residence time is,
for example,

00:16:25.073 --> 00:16:26.672
in
the atmosphere.

00:16:26.672 --> 00:16:30.767
And you can see when the pool
is very small relative

00:16:30.767 --> 00:16:34.203
to the fluxes,
the residence time is going to

00:16:34.203 --> 00:16:36.000
be very short,
right?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.967
That's something to remember.

00:16:37.967 --> 00:16:40.614
When the pool is huge relative
to the

00:16:40.614 --> 00:16:44.074
fluxes, the residence time is
going to be very long.

00:16:44.074 --> 00:16:47.018
So, you should
think about that as you go

00:16:47.018 --> 00:16:48.327
through your notes.

00:16:48.327 --> 00:16:49.842
But, in oceans,
the

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:53.067
residence time is thousands of
years in groundwater.

00:16:53.067 --> 00:16:56.019
The residence time,
again, can be very long,

00:16:56.019 --> 00:16:59.075
which is why we don't want to
contaminate our

00:16:59.075 --> 00:17:03.691
groundwater because it's going
to take a really long time

00:17:03.691 --> 00:17:05.704
to flush that through.

00:17:05.704 --> 00:17:09.000
Lakes: the residence time is on
the

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.147
order of decades,
streams on the order of weeks,

00:17:13.147 --> 00:17:17.776
and atmosphere I'll
let you calculate it and figure

00:17:17.776 --> 00:17:18.402
it out.

00:17:18.402 --> 00:17:22.909
OK, let's move on now to an
element cycle,

00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:27.000
the global phosphorous cycle.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:55.623
First of all, there's no redox 
chemistry in the cycle.

00:17:55.623 --> 00:17:57.376
That's important.

00:17:57.376 --> 00:18:01.868
OK, that's the first
thing to remember.

00:18:01.868 --> 00:18:06.221
And it's called a sedimentary
cycle

00:18:06.221 --> 00:18:10.165
because there is no atmospheric
component.

00:18:10.165 --> 00:18:15.585
There is essentially no
phosphorus in the atmosphere.

00:18:15.585 --> 00:18:19.109
Everything in this field,
there's

00:18:19.109 --> 00:18:21.188
always an exception.

00:18:21.188 --> 00:18:25.554
There is something called
phosphine that

00:18:25.554 --> 00:18:32.000
comes out of bogs that is
really interesting.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.333
But it's not a huge amount,
so it doesn't really matter in

00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:40.016
this
analysis.

00:18:40.016 --> 00:18:43.064
And, let's look at it here.

00:18:43.064 --> 00:18:48.843
We have a fair amount of
phosphorus in land plants.

00:18:48.843 --> 00:18:52.453
And there's internal cycling
here.

00:18:52.453 --> 00:18:57.951
We
have the mining of phosphorus

00:18:57.951 --> 00:19:00.000
from rocks.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.684
This is a fertilizer.

00:19:01.684 --> 00:19:04.651
No, that's not a mine;
that's a house.

00:19:04.651 --> 00:19:05.453
Sorry.

00:19:05.453 --> 00:19:07.218
The mine is invisible.

00:19:07.218 --> 00:19:08.501
Here's the mine.

00:19:08.501 --> 00:19:11.427
So, the phosphorus is being
mined.

00:19:11.427 --> 00:19:14.111
It's put on crops as
fertilizer.

00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:18.286
The crops are eaten by
the people in the house,

00:19:18.286 --> 00:19:21.174
and the phosphorus ends up in
sewage.

00:19:21.174 --> 00:19:23.138
Even
if it's treated,

00:19:23.138 --> 00:19:27.270
it ends up in the rivers,
and it ends up flowing

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.141
into the oceans.

00:19:29.141 --> 00:19:33.000
And there's a little bit in
dust

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.882
transport here,
but if you look at this whole

00:19:36.882 --> 00:19:41.228
system, it's basically
the phosphorous cycle is a

00:19:41.228 --> 00:19:43.542
one-way flow to the oceans.

00:19:43.542 --> 00:19:46.971
The only return
of the cycle is via the

00:19:46.971 --> 00:19:51.000
sedimentary cycle where you go
from sediments.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Those are sedimentary rocks
until you go to mineable rock

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.553
and through uplifting.

00:19:59.553 --> 00:20:03.556
And this is on geological
timescales.

00:20:03.556 --> 00:20:08.060
So, on the earth today,
the global phosphorous cycle is

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.562
really not a cycle.

00:20:09.562 --> 00:20:12.170
It's a one-way flow to the
oceans.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.749
Well, it's a
cycle, but it's an extremely

00:20:15.749 --> 00:20:18.808
unbalanced cycle because
eventually

00:20:18.808 --> 00:20:20.625
this one will come back.

00:20:20.625 --> 00:20:24.183
It cycles very rapidly in the
biota, internal

00:20:24.183 --> 00:20:25.894
cycling in the ocean.

00:20:25.894 --> 00:20:29.558
So, it comes in the river,
it's taken up by

00:20:29.558 --> 00:20:32.909
phytoplankton,
they're eaten by zooplankton,

00:20:32.909 --> 00:20:38.480
and then the phosphorus
is excreted or bacteria chew on

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:44.641
dead organisms
take up the phosphorous.

00:20:44.641 --> 00:20:51.909
It's excreted as organic
phosphorous,

00:20:51.909 --> 00:21:00.711
and it cycles rapidly through
this system.

00:21:00.711 --> 00:21:02.000
OK.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:12.967
So the other important feature
of this one way flow,

00:21:12.967 --> 00:21:33.000
and also
humans have altered.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.693
In other words,
humans are responsible for

00:21:38.693 --> 00:21:44.826
this, basically,
one-way flow by mining the

00:21:44.826 --> 00:21:49.664
phosphorus and putting it into
the

00:21:49.664 --> 00:21:52.490
agricultural system.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:58.000
OK, yeah, and there's the
return flux.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.757
OK, moving on to the nitrogen
cycle, which is much more

00:22:03.757 --> 00:22:08.702
complicated
because it is redox chemistry,

00:22:08.702 --> 00:22:09.047
OK?

00:22:09.047 --> 00:22:13.906
And, humans have also had a
major, major,

00:22:13.906 --> 00:22:18.343
major effect on the global
nitrogen cycle.

00:22:18.343 --> 00:22:23.301
So, let's
first look at the global

00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:27.000
nitrogen transformation.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.985
So this isn't a pools and
fluxes diagram.

00:22:29.985 --> 00:22:34.109
This is a summary for you
of things you already know.

00:22:34.109 --> 00:22:35.828
You already know this.

00:22:35.828 --> 00:22:39.279
It just looks
different than what you learned

00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:40.897
in the second lecture.

00:22:40.897 --> 00:22:43.985
So let's just
go through it very quickly.

00:22:43.985 --> 00:22:47.000
If we think of the compounds of
nitrogen

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.029
as being either reduced or
oxidized and we think of the

00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:54.153
environment
where they might be found as

00:22:54.153 --> 00:22:57.000
either being aerobic or oxic,
having

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
oxygen, or anaerobic,
anoxic, not having oxygen.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.941
We can draw a schematic of
these processes that hopefully

00:23:06.941 --> 00:23:08.537
makes good
sense.

00:23:08.537 --> 00:23:13.283
If we start with organic
nitrogen, but say it's a dead

00:23:13.283 --> 00:23:16.090
whale
that you saw is organic

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:20.000
nitrogen, bacteria work on it,
and through

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.545
this process which you haven't
really learned about explicitly

00:23:25.545 --> 00:23:28.438
at,
can convert that to free

00:23:28.438 --> 00:23:29.251
ammonia.

00:23:29.251 --> 00:23:33.799
That ammonia can be used in
chemosynthesis,

00:23:33.799 --> 00:23:36.199
which you learned about.

00:23:36.199 --> 00:23:41.453
OK, the specific type of
chemosynthesis is called

00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:45.499
nitrification,
where this ammonia is

00:23:45.499 --> 00:23:47.537
converted to nitrite.

00:23:47.537 --> 00:23:50.934
Is that an oxidation or a
reduction?

00:23:50.934 --> 00:23:52.493
Shout it
out.

00:23:52.493 --> 00:23:53.379
Yes, yes.

00:23:53.379 --> 00:23:55.152
It's an oxidation.

00:23:55.152 --> 00:23:58.699
This was obvious because you
can

00:23:58.699 --> 00:24:01.294
actually see the oxygen.

00:24:01.294 --> 00:24:04.538
So, in that,
nitrite also in

00:24:04.538 --> 00:24:09.060
chemosynthesis can be further
oxidized to nitrate.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.785
And
chemosynthesis,

00:24:10.785 --> 00:24:14.690
so this is an energy releasing
process for these

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:15.324
bacteria.

00:24:15.324 --> 00:24:19.060
Now, so here we now have
nitrogen in an oxidized form,

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.931
and we
are in an anoxic environment,

00:24:21.931 --> 00:24:24.844
and that should immediately
tell you,

00:24:24.844 --> 00:24:29.480
oh, that's an electron acceptor
for the anaerobic bacteria which

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.153
are
going to dump their electrons

00:24:32.153 --> 00:24:35.000
on this and convert it to NO or
N2O.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.273
These are gases,
and nitrogen gas.

00:24:38.273 --> 00:24:42.142
This is denitrification or
anaerobic

00:24:42.142 --> 00:24:46.251
respiration,
which we already talked about.

00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:52.097
And it also can be converted
through nitrogen fixation,

00:24:52.097 --> 00:24:55.777
N2 gas can be converted to
ammonia.

00:24:55.777 --> 00:24:58.758
We
already talked about this,

00:24:58.758 --> 00:24:59.117
too.

00:24:59.117 --> 00:25:02.615
Remember, bacteria and
cyanobacteria

00:25:02.615 --> 00:25:06.643
are the only organisms that can
take nitrogen gas from the

00:25:06.643 --> 00:25:10.063
atmosphere and
converted to ammonia for the

00:25:10.063 --> 00:25:11.886
use of other organisms.

00:25:11.886 --> 00:25:15.293
OK, and then
there's one other thing here

00:25:15.293 --> 00:25:18.305
which is called assimilatory
nitrate

00:25:18.305 --> 00:25:19.122
reduction.

00:25:19.122 --> 00:25:22.963
And that is when organisms just
take up nitrate,

00:25:22.963 --> 00:25:24.432
and
inside them,

00:25:24.432 --> 00:25:28.768
and they reduce it so that they
can, they have to reduce

00:25:28.768 --> 00:25:34.000
it to ammonia in order to
reduce it for protein synthesis.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.243
So that's another route for
nitrate to become organic

00:25:40.243 --> 00:25:45.184
nitrogen in an
oxidized environment.

00:25:45.184 --> 00:25:50.569
So these are the important
biological

00:25:50.569 --> 00:25:54.712
transformations in the cycle.

00:25:54.712 --> 00:26:01.934
So, here's the cycle in all
of its complexity.

00:26:01.934 --> 00:26:05.868
And redox is important.

00:26:05.868 --> 00:26:08.851
That's a
feature.

00:26:08.851 --> 00:26:17.250
I'm going to list these things,
and then we'll look at them

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:22.068
on the diagram,
has a gaseous phase,

00:26:22.068 --> 00:26:26.750
in other words,
is an important

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:31.500
atmosphere component,
N2, NO, N2O,

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:36.250
and by the way,
this is a very

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:40.282
powerful greenhouse gas.

00:26:40.282 --> 00:26:46.500
So, the balance or imbalance in
the

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:54.985
nitrogen cycle that results in
more or less N2O is very

00:26:54.985 --> 00:27:05.516
important for
global climate regulation.

00:27:05.516 --> 00:27:16.000
Nitrogen fixation by microbes
and

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.886
humans: very important.

00:27:22.886 --> 00:27:33.665
And denitrification by microbes
is

00:27:33.665 --> 00:27:40.198
the only way to return nitrogen
to the atmosphere.

00:27:40.198 --> 00:27:45.193
If you didn't have
denitrification,

00:27:45.193 --> 00:27:52.330
this process that you learned
in my second lecture

00:27:52.330 --> 00:28:00.176
that you thought was just some
weird way things get through

00:28:00.176 --> 00:28:05.127
life, is
incredibly important in

00:28:05.127 --> 00:28:11.000
maintaining the global nitrogen
cycle.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.671
So, let's look at this,
the details here.

00:28:16.671 --> 00:28:25.250
So, in terms of nitrogen
fixation, that's taking N2 gas

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:30.000
and converting it to ammonia.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.062
Biological fixation by plants,
or it's really not by plants.

00:28:36.062 --> 00:28:40.275
It's by
the symbiotic microbes in their

00:28:40.275 --> 00:28:44.180
roots is 140 times 1012 of grams
per

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:44.709
year.

00:28:44.709 --> 00:28:49.365
The industrial electrician
fixation, that is,

00:28:49.365 --> 00:28:53.839
what's done by
humans, there's a process

00:28:53.839 --> 00:28:58.362
called the Haber process that's
incredibly

00:28:58.362 --> 00:29:00.306
energy intensive.

00:29:00.306 --> 00:29:05.452
It takes a lot of fossil fuel
to break that

00:29:05.452 --> 00:29:07.462
nitrogen triple bond.

00:29:07.462 --> 00:29:11.098
In other words,
to take nitrogen gas

00:29:11.098 --> 00:29:14.352
and convert it to ammonia,
you have to break this triple

00:29:14.352 --> 00:29:16.638
bond which is
very energy intensive.

00:29:16.638 --> 00:29:19.499
But they figured that out
during World War II

00:29:19.499 --> 00:29:21.535
basically, or was it World War
I?

00:29:21.535 --> 00:29:23.699
Anyway, one of the wars,
how to

00:29:23.699 --> 00:29:26.848
break that bond,
and that was the beginning of

00:29:26.848 --> 00:29:29.784
the nitrogen
fertilizer industry.

00:29:29.784 --> 00:29:33.271
So, this is human nitrogen
fixation

00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:36.299
that is used to fertilize
crops.

00:29:36.299 --> 00:29:39.816
So this is a huge fraction of
the

00:29:39.816 --> 00:29:41.405
natural fixation.

00:29:41.405 --> 00:29:46.361
I mean, this adds a huge amount
of nitrogen flux to

00:29:46.361 --> 00:29:47.375
the system.

00:29:47.375 --> 00:29:51.800
OK, in this flux here,
this is cultivated legume.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.338
So, this
would be agricultural bean

00:29:55.338 --> 00:29:59.452
plants that naturally have
nitrogen fixers

00:29:59.452 --> 00:30:06.000
in them, and that also import
nitrogen into the system.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.518
So, we consider that part of
the human flux.

00:30:10.518 --> 00:30:13.250
OK, to balance this,
we

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:18.117
have denitrification,
which as I said is done by

00:30:18.117 --> 00:30:21.996
microbes on land and
in the ocean.

00:30:21.996 --> 00:30:26.023
So, looking at this,
is it balanced?

00:30:26.023 --> 00:30:31.633
Is nitrogen
fixation on a global scale and

00:30:31.633 --> 00:30:35.000
denitrification balanced?

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.647
Did I hear a no?

00:30:36.647 --> 00:30:38.397
Which is greater?

00:30:38.397 --> 00:30:40.558
Denitrification,
yeah.

00:30:40.558 --> 00:30:44.161
If you add
this, this, and this,

00:30:44.161 --> 00:30:45.397
you get 260.

00:30:45.397 --> 00:30:46.838
Is that right?

00:30:46.838 --> 00:30:50.666
Yeah, and then you
add this, this,

00:30:50.666 --> 00:30:53.000
and this you get 310.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:00.375
So, there's more nitrogen
going into the atmosphere than

00:31:00.375 --> 00:31:03.000
we're taking out.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.130
And people don't understand
this.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.750
They think the denitrification
has

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:14.957
been disproportionately
stimulated by this huge flux of

00:31:14.957 --> 00:31:17.717
nitrogen into
the system.

00:31:17.717 --> 00:31:23.250
But this is an important
imbalance that a lot of

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:28.312
people are studying very hard.

00:31:28.312 --> 00:31:30.000
OK, yeah.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.870
That's the major feature that
you want to look at in the

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:34.363
system.

00:31:34.363 --> 00:31:36.263
And
then, if we compare,

00:31:36.263 --> 00:31:39.711
this figure is from your
textbook comparing the

00:31:39.711 --> 00:31:41.752
biological nitrogen fixation.

00:31:41.752 --> 00:31:44.567
Plus, lightning fixes it a
little bit.

00:31:44.567 --> 00:31:48.194
Compared to the human,
you can see that humans are now

00:31:48.194 --> 00:31:51.413
responsible for
an equal amount of nitrogen

00:31:51.413 --> 00:31:54.284
flux on a global scale as the
natural

00:31:54.284 --> 00:31:54.815
system.

00:31:54.815 --> 00:31:57.168
This is a dramatic
perturbation,

00:31:57.168 --> 00:32:00.846
and that's only in the
last 50 years or so,

00:32:00.846 --> 00:32:04.000
dramatic perturbation to the
system.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.930
This amount that we are doing
is, 140 gigatons is equivalent

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:12.106
to 10
million trucks of dry nitrogen

00:32:12.106 --> 00:32:15.199
fertilizer that we are putting
into

00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:18.709
the system with completely
unknown effects.

00:32:18.709 --> 00:32:23.152
OK, the next series of
slides are just to illustrate

00:32:23.152 --> 00:32:26.398
in one ecosystem the importance
of the

00:32:26.398 --> 00:32:32.000
biota and maintaining nitrogen
in the ecosystem.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.266
And I'll also just show you the
importance of experiments in

00:32:36.266 --> 00:32:36.760
ecology.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.790
And this is the Hubbard Brook
Experimental Forest,

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.768
which is
up in New Hampshire.

00:32:41.768 --> 00:32:44.303
Some of you might have even
visited there.

00:32:44.303 --> 00:32:46.708
This
was my first job as a graduate

00:32:46.708 --> 00:32:49.064
student was actually working in
the

00:32:49.064 --> 00:32:49.484
forest.

00:32:49.484 --> 00:32:52.909
I was measuring phosphorous
concentrations in the streams.

00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:54.522
And
what they do there,

00:32:54.522 --> 00:32:57.596
just like that experimental
lake study I showed

00:32:57.596 --> 00:33:01.477
you, here, they have permits
from the forest service to clear

00:33:01.477 --> 00:33:03.342
cut
entire watersheds.

00:33:03.342 --> 00:33:06.133
A watershed is just an area
that

00:33:06.133 --> 00:33:09.762
collects the rainfall and
directs it into a single stream.

00:33:09.762 --> 00:33:12.035
You can
collect the rain and measure

00:33:12.035 --> 00:33:14.664
what's in it,
and you can collect the water

00:33:14.664 --> 00:33:16.860
coming out and measure what's
in it.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.637
And the difference is what the
ecosystem is actually doing.

00:33:20.637 --> 00:33:23.196
So, what they did was they had
these two

00:33:23.196 --> 00:33:27.080
watersheds that were the same,
and they clear cut one of them.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.427
And
they asked with the influence

00:33:29.427 --> 00:33:34.607
of this clear cutting was on the
quality of the water coming out

00:33:34.607 --> 00:33:36.000
of the system.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.485
And to make a long story very
short, it's a really fascinating

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:43.205
study
that's been going on for years

00:33:43.205 --> 00:33:46.000
that I don't want to tell you
because

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.173
then you'll know how old I am.

00:33:48.173 --> 00:33:51.000
But, here's the control
watershed, and

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.731
here's the water coming out of
the devegetated one,

00:33:54.731 --> 00:33:58.155
showing massive
eflux of nitrate from the

00:33:58.155 --> 00:34:01.000
system as well as other cations.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.289
And your textbook does a
terrible job of not explaining

00:34:04.289 --> 00:34:04.593
this.

00:34:04.593 --> 00:34:06.996
And I
don't have time to go into the

00:34:06.996 --> 00:34:07.491
details.

00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:11.020
But, the major reason this
is lost, the vegetation is

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.425
really important in that,
but it's

00:34:13.425 --> 00:34:17.073
important in also maintaining
the microbial community in the

00:34:17.073 --> 00:34:17.568
soil.

00:34:17.568 --> 00:34:20.692
And when it's cut down,
the microbial community

00:34:20.692 --> 00:34:21.236
changes.

00:34:21.236 --> 00:34:23.320
And
that is very important and

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.680
resulting in the loss.

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.964
It's a beautiful
study, which unfortunately we

00:34:27.964 --> 00:34:30.000
don't have time to go into.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.828
But if you're interested,
I can point you in the right

00:34:33.828 --> 00:34:34.768
direction.

00:34:34.768 --> 00:34:38.022
OK, now, let's go into the
really important,

00:34:38.022 --> 00:34:41.631
well, they're all
important because they're all

00:34:41.631 --> 00:34:42.209
coupled.

00:34:42.209 --> 00:34:46.381
But this is the one that's
getting a lot of attention,

00:34:46.381 --> 00:34:48.227
the global carbon cycle.

00:34:48.227 --> 00:34:51.107
And it's
getting a lot of attention

00:34:51.107 --> 00:34:53.844
because we have had an
incredibly

00:34:53.844 --> 00:34:57.868
significant impact on it,
and we are worried about that

00:34:57.868 --> 00:35:00.366
causing
major global warming.

00:35:00.366 --> 00:35:03.454
And as an aside,
I'll just tell you

00:35:03.454 --> 00:35:07.081
that I actually think the
global nitrogen cycle is a

00:35:07.081 --> 00:35:10.339
sleeping giant,
and that the public doesn't

00:35:10.339 --> 00:35:12.610
know much about that right now.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.048
But in
the scientific community,

00:35:15.048 --> 00:35:18.179
we know the perturbation we've
had on that

00:35:18.179 --> 00:35:21.205
cycle could end up being
equally, if not more,

00:35:21.205 --> 00:35:25.212
traumatic for the Earth's
climate as this.

00:35:25.212 --> 00:35:28.000
But that's an aside.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.320
So let's focus on this now.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.500
So, here's the global carbon
cycle,

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:37.604
which you've seen now several
times in my lectures.

00:35:37.604 --> 00:35:41.138
So here's gross
primary productivity,

00:35:41.138 --> 00:35:46.583
and respiration by land plants,
respiration by the soils.

00:35:46.583 --> 00:35:50.000
These are RA and RH that we
talked about

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:50.542
before.

00:35:50.542 --> 00:35:53.176
And in this,
we have their balance,

00:35:53.176 --> 00:35:55.500
roughly balanced,
and then

00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:01.000
you have uptake by the oceans,
and loss of CO2 by the oceans.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.733
Your textbook says this is all
a physical and chemical process

00:36:04.733 --> 00:36:06.355
that's
absolutely wrong.

00:36:06.355 --> 00:36:09.570
The biota are central to that,
and that's another

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:10.039
lecture.

00:36:10.039 --> 00:36:13.092
But you already know that,
that the phytoplankton are

00:36:13.092 --> 00:36:15.492
sucking a
lot of CO2 in through

00:36:15.492 --> 00:36:16.660
photosynthesis.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.229
So let's look at
the budget here.

00:36:19.229 --> 00:36:22.427
And, this is the introduction
of CO2 into the

00:36:22.427 --> 00:36:25.820
atmosphere by burning fossil
fuel, and the introduction of

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.713
CO2 into the
atmosphere by destruction of

00:36:29.713 --> 00:36:31.000
vegetation.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:41.000
So, we have 7.5 gigatons going
into the atmosphere due to human

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
perturbation.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:51.000
The annual increase of CO2 in
the atmosphere is 3.5

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.525
gigatons.

00:36:52.525 --> 00:36:58.796
So, 3.5 gigatons annual
increase, and,

00:36:58.796 --> 00:37:01.000
let's see.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.460
If we look at the difference
here between respiration and

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:08.821
photosynthesis we see that
there's 2 gigatons going into

00:37:08.821 --> 00:37:11.259
the vegetation,
actually net into the

00:37:11.259 --> 00:37:11.960
vegetation.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.382
And if we look at this,
we see that

00:37:14.382 --> 00:37:16.612
there's two going into the
ocean.

00:37:16.612 --> 00:37:18.844
So, if we ask,
of all of this

00:37:18.844 --> 00:37:21.074
anthropogenic CO2 where's it
going?

00:37:21.074 --> 00:37:24.268
3.5 is going to increase in the
atmosphere.

00:37:24.268 --> 00:37:27.768
Two is going to vegetation,
and two is

00:37:27.768 --> 00:37:29.841
going to the ocean.

00:37:29.841 --> 00:37:35.961
And it's this that we are very
concerned about because it's

00:37:35.961 --> 00:37:39.998
causing a dramatic increase in
the CO2 in

00:37:39.998 --> 00:37:41.514
the atmosphere.

00:37:41.514 --> 00:37:46.664
Even though these are tiny
fluxes relative to the

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:51.916
global biological fluxes,
these tiny fluxes lead to a

00:37:51.916 --> 00:37:56.612
significant
increase because the pool is so

00:37:56.612 --> 00:38:00.000
small of CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.594
So, this is a trace of CO2
since 1960.

00:38:02.594 --> 00:38:05.676
Here's a question for you to
think about.

00:38:05.676 --> 00:38:07.719
I'm not going to answer it.

00:38:07.719 --> 00:38:11.038
Its summer and winter
are out of phase in the

00:38:11.038 --> 00:38:14.304
Northern and Southern
Hemisphere, why isn't this

00:38:14.304 --> 00:38:15.088
just smooth?

00:38:15.088 --> 00:38:19.074
This cycle that we see here is
an annual cycle of the Earth

00:38:19.074 --> 00:38:19.819
breathing.

00:38:19.819 --> 00:38:23.844
Remember I showed you that the
first lecture showing

00:38:23.844 --> 00:38:28.159
photosynthesis greater than
respiration during the summer,

00:38:28.159 --> 00:38:30.842
and
the reverse during the winter.

00:38:30.842 --> 00:38:33.666
Think about why it isn't just
smooth

00:38:33.666 --> 00:38:36.966
and canceled out by the two
hemispheres.

00:38:36.966 --> 00:38:40.150
OK, and if we look at
that same graph,

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:44.329
this is atmospheric CO2 from
ice core data as a function

00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:44.914
of time.

00:38:44.914 --> 00:38:48.201
This is today,
and this is time before present

00:38:48.201 --> 00:38:49.663
going backwards.

00:38:49.663 --> 00:38:51.644
This is 450,000 years ago.

00:38:51.644 --> 00:38:54.996
We can see that CO2 in the
atmosphere, and

00:38:54.996 --> 00:38:58.384
this is measured in,
you take a deep ice core in

00:38:58.384 --> 00:39:02.342
Greenland, or something,
and you measure the CO2

00:39:02.342 --> 00:39:05.664
concentration at different
slices of

00:39:05.664 --> 00:39:06.452
the core.

00:39:06.452 --> 00:39:11.000
And it tells you what the Earth
was like back then.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.846
And, this just dramatically
shows you what we are doing just

00:39:15.846 --> 00:39:18.570
that the
last hundred years.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:22.500
We have increased CO2 in the
atmosphere

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.589
dramatically by burning fossil
fuels.

00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:32.275
And CO2 is a greenhouse gas,
and so we are very concerned

00:39:32.275 --> 00:39:34.000
about that.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.885
OK, this is just read showing
that slide from last time of

00:39:37.885 --> 00:39:40.203
upwelling to
remind you that the

00:39:40.203 --> 00:39:43.815
biogeochemical cycles of these
elements are tightly

00:39:43.815 --> 00:39:44.393
coupled.

00:39:44.393 --> 00:39:47.641
Remember, we talked about
nutrients, nitrogen,

00:39:47.641 --> 00:39:50.807
phosphorus,
being upwelled from the deep

00:39:50.807 --> 00:39:53.634
water, phytoplankton taking them
up,

00:39:53.634 --> 00:39:58.543
drawing down CO2 and then we
had oxygen and CO2 going back

00:39:58.543 --> 00:40:00.895
and forth in the water.

00:40:00.895 --> 00:40:04.166
So, the oxygen cycle,
which we

00:40:04.166 --> 00:40:09.354
haven't even talked about is
tightly coupled also to the CO2

00:40:09.354 --> 00:40:09.882
cycle.

00:40:09.882 --> 00:40:13.084
I'm
not going to show this there.

00:40:13.084 --> 00:40:16.831
OK, moving on,
and I know this is quick,

00:40:16.831 --> 00:40:19.493
but this is in your readings.

00:40:19.493 --> 00:40:23.164
There is a newspaper article
about the

00:40:23.164 --> 00:40:27.446
Biosphere 2 experiment which
now is pretty dated.

00:40:27.446 --> 00:40:32.068
To make a long story
short, many years ago a very

00:40:32.068 --> 00:40:35.831
rich person built the system out
in the

00:40:35.831 --> 00:40:38.286
middle of the Arizona desert.

00:40:38.286 --> 00:40:41.333
And it had seven ecosystems in
it.

00:40:41.333 --> 00:40:42.253
It was sealed.

00:40:42.253 --> 00:40:43.173
It was closed.

00:40:43.173 --> 00:40:45.998
And, he put people in,
which were called

00:40:45.998 --> 00:40:49.018
biospherians,
and the idea was to see whether

00:40:49.018 --> 00:40:52.414
humans could create a
closed biosphere that would

00:40:52.414 --> 00:40:53.646
sustain human life.

00:40:53.646 --> 00:40:57.292
And, it was a miserable
failure, which is sad because

00:40:57.292 --> 00:40:59.998
it costs a lot of money,
and has since

00:40:59.998 --> 00:41:04.664
been taken over by Columbia
University to use it as an

00:41:04.664 --> 00:41:06.474
experimental facility.

00:41:06.474 --> 00:41:09.599
But the one thing that they
learned,

00:41:09.599 --> 00:41:11.181
here's what happened.

00:41:11.181 --> 00:41:12.914
They put the people in.

00:41:12.914 --> 00:41:16.328
And it turned out that
there was not enough

00:41:16.328 --> 00:41:19.998
photosynthesis to supply enough
oxygen for the

00:41:19.998 --> 00:41:21.375
people to breathe.

00:41:21.375 --> 00:41:23.822
Oxygen levels steadily went
down.

00:41:23.822 --> 00:41:27.353
And the reason
for that, they learned later,

00:41:27.353 --> 00:41:30.398
was that they had put way too
much rich

00:41:30.398 --> 00:41:32.125
soil in the system.

00:41:32.125 --> 00:41:35.306
So, the bacteria in the soil
were

00:41:35.306 --> 00:41:38.602
sucking the oxygen out of the
atmosphere.

00:41:38.602 --> 00:41:41.867
And they were
subsidizing the system with

00:41:41.867 --> 00:41:44.536
rich soil so that people would
have

00:41:44.536 --> 00:41:45.444
enough food.

00:41:45.444 --> 00:41:49.152
But there was a puzzle,
because if this was the

00:41:49.152 --> 00:41:53.328
case, because the cycles are
coupled, you should expect to

00:41:53.328 --> 00:41:55.020
see
the same amount of,

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.922
if this oxygen is coming from
photosynthesis,

00:41:57.922 --> 00:42:00.732
you
should see the same amount of

00:42:00.732 --> 00:42:03.000
CO2 coming into the system.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.958
And you should see an increase
in CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:42:06.958 --> 00:42:08.238
And they
didn't.

00:42:08.238 --> 00:42:11.172
In other words,
they saw oxygen going down,

00:42:11.172 --> 00:42:14.107
but they didn't
see surplus CO2 in the

00:42:14.107 --> 00:42:14.911
atmosphere.

00:42:14.911 --> 00:42:18.654
And it took a bright graduate
student from Columbia

00:42:18.654 --> 00:42:22.000
University to go in there and
figure out what was

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:22.657
going on.

00:42:22.657 --> 00:42:26.311
And it turned out that,
so why didn't CO2 increase?

00:42:26.311 --> 00:42:28.549
It
turned out that this CO2,

00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:31.500
which was coming out of the
system from

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:35.273
respiration in the soil was
actually binding to the calcium

00:42:35.273 --> 00:42:39.693
hydroxide in
the cement and making calcium

00:42:39.693 --> 00:42:41.000
carbonate.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.659
So, the cement,
another human invention,

00:42:43.659 --> 00:42:46.142
was playing an important
role here.

00:42:46.142 --> 00:42:50.000
The point is that none of this,
this is only understandable

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.382
in hindsight,
because it didn't work.

00:42:52.382 --> 00:42:55.469
You can go in and figure out,
what the heck,

00:42:55.469 --> 00:42:57.961
where did these imbalances come
from?

00:42:57.961 --> 00:43:00.544
So, it was a
very interesting study,

00:43:00.544 --> 00:43:03.500
and we learned that it's not
easy to mimic

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:08.000
natural biosphere on a very
small scale.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.725
OK, I'm going to skip that one,
and come to this real quickly,

00:43:12.725 --> 00:43:16.000
because
this was just on the news this

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
morning as I was driving into
work.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.007
I thought, perfect for this
lecture.

00:43:22.007 --> 00:43:26.744
The UN just announced this
millennium ecosystem

00:43:26.744 --> 00:43:27.979
assessment.

00:43:27.979 --> 00:43:30.000
It's on the web.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.764
And 2,000 scientists have been
working on this for over ten

00:43:33.764 --> 00:43:36.288
years
trying to assess the state of

00:43:36.288 --> 00:43:40.537
the global ecosystems and their
capability to support future

00:43:40.537 --> 00:43:42.364
generations, i.e.
you guys.

00:43:42.364 --> 00:43:44.532
And
they say the next 50 years,

00:43:44.532 --> 00:43:47.141
and those are the 50 years that
you guys

00:43:47.141 --> 00:43:49.886
are in charge,
are absolutely critical for

00:43:49.886 --> 00:43:52.770
whether or not these
systems will sustain,

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:55.073
be able to sustain human
populations.

00:43:55.073 --> 00:43:58.175
So you
can go to the web if you're

00:43:58.175 --> 00:44:00.000
interested in that.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.615
OK, quickly to our civil and
environmental engineering major,

00:44:04.615 --> 00:44:07.173
I'm
just going to say that our new

00:44:07.173 --> 00:44:09.492
motto is nature,
tools, and toys,

00:44:09.492 --> 00:44:11.363
that
nature is ecology.

00:44:11.363 --> 00:44:14.090
There is a two series ecology
course.

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:16.363
Tools are
mechanics: basics,

00:44:16.363 --> 00:44:18.939
fundamentals for analyzing
systems.

00:44:18.939 --> 00:44:20.593
And toys is
design.

00:44:20.593 --> 00:44:25.000
The part of the curriculum is
going to be designing

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000
instrumentation for studying
environmental systems.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.097
And there are these brochures
here and in the back.

00:44:34.097 --> 00:44:38.263
So I encourage you
to pick those up if you're at

00:44:38.263 --> 00:44:40.708
all interested in that major.

00:44:40.708 --> 00:44:43.946
Now, let
me show you this cool clip.

00:44:43.946 --> 00:44:45.315
Don't leave yet.

00:44:45.315 --> 00:44:46.769
This is worth it.

00:44:46.769 --> 00:44:48.827
It's
only two minutes,

00:44:48.827 --> 00:44:51.009
and its nature at its best.

00:44:51.009 --> 00:44:54.283
So, all I need to do here
is hit play.

00:44:54.283 --> 00:44:58.162
And this is the soccer player's
look like this.

00:44:58.162 --> 00:45:20.000
Oh, why
didn't that work.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
myofauna are little bugs in the
sand.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:52.000
That's my favorite part.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Life is a geological agent.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:23.250
See, that would have been a
great

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:26.876
kick off for spring break,
but welcome back from spring

00:46:26.876 --> 00:46:27.279
break.

00:46:27.279 --> 00:46:29.627
All
right, I'll see you in a few

00:46:29.627 --> 00:46:30.627
weeks.
