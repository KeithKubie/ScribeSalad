00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.144
To get rid of our log here, we need to take both sides as the exponent of 10.

00:00:05.144 --> 00:00:11.320
The left hand side becomes 10 to the 1.1, and on the right hand side that will

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.920
just leave us with J over C. Now let's use our calculator. 10 to the 1.1 is

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:28.310
equal to 12.589 and so on, or rounded, about 12.6. So what does this mean?

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.170
Well, that means that the intensity of the Japenese earthquake was about 12.6

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.165
times greater than the worst California recorded earthquake.
