00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:40.600
It's time to get back to learning.
A couple of announcements before we

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
get started: tomorrow there will be
a 10 minute quiz in recitation based

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
upon the content of homework one.
Obviously, it's not going to be a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
question identical to something
you've done, but it's going to cover

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that subject matter.
So, please don't bring in your

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
attorney if I didn't ask a question
that's identical to one

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:47.780
that you've worked.
Second thing, we started talking

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.360
about the periodic table,
and I believe that it's a hallmark

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.940
of any educated person in the 21st
century who is technically literate

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.520
to know the periodic table by heart.
And so, there will be another test.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.100
It will be on the 23rd on a
Thursday, ten minutes.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.680
You will be asked to write down the
periodic table.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.260
But, you don't have to do the whole
table. We're going to leave out the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.840
lanthanides and actinides.
So, this is what it's going to look

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.420
like. You'll have S block,
P block, and D block elements.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:36.306
Identical to this, you can see this
was September 18.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If I could just ask if the people
can fix the video,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
it's just a little bit set off to
the left here.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, this is what you'll get.
You'll get 10 minutes to fill it in,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and people grouse about it.
They say, oh, this is rote learning.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This went out at the end of the
19th century, and so on.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And I say, no, I think any of you
should know that potassium lies

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
under sodium. I bet there are
people in this room who know the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
lyrics to over 1,
00 songs, know the number of every

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
individual in the National
Basketball Association,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
so I think that learning some subset
of elements is not unreasonable.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:02:03.160
Everybody's done it in the past.
They grouse about it when I assign

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.330
it, and they all do it within a
minute. And then,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.490
they're proud of it and they insist
that I, not inflict,

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.660
but rather induce you,
invite you to do the same thing.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.830
But, I don't want to leave out the
lanthanides and actinides.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:35.726
So, we're going to have contests
for mnemonics.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:22.440
So, lanthanum,
cerium, praseodymium,

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.880
and so on. So, here's an example of
a mnemonic. So,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.330
there will be two of these contests,
one for lanthanides, one for

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.770
actinides. Submitted by e-mail by 5
p.m. eastern daylight time to my

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.220
office to my e-mail address.
So, this is an example: lazy

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.660
college professors never produced
officially educated graduates to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.100
dramatically help executives trim
yearly losses.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.550
And if you remember this phrase,
I don't know why you would, but this

00:02:46.550 --> 00:03:06.033
will help you learn the
lanthanides in order.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:54.710
You can see that this obviously came
from industry.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.420
There's a reference to executives.
There is the slur against the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.140
academy here: lazy college
professors. I mean,

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.850
they have no idea how hard we work,
and look at this gigantic split

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.570
infinitive, to dramatically help.
We can do better. So, this is 3.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.280
91 winners from previous years.
This is one. [LAUGHTER] Clearly,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:36.493
this was not referring to the 3.09
professor.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:27.130
There's other ways to take chemistry
at MIT. In fact,

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.260
there's a whole chemistry department
full of loony chemistry professors.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.390
Here's another one. This one
piqued my interest.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.530
I like the engineering theory of it.
That's what I liked.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.660
But now, this is the piece de
resistance. I've been doing this

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.790
for many years,
and all of a sudden comes a sonnet.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.930
There are 14 f-block elements, and
an Elizabethan sonnet

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.230
contains 14 lines.
Well, OK, this looks good,

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.690
and so there is the cerium,
praseodymium, neodymium, you know,

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.150
three stanzas, four lines apiece
with the rhyming couplet at the end.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.610
But what's really shocking is when
you compare this with this,

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.070
it's based upon sonnet 57 because
lanthanum is element 57.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.530
This is really, really good.
And, I mean, I wouldn't just give

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:38.860
it to him because he wrote a sonnet.
But there were some key points here.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:27.900
You see he mentioned smelting.
And, as an extractive metallurgist,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.810
that took the cake. When he said
smelting, I said,

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.720
OK, you got it. So,
I think this is something to think

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.630
about. We'll wait before we go to
that one, blank on that one.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.540
So, the contest, the prizes are
neckties, and ladies' scarves.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.380
They're very hot.
They're black with colored elements

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.150
of the periodic table.
It's very nice. Don't laugh,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.920
I'll bring samples next date. They
really look sharp,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.690
very sharp. There's all kinds of
gift giving coming down the road.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.460
You never know when one of these
could just do the trick.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.230
So, don't fail to enter.
And, I will have office hours today

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:34.926
starting at about 3:30 to 4:30 if
you want to see me.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
By all means, go to your own
recitation instructor as well.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So, last date we were looking at
some early taxonomy,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and then on to a little bit more
about the interior of the atom.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And, we looked at the
representation of elements in the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
periodic table where we have the
proton number,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
z, which is equal to the number of
electrons in the neutral atom,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and the atomic mass which is the sum
of the proton number and the neutron

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
number. We talked about
isotopes, and whatnot.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.600
Today, I want to continue.
So far, we've put looking at static

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.200
elements. But most people think of
chemistry as involving reactions.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.800
So, let's look at dynamics,
reactions between chemicals.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.400
So, how would we describe a
chemical reaction?

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.000
What are the rules?
Well, the first thing you do is you

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.600
write an equation.
And, the equation is subject to

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.200
these constraints.
First of all, we invoke Dalton's

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:22.630
Law.
We invoke Dalton's Law of molar

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.900
proportions, and secondly we write
it subject to conservation of mass.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.180
We write it subject to conservation
of mass. And,

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.450
I mean literally,
mass, not mole number.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.720
And, let's look at this.
This is probably best seen by

00:06:43.720 --> 00:07:01.040
example. So, let's look
at a simple one.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:54.530
This is the calcination of limestone.
Limestone is calcium carbonate,

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.070
and at about 900Ã­C, calcium
carbonate decomposes to give lime or

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.610
calcium oxide plus carbon dioxide
**CaCO3 --&gt;CaO + CO2**.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:11.150
And, this is used as the first step
for making cement concrete.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.690
And so, when you think about how
much cement concrete are consumed

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:22.230
annually on the planet,
this becomes a considerable point

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.920
source of greenhouse gas emissions.
And as you know,

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.760
carbon dioxide is implicated as a
greenhouse gas.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.610
And, there's a huge amount of CO2
that comes from this process.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.460
This is also used in steelmaking
and so on. So,

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.300
anything on the left side of the
equation is called a reactant,

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.150
and anything on the right side of
the equation is called a product.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:08:05.166
So, the products react to give us
reactants.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:55.090
And, just to show some of the hidden
balance here, here we have one mole.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:08:00.180
I don't put a one in front. We
just take one for granted.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:05.270
So, there's 1 mole of calcium
carbonate. That gives us 1 mole of

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:10.360
calcium oxide and 1 mole of carbon
dioxide. So, here we have 2 mole,

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.450
and here we have 1 mole. So, what's
the conservation of mass if we

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:20.350
divide by the atomic masses here?
We will get 100.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:25.050
g of calcium carbonate and then
discover that we have 56.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:29.760
g of calcium oxide, and 44 g of
carbon dioxide.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.460
So, clearly, mass is conserved,
not mole numbers. And, if you have

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.170
trouble balancing equations,
you can look in section 2.11 in the

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.880
text. And, they go through some
mechanics. But now,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.580
I want to look at what happens when
things are not in proper proportion.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.290
So, in other words, what happens if
we put a bunch of elements,

00:08:53.290 --> 00:09:12.913
compounds into a reactor but they
are not in the balanced amounts?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:09:02.880
And so, for that,
I want to look at the production of

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.770
titanium by the Kroll process.
And, this involves the reaction of

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.660
titanium tetrachloride with
magnesium to form magnesium chloride

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.550
plus titanium **TiCl4 + 2 Mg --
2 MgCl2 + Ti**. And, this was

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:23.100
invented in 1937 by W. J. Kroll.
While he was still in Luxembourg,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:29.300
just before World War II broke out,
he emigrated to the United States

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:47.300
and finished his career in the
Pacific Northwest where he helped

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:21.700
make huge quantities of titanium.
And, this reaction is performed in

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:27.900
a giant batch type reactor in which
you feed titanium tetrachloride and

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:52.930
magnesium and heat to about 900Ã­C.
And, as the reaction goes,

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:56.790
we'll have some magnesium liquid
sitting on top of magnesium chloride

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.660
liquid, and then chunks of titanium
solid forming at the bottom with

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.530
titanium chloride gas above.
And, this is a really clever

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.390
reaction because titanium
tetrachloride is a gas.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.260
So, it's obviously buoyant.
Magnesium is a liquid but it's less

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.130
dense than magnesium chloride.
So, as these products form, they

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:36.260
continue to fall out of the way and
keep this interface open.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:23.660
So, the reaction can keep going.
And at the end of the reaction, you

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.330
have the reactor consumed of
titanium tetrachloride magnesium.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.990
You have salt on top, and you have
titanium on the bottom.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.660
And, this is what the stuff looks
like. Earlier this summer I was at

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.330
a smelter in Japan,
the largest titanium smelter on the

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.990
planet. And this is coming out of
one of these reactors.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.660
This is both 3 m across,
and about 6 m tall. This is

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.330
titanium sponge that comes out of
the bottom of this reactor,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:11:09.193
and it subsequently re-melted in a
vacuum arc furnace.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:57.760
And, these are giant billets of
solid titanium weighing tens of tons.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.530
OK, so let's say some young
engineer is on the job the first day

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:07.300
and says, OK, let's put in 200 kg of
tickle, and let's put in about 25 kg

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:12.070
of mag. I'm using the typical terms.
Nobody says titanium tetrachloride.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:16.840
It's tickle. This is mag. I had a
graduate student.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:21.610
She was a brilliant Ph.
. student of mine and she had two

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:26.230
dogs.
This is parenthetical.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.690
And, she loved metallurgy as I do,
and she named one of her dogs Maggie,

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:35.150
and one of her dogs Molly,
magnesium and molybdenum. Boy,

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:39.610
you have no sense of humor
whatsoever. Either that or you are

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:44.070
dog lovers and you are offended by
giving them metallic names.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:48.530
I don't know. All right, so what
happens? What does this engineer

00:11:48.530 --> 00:12:07.060
give us? What is the yield?
What is the yield?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:58.270
OK, so what we have to do is get
back underneath this reaction,

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:03.540
and see what the molar quantities
are. So, titanium tetrachloride,

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:08.810
magnesium, I've got 200 kg here, 25
kg here, and if I divide by the

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:14.080
appropriate quantities,
I'll discover I have a little over 1,

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:19.360
00 moles of tickle,
and I've got about 1,

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.780
00 moles of mag.
But, the reaction says I need twice

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:27.360
as much mag as tickle if this
reaction is going to go to

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.940
completion. Clearly,
this isn't twice that.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.520
In fact, it's even less than that.
So, we've got a problem here. This

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.100
is much less that two times 1,
54, so therefore mag is the limiting

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.670
reagent. Mag is the limiting
reagent. And,

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:45.250
that's going to gate the yield.
It's going to control the yield.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.830
The yield is going to be throttled
by magnesium. So,

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.410
how much titanium can I make?
I can only make as much titanium as

00:12:52.410 --> 00:13:11.353
is consumed by the available
magnesium.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:13:01.110
So, if I look at the mole ratios on
the reaction over there,

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:06.220
I'm going to find that I'll be able
to consume, at most,

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:11.330
1,029 over two, right?
Two moles of mag consume one mole

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:16.440
of tickle, giving us one mole of Ti,
and that's 515 moles of tickle

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.380
consumed.
And then, that produces 515 moles

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:26.150
titanium. And then I convert that
to mass, and that gives me 24.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:30.920
kg of titanium. If I charged the
reactor in this manner,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.680
and of course I'm assuming 100%
completion of the reaction which we

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.450
know is overly optimistic.
There may be some inefficiencies,

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:45.220
and at some point, if you catch me
in the hallway,

00:13:45.220 --> 00:14:04.373
I can give you a sermon on what goes
on inside that reactor.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:53.760
OK, so now the question is,
how do we know the first place that

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.520
this is a suitable reductant?
How do we know that mag will reduce

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.290
titanium tetrachloride?
Well, for this, we have to look

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:05.050
inside the atom.
And as I'm going to do many times

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.820
in 3.091, I'm going to start a unit
like this with a history lesson.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.580
So, let's go back to the thrilling
days of the end of the 19th century,

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.350
and just take stock. What did we
know at the end of the 19th century

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:20.110
about the structure of the atom?
Well, first of all, we knew that

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.930
the atom was electrically neutral.
We knew that the negative charge is

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.790
carried by some particles called
electrons. Furthermore,

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.660
the electron has a very tiny mass in
comparison to that of the overall

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.530
atom. I mean,
the atom has a tiny mass,

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.390
too, but what we are saying is
compared to the totaled atomic mass,

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:43.260
the mass of the electron is tiny.
And, secondly,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.130
the bulk of the atom is positive.
If the atom is fixed mass, the

00:14:47.130 --> 00:15:05.660
electron is tiny, not
massive, then -

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:55.250
It must be the positives have all
the mass. So,

00:14:55.250 --> 00:15:15.133
the question then is what is the
spatial distribution of charge

00:14:39.500 --> 00:15:03.750
inside the atom?
Why do we want to know the answer

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:22.900
to that question?
Because that's going to give clues

00:14:48.000 --> 00:15:12.250
as to reactivity.
So, what do we know about spatial

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:31.533
distribution? Well,
people took a stab at modeling it,

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:20.750
and the first model worth talking
about is that of J.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:39.500
J. Thompson, who published this
model in 1904.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:28.570
He was a professor of physics at
Cambridge University,

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:32.140
and he was also the director of the
Cavendish Laboratory.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.710
Or I guess they would say
laboratory. So,

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.280
he was the director of the
laboratory, and Cavendish made a

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.850
fortune in the 1700s,
and willed it to Cambridge.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:46.420
And so, they established this
laboratory in his name.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:16:05.640
And, here's the essence of what J.
J. said.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.200
He said that the electrons were
distributed throughout a uniformly

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:44.400
charged positive sphere of atomic
dimensions. So,

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:52.000
electrons distributed throughout --

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000
-- a uniformly charged
positive sphere --

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.500
-- uniformly charged positive sphere,

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.500
and let me finish it,
of atomic dimension. So,

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.500
essentially you've got a positive
ball which is identical to

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:19.000
the size of the atom.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.300
This was termed the plum pudding
model. This is cultural bias,

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:47.590
of course. This is a British term.
I've never eaten the stuff. I

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:51.890
don't know if I'd eat it if it were
put in front of me,

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:56.190
but anyways, I'm told that it looks
something like this,

00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:00.490
that you have the custard with
little fragments of plum inside.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:04.790
So, this is a positive sphere of
custard, and inside are little,

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.090
negative bits. This is the plum.
And, these bits are in motion. So,

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:13.390
the bulk of the atom is positive.
That's where the mass resides.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:17.690
And, you get these tiny little
negatives running around.

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:36.113
So, the negatives are, these are
negative.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:26.420
They are physically small.
They are very light, that is to say,

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.850
low mass. They are mobile.
They're moving around, and the

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:35.280
worst thing is that J.
J., in 1897 did the pioneering work

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.710
that got him the Nobel Prize.
He measured the charge to mass

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:44.140
ratio of the electron.
But, he didn't use the term of

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.560
electron. He called this negative
elemental particle the corpuscle.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:18:07.120
He called it the corpuscle of
electric charge.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:57.330
And, he kept referring to them as
corpuscles. And I'm really glad

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.660
that along came Johnstone Stony,
who was an electrochemist, the

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.990
noblest form of chemistry,
and as an electrochemist, he chose

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:10.330
the term for the element of an
electric charge,

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:14.660
the electron, coming from the Greek
word for amber because,

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:33.520
you know, if you rub amber you get
static charge.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:23.700
So, thank goodness,
Stony triumphed. Otherwise,

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.410
we'd be talking about corpuscular
mail. You'd have c-mail.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:33.110
You wouldn't have e-mail.
All right, so anyways, so all right

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:37.820
we have a theory.
It's 1904. What's the method of

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.520
science? You have a theory; what do
you do? Put it to the test.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.230
So, who puts it to the test?
Ernest Rutherford. Ernest

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:51.940
Rutherford: he was a professor of
physics as well,

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.640
but he was at Victoria University in
Manchester just up the

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.760
road from Cambridge.
Both of these were in the UK in the

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.300
early part of the 20th century.
And, he conducted experiments to

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.840
test the plum pudding model.
Basically what he did is he took a

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.380
very thin metal foil,
and he bombarded it with charged

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.920
particles. And,
here's the Rutherford experiment.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.460
It's taken right out of your text.
But, before I go into details, a

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:37.786
little bit more background
about Rutherford.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:25.460
Rutherford was an interesting person.
He was born in New Zealand,

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.930
and he came from a farming family.
He was the first generation to go

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.390
to college, grew up in the farms,
and as such, he was very skilled

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.860
with machining.
He was very handy.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.330
He was a brilliant experimentalist.
That's not to say he wasn't a

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.790
brilliant thinker,
but here the gift of a good minds

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:46.260
and good hands,
like the two parts of the MIT logo:

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.250
two parts rolled into one.
He did his Ph.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:54.750
. He managed to get a fellowship,
and he came to the UK all the way

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:59.250
from New Zealand.
He got his Ph.D. under J.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:03.750
J. Thompson at Cambridge. And there,
he studied radiation coming from

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:08.250
radioactive elements,
and he categorized to different

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:12.750
types of radiation,
which he termed alpha and beta,

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:17.250
and what he found was that the alpha
radiation as he studied it was very

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.750
good at ionizing gases whereas beta
radiation was not so good

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:26.410
at ionizing gases.
On the other hand,

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:31.240
when it came to penetrating solids,
penetrating solids, the alpha

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.080
radiation was poor at penetrating
solids, whereas the beta radiation

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.910
was very good at penetrating solids.
So, you see, this is formative

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:45.740
information. He understood the
interaction of particles of matter,

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:50.580
and that's important to set the
stage for the Rutherford experiment

00:20:50.580 --> 00:21:10.026
in Manchester about 10 years later.
He took a job teaching,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
went to another part of the British
Empire and went to Canada,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
got a job at McGill. And, he worked
for a little less than 10 years at

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
McGill where he did more work on
these particles that radiate from

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
radioactive elements.
And there he was able to identify

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
the alpha particle as the helium
nucleus. It's helium denuded of

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
both of its electrons.
So, all that's left is the helium

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
nucleus, two protons,
two neutrons. And, for this,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
he got the Nobel Prize in 1908 in
physics.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:30.530
Let me just check that,
yes, no, excuse me. He got it in

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:34.070
chemistry. And why I'm hesitating
is, in the early days of the 20th

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.610
century, the Nobels were first given
in 1901. But,

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:41.150
we'll see as 3.
91 progresses, people working almost

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.690
on the same topic,
making new discoveries out of the

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:48.230
same lab, one of them might
subsequently win the

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:52.060
Nobel in physics.
One might win it in chemistry

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:56.190
because the disciplines weren't as
diverse as they are today.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:00.330
So, that's why I hesitate.
So, he got the Nobel in chemistry,

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:04.460
which made him a hot property
academically. And so,

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.590
he got hired to come to the UK,
and got the job at Victoria

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.730
University after bagging a Nobel in
chemistry. By the way,

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:16.860
he didn't outdo his adviser,
J. J. J. J. already got his Nobel

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:35.986
in 1906 for that work on the
charge to mass ratio.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:25.530
So, let's give him his credit,
Nobel in physics. I rather suspect

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:30.060
if J. J. hadn't gotten his Nobel,
it probably would have been tough

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.590
for Rutherford to get one since some
of these guys stood on the

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:39.130
committees. But,
it's just a speculation.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:43.660
All right, so now, let's get on and
talk about the experiment.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:48.190
So, what we've got here is a source
of alpha particles.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:52.730
Alpha particles are these helium
nuclei, and they are the result of

00:22:52.730 --> 00:23:11.926
radioactive decay.
So, you've got polonium or thorium

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
sitting inside this leaded box with
one opening. And so,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
we've got a beam. And,
these particles are of extremely

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
high energy, very,
very high energy. And,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
they strike a thin foil of metal.
And, Rutherford tried various

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
metals. But, the famous experiment
is attributed to the use of gold.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
We've known since antiquity that
you could take gold,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
and you can hammer to very,
very thin foil.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:29.160
And, in this case,
they had foil that was less than a

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:33.330
micrometer thick.
This was 600 nanometers thick,

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:37.490
very, very thin. And, so the
experiment was to bombard the foil

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:41.660
with these alpha particles,
and that measure what happens to

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:45.830
them. So, we have to be able to
detect them. And so,

00:23:45.830 --> 00:24:05.926
Rutherford had a fellow working in
his lab by the name of Geiger.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:54.260
And, Geiger invented a detector.
It's called the scintillation

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:58.530
screen. He ultimately invented the
Geiger counter that bears his name.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:02.790
But, he built a scintillation
screen, which is essentially a cloth

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:07.060
fiber that was covered with zinc
sulfide. And,

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:11.330
when zinc sulfide is hit by
particles or by anything,

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:15.590
by radiation or by particles of
greater than a certain critical

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:19.860
energy, there is a glow.
That's from the Latin word

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:24.050
scintilla, OK, spark.
So, you sit. You get graduate

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:28.170
students or some other form of cheap
labor and he had them sit in front

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:32.290
of the scintillation screen,
and they count. They count where

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:36.400
these particles hit the screen.
And then, what they did is they

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.520
made a map of where the particles
scattered once they struck the

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.640
screen. And, here's what their
findings were.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.760
The important findings of note are
the following.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.880
First of all, the majority of the
alpha particles were transmitted

00:24:52.880 --> 00:25:11.893
through the screen, OK, majority,
vast majority.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:25:03.570
Majority of alphas transmitted,
that means, when I use the term

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:10.140
transmitted that means passing
through in the direction that they

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:16.710
were originally traveling,
transmitted and some deflected

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:22.150
through small angles.
And, I'm going to abbreviate,

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:26.470
just put theta. On what else do you
use theta for,

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:30.780
if not angles? So,
deflected through small angles.

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:35.100
That's the main thing that they
observed, but there's a second thing.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.410
And this was really,
really shocking. A tiny fraction of

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:43.730
the incident alpha particles were
deflected through large angles.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:48.050
By large angles, I mean greater
than 90Ã­, essentially coming back in

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:52.360
the direction from which they came.
OK, so tiny fraction, tiny fraction

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.680
of alphas, tiny fraction of incident
alphas, tiny fraction of incident

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:14.826
alphas deflected through
large angles.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:26:11.200
And that, I mean,

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.620
greater than 90Ã­. So,
this is called back scattering.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:20.040
And, in fact, there's a technique
of analysis used today that's called

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:24.450
Rutherford back scattering where
people actually saw that this is a

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.870
means of identifying the substance,
the sample. The scattering is an

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:33.280
indication of the nature of the
substance. And,

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.700
this was a surprise because when you
take a look at what that gold foil

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.120
constitutes in the way of a
resistance to a beam of charged

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.530
particles of 7.
8 million electron volts,

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.950
when Rutherford learned of these
results, he said,

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:55.370
this is akin to having a 15 inch
artillery shell deflect back from a

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:59.790
piece of tissue paper,
to give you a sense of the relative

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:03.840
scales.
If you took a 15 inch artillery

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.530
shell moving at the velocity it
typically goes at,

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.230
and take that amount of kinetic
energy versus the resistive capacity

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:14.920
of a sheet of tissue paper,
that's the scale that we're looking

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.610
at here. It was absolutely
astonishing. So,

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:22.300
they thought about this,
and they said, you know, this cannot

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:42.333
make sense from the standpoint of
the plum pudding model.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
This can't make sense because the
plum pudding model says you've got

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
uniformly distributed charge.
So, if I've got positive charge

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
uniformly distributed,
look at the choice. It's a

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
brilliant experiment.
He didn't shoot neutrals.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
He shot alpha particles which have
a charge of plus two.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
So, I've got plus twos,
zooming in at high energy against a

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:53.720
wall of positive charge.
And, most of the stuff goes flying

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.160
through. So, you just say,
well, this is like a bullet going

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.610
through pumpkin.
So, what's the big deal?

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:04.050
But, how do you explain some of
these going way,

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:07.490
way back. And, that's what
Rutherford says,

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.940
this can't be right.
I'm going to come up with something

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:14.380
else. I'm going to come up with
this model. I'm going to say that

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.830
the positive charge is not uniformly
distributed. I'm going to say,

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:21.270
quite to the contrary, the positive
charge is concentrated at the center

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:26.290
in a tiny, tiny, tiny volume.
So, I've got this tiny volume with,

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:32.890
in the case of gold 79 plus of
charge, and I've got some electrons

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:39.490
out here somewhere,
and the vast majority of the atom is

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:46.090
nothing. Isn't this a lot like
Democritus? Being and void,

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:52.690
being and void, so now I've got my
plus two little projectile coming in,

00:28:52.690 --> 00:29:10.946
and plus two zooms right through.
But, there is a positive 79,

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:43.500
so the positives deflect. And so,
there is a little bit of deflection

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.500
because plus repels plus.
But once in awhile, one of these

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:53.500
plus twos comes in almost on axis,
and it gets whipped around by the

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:58.500
Coulombic repulsive forces.
So, that's Rutherford's explanation

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:22.770
of this set of data.
Oh, by the way,

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:26.330
there is a third person.
There's Rutherford, there's Geiger,

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.880
there's Marsden. Marsden is an
interesting character.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.440
Marsden was not too different from
you. Marsden was essentially a UROP.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.990
He'd left school for a couple of
years. He hadn't gotten his

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:40.550
undergrad yet.
He'd come back,

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:44.100
and Rutherford accepted him in his
lab. I think the man was something

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.660
like 20 years of age.
So, he says to Marsden,

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:51.220
take these data. I'm going to give
you the data set of the scattering

00:29:51.220 --> 00:30:10.273
angles of the atoms.
And, he says, give me a model for

00:29:35.700 --> 00:30:01.100
this. That's the assignment.
Get busy. So, Marsden came up with

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:20.366
the model, and as you go through 8.
2 and you understand electrostatics

00:29:46.500 --> 00:30:11.900
and electrodynamics,
you'll be able to do this analysis.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:30.366
B is the assumed cross-section of
the nucleus. And then, on

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:02.000
either side is nothing.
So, you've got a huge distance

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
between center to center.
And, so all Marsden is doing is

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
asking, what must be the,
if I've got a wall of nothing with

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
spots of high positive charge,
and this is my scattering data,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
what must be the relative size of
the spots versus the nothing?

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
And, he solved the problem. And,
he concluded, let's get his name on

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
the board. Heck,
he deserves to have his name on the

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
board, Marsden.
So, Marsden concluded by his

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
analysis that the radius of the
nucleus, and this is Rutherford,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:58.080
by the way, coining this term.
It's a nuclear model.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.240
The radius of the nucleus as
compared to the radius of the entire

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:06.410
atom is on the order of about one to
10,000. So, indeed,

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:10.580
we are talking about a lot of void
and a tiny little bit of extremely

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.740
dense being. So,
they published this.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:18.910
And, what's the result?
You would think, well, they finally

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:23.060
solved it, it's terrific.
Hurray! No - it's science.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:27.190
They tear each other's eyes out.
The reaction to a model was

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:31.330
strongly negative.
Derision was the typical reaction.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:35.460
They said, look, this is stupid.
First of all, this thing can't

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:39.590
sustain itself.
You've got a positive charge here

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:43.730
with a negative charge around it.
Coulomb's law says the negative

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:47.860
will be attracted to the positive,
and the atom will collapse. So,

00:31:47.860 --> 00:32:06.786
that's their first objection,
nuclear collapse.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:57.660
All the electrons fall into the
nucleus. The data suggests that's

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:03.330
what it is. The problem is that the
theory of the day can't explain it.

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:08.990
So, of course, theoreticians
bristle. It's Huxley that said woe

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:14.660
to the slaying of a beautiful theory
by an ugly fact,

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:20.330
nuclear collapse.
So, the Coulombic forces,

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:38.993
Coulombic or electrostatic forces
draw...I don't need to write it.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:29.420
You know what it means.
They're Coulombic forces,

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.850
end of story. All right, number two.
Second, even if it didn't collapse,

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:36.280
they said you've got a radiation
problem. You've got negative charge

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:39.710
in motion, and it's in a circular
orbit. And, you know acceleration

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:43.140
means either change of speed or
change of direction.

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.560
You will learn in 8.
2 that if you have a charged body

00:32:46.560 --> 00:33:06.586
changing direction,
that constitutes an acceleration.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:55.380
And, it will be accompanied by
radiation. Radiation is the

00:32:55.380 --> 00:33:00.760
emission of energy.
And so, again, this thing will run

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:06.150
out of gas. So,
an energy deficit,

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:11.530
accelerating charge,
the accelerating negative charge,

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:16.920
because it's the negatives that are
orbiting the positive center.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:22.300
And that means radiation of energy,
and that energy has to come from

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:27.350
inside the atom itself.
So, on both counts,

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:32.070
they say this is no good.
It's no good. Well, time marches

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:36.780
on. 1912: interesting.
A young Danish scientist by the

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:41.490
name of Niels Bohr,
he just finished his Ph.

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:46.210
. in Copenhagen, and he had won
himself a postdoctoral fellowship,

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:50.920
courtesy of the Carlsberg Brewery
foundation. Carlsberg Brewery for

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:55.640
many years has sponsored scientific
research through the Carlsberg

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.920
Foundation.
So, Niels had a Ph.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.760
. and a Carlsberg Foundation
Fellowship. And he decided,

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.610
well, I'm interested in modern
physics. There is some conflict in

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:11.460
the air. One of the proponents is J.
J. Thompson. One of the proponents

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:15.300
is Ernest Rutherford.
I know what I'll do. I'll spend

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:19.150
six months with J.
J. in Cambridge, and I'll spend six

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:37.700
months with Rutherford
in Manchester.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:27.920
And that's what he set out to do.
So, he goes to Cambridge, and he

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:32.840
spends six months with Thompson.
And then, he heads up north. And

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.760
then, he spends only three months in
Manchester, not because he didn't

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.690
like Rutherford.
Actually, it was quite the contrary.

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:47.610
He far preferred Rutherford to
Thompson. But,

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:52.530
he got a teaching job,
and so he zoomed back to Denmark to

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:57.540
assume his teaching duties.
And, during the time of his

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:02.630
interactions with Thompson and
Rutherford, he got to thinking about

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:07.720
a way to explain the observations of
Rutherford. And so,

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:12.810
he finished the manuscript back in
Copenhagen. In Copenhagen,

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:17.900
he completes the manuscript and -
I'm going to write MS for manuscript

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:36.800
- completes the manuscript,
and submits this for publication.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:26.860
It's a paper that describes a model
to explain the results.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.730
So, you see how we are oscillating
back and forth?

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:34.590
J. J. Thompson,
model. Rutherford,

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:38.460
experimental data. Now,
Bohr comes with a new improved model.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.330
So, obviously,
what's going to have to happen next

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:46.190
is some more data to test Bohr's
model. So, first of all,

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:50.060
let's take a look at how we conduct
science. I said Bohr

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:53.750
came up with a model.
How do we find out about it?

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:57.250
Did we read about it in the New
York Times? Did we see it on the

00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:00.750
nightly news? No,
people publish, and this is the

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:04.250
publication of Bohr's model.
It's in a scientific journal that

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.750
goes back to the 1600's.
It's called Philosophical Magazine

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:11.250
and Journal of Science.
People just know it as Phil Mag.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.750
It's 1913. It's London, Edinburgh,
and Dublin. You see Ireland was

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:18.250
part of the United Kingdom at that
time. So, Dublin was a British city

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:21.870
at the time this is published.
All right, July,

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:25.620
1913, blow this up,
so On the Constitution of Atoms and

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:29.370
Molecules by N.
Bohr, Doctor of Philosophy,

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:33.120
Copenhagen, asterisk here, and I've
blown up the bottom of the page,

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.870
communicated by Professor Ernest
Rutherford, F.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:40.620
.S., Fellow of the Royal Society.
So, only a member of the Royal

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:44.370
Society could read the paper into
the proceedings,

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:48.120
into the session of the society for
subsequent publication.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.890
And, this was July 1913.
So, we're going to read.

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:55.680
We're going to read this together.
I want you to see how science is

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.470
conducted. So,
introduction, "in order to explain

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:03.250
the results of experiments on
scattering of alpha rays by matter,

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:07.040
Professor Rutherford," and there is
a footnote to the Rutherford model.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.830
So, if you go and read Phil Mag
669-1911, you'll see Rutherford's

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.620
model as it's presented.
"Professor Rutherford has given a

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:18.410
theory of the structure of atoms.
According to this theory, the atoms

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:22.200
consist of a positively charged
nucleus surrounded by a stream of

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:42.466
electrons kept together by
attractive forces from the nucleus.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:29.370
The total negative charge of the
electrons is equal to the positive

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:32.740
charge of the nucleus.
Further, the nucleus is assumed to

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:36.120
be the seat of the essential part of
the mass of the atom,

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.490
and to have linear dimensions
exceedingly small compared with the

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:42.870
linear dimensions of the whole atom.
This is beautiful writing. It's

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.240
crystal clear.
It was written by someone almost

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.620
100 years ago whose native language
isn't English.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:38:10.306
You can read this and you can learn
because it's well-written.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:57.150
I invite you to read.
If you go to the library,

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:01.300
they have books. They have all of
this. "The number of electrons in

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:05.460
an atom is deduced to be
approximately equal to half the

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:09.610
atomic weight.
Great interest is to be attributed

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:13.760
to this atom model.
That's scientific talk.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.920
When someone says great interest,
that's a euphemism for embroiled in

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.940
controversy.
They don't say that nobody believes

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:25.840
this. They say great interest.
"For, as Rutherford has shown the

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:29.740
assumption of the existence of
nuclei, as those in question seems

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:33.640
to be necessary in order to account
for the results of the experiments

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.540
on large angle scattering of the
alpha rays. In an attempt to

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:41.440
explain some of the properties of
matter on the basis of this atom

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:45.340
model, we meet,
however, with the difficulties of a

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:49.240
serious nature arising from the
apparent instability of the system

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:53.140
of electrons, difficulties purposely
avoided in atom models previously

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.040
considered, for instance,
in the one proposed by Sir J.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.460
J. Thompson."
That's almost a slur.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.380
That's almost saying there are
difficulties, and you didn't treat

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:06.300
them either. You just kind of swept
them under the rug,

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.220
but now, you are out there in full
force with your knives sharpened.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:12.150
If you're so smart, why didn't you
explain it? All right,

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:15.070
so they go on, and on, and on in
talking about stability.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:35.340
But here's the brilliance.
Here's where it comes.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:22.530
"The result of the discussion of
these questions seems to be a

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:27.060
general acknowledgment of the
inadequacy of classical

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:31.590
electrodynamics in describing the
behavior of systems of atomic size.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:36.130
So, he basically says, you know
what? I can't explain this because

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:40.660
classical physics doesn't work at
atomic dimensions.

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:45.190
He says, I plead guilty,
but your physics is useless at this

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:49.730
length scale. So,
we are even. Now, let's start all

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:54.140
over.
Size dependent behavior: that's what

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:58.420
nanotechnology is about,
isn't it? If everything is the same,

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.710
you know, when you were a kid
someone would say,

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:06.990
which has a higher boiling point,
a quart of water or a gallon of

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:11.280
water? And the answer is,
well, water boils at 100Ã­C,

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:15.570
ha, ha, ha. Well, guess what?
If I get you down to a cluster of

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:19.850
about 30 water molecules,
the boiling point is a function of

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:24.150
the size of the water droplet.
Now, that's new.

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:28.460
That's new. But normally,
no. So, Bohr came way ahead of the

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:32.760
game. Now, let's take a look at the
Bohr model of the atom.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:37.070
Let's see what's in there.
Here it is. These are the Bohr

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:41.380
postulates. And,
the stuff will be posted at the

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:45.690
website so you don't have to copy it
all down. It's just taken out of

00:40:45.690 --> 00:41:05.113
the reading of lecture notes.
So, it's a planetary model.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000
And, it involves a single electron
orbiting a positively charged

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:42.000
nucleus. OK, this is the Bohr model,
Bohr model of the atom is planetary

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.000
or nuclear. OK,
and it's got one electron only,

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.000
one electron only. You've got to
learn to crawl before you learn to

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000
run. But, it could be not
just atomic hydrogen.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
First of all, I want to point out
that this is not to scale.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Marsden told us that this distance
here is about 10,

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
00. So, we get a little speck here
and an even tinier speck here.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
So, this is not to scale. So,
this distance here is R. This is

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
the radius of the orbit in which the
electron travels.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
And, so we have the positive charge
in the center.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
I'm going to, just for convenience,
call that Q1. And, that's equal to

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
the product of the proton
number times e.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:55.750
In other words,
this could be any one electron

00:41:55.750 --> 00:42:14.400
system. You say,
well, wait a minute,

00:41:39.500 --> 00:42:03.250
what's he talking about?
OK, atomic hydrogen, one proton,

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:23.433
one electron. But, I'd give you
another one electron system.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:42:10.750
You learned about ions last day.
If helium loses on electron, what

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:30.533
do we have? We have a helium
nucleus and one electron.

00:41:54.500 --> 00:42:18.250
So, helium plus is a one electron
system. What about lithium 2+?

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:38.900
That's a one electron system. Well,
my favorite is unununium, 110+.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:25.460
That's a one electron system.
OK, so all I do is I take into

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:28.930
account that I've got all the
positive charge,

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:32.390
whatever it is, it's a nucleus.
And the negative charge is always,

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:35.860
Q2 is always equal to minus e
because it's a one electron system.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:39.330
Who's buried in Grant's tomb? How
many electrons in the one electron

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:42.790
system, right?
So, there it is.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:46.260
So, this has got protons and
neutrons. But the neutrons,

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:49.770
it doesn't matter about the neutrons.
And don't ask me,

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:53.330
well what about the relative
dimension of this?

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:56.880
At 10,000 to 1, who cares?
It doesn't matter how big it is.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.440
So, what we're going to do is we're
going to go through the derivation

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.990
of that next day.
But I think at this point,

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:07.550
it's probably a good place to stop.
And, I will go through the actual

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:11.100
line by line derivation not because
I want to do derivations in class.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.660
I will only do them on one
condition, and that is I want to be

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.220
able to teach you what the
assumptions are that underlie the

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:21.780
points in the derivation.
But I'm never going to ask you to

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:25.360
derive things.
But, I'd ask you,

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.940
since the class doesn't end until
11:55, there's no need to be

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:32.520
gathering things up and snapping
binders and so on.

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.100
I know you want to get on with life,
and you're onto the next thing,

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.670
and you are tuning out, but you hear
all the click,

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:43.250
click, click, click,
click? There's actually one or two

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:46.830
people down here that are feigning
interest. I'd kind of like to let

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:50.410
them hear. So,
let's be good neighbors.

00:43:50.410 --> 00:44:11.220
So anyways, Bohr ascended to the
heights achieved only by Einstein.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:58.150
Bohr and Einstein were considered
the top two physicists in the world

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:02.300
through the first part of the 20th
century. If you go to Denmark and

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:06.460
you break a $100 bill,
you're going to be given one of

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:10.610
these, undoubtedly,
the 500 kroner note,

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:14.760
which is worth about $75-80,
and it has Niels Bohr on it. And,

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.920
if you look carefully, it tries to
give the sense of a one

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.930
electron system.
Here's a young Niels Bohr.

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:26.790
Here's Bohr with Heisenberg,
and we'll talk about Heisenberg's

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:30.660
uncertainty principle.
Heisenberg post-doced with Bohr.

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:34.530
These people all moved from one
capital to another.

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:38.390
This one here, that's Einstein.
This is the two giants of modern

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:42.260
physics: Einstein and Bohr.
Check out the hats. There is a

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:46.130
Homburg and there is a Borsalino,
really cool. Here's Bohr mixing it

00:44:46.130 --> 00:45:05.526
up with royalty.
There is a young Queen Elizabeth.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:54.420
There's Prince Philip,
and this is some Danish royalty in

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:58.850
the back. I never got invited to
their place so I don't know them.

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:03.280
Bohr liked music. He and Louis
Armstrong are discussing

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.710
quantization [LAUGHTER].
In the year 2000, the play by

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:12.140
Michael Frain,
Copenhagen, is set in Copenhagen in

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:16.570
Nazi occupied Germany where Niels
Bohr is in discussion with his

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:35.140
former post-doc and student
Werner Heisenberg.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:25.150
And, you can see the stage set here.
There is Bohr at the center, and

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:29.300
there is Heisenberg who is the one
electron orbiting the center.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:33.460
And then, there is Bohr's wife who
is the observer.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:37.610
Heisenberg gave us the uncertainty
principle, which we will visit later.

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:41.760
And so, it's a very interesting
play about the morality of

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.920
developing nuclear weapons.
And, what does modern physics

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:50.280
really have to give us?
A couple of other things about

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:54.850
hydrogen: hydrogen also,
like other elements, has isotopes

00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:59.420
and we already saw that in 1766,
Cavendish isolated atomic hydrogen

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:03.990
and enunciated some of its
properties. He was in London,

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:08.560
and as I mentioned, he deeded his
fortune to the Cambridge University.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:13.140
And, Cavendish Lab is there to this
day. In 1931,

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:17.710
at Columbia University,
Harold Yuri discovered this isotope,

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:35.720
which has two.
It has an atomic mass of two

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:07.500
deuterium. And then,
in 1934, it was Ernest Rutherford -

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:12.500
by the mid-30s,
J. J. Thompson had retired.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:17.500
And, Rutherford was invited to
occupy the chair and be the director

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:22.500
of the Cavendish Laboratory.
So, he ended his career in

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:47.400
Cambridge.
It is said of Rutherford,

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:52.200
it is said of Rutherford that he is
unique among Nobel Prize winners

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.990
that when you look at what he did
here with the experiment of the gold

00:46:56.990 --> 00:47:01.790
foil, and how it was able to
engender the insights of Bohr,

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:06.590
that, yeah, he got the Nobel Prize
in 1908 for the decomposition or

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:11.390
disintegration of matter,
but people generally say Rutherford

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:16.190
did his best work after he got the
Nobel Prize. And,

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:34.580
here he is in 1934 with the
discovery of tritium.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:24.880
Last comments: hydrogen,
now here, I'm using a little bit of

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:28.760
license here. We've been talking
about atomic hydrogen,

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.640
H. Later on, we'll learn that
hydrogen as we typically encounter

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:36.520
it is H2, the molecule.
And, you've undoubtedly heard a lot

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:40.410
in the public press,
and even in the political dialogue

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:44.290
such as it is these days that
hydrogen might be on environmentally

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:48.170
friendly fuel.
And, even Cavendish,

00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:52.050
one of the things that he observed
was that hydrogen could be combusted

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:55.920
to produce water vapor.
So, you might say,

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.760
well, gee, why don't we just power
our cars with hydrogen,

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:03.610
use an internal combustion chamber.
But, in an internal combustion

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:07.460
engine what happens is we don't have
an oxygen tank.

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:11.300
We, in fact, borrow oxygen or steal
oxygen from the air free of charge.

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:15.150
But, as you know, air is only 20%
oxygen, the balance being nitrogen.

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:35.100
And so, that nitrogen goes through
the combustion chamber.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:22.520
And, although you think that
nitrogen, I mean,

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:26.040
it's an inert gas.
Well, if you get the combustion

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.560
chamber hot enough,
in point of fact, there are some

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:33.090
reactions between nitrogen and the
oxygen. And so,

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:36.610
you make not only water vapor,
but you make some nitrous oxides,

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:40.140
NOX, or nox as it is known, and this
is the precursor to smog.

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:43.660
So, if you want to attack urban air
quality, this is probably moving in

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:47.180
the wrong direction,
OK? So, people are talking about

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:50.710
the use of hydrogen in fuel cells.
And, we'll talk about fuel cells

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:54.230
later in the semester when we do the
unit on redox reactions

00:48:54.230 --> 00:49:13.993
and electrochemistry.
But, there are some issues here.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Putting hydrogen onboard an
automobile, it's one thing to have

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
hydrogen in the tank.
But, put it on a vehicle and keep

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
that vehicle crash-worthy.
If the vehicle in the unfortunate

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
circumstances of a collision,
has to be able to maintain the

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
security of the hydrogen,
which means more mass, which means a

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
lot of the efficiency
is being squandered.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:25.680
What's the environmental impact of
hydrogen production?

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:29.360
Do you get hydrogen on the hydrogen
tree? Where do you get it?

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:33.050
Electrolysis of water, catalytic
decomposition of hydrocarbons?

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:36.730
Well, electrolysis of water
consumes energy.

00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:40.420
Where does the energy come from?
It's electrical energy. Burn coal

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:44.100
to make it, catalytic decomposition
of methane, you get the hydrogen,

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:47.780
where does the carbon go?  Goes up
the stack as CO2.

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:51.470
So, one of the things that you can
do is to become technically literate

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:55.150
so you can become part of the
discussion and help formulate

00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:59.250
sensible policy.
Put something on the road that

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:03.750
metaphorically we can all follow.
And last is cost, last is cost;

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:08.250
hydrogen is not cheap.
So, with that, I think I'll leave

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:09.516
it until Wednesday.
