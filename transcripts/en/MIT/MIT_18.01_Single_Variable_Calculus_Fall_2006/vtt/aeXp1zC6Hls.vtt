00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.390
PROFESSOR: Now, to start out
today we're going to finish up

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.850
what we did last time.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.950
Which has to do with
partial fractions.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.160
I told you how to do partial
fractions in several special

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.690
cases and everybody was trying
to figure out what the general

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.920
picture was.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.180
But I'd like to lay that out.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.730
I'll still only do it
for an example.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.300
But it will be somehow a bigger
example so that you can

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:53.310
see what the general
pattern is.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:04.280
Partial fractions, remember,
is a method for breaking up

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.730
so-called rational functions.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.510
Which are ratios
of polynomials.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.110
And it shows you that you can
always integrate them.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.920
That's really the theme here.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.190
And this is what's reassuring
is that it always works.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.670
That's really the bottom line.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.150
And that's good because there
are a lot of integrals that

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.100
don't have formulas
and these do.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.560
It always works.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.340
But, maybe with lots of help.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.570
So maybe slowly.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.830
Now, there's a little bit of
bad news, and I have to be

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.230
totally honest and tell you
what all the bad news is.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.930
Along with the good news.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.180
The first step, which maybe I
should be calling Step 0, I

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.710
had a Step 1, 2 and 3 last
time, is long division.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.920
That's the step where you take
your polynomial divided by

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.760
your other polynomial,
and you find the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.470
quotient plus some remainder.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.370
And you do that by
long division.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.120
And the quotient is easy to take
the antiderivative of up

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.010
because it's just
a polynomial.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.950
And the key extra property here
is that the degree of the

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.350
numerator now over here, this
remainder, is strictly less

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.510
than the degree of
the denominator.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.140
So that you can do
the next step.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.580
Now, the next step which I
called Step 1 last time,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.500
that's great imagination, it's
right after Step 0, Step 1 was

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.930
to factor the denominator.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.740
And I'm going to illustrate
by example what

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.630
the setup is here.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:09.120
I don't know maybe,
we'll do this.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.920
Some polynomial here,
maybe cube this one.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:21.440
So here I've factored
the denominator.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.840
That's what I called
Step 1 last time.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.650
Now, here's the first
piece of bad news.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.130
In reality, if somebody gave you
a multiplied out degree,

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.900
whatever polynomial here,
you would be very hard

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.710
pressed to factor it.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.300
A lot of them are extremely
difficult to factor.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.090
And so that's something you
would have to give to a

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.940
machine to do.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.880
And it's just basically
a hard problem.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.790
So obviously, we're only going
to give you ones that you can

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.480
do by hand.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.060
So very low degree examples.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.320
And that's just the way it is.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.600
So this is really a hard step
in disguise, in real life.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.000
Anyway, we're just going
to take it as given.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.130
And we have this numerator,
which is of degree less than

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.720
the denominator.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.830
So let's count up what
its degree has to be.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.640
This is 4 + 2 + 6.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.440
So this is degree 4 + 2 + 6.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.720
I added that up because this is
degree 4, this is degree 2

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.600
and (x ^2) ^3 is
the 6th power.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.330
So all together it's
this, which is 12.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:39.860
And so this thing is
of degree &lt;= 11.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.250
All the way up to degree 11,
that's the possibilities for

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.240
the numerator here.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.780
Now, the extra information that
I want to impart right

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:56.450
now, is just this setup.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.990
Which I called Step
2 last time.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.260
And the setup is this.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.590
Now, it's going to take
us a while to do this.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.810
We have this factor here.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.450
We have another factor.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.620
We have another term,
with the square.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.220
We have another term
with the cube.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.810
We have another term with
the fourth power.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.640
So this is what's going to
happen whenever you have

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.530
linear factors.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.560
You'll have a collection
of terms like this.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.030
So you have four constants
to take care of.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.610
Now, with a quadratic in the
denominator, you need a linear

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.840
function in the numerator.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.250
So that's, if you like, B0
x + C0 divided by this

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:49.370
quadratic term here.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.910
And what I didn't show you last
time was how you deal

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.720
with higher powers of
quadratic terms.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.090
So when you have a quadratic
term, what's going to happen

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.370
is you're going to take that
first factor here.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.870
Just the way you did
in this case.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.780
But then you're going to have to
do the same thing with the

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:24.120
next power.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.640
Now notice, just as in the case
of this top row, I have

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.830
just a constant here.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.030
And even though I increased the
degree of the denominator

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.540
I'm not increasing
the numerator.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.970
It's staying just a constant.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.230
It's not linear up here.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.850
It's better than that.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.990
It's just a constant.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.130
And here it stayed a constant.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.630
And here I stayed a constant.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.640
Similarly here, even though I'm
increasing the degree of

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.550
the denominator, I'm leaving the
numerator, the form of the

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:52.810
numerator, alone.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.150
It's just a linear factor
and a linear factor.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:05.350
So that's the key
to this pattern.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.850
I don't have quite as jazzy
a song on mine.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.410
So this is so long that it runs
off the blackboard here.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.820
So let's continue
it on the next.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:21.535
We've got this B2 x + C2
- sorry, B3 x + C3

00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:26.590
/ (x ^2 + 4) ^3.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:38.590
I guess I have room
for it over here.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.120
I'm going to talk about
this in just a second.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.590
Alright, so here's
the pattern.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:50.610
Now, let me just do a count
of the number of

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.410
unknowns we have here.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.480
The number of unknowns that we
have here is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.750
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.930
That 12 is no coincidence.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.960
That's the degree of
the polynomial.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.950
And it's the number of unknowns
that we have. And

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.140
it's the number of degrees
of freedom in a

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.370
polynomial of degree 11.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.310
If you have all these free
coefficients here, you have

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.560
the coefficient x^ 0, x ^ 1,
all the way up to x^ 11.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:23.100
And 0 through 11 is 12 different
coefficients.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.490
And so this is a very
complicated system of

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.150
equations for unknowns.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:33.410
This is twelve equations
for twelve unknowns.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:34.800
So I'll get rid of this
for a second.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:41.090
So we have twelve equations,
twelve unknowns.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.830
So that's the other bad news.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.210
Machines handle this very well,
but human beings have a

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.630
little trouble with 12.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:52.030
Now, the cover-up method works
very neatly and picks

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.730
out this term here.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.470
But that's it.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.550
So it reduces it
to an 11 by 11.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.170
You'll be able to evaluate
this in no time.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:00.890
But that's it.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.240
That's the only simplification
of your previous method.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.250
We don't have a method
for this.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.870
So I'm just showing what the
whole method looks like but

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.320
really you'd have to have a
machine to implement this once

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.760
it gets to be any size at all.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.490
Yeah, question.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.060
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:23.280
PROFESSOR: It's one big
equation, but it's a

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.920
polynomial equation.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:30.710
So there's an equation, there's
this function r ( x) =

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:41.350
a11 x^2 11 + a10 x^ 10... and
these things are known.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.495
This is a known expression
here.

00:09:43.495 --> 00:09:45.730
And then when you cross-multiply
on the other

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:52.430
side, what you have is, well,
it's a1 times, if you cancel

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:58.410
this denominator with that,
you're going to get (x + 2) ^3

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:08.260
( x ^2 + 2x + 3)( x^2 + 4)^3
+ the term for a2, etc.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.350
It's a monster equation.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.760
And then to separate it out into
separate equations, you

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:19.550
take the coefficient on x^ 11th,
x ^ 10, ... all the way

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.670
down to x^ 0.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:27.280
And all told, that means there
are a total of 12 equations.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.030
11 through 0 is 12 equations.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:35.030
Yeah, another question.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.560
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.370
PROFESSOR: Should I write
down rest of this?

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:38.610
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.820
PROFESSOR: Should you write
down all this stuff?

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.950
Well, that's a good question.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.070
So you notice I didn't
write it down.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.300
Why didn't I write it down?

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.200
Because it's incredibly long.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.790
In fact, you probably,
so how many pages of

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:54.770
writing would this take?

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.210
This is about a page
of writing.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.270
So just think of your machine,
how much time you want to

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.660
spend on this.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.430
So the answer is that you
have to be realistic.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.420
You're a human being,
not a machine.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.170
And so there's certain things
that you can write down and

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.510
other things you should
attempt to write down.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:17.770
So do not do this at home.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.180
So that's the first down-side
to this method.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.350
It gets more and more
complicated as time goes on.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.770
The second down-side, I want to
point out to you, is what's

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:35.100
happening with the pieces.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:42.830
So the pieces still need
to be integrated.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:48.130
We simplified this problem, but
we didn't get rid of it.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.890
We still have the problem of
integrating the pieces.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.740
Now, some of the pieces
are very easy.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.640
This top row here, the
antiderivatives of these, you

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.150
can just write down.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.390
By advanced guessing.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.970
I'm going to skip
over to the most

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.300
complicated one over here.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.220
For one second here.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.240
And what is it that you'd have
to deal with for that one.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:14.710
You'd have to deal with, for
example, so e.g., for example,

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:21.660
I need to deal with
the this guy.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.590
I've got to get this
antiderivative here.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.130
Now, this one you're supposed
to be able to know.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:30.430
So this is why I'm
mentioning this.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.380
Because this kind of ingredient
is something you

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.860
already covered.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.740
And what is it?

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.290
Well, you do this one by
advanced guessing, although

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.000
you it as the method
of substitution.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.260
You realize that it's going to
be of the form (x^2 + 4) ^ -

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.400
2, roughly speaking.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.170
And now we're going
to fix that.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:55.780
Because if you differentiate it
you get 2x (-2), that's - 4

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.410
(x)(x) times this.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.370
There's an x in the
numerator here.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.600
So it's - 1/4 of that
will fix the factor.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.550
And here's the answer
for that one.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.560
So that's one you can do.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:19.020
The second piece is this guy.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.480
This is the other piece.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.680
Now, this was the piece
that came from B3.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.170
This is the one that
came from B3.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.430
And this is the one that's
coming from C3.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.360
This is coming from C3.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.000
We still need to get
this one out there.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.970
So C3 times that will be the
correct answer, once we've

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.960
found these numbers.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.160
So how do we do this?

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.490
How's this one integrated?

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:49.690
STUDENT: Trig substitution?

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.640
PROFESSOR: Trig substitution.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:57.630
So the trig substitution
here is x = 2 tan u.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.800
Or 2 tan theta.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.430
And when you do that, there
are a couple of

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:03.860
simplifications.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.450
Well, I wouldn't call this
a simplification.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:11.330
This is just the differentiation
formula. dx =

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.830
2 sec^2 u du.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:19.030
And then you have to plug in,
and you're using the fact that

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.960
when you plug in the tan^2,
4 tan ^2 + 4,

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.370
you'll get a sec ^2.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:32.240
So altogether, this thing
is, 2 sec^2 u du.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:40.300
And then there's a (4 sec^2
u) ^3, in the denominator.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.340
So that's what happens when
you change variables here.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.790
And now look, this
keeps on going.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.120
This is not the end
of the problem.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.790
Because what does that
simplify to?

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:55.610
That is, let's see, it's
2/64, the integral

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.620
of sec^6 and sec^2.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.090
That's the same as cos^4.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.780
And now, you did a trig
substitution but you still

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:11.140
have a trig integral.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.540
The trig integral now, there's
a method for this.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.060
The method for this is when it's
an even power, you have

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.280
to use the double
angle formula.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:31.890
So that's this guy here.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.470
And you're still not done.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.040
You have to square
this thing out.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.120
And then you'll still
get a cos^2 2u.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.160
And it keeps on going.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.850
So this thing goes on
for a long time.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.870
But I'm not even going to finish
this, but I just want

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:44.780
to show you.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.420
The point is, we're not showing
you how to do any

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.270
complicated problem.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.550
We're just showing you all
the little ingredients.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:53.210
And you have to string them
together a long, long, long

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.010
process to get to the
final answer of

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.680
one of these questions.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:07.300
So it always works,
but maybe slowly.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.270
By the way, there's
even another

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.440
horrible thing that happens.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.970
Which is, if you
handle this guy

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:22.710
here, what's the technique.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:26.040
This is another technique that
you learned, supposedly within

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.770
the last few days.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.810
Completing the square.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:39.020
So this, it turns out, you have
to rewrite it this way.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.280
And then the evaluation is going
to be expressed in terms

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.440
of, I'm going to jump
to the end.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:49.310
It's going to turn out to be
expressed in terms of this.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.940
That's what will eventually
show up in the formula.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:58.180
And not only that, but if you
deal with ones involving x as

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:06.580
well, you'll also need to deal
with something like ln of this

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.560
denominator here.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.120
So all of these things
will be involved.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.700
So now, the last message that
I have for you is just this.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.260
This thing is very
complicated.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.150
We're certainly never going
to ask you to do it.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.160
But you should just be aware
that this level of complexity,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.690
we are absolutely stuck
with in this problem.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:32.150
And the reason why we're stuck
with it is that this is what

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:36.160
the formulas look
like in the end.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.740
If the answers look like this,
the formulas have to be this

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.460
complicated.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.580
If you differentiate this, you
get your polynomial, your

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.710
ratio of polynomials.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.730
If you differentiate this, you
get some ratio of polynomials.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.930
These are the things that
come up when you take

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.710
antiderivatives of those
rational functions.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:56.080
So we're just stuck
with these guys.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.800
And so don't let it get
to you too much.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.770
I mean, it's not so bad.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.260
In fact, there are computer
programs that will do this for

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.510
you anytime you want.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.800
And you just have to be not
intimidated by them.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:10.260
They're like other functions.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:20.600
OK, that's it for the general
comments on partial fractions.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.880
Now we're going to change

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.410
subjects to our last technique.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.910
This is one more technical
thing to get you

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.540
familiar with functions.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:32.260
And this technique is called
integration by parts.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.550
Please, just because its name
sort of sounds like partial

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.290
fractions, don't think
it's the same thing.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:38.450
It's totally different.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:44.340
It's not the same.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:19:06.640
So this one is called
integration by parts.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.570
Now, unlike the previous case,
where I couldn't actually

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:13.010
justify to you that the linear
algebra always works.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.860
I claimed it worked, but I
wasn't able to prove it.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.440
That's a complicated theorem
which I'm not able to do in

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.560
this class.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.520
Here I can explain to you
what's going on with

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.200
integration by parts.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.840
It's just the fundamental
theorem of calculus, if you

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.430
like, coupled with the
product formula.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.740
Sort of unwound and
read in reverse.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.610
And here's how that works.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.540
If you take the product of
two functions and you

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.570
differentiate them, then we
know that the product rule

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:45.790
says that this is u' v + uv'.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.920
And now I'm just going
to rearrange in

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.400
the following way.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.370
I'm going to solve for uv'.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:54.710
That is, this term here.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.370
So what is this term?

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.990
It's this other term, (uv)'.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:04.520
Minus the other piece.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.360
So I just rewrote
this equation.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.900
And now I'm going
to integrate it.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:11.860
So here's the formula.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:16.380
The integral of the left-hand
side is equal to the integral

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.200
of the right-hand side.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.530
Well when I integrate a
derivative, of I get back the

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.070
function itself.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:27.010
That's the fundamental
theorem.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:27.600
So this it.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.500
Sorry, I missed the dx,
which is important.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.460
I apologize.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.410
Let's put that in there.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:41.540
So this is the integration
by parts formula.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:46.760
I'm going to write it one more
time with the limits stuck in.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.070
It's also written this
way, when you

00:20:49.070 --> 00:21:02.170
have a definite integral.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:13.260
Just the same formula,
written twice.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.260
Alright, now I'm going
to show you how it

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:24.360
works on a few examples.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:29.470
And I have to give you a flavor
for how it works.

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:34.230
But it'll grow as we get more
and more experience.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:39.640
The first example that I'm
going to take is one that

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.040
looks intractable on
the face of it.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:49.740
Which is the integral
of ln x dx.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.950
Now, it looks like there's
sort of nothing

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.560
we can do with this.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.310
And we don't know what
the solution is.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:59.810
However, I claim that if we fit
it into this form, we can

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:03.100
figure out what the integral
is relatively easily.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:07.160
By some little magic of
cancellation it happens.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.960
The idea is the following.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.910
If I consider this function to
be u, then what's going to

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:17.390
appear on the other side in
the integrated form is the

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:22.680
function u', which is -- so,
if you like, u = ln x.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.620
So u' = 1 / x.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.680
Now, 1 / x is a more manageable
function than ln x.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.370
What we're using is that when we
differentiate the function,

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.100
it's getting nicer.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.830
It's getting more tractable
for us.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.130
In order for this to fit into
this pattern, however, I need

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:45.820
a function v. So what in
the world am I going to

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.220
put here for v?

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.920
The answer is, well, dx is
almost the right answer.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.860
The answer turns out to be x.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:23:01.260
And the reason is that
that makes v' = 1.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.630
It makes v' = 1.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:05.560
So that means that this is
u, but it's also uv'.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:11.240
Which was what I had on
the left-hand side.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.470
So it's both u and uv'.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:14.710
So this is the setup.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.770
And now all I'm going
to do is read off

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.300
what the formula says.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:24.380
What it says is, this is
equal to u v. So u is

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.270
this and v is that.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:32.800
So it's x ln x, minus, so that
again, this is uv. Except in

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.170
the other order, vu.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.510
And then I'm integrating, and
what do I have to integrate? u

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:45.550
' v. So look up there. u' v with
a minus sign here. u' = 1

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.760
/ x, and v = x.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.890
So it's 1 / x, that's u'.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:56.070
And here is x, that's v, dx.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.270
Now, that one is easy
to integrate.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.870
Because (1/x) x = 1.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:07.630
And the integral of 1 dx
is x + c, if you like.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:10.510
So the antiderivative
of 1 is x.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.610
And so here's our answer.

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:34.480
Our answer is that this
is x ln x - x + c.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.400
I'm going to do two
more slightly

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.380
more complicated examples.

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.570
And then really, the main thing
is to get yourself used

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:44.580
to this method.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:47.930
And there's no one way
of doing that.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:49.970
Just practice makes perfect.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.070
And so we'll just do a
few more examples.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.870
And illustrate them.

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.960
The second example that I'm
going to use is the integral

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.590
of (ln x) ^2 dx.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:08.510
And this is just slightly
more recalcitrant.

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:13.270
Namely, I'm going to
let u be (ln x)^2.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.440
And again, v = to x.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.890
So that matches up here.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:23.730
That is, v' = 1.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:28.390
So this is u v'.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:31.440
So this thing is u v'.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.510
And then we'll just
see what happens.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:38.230
Now, the game that we get is
that when I differentiate the

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:42.870
logarithm squared, I'm going to
to get something simpler.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:48.670
It's not going to win us the
whole battle, but it will get

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:49.860
us started.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.770
So here we get u'.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:56.650
And that's 2 ln x ( 1 / x).

00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:00.470
Applying the chain rule.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:06.790
And so the formula is that this
is x (ln x)^2, minus the

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:12.400
integral of, well it's u' v,
right, that's what I have to

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.210
put over here.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:22.190
So u' = 2 ln x ( 1
/ x), and v = x.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:25.260
And so now, you notice
something interesting

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:25.880
happening here.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.960
So let me just demarcate
this a little bit.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.680
And let you see what it is
that I'm doing here.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.820
So notice, this is the
same integral.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.650
So here we have x (ln x) ^2.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.050
We've already solve that part.

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.870
But now know notice that the
1 / x and the x cancel.

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.890
So we're back to the
previous case.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.570
We didn't win all the way, but
actually we reduced ourselves

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:51.350
to this integral.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:56.630
To the integral of ln x,
which we already know.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.700
So here, I can copy that down.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:04.690
That's - 2 (x ln x - x), and
then I have to throw in a

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:05.460
constant, c.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.270
And that's the end of
the problem here.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:10.260
That's it.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:26.400
So this piece, I got
from Example 1.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:35.230
Now, this illustrates a
principle which is a little

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:38.490
bit more complicated than
just the one of

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.390
integration by parts.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:44.930
Which is a sort of a general
principle which I'll call my

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.270
Example 3, which is
something which is

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:56.520
called a reduction formula.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.680
A reduction formula is a case
where we apply some rule and

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.770
we figure out one of these
integrals in terms of

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:05.440
something else.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.320
Which is a little bit simpler.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.020
And eventually we'll get down to
the end, but it may take us

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.810
n steps from the beginning.

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:18.040
So the example is
l(n x^ n) dx. .

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.880
And the claim is that if I do
what I did in Example 2, to

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:26.300
this case, I'll get a simpler
one which will

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.430
involve the n - 1st power.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.790
And that way I can get
all the way back down

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.440
to the final answer.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.160
So here's what happens.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.090
We take u as ln x^ n.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:40.980
This is the same discussion
as before, v = x.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:47.440
And then u' is n l(n
x) ^ n - 1( 1 / x).

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.020
And v' is 1.

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.800
And so the setup is similar.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:59.320
We have here x ( ln x)^
n minus the integral.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:05.020
And there's n times, it turns
out to be (ln x)^ n - 1.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:26.410
And then there's a 1 / x
and an x, which cancel.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:32.400
So I'm going to explain this
also abstractly a little bit

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.450
just to show you what's
happening here.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:43.450
If you use the notation Fn (x)
is the integral of (ln x)^n

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.780
dx, and we're going to forget
the constant here.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:52.860
Then the relationship that we
have here is that Fn (x) = n

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:56.590
ln, I'm sorry, x (ln x)^ n.

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:59.490
That's the first
term over here.

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:03.650
Minus n times the
preceding one.

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:07.670
This one here.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:11.060
And the idea is that eventually
we can get down.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.490
If we start with the nth one,
we have a formula that

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:17.760
includes, so the reduction is
to the n - 1st. Then we can

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.280
reduce to the n -
2nd, and so on.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.610
Until we reduce to the
1, the first 1.

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:29.390
And then in fact we can even
go down to the 0th one.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:32.510
So this is the idea of
a reduction formula.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:36.480
And let me illustrate it exactly
in the context of

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.870
Examples 1 and 2.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:44.670
So the first step would be to
evaluate the first one.

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:48.190
Which is, if you like,
(ln x)^ 0 dx.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:52.370
That's very easy, that's x.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:31:01.000
And then F1 ( x) =
x ln x - F0 (x).

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.240
Now, that's applying
this rule.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.830
So let me just put
it in a box here.

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:09.380
This is the method
of induction.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:13.510
Here's the rule.

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:21.930
And I'm applying it for n = 1.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:23.810
I plugged in n = 1 here.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:32.430
So here, I have x ln x
^ 1 - 1 ( F0 ( x).

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:39.240
And that's what I put right
here, on the right-hand side.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.970
And that's going to generate
for me the formula that I

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.920
want, which is x ln x - x.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.160
That's the answer to this
problem over here.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.230
This was Example 1.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.410
Notice I dropped the constants
because I can add

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:54.880
them in at the end.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.590
So I'll put in parentheses
here, (+ c).

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:01.850
That's what would happen at
the end of the problem.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:10.320
The next step, so that was
Example 1, and now Example 2

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.190
works more or less
the same way.

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:14.030
I'm just summarizing
what I did on that

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:16.640
blackboard right up here.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:21.030
The same thing, but in much
more compact notation.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:26.330
If I take F2 ( x), that's going
to be equal to x (ln

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:31.820
x)^2 - 2 F1 ( x).

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:41.550
Again, this is box for n = 2.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:47.250
And if I plug it in, what I'm
getting here is x (ln x) ^2 -

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:49.570
twice this stuff here.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:55.780
Which is right here.
x ln x - x.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.580
If you like, + c.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:07.360
So I'll leave the c off.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:12.170
So this is how reduction
formulas work in general.

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:14.880
I'm going to give you
one more example

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:22.620
of a reduction formula.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:30.560
So I guess we have to
call this Example 4.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.050
Let's be fancy, let's
make it the sine.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:35.950
No no, no, let's be
fancier still.

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:38.110
Let's make it e^ x.

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:48.790
So this would also work for
cosine x and sine x.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.110
The same sort of thing.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:53.300
And I should mention that on
your homework, you have to do

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.400
it for cosine of x.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.550
I decided to change my mind
on the spur of the moment.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:58.700
I'm not going to do it for
cosine because you have to

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.530
work it out on your homework
for cosine.

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:03.100
In a later homework you'll
even do this case.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.190
So it's fine.

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.400
You need the practice.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.240
OK, so how am I going
to do it this time.

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.970
This is again, a reduction
formula.

00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:19.420
And the trick here is to pick
u to be this function here.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.780
And the reason is
the following.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.060
So it's very important to pick
which function is the u and

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:26.450
which function is the v. That's
the only decision you

00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:30.020
have to make if you're going to
apply integration by parts.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.160
When I pick this function as
the u, the advantage that I

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:38.150
have is that u' is simpler.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:39.630
How is it simpler?

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:42.820
It's simpler because it's
one degree down.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.420
So that's making progress
for us.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.290
On the other hand, this function
here is going to be

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:54.900
what I'll use for v. And if I
differentiated that, if I did

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.780
it the other way around and I
differentiated that, I would

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.900
just get the same level
of complexity.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.120
Differentiating e^x just
gives you back e ^ x.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.000
So that's boring.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.750
It doesn't make any progress
in this process.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:11.090
And so I'm going to instead
let v = e ^ x and,

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:12.830
sorry this is v '.

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:14.380
Make it v ' = e ^ x.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.995
And then v = e ^x.

00:35:15.995 --> 00:35:17.800
At least it isn't any
worse when I went

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.640
backwards like that.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:28.150
So now, I have u and v ', and
now I get (x ^ n)( e ^ x).

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:31.730
This again is u, and this is v.
So it happens that v = t v

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:34.200
' so it's a little
confusing here.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.640
But this is the one
we're calling v '.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.510
And here's v. And now minus the
integral and I have here

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:43.760
nx ^ n - 1.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.120
And I have here e ^ x.

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:52.060
So this is u ' and
this is v dx.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:55.180
So this recurrence is
a new recurrence.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.050
And let me summarize it here.

00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:01.160
It's saying that Gn ( x) should
be the integral of (x ^

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:05.210
n)( e ^ x) dx.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.810
Again, I'm dropping the c.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:17.060
And then the reduction formula
is that Gn (x) = this

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:25.300
expression here, (x ^ n)(
e ^ x) - n Gn - 1 (x).

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:32.830
So here's our reduction
formula.

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:38.350
And to illustrate this, if I
take G0 (x), if you think

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:40.520
about it for a second that's
just, there's nothing here.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.870
The antiderivative of e ^ x,
that's going to be e ^ x, that

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:48.220
getting started at the
real basement here.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:52.000
Again, as always, 0 is
my favorite number.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.820
Not 1.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.850
I always start with the easiest
one, if possible.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:37:01.140
And now G1, applying this
formula, is going to be equal

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:06.830
to x e ^ x - G0 ( x).

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:11.180
Which is just right, because
n is 1 and n - 1 is 0.

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:17.220
And so that's just
x e ^ x - e^ x.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.470
So this is a very, very
fancy way of saying

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:22.620
the following fact.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:32.210
I'll put it over on
this other board.

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:44.600
Which is that the integral of
x e^ x dx = x e^ x - x + c.

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.270
Yeah, question.

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:50.950
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:53.020
PROFESSOR: The question
is, why is this true.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.830
Why is this statement true.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:56.420
Why is G 0 = e^ x.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.410
I did that in my head.

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:02.910
What I did was, I first wrote
down the formula for G0.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:11.110
Which was G0 is equal to the
integral of e^ x dx.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.950
Because there's an x to
the 0 power in there,

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:15.010
which is just 1.

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:17.780
And then I know the
antiderivative of e ^ x.

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:23.230
It's e ^x.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:31.400
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.030
PROFESSOR: How do you know when
this method will work?

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:37.370
The answer is only
by experience.

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:40.280
You must get practice
doing this.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.950
If you look in your textbook,
you'll see hints

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.430
as to what to do.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:47.920
The other hint that I want to
say is that if you find that

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.370
you have one factor in your
expression which when you

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:52.590
differentiate it,
it gets easier.

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:56.170
And when you antidifferentiate
the other half, it doesn't get

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:58.470
any worse, then that's
when this method

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:01.790
has a chance of helping.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.430
And there is there's
no general thing.

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:08.300
The thing is, though, if you
it with x^ n (e^ x), x ^ n

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.700
cosine x, especially on
sine x, those are

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:11.970
examples where it works.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:15.600
This power of the ln.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.150
I'll give you er one
more example here.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:26.540
So this was G1 ( x), right.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.310
I'll give you one more
example in a second.

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:29.330
Yeah.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:33.220
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.680
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.490
There's a mistake here.

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:39.240
That's bad.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:39.982
I was thinking in the
back of my head of

00:39:39.982 --> 00:39:45.910
the following formula.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:51.420
Which is another one which
we've just done.

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.450
So these are the types of
formulas that you can get out

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:57.620
of integration by parts.

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.650
There's also another way of
getting these, which I'm not

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:02.240
going to say anything about.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.440
Which is called advance
guessing.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.740
You guess in advance what the
form is, you differentiate it

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.160
and you check.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:14.250
That does work too, with
many of these cases.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:21.580
I want to give you
an illustration.

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:30.760
Just because you these formulas
are somewhat dry.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:34.570
So I want to give you just
at least one application.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:42.230
We're almost done with the
idea of these formulas.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:45.600
And we're going to get back now
to being able to handle

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.990
lots more integrals than
we could before.

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:50.830
And what's satisfying is that
now we can get numbers out

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:54.670
instead of being stuck and
hamstrung with only a few

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:55.120
techniques.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.820
Now we have all of the
techniques of integration that

00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.250
anybody has.

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:02.880
And so we can do pretty much
anything we want that's

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.430
possible to do.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:14.990
So here's, if you like, an
application that illustrates

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:18.890
how integration by parts
can be helpful.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:27.030
And we're going to find the
volume of an exponential wine

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:34.290
glass here.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:38.350
Again, don't try this
at home, but.

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:40.500
So let's see.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:44.660
It's going to be this
beautiful guy here.

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:46.930
I think.

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:49.060
OK, so what's it going to be.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:52.780
This graph is going
to be y = e^ x.

00:41:52.780 --> 00:42:04.030
Then we're going to rotate
it around the y axis.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:10.290
And this level here is
the height y = 1.

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:12.990
And the top, let's
say, is y = e.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:22.160
So that the horizontal here,
coming down, is x = 1.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:35.050
Now, there are two ways to
set up this problem.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:40.050
And so there are two methods.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:44.870
And this is also a good review
because, of course, we did

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:46.330
this in the last unit.

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:58.480
The two methods are horizontal
and vertical slices.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.660
Those are the two ways
we can do this.

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:03.840
Now, if we do it with, so
let's start out with the

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:09.370
horizontal ones.

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:12.370
That's this shape here.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:15.370
And we're going like that.

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:21.020
And the horizontal slices mean
that this little bit here is a

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.890
thickness dy.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:24.550
And then we're going to
wrap that around.

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:30.810
So this is going to
become a disk.

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:34.070
This is the method of disks.

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:35.830
And what's this distance here?

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:37.770
Well, this place is x.

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:40.680
And so the disk has
area pi x ^2.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.400
And we're going to add up the
thickness of the disks and

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.730
we're going to integrate
from 1 to e.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:51.930
So here's our volume.

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:54.820
And now we have one last little
item of business before

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:56.490
we can evaluate this integral.

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:58.620
And that is that we need to know
the relationship here on

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.360
the curve, that y = e ^ x.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:07.490
So that means x = ln y.

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:10.525
And in order to evaluate this
integral, we have to evaluate

00:44:10.525 --> 00:44:13.050
x correctly as a
function of y.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:16.780
So that's the integral
from 1 to e of (ln

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:26.200
y)^2, times pi, dy.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.080
So now you see that this
is an integral that we

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.140
did calculate already.

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:34.280
And in fact, it's sitting
right here.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.030
Except with the variable x
instead of the variable y.

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:41.090
So the answer, which
we already had, is

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:44.830
this F2 ( y) here.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:47.820
So maybe I'll write
it that way.

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:52.010
So this is F2 (y)
between 1 and e.

00:44:52.010 --> 00:45:00.040
And now let's figure
out what it is.

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.060
It's written over there.

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:15.100
It's y (ln y) ^2 -
2(y ln y - y).

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:24.460
The whole thing evaluated
at 1e.

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:29.130
And that is, if I plug
in e here, I get e.

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:32.150
Except there's a factor
of pi there, sorry.

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:36.360
Missed the pi factor.

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.780
So there's an e here.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:43.050
And then I subtract off, well,
at 1 this is e - e.

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:44.330
So it cancels.

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:45.440
There's nothing left.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:50.950
And then at 1, I get ln 1 is 0,
ln 1 is 0, there's only one

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:53.500
term left, which is 2.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.720
So it's - 2.

00:45:55.720 --> 00:46:03.790
That's the answer.

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:11.260
Now we get to compare that with
what happens if we do it

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:15.950
the other way.

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:19.870
So what's the vertical?

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:31.830
So by vertical slicing,
we get shells.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:38.530
And that starts, that's
in the x variable.

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:43.480
It starts at 0 and ends
at 1 and it's dx.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.300
And what are the shells?

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:51.960
Well, the shells are, if I can
draw the picture again, they

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:55.120
start, the top value is e.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:01.650
And the bottom value
is, I need a little

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:02.530
bit of room for this.

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:06.810
The bottom value is y.

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:12.950
And then we have 2 pi x is
the circumference, as we

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:15.970
sweep it around dx.

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:18.260
So here's our new volume.

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:23.600
Expressed in this
different way.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.220
So now I'm going to plug
in what this is.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:30.380
It's the integral from
0 to 1 of e - e ^ x.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.570
That's the formula for y.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:36.530
2 pi x dx.

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:41.000
And what you see is that you get
the integral from 0 to 1

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.150
of 2 pi e x dx.

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:46.540
That's easy, right?

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:51.940
That's just 2 pi e ( 1/2).

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.820
This one is just the
area of a triangle.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.890
If I factor out the 2 pi e.

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.920
And then the other piece
is the integral

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:03.230
of 2 pi x e^ x dx.

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:08.610
From 0 to 1.

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:11.550
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:14.370
PROFESSOR: Are you asking me
whether I need an x ^2 here?

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:15.960
I just evaluated the integral.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.290
I just did it geometrically.

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:19.570
I said, this is the area
of a triangle.

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:22.860
I didn't antidifferentiate and
evaluate it, I just told you

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:23.880
the number.

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:27.580
Because it's a definite
integral.

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:33.470
So now, this one here, I can
read off from right up here.

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:37.050
Above it, this is G1.

00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:42.060
So this is equal to, let's
check it out here.

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:52.280
So this is pi e, right, - 2 pi
G1 ( x), evaluated at 0 and 1.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.840
So let's make sure that
it's the same

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.990
as what we had before.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:59.860
It's pi e - 2 pi times
here's g1.

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:03.340
So it's x e ^ x - e^ x.

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:05.720
So at x = 1, that cancels.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.260
But at the bottom
end, it's e^ 0.

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:12.040
So it's - 1 here.

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.130
Is that right?

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:13.710
Yep.

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:17.060
So it's pi e - 2.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:21.710
It's the same.

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:22.150
Question.

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:28.030
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:33.380
PROFESSOR: From here to here,
is that the question?

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:39.710
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:43.730
PROFESSOR: So the step here is
just the distributive law.

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:46.810
This is e 2 pi x, that's
this term.

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:49.550
And the other terms, the
minus sign is outside.

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:51.320
The 2 pi I factored out.

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:56.980
And the x and the e ^x stayed
inside the integral sign.

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:59.140
Thank you.

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.260
The correction is that
there was a missing

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:03.780
minus sign, last time.

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:09.710
When I integrated from
0 to 1 x e^ x dx, I

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:13.100
had a x e^ x - e^x.

00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.090
Evaluated at 0 and 1.

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:18.350
And that's equal to + 1.

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:21.580
I was missing this minus sign.

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:30.840
The place where it came in was
in this wineglass example.

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:39.340
We had the integral of
2 pi x e - e ^x dx.

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:48.900
And that was 2 pi e integral of
x dx, from 0 to 1, - 2 pi,

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:52.810
integral from 0 to
1 of x e^x dx.

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:58.400
And then I worked this
out and it was pi e.

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:03.030
And then this one was - 2 pi,
and what I wrote down was - 1.

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:05.410
But there should have been an
extra minus sign there.

00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:08.430
So it's this.

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.240
The final answer was
correct, but this

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.590
minus sign was missing.

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:16.930
Right there.

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:20.460
So just, right there.
