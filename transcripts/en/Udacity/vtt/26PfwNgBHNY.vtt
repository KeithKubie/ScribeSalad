00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.530
Here's an illustration of the processing
of outgoing IPsec traffic.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.880
First, the SPD is looked up
to see if the traffic, for

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.710
example http traffic from A to B,
needs to be protected,

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.030
that is whether the traffic
should undergo IPsec processing.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.390
If there's an SPD entry then the SA
is looked up in the SADB and

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.930
the packet is processed accordingly and
SPI is inserted in the IPSec header.
