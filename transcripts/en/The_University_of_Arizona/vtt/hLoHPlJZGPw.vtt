 We put six drops of
lavender on this pad here.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.120
And then we just turn it on.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.490
And then there's a little heater
in here, an electric heater,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.800
that causes the
lavender to vaporize.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.080
And then it comes out of here.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.270
I've been interested in horses
ever since I was a child.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.130
I started riding when I was six.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.550
And then I became interested
in science and research.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.220
And then I happened to
meet a couple of people

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.290
who were doing equine therapy.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.400
I became aware of how horses are
being used with people to help

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.250
reduce their stress levels.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.320
So that really gave
me the inspiration

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.584
for doing more work
with horses and people.

00:00:56.584 --> 00:00:58.000
I teach a course
at the University

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.730
of Arizona, Physiology
for Mind Body Interaction.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.379
ISABELLE: One of the units that
we were learning specifically

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:08.420
talks about the amygdala.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.910
And then we also learn
about the olfaction system

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.767
and how it has a direct
link to the amygdala.

00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:15.350
And aroma therapy
was always something

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.500
that I was kind of interested in
and wanted to learn more about

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.830
and to see how it
works and understanding

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.540
how it might be able to impact
our stress response because

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.410
of the amygdala.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.410
And from there we were able
to come up with an experiment

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.760
that we were both interested in.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.070
 The lavender physiologically
causes them to relax.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.290
It stimulates what's called the
parasympathetic nervous system,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.740
which then stimulates
the salivary glands

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.730
to produce saliva.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.090
So licking and chewing
is a sign of relaxation.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.340
Horses have an extremely
sensitive sense of smell.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.080
And they are sensitive animals
because they are prey animals.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.880
They evolved as prey animals.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.030
They're always looking
around to make sure

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.770
that there's no danger.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.460
That's why horses are a good
model for testing aroma therapy

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.300
because they're highly
sensitive and they

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.810
have a good sense of smell.
