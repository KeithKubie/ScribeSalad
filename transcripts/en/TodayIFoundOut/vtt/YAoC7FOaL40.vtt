00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.929
Santa Claus has long been the symbol of Christmas,
bringing joy and presents to all the good

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.539
girls and boys. But if you are child in Germany,
Austria, and other parts of the Alps region,

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.080
there may be something much more dark, mischievous,
and grumpy hidden in the shadows next to dear

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.179
old St. Nick. That something is Krampus, the
Christmas demon.

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.420
A beast-like creature with fangs, fur, and
horns, Krampus announces his presence with

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.370
loud bells and terrorizes the kids who have
been naughty during the year. While Santa

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.000
gives the good ones gifts and joy, Krampus
gives the bad ones beatings with a whip (made

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.480
from birch sticks and horsehair) and nightmares.
As for the really, really naughty kids, Krampus

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.649
drops them in a sack (or a wicker basket on
his back) and whisks them away to his lair

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.739
– which is of course the underworld – never
to be seen again.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.479
So how did this mythological beast come to
be a part of this region’s Christmas tradition?

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.200
High up in the Alp countries of Europe is
where Krampus was born, or, more accurately,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.740
where the legend was created. The word “Krampus”
is derived from the Old High German word krampen,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.049
meaning “claw.” According to Norse mythology,
Krampus is the son of Hel, the goddess ruler

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:32.220
of the underworld. There are also a few physical
similarities between Krampus and Greek mythical

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.329
creatures – like the horns and hoofs of
satyrs and fauns.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.210
Scholars estimate that Krampus started appearing
around the 13th century, if not earlier – perhaps

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.450
in the 11th century. Originating in Southern
Germany and Austria (the area known as Bavaria),

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.579
the creature moved to other European countries
such as Switzerland, Czech Republic, Hungary,

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:59.299
and even the Alp villages of Italy, sometimes
with variations on the name and practiced

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.689
customs. For example, in Tyrol (a state in
western Austria), Krampus tends to look like

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.330
a giant, sadistic, teddy bear. In western
Germany, he actually arrives with Santa, sitting

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.690
shotgun in his sleigh. In Styria (southeast
Austria), the birch sticks used for his whip

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.910
are painted gold and displayed year around,
to remind kids of Krampus’s impending arrival.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.140
According to Al Ridenour, director of Krampusfest
LA and in an article he wrote for Atlas Obscura,

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.879
this is due to the regions’ isolation and
each communities’ interpretation of Krampis.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:34.879
Said Ridenour,

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.819
“Long before the circulation of any (art)
standardizing the image, the isolating Alpine

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.720
terrain of Krampus’ native habitat encouraged
strong regional variations. And without any

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.160
grounding source text to nail down his appearance,
the original Krampus would have been a shapeless

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.819
bogeyman defined only by oral tradition, a
freeform figure variously described by parents

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.170
and other storytellers.”

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.980
As Christianity took over the region, Krampus
wasn’t forgotten, but rather altered to

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.110
match changing customs. No longer thought
of as a pagan tradition, he was given chains,

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.019
to show the “devil” being binded by the
Church. Soon, Krampus was attached to St.

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:20.200
Nick, a Christian saint and the owner of his
very own feast day (or celebration) on December

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.340
6th. St. Nick, himself, wouldn’t be closely
associated with Christmas until early 19th

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.909
century with the name Santa Claus coming from
the Dutch of the protracted words for St.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:30.909
Nicholas.

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.129
In many parts of Germany and Austria, St.
Nick is still separate from Christmas and

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.459
celebrated on December 6th. To further the
connection between the two, Krampus was awarded

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.640
his own night on December 5th, the day before
St. Nick’s feast (the same evening when

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.390
kids would put a boot outside, hoping St.
Nick drops fruit and nuts into it). Called

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.819
Krampusnacht (Krampus Night), Krampus bounds
around making loud noises and scaring kids.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.459
This night is still celebrated in the Alps
region with it being customary to offer Krampus

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.239
a drink of warm schnapps.

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.890
Despite these attachments to Christianity,
some pagan traditions have survived and are

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.239
still part of today’s Krampus. To wit, he
continues to carry bells, which were customarily

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.370
used to ward off spirits. As mentioned, the
animal-like appearance of most Krampus’

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.329
also date to pagan times.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.729
Krampus, along with other German pagan legends,
started to regain acceptance and a following

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.750
in the 19th century. This was partially due
to the ancient German folk tales that the

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.509
Brothers Grimm popularized in the early 1800s.
In fact, Krampus gets a quick reference in

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:41.610
Jacob Grimm’s 1835 book Deutsche Mythologie
(translated to “Teutonic Mythology”).

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.150
Art and postcards were also created that showed
off Krampus and people began to exchange Krampus

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.360
cards (with some saying “Greetings from
the Krampus”) in Europe during the late

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.500
19th century as a rather peculiar way of saying
“happy holidays.” They tended to be kitschy

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.250
in nature, even with somewhat sexual overtones
such as a Krampus scaring a good-looking,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.330
half-dressed woman.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.820
Krampus hasn’t always been an accepted European
tradition. In 1934, four years before the

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.690
Third Reich overran Germany and Austria, The
New York Times ran an article with the headline,

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.360
“Krampus Disliked in Fascist Austria; Gienel
Black and Red Devil, Symbol of Christmas Fun,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.509
Is Frowned Upon.” The article goes on to
say how the Austrian Fascist government outlawed

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:30.300
Krampus, even going so far as claiming he
was socialist. When the fascist government

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.500
fell after World War II, Krampus was allowed
to walk the streets once again.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.449
More recently, Krampus has started his rise
in popularity in America, with Krampus festivals

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:45.250
across the country, including ones in Los
Angeles, Philadelphia, and New York City.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.289
So, next time someone says “happy holidays”
to you, feel free to greet them back with

00:05:50.289 --> 00:06:07.990
“May Krampus not take your child away 
in 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.330
a basket.”
