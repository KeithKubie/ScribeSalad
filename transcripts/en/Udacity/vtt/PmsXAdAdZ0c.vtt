If you got 19 for the numerator, and 135 for the denominator, good job. Let's

00:00:04.683 --> 00:00:09.342
see how we got that answer. When we subtract fractions, we also have to have a

00:00:09.354 --> 00:00:13.896
common denominator. So the first thing that I need to do is find that common

00:00:13.908 --> 00:00:18.805
denominator. When I use the factor tree method, I need a factor in common. For

00:00:18.817 --> 00:00:25.355
45 and 27, that common factor is 9. I know that 9 times 5 is 45 and I know that

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:31.755
9 times 3 gives me 27. If I multiply those together 3 times 9 times 5, I get

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:37.680
135. The next thing I need to do is to convert my 2 fractions that I'm

00:00:37.692 --> 00:00:45.071
subtracting into equivalent fractions with 135 as the denominator. So, I can

00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:51.442
take 5 over 27, and I want to have 135 as the denominator. So, 27 times 5 gives

00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:57.969
me 135 and 5 times 5 gives me 25. Now let's create an equivalent fraction for 2

00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:04.907
over 45. Since I want 135 as the denominator. I need to mutliply 45 times 3. And

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:11.043
now I have 45 times 3 is 135, and 2 times 3 gives me 6. Now I can rewrite my

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:19.145
original subtraction problem with my equivalent fractions. So I have 25 over 135

00:01:19.157 --> 00:01:26.496
minus 6 over 135. When I subtract fractions, I keep the denominators the same

00:01:26.496 --> 00:01:31.289
and I subtract the numerators. 25 minus 6 gives me 19.
