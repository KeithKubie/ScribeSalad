example well we need to modify that to
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.990
example well we need to modify that to
make it really actionable the first is

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
make it really actionable the first is
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.260

let's say within six months doubling and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740
let's say within six months doubling and
 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.010
let's say within six months doubling and
this is a real example for me doubling

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
this is a real example for me doubling
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.810

and I want to accomplish that within six

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
and I want to accomplish that within six
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.160
and I want to accomplish that within six
months alright and then we could borrow

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
months alright and then we could borrow
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.530
months alright and then we could borrow
from David Allen and just ask what are

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
from David Allen and just ask what are
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.440
from David Allen and just ask what are
some of the what are some of the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450
some of the what are some of the
 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.330
some of the what are some of the
prerequisites the component pieces of

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340
prerequisites the component pieces of
 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.890
prerequisites the component pieces of
doing that let's let's break it out into

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
doing that let's let's break it out into
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.670
doing that let's let's break it out into
say content and organic you can have

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
say content and organic you can have
 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.440
say content and organic you can have
paid acquisition you make a long list of

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450
paid acquisition you make a long list of
 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.710
paid acquisition you make a long list of
these potential buckets of activities

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720
these potential buckets of activities
 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.179
these potential buckets of activities
from there you would look at next

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189
from there you would look at next
 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.920
from there you would look at next
physical actions and then this is

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
physical actions and then this is
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.270
physical actions and then this is
directly from getting things done and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
directly from getting things done and
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.510
directly from getting things done and
you can apply that to any number of

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
you can apply that to any number of
 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.859
you can apply that to any number of
these let's just say it's ten buckets

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
these let's just say it's ten buckets
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.270
these let's just say it's ten buckets
but you would ask yourself this is a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280
but you would ask yourself this is a
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.880
but you would ask yourself this is a
question I asked myself very often when

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890
question I asked myself very often when
 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.830
question I asked myself very often when
I'm procrastinating because there is

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840
I'm procrastinating because there is
 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.690
I'm procrastinating because there is
indecision and this is a particularly

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700
indecision and this is a particularly
 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.690
indecision and this is a particularly
dove procrastination in other words if I

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
dove procrastination in other words if I
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.480
dove procrastination in other words if I
have 10 things on my to-do list or 10

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490
have 10 things on my to-do list or 10
 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.330
have 10 things on my to-do list or 10
potential projects I could pursue what

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
potential projects I could pursue what
 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.550
potential projects I could pursue what
to do in that situation and what I ask

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560
to do in that situation and what I ask
 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.490
to do in that situation and what I ask
myself is which one of these

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500
myself is which one of these
 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.070
myself is which one of these
done will make the rest irrelevant or

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080
done will make the rest irrelevant or
 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.920
done will make the rest irrelevant or
easier this is a key question I ask all

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930
easier this is a key question I ask all
 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.660
easier this is a key question I ask all
the time which one of these will make

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670
the time which one of these will make
 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.550
the time which one of these will make
all the rest easier to do if done first

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
all the rest easier to do if done first
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.470
all the rest easier to do if done first
or all the rest them irrelevant don't

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480
or all the rest them irrelevant don't
 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.390
or all the rest them irrelevant don't
even need to do them that is how I will

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400
even need to do them that is how I will
 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.820
even need to do them that is how I will
then hone in on one piece of the puzzle

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830
then hone in on one piece of the puzzle
 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.100
then hone in on one piece of the puzzle
and this can be applied all over the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110
and this can be applied all over the
 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.110
and this can be applied all over the
place but let's just say it's the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120
place but let's just say it's the
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.060
place but let's just say it's the
doubled podcast it could be losing

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070
doubled podcast it could be losing
 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.680
doubled podcast it could be losing
weight alright you can see that's very

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690
weight alright you can see that's very
 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.230
weight alright you can see that's very
very amorphous we need timelines we need

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240
very amorphous we need timelines we need
 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.990
very amorphous we need timelines we need
an amount to lose and then you wanna

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000
an amount to lose and then you wanna
 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.250
an amount to lose and then you wanna
make it as small as possible so give you

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260
make it as small as possible so give you
 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.050
make it as small as possible so give you
a different example if you look if you

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060
