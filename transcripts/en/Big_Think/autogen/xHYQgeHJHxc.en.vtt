I think one of our difficult

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899
I think one of our difficult
 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.519
I think one of our difficult
conditionings actually is that we feel

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529
conditionings actually is that we feel
 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.470
conditionings actually is that we feel

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480
first of all over taught first of all
 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.690
first of all over taught first of all
that we will feel better about ourselves

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700
that we will feel better about ourselves
 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.660
that we will feel better about ourselves
by demeaning others by putting others

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670
by demeaning others by putting others
 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.519
by demeaning others by putting others
down and I think a lot of workplaces

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529
down and I think a lot of workplaces
 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.150
down and I think a lot of workplaces
reflect that a lot of homes reflect that

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160
reflect that a lot of homes reflect that
 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.750
reflect that a lot of homes reflect that
you know that we we feel ok the way I am

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760
you know that we we feel ok the way I am
 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.820
you know that we we feel ok the way I am
gonna trust myself and feel good about

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830
gonna trust myself and feel good about
 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.390
gonna trust myself and feel good about
myself is if I can just kind of denounce

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400
myself is if I can just kind of denounce
 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.749
myself is if I can just kind of denounce
this other person and we asked I think

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759
this other person and we asked I think
 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.639
this other person and we asked I think
we actually feel terrible but we don't

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649
we actually feel terrible but we don't
 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.860
we actually feel terrible but we don't
realize it because we're so caught in

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870
realize it because we're so caught in
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.810
realize it because we're so caught in
that paradigm if this is what we have to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820
that paradigm if this is what we have to
 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.630
that paradigm if this is what we have to
do and so I would disrupt that first of

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640
do and so I would disrupt that first of
 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.770
do and so I would disrupt that first of
all and and really challenge that and we

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780
all and and really challenge that and we
 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.869
all and and really challenge that and we
also tend to think that compassion is a

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
also tend to think that compassion is a
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.189
also tend to think that compassion is a
weakness and that if we care we'll we'll

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199
weakness and that if we care we'll we'll
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.360
weakness and that if we care we'll we'll
just burn out and you know compassion

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
just burn out and you know compassion
 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.090
just burn out and you know compassion
will inevitably lead to exhaustion and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
will inevitably lead to exhaustion and
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.520
will inevitably lead to exhaustion and
giving in losing a sense of principle

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530
giving in losing a sense of principle
 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.850
giving in losing a sense of principle
and discernment and and really having

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860
and discernment and and really having
 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.410
and discernment and and really having
boundaries and I think none of that is

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
boundaries and I think none of that is
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.580
boundaries and I think none of that is
true either we can redefine happiness so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590
true either we can redefine happiness so
 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.330
true either we can redefine happiness so
that it's not just pleasure and endless

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340
that it's not just pleasure and endless
 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.700
that it's not just pleasure and endless
pleasure seeking and being superficial

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
pleasure seeking and being superficial
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.520
pleasure seeking and being superficial
or being like happy-go-lucky to having a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530
or being like happy-go-lucky to having a
 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.210
or being like happy-go-lucky to having a
deep deep sense of resiliency and

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220
deep deep sense of resiliency and
 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.130
deep deep sense of resiliency and
connection to a bigger picture and we

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
connection to a bigger picture and we
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.190
connection to a bigger picture and we
would be a lot happier and success our

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
would be a lot happier and success our
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.020
would be a lot happier and success our
sense of what successes would follow

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
sense of what successes would follow
 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.899
sense of what successes would follow
that when it comes to compassion I think

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
that when it comes to compassion I think
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.210
that when it comes to compassion I think
there always needs to be an examination

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220
there always needs to be an examination
 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.760
there always needs to be an examination
and balance it's a balance first of all

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
and balance it's a balance first of all
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.920
and balance it's a balance first of all
between compassion for ourselves and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
between compassion for ourselves and
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.770
between compassion for ourselves and
compassion for others if we ignore

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
compassion for others if we ignore
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.539
compassion for others if we ignore
ourselves I mean that's not going to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549
ourselves I mean that's not going to
 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.310
ourselves I mean that's not going to
work in the long run anyway we're not

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320
work in the long run anyway we're not
 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.020
work in the long run anyway we're not
gonna be able to sustain some effort

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
gonna be able to sustain some effort
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.149
gonna be able to sustain some effort
we're just going to burn out and it's

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159
we're just going to burn out and it's
 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.240
we're just going to burn out and it's
also a balance between compassion for

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
also a balance between compassion for
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.260
also a balance between compassion for
someone and discernment maybe we really

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270
someone and discernment maybe we really
 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.289
someone and discernment maybe we really
feel bad for someone and we need to be

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299
feel bad for someone and we need to be
 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.520
feel bad for someone and we need to be
strong we need to express disapproval we

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
strong we need to express disapproval we
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.490
strong we need to express disapproval we
really need to set a boundary that's

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
really need to set a boundary that's
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.699
really need to set a boundary that's
very clear not give them what they want

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709
very clear not give them what they want
 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.619
very clear not give them what they want
right and there's also balance between

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629
right and there's also balance between
 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.670
right and there's also balance between
having compassion

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
having compassion
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.920
having compassion
for someone and realizing I can't fix it

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930
for someone and realizing I can't fix it
 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.020
for someone and realizing I can't fix it
right I can't make your problem go away

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030
right I can't make your problem go away
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.709
right I can't make your problem go away
I can be there I could try to help I

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719
I can be there I could try to help I
 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.160
I can be there I could try to help I
could do this I could do that but in the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170
could do this I could do that but in the
 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.429
could do this I could do that but in the
end I can't control the unfolding of the

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439
end I can't control the unfolding of the
 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.220
end I can't control the unfolding of the
universe which I often add an addendum

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230
universe which I often add an addendum
 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.830
universe which I often add an addendum
to that like too bad right it's kind of

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840
to that like too bad right it's kind of
 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.869
to that like too bad right it's kind of
too bad but it's true

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879
too bad but it's true
 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.899
too bad but it's true
and so we need we need a balance in

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909
and so we need we need a balance in
 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.449
and so we need we need a balance in
order to have resiliency which is kind

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459
order to have resiliency which is kind
 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.970
order to have resiliency which is kind
of the secret ingredient in compassion

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980
of the secret ingredient in compassion
 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.569
of the secret ingredient in compassion
otherwise compassion becomes burnout it

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579
otherwise compassion becomes burnout it
 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.720
otherwise compassion becomes burnout it
becomes exhaustion
