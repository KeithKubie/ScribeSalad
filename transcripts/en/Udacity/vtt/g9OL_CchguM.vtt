00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.940
In this application,
you saw the infrastructure for

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.950
how Geo-fences work in Android.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.540
You saw how easy it is to set up
Geo-fences, and how you can use

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.970
an intent service to handle
the transitions between Geo-fences.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.750
In this case,
we hard coded several locations but

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.080
there's no reason why you couldn't put
your Geo-fence data into the cloud and

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.270
have your phone dynamically update
the number of Geo-fences that it tracks.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.130
So for example, if you wanted
to have a virtual treasure hunt

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.280
with locations that change every day,
you could do so and

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.375
have your app update them
whenever it launches.

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:34.760
There's just so
much that you can do with Geo-fencing.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.400
Particularly, now,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.120
that the users carry these powerful
mobile devices with them all the time.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.400
We scratched the surface
of what you can do.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.130
But in doing so,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.520
we've built a powerful scaffolding
that you can use in your future apps.
