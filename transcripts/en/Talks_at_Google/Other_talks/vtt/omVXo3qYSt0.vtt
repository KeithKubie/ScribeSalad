00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everybody.
Welcome to another Authors at Google event.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.610
We are pleased today to welcome Mr. Jeremy
Rifkin, a well-known economist and activist.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.480
He's probably best known for his work, Where's
the Foundation on Economic Trends?

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.849
As well as his published works, which include
The End of Work and The Hydrogen Economy.

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.529
And both topics are very relevant to the work
we do here at Google.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.789
Time magazine describes Jeremy as, "The most
hated man in science."

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:39.410
But we love you, it's okay. Just ignore them.
Today, he'll be speaking to us on his latest

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.460
book, The Empathic Civilization.
The book outlines the essential conflict between

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.650
empathy and entropy -- between thinking and
doing.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.510
Jeremy suggests that this arises from the
very way our consciousness is structured.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.000
And for those who have questions later, please
use the mic for the benefit of those on YouTube.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.749
And with that, my friends, please welcome
Jeremy Rifkin.

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:13.220
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:26.950
Jeremy: [pause] Good afternoon, everyone.
Thank you for coming.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:36.350
Let me start off on a somber note, which I
hope might become a liberating reflection.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.510
I believe we may be at a seminal turning point
in the history of our species on this planet.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:50.010
Sounds melodramatic -- I won't be here to
see it, but all of you young people in this

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.159
room may be a decisive generation.
Species come and go.

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:02.100
We had two events in the last 18 months which
signaled the end game that a great industrial

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.229
age propelled by fossil fuels that gave us
one of the great, short-lived civilizations

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:15.779
in history.
July 2008 -- you recall oil hit $147 a barrel

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:20.900
on world markets.
Prices soared, inflation roared, basic items

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.440
became prohibitively expensive around the
world from groceries to gasoline.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.919
There were food riots in 30 countries.
Purchasing power plummeted at $147 a barrel

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:38.400
all over the world.
The entire economic engine of the Industrial

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.900
Revolution turned off at 147 a barrel.
That was the economic meltdown. That was the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.519
earthquake.
A collapse of the financial markets sixty

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:56.829
days later, that was the aftershock.
G-20, G-8, G-2 -- our world leaders have not

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.540
yet come to grips with what is really happening
to the global economy.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.700
Our fossil fuel energies are sunsetting. Their
S-curve is exhausted.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.049
And the entire infrastructure of this civilization
is embedded in the carbon deposits of the

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.459
Jurassic Age.
Our agricultural food is grown in petrochemical

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.819
fertilizers and pesticides.
Almost all of our pharmaceutical products

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.180
are still fossil-fuel-based.
Most of our clothes.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.680
The entire construction infrastructure of
civilization is fossil-fuel-based.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.150
Our power transport, our heat, our light,
our logistics, our supply chain.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.699
What we are seeing is the sunsetting of these
energies and the life support of the infrastructure

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:46.709
built from them.
That's what we haven't yet come to grips with.

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.249
The reason this has happened -- it's what
I call 'peak globalization' -- 147 a barrel

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:56.099
is something called 'peak oil per capita'
not to be confused with peak oil production.

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.189
They're two different things.
Peak oil per capita actually occurred over

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:06.489
30 years ago in 1979, at the height of the
Second Industrial Revolution.

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.159
In that year, had we distributed all the oil
reserves we knew we had to everyone living

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.470
on the planet at that time, fairly and equitably,
that would be the most oil each person could

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.129
have.
We found more oil since then, but population

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:23.430
grows quicker.
So if we distributed all the oil reserves

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.629
we know we have now today to 6.8 billion people,
there's less to go around per person.

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:32.379
So you see where I'm heading.
When China and India made their bid to bring

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:37.979
one-third of the human race into the Industrial
Revolution propelled by and embedded into

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.229
fossil fuels, the demand pressure was enormous
 -- prices went up, inflation soared, and

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.759
the entire economic engine of the Industrial
Age actually shorted out at 147 a barrel.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:54.229
Now, you notice the economy is just slightly
starting to move again around the world.

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.620
That's because we had depleted inventories.
We're replenishing them. And what's happening?

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.360
Oil is shooting up to $80 a barrel again.
So what I say to my colleagues is, "Show me

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.460
how we get through that wall."
Every time we try to regroup the global economy,

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.629
based on these sunsetting energies, with a
huge amount of the developing world coming

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:17.680
into the game, prices will go up, inflation
will roar, purchasing power will plummet at

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.930
about 147 a barrel, we'll keep hitting the
wall.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.930
That's peak globalization.
We now know the outer limits of the Industrial

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.039
Revolution.
We will look back at this moment as decisive.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.750
Fast forward, December 2009, Copenhagen.
Our world leaders come together to try to

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:44.460
address the entropy bill for the Industrial
Age -- the spent CO2, the exhausted energy.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.819
The U.N. Climate Panel -- our scientists tell
us that we may see a 3-degree rise in temperature

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:55.189
on this planet -- Celsius -- in this century
because of the burning of carbon deposits

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.970
over the last 200 years.
It's probably going to go much higher. That's

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.540
now optimistic.
But to give you an idea of what '3-degree

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.210
rise' means.
A 3-degree rise in temperature in this century,

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.080
your century, and your children, takes us
back to the temperature on Earth 3 million

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.650
years ago in the Pliascene.
Different flora, different fauna, different

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.370
hydrological cycles.
And it's really all about the water.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.879
This is something folks really don't hear
about.

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:26.069
For every one degree centigrade that the temperature
on the earth rises, the atmosphere can absorb

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.629
and does absorb 7 percent more precipitation
 -- takes it up from the ground.

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:36.750
That's why you're seeing more violent weather,
more floods, longer periods of droughts, wildfires.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:42.659
Our ecosystems and our biomes have developed
over millions of years.

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:46.030
They cannot adjust to this kind of change
this rapidly.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.789
I advise the European Union.
We went to Copenhagen, and we were hoping

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:56.960
to talk the world into mitigating CO2 at 450
parts per million by mid-century.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.879
Nobody wanted to play the game.
But if we go to 450 parts per million, we

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:08.539
were hoping we'd only go up two degrees.
Devastating, but maybe we would survive.

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:12.009
Then James Hansen, the chief climatologist
for the United States Government threw us

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:16.319
a curve in Brussels.
He's the head of the NASA Goddard Space Institute.

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:21.270
Their studies show that, if we mitigate at
450 parts per million carbon by mid-century

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:28.939
 -- your century -- we go up six degrees Celsius
according to the geological record.

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:32.189
And the end of human civilization as we've
come to know it.

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:39.819
We are asleep. The feedback loops are coming.
We're really in denial.

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:43.770
Our world leaders came together in Copenhagen.
They could not cut a deal. It broke down in

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.710
acrimony.
The entire talks collapsed.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:53.469
So here's my question for all of you in Google:
Why is it that our world leaders were simply

00:07:53.469 --> 00:08:01.830
unable to anticipate or respond to the meltdown
of the Industrial Revolution at 147 a barrel?

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.029
Still no analysis.
Why was it that our world leaders were unable

00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:11.789
to cut a deal on carbon reduction and methane
and nitrous oxide reduction at Copenhagen

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:18.930
to address climate change even though we know
that this is imperiling our planet and threatening

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:24.310
our own species -- certainly the biggest threat
we've ever faced?

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:29.129
The fault lies, not with just the inability
of government and business leaders to come

00:08:29.129 --> 00:08:33.830
up with new regulating mechanisms for the
global economy.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.750
The fault lies deeper than just the inability
to come up with a binding, carbon-reduction

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:45.450
target that everyone could agree to.
The fault lies with this: Our government and

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:52.500
business leaders are relying on 18th-century
ideas about human nature and the human journey

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:58.120
that were born at the beginning of the marketed,
nation-state era and spawned by the philosophers

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:03.080
in the Enlightenment.
Those ideas are completely ill-suited for

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:09.940
the global economy and biosphere world -- your
world of the 21st century.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:15.490
For 1500 years, in western civilization, the
church worldview about human nature dominated.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.930
And the church said, "Little babies are born
depraved.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:24.150
Born in sin. Born in evil.
And if we want salvation, we need to wait

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:30.160
to the next world with salvation in Christ."
At the dawn of the market era and the nation-state

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.280
governance, the philosophers of Enlightenment
took that worldview on, and they came up with

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.460
a new set of ideas about human nature.
And those new ideas were accompanied by new

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:46.450
institutions -- market institutions, nation-state
governance, new education institutions that

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.600
comported with these new ideas.
What were they?

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:56.160
John Locke, the political philosopher of the
Enlightenment said, "Babies are born tabular

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.630
rasa -- blank slate --" except he gave a little
opening, "There is a predisposition in human

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:05.340
nature to acquire property."
Which is kind of funny, he kind of let that

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.820
one.
"And if we acquire property, we become wealthy,

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:13.930
and that's the road to happiness." Adam Smith,
the great, Scottish economist of the Enlightenment

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:20.710
said, "Little babies are born as rational,
detached, autonomous agents.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:26.710
And as we grow up, we pursue our inner drive,
which is our material, self-interest in the

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.790
market."
The 19th century, post-Enlightenment philosophers

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.380
 -- Jeremy Benton.
He said, "Little babies are born, and they

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:39.320
seek pleasure over pain, and their core nature
is utilitarian."

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.820
The great naturalist, Charles Darwin, later
in the 19th century said, "Every organism,

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:49.160
every species, seeks to perpetuate themselves
and reproduce their survivor."

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.120
And then, of course, at the end of the 19th
century, Sigmund Freud suggested that, "Little

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.150
babies are born with an insatiable, erotic,
sexual desire, and they need to extinguish

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:03.400
their libido -- that's the core drive."
Okay, now. I don't know if there are any parents

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.640
in this room.
Do we have any parents in this room?

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:12.820
Please, is this what human nature is about?
That little baby -- is that little baby born

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.230
depraved and in sin?
Is that little baby a rational, calculating,

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:23.450
detached, autonomous agent, pursuing their
own material, utilitarian self-interest in

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:30.420
a competitive struggle to survive?
If that's who we really are -- that is our

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:36.860
core nature -- we're likely doomed.
I don't see any scenario on the horizon in

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:43.750
which we can bring together 6.8 billion human
beings to create a seamless, integrated, sustainable,

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:49.620
and just global economy and address climate
change and we heal the biosphere of the earth,

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.880
do you?
And remember, ideas have consequences.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:59.640
Again, those ideas about human nature comported
with and accompanied the institutions that

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.800
justified them.
Look at our schooling system, our parenting

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.260
styles, our business models.
They reflect the idea that we are aggressive,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:14.260
utilitarian, self-interested, materialistic,
and pleasure-seeking.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:21.130
In the last ten years, below the radar screen,
in evolutionary biology, neurocognitive science,

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:28.930
child development, and other related fields,
our researchers are making breathtaking breakthroughs

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:36.170
that are challenging some of the age-old assumptions
about human nature.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:41.130
Let me take you back to the early 1990s.
Sleepy little laboratory in Parma, Italy.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:45.840
There's a macaque monkey in the laboratory,
and it got a little MRI brain scan on the

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.480
monkey.
And they're watching the monkey open up a

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.100
nut and seeing which neurons light up with
the brain scan.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.200
By sheer serendipity -- and these are how
these things happen -- a human trainer walks

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.300
into the lab right after this experiment within
minutes and picks up a similar nut and tries

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.450
to open it.
The macaque is gazing straight at the trainer,

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.410
not moving.
And when they look at the scanning machine

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:13.680
on the brain of the macaque, the same exact
neurons are lighting up when he was observing

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.580
someone else open the nut as when he was opening
up the nut himself.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.040
They were flabbergasted. They had no idea
what this was.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.810
They started to put brain scanners on other
primates, and then, humans.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:29.430
Over and over again, they discovered something
interesting in the neural circuits of some

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:35.070
primates and all humans.
And that is, when a person experienced a certain

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:42.430
feeling -- disgust, rejection, pleasure, joy,
frustration, anger -- certain neurons would

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.680
light up.
If they then observed someone else experiencing

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.860
those same feelings, the observer's same neurons
would light up exactly as if they were feeling

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.410
that other person as if it were themselves.
Now, we know this from common sense experience.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:01.410
If someone punctures themself and bleeds,
you have the same wince as what's going on

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.860
to them.
When you see a little spider going up on someone's

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:12.570
arm, you feel a creepy feeling in your biology.
It's what we call, "empathic distress."

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:17.970
What we are finding is that all animals that
nurse their young are social, and they have

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:22.040
some kind of empathic distress, not just mere
neurons -- that's what we're discovering now,

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:28.080
the empathy neurons -- but a whole circuitry
that allows them to actually play and groom

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:34.320
and nurse -- social animals.
Human beings with the big neocortex were ultimately

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.600
social.
The worst thing you could do to a human? Ostracize

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.370
them.
That little baby comes out of the womb, and

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:47.050
immediately seeking some engagement, some
reciprocity, intimacy, affection, a sense

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:53.570
of belonging.
We discovered homo empathicus. Empathy is

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:59.000
very complicated.
When little babies are in a nursery and one

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.920
baby cries, the other babies will cry.
That's empathic distress.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.870
But they don't know why they're crying.
Around two-and-a-half years of age, the baby

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.820
can identify themselves in the mirror and
say, "Oh, that's me.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:15.870
That's you." Self-reflection and selfhood
go hand in hand with empathy.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:20.410
The more I have a sense of individuality,
the more I can empathize with another individual.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:24.170
At around seven or eight, we learn about birth
and death.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:31.580
Then we know we have one and only life -- we're
fragile, we're vulnerable, we have frailties,

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:37.090
and we understand that our life is unrepeatable.
This existential sense of ourselves that we

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:41.790
develop, that we have one and only history
 -- we live and die -- allows us to then feel

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.190
that same thing in another person.
Think about when you empathize with another

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:49.990
human or another animal.
It's that feeling of death and life altogether.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:55.411
You feel their fragility, their frailties,
their vulnerability, the one and only history,

00:15:55.411 --> 00:15:59.600
the one and only life.
And you feel their struggle to flourish and

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.670
be, because it's extremely hard being alive
 -- whether you're a human being or fox in

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:07.970
the wood or an ant on the ground -- it is
tough being alive.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:13.130
Empathy is the ability to actually feel another's
struggle.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.870
Their desire to flourish and be and then show
compassion and solidarity.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:22.241
The most alive moments in the world are when
we feel this feeling of empathy, because we

00:16:22.241 --> 00:16:28.600
transcend ourselves, and we live in that I
zone -- kind of 'middle zone' there.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.490
By the way, empathy is the opposite of paradise
and utopia.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:36.070
There's no empathy in heaven.
Don't look for it; it's not there.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:40.160
There's no empathy in utopias, because there's
no mortality.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:46.610
Empathy is the opposite, because it is a recognition
of life and death, our one and only journey.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.620
And that's why we feel solidarity, and we
feel such an expression of transcendance with

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.970
our fellow human beings.
The awe of life is right involved with that

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:59.630
empathic sensibility.
So here's the question: If we are wired for

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:05.800
empathic distress, can we imagine a scenario
in which we could extend that central nervous

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.000
system -- folks here in Google -- to the entire
human race?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.290
All of our fellow creatures in the biosphere
in which we live.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.910
Can you imagine that?
So now you're saying, "Oh, my God, I just

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.550
gave up my lunch for this.
This guy's over the end.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:25.150
We can't even pass health care reform legislation.
We just had a Supreme Court that said, "You

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:30.350
can buy any election you want in this country."
And this guy's up there talking about biosphere

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:37.020
consciousness, the human family coming together."
Well, this is the appropriate place -- Google.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.790
Consciousness changes over history.
The way our brains are wired this afternoon

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:46.160
 -- today, in the 21st century -- completely
different than a medieval serf.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:52.790
And their brain completely different in its
wiring than an hunter/gatherer 30,000 B.C.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:59.100
So the question is, What is the mechanism
upon which consciousness changes over history

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.760
and empathy evolves, if it does?
Because if we can find a mechanism, perhaps

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:09.180
we could see how we could take a leap and
begin to think homo empathicus, prepare an

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:16.320
empathic civilization, create biosphere awareness.
Now, I want everyone in Google that's here

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.240
in this room to concentrate with me from here
on, because you have a special mission, I

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.090
think.
The great changes in consciousness in history

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:30.560
 -- they occur when two things happen.
First, we change the way we organize the energy

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.000
of the earth.
And that's happened frequently through history.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.560
Second, we change the way we communicate to
organize these new energy revolutions.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:46.769
It's when communication revolutions come together
with energy revolutions -- when they converge

00:18:46.769 --> 00:18:50.740
 -- those are the pivotal points in history.
They change human consciousness.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:56.680
They expand the empathic horizons, even with
all the genocidal blowbacks, it keeps moving

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.630
forward.
I'll give you an example of energy/communication

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:03.750
convergence.
You read about the Sumerians at the university

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:08.810
in your cultural anthropology course?
The Sumerians, ancient Mesopotamia, which

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:12.881
was Iraq.
They were the first to harness the sun's energy

00:19:12.881 --> 00:19:18.690
in photosynthesis in cereal plants that stored
grain -- barley and wheat was stored sun's

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:22.100
energy.
Complicated, because before that time, people

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:26.020
lived in little villages, rain fed, garden
agriculture.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:31.370
All of a sudden, they had to indenture thousands
of men to build these long, irrigation canals.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:36.740
Think of the logistics here.
They had to create craft skills to manufacture

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.480
 -- to make the dikes.
They had to create the royal granaries, the

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.650
royal roads, and distribution systems.
They had to create urban life.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:49.660
It required a communication revolution, Google,
to organize it.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:54.080
And they created writing -- cuniform.
Everywhere we see these great, hydraulic,

00:19:54.080 --> 00:20:00.580
agricultural civilizations -- the Middle East,
the Indus Valley in India, China, Mexico,

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.830
fascinating.
Independently, humans figure out writing to

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:09.430
organize hydraulic, agricultural life.
Let's go all the way up to the 19th century.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:13.810
First Industrial Revolution -- another convergence
of communication and energy -- the print technology

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:20.120
revolution was upgraded with steam power.
With steam power, liner type and rotary, we

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:26.000
could mass produce print quick and cheap.
At that same time -- between 1830 and 1880

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.090
 -- we introduced public schools and mass
literacy in Europe and America.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:36.610
And the first generation of print-literate
communication generation, then, was able to

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:41.309
manage the First Industrial Revolution -- coal,
steam, and rail.

00:20:41.309 --> 00:20:44.120
We could not have organized coal, steam, and
rail with codex.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:50.010
That communication was too parochial.
20th century -- another convergence of communication

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.800
and energy.
Telegraph and telephone, and cinema, radio,

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:59.460
later television, became the communication
vehicle to manage oil, the internal combustion

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.860
engine, the suburban rollout, the Second Industrial
Revolution.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:10.730
And that Second Industrial Revolution peaked
in July 2008 at 147 a barrel.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.430
Those energies are sunsetting.
The infrastructure on which they're embedded,

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:19.400
life-support.
When communication/energy revolutions come

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:28.250
together, the communication not only manages
the new energy, it changes consciousness.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:32.309
Every forager, hunter society in history had
oral communication.

00:21:32.309 --> 00:21:36.410
Their consciousness was mythlogical.
Every single one had mythlogical consciousnesses

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:41.200
 -- no exception.
When we go to the great, hydraulic, agricultural

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.520
civilizations, the new communication to organize
agriculture was writing -- script.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.130
Every single one of them created some form
of theological consciousness.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:53.620
The great religions formed at that time in
the Middle East.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:58.050
The Abrahamic religions -- the people of the
book -- Judaism, Christianity, Islam.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:04.640
In the East, Buddhism, Confucist philosophy,
all based on script -- theological consciousness.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:10.820
19th century, convergence of communication/energy
 -- print communication gave rise to ideological

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:16.020
consciousness.
People thought ideologically in the 19th century.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.990
20th century, Second Industrial Revolution,
first-generation electricity communication

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:24.730
ushered in psychological consciousness.
We think therapeutically in this room. Grandma

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:28.370
didn't.
My grandma from a hundred years ago -- if

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:33.080
my grandma were at Thanksgiving dinner, and
all of a sudden, she throws the dish down

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.420
on the floor, I'd come up to Grandma and say,
"Grandma, now wait a minute, that was a passive/

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.960
aggressive act.
We've got some transference and some projection

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.850
problems here.
Let's go back. Something triggered from your

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.240
childhood.
Let's go deep into your psyche, and let's

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:51.130
understand what happened here.
Grandma doesn't have a clue. She's ideological.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:55.650
She may be theological. Maybe even mythlogical.
She's not therapeutic, all right?

00:22:55.650 --> 00:23:02.090
Consciousness changes over history.
And when consciousness changes, empathy extends

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.520
itself.
Now, I want you to think 'Google'.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:09.820
The real Google -- your real mission in the
21st century.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:14.320
The communication revolutions allow us to
extend the central nervous system so we can

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.170
bring more diverse people together across
time and space.

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:23.700
So if you are in a forager/hunter society
with oral communication, and mythlogical thinking,

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:28.020
your empathy doesn't extend beyond shouting
distance -- your blood kin, your relatives

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:33.340
 -- because that's who you've got.
Oral communication, forage and hunting, small

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:38.010
spatial/temporal limits.
When we go to the great, hydraulic, agricultural

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:42.679
civilizations, script allows us to extend
the central nervous system, annihilate a little

00:23:42.679 --> 00:23:48.220
bit of time and space.
Empathy extends beyond blood ties to associational

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:53.900
ties, religious affiliations.
Jews start to see other Jews as extended family

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.850
and extend their empathy from blood ties to
religious ties.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:01.490
Muslims empathize with Muslims. Christians
with Christians.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:07.250
When we get to the 19th century, print communication
 -- with coal, steam, and rail -- extends

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:11.210
the central nervous system and again annihilates
time and space, right?

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:14.340
People began to empathize around national
boundaries.

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:19.230
That's the extension of print communication.
Americans start to see Americans as the extended

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:23.010
families and empathize with each other.
The French with the French, the Japanese with

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:28.850
the Japanese.
Now, we are on the cusp of a global economy

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:33.020
and a biosphere era.
Can we extend the boundaries of empathy?

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:40.200
It started with blood ties in local regions
 -- to religious affiliations, to national

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.100
boundaries, and now, to the human species
in the biosphere?

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:49.690
Hold that aside.
There's a paradox in history.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:55.620
It's a deep paradox in the empathic civilization.
In this book, I write about this sub-theme.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:59.601
And it has never been discussed before, but
it's something we really need to have a conversation

00:24:59.601 --> 00:25:02.240
about.
There's a deep paradox in human history.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:09.590
It's the empathy/entropy paradox.
And that is, as we create more complex energy-consuming

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:14.590
civilizations and bring them together with
more sophisticated communication so we can

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:20.100
extend the central nervous system -- bring
more people together -- heighten our sensibilities

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:26.570
and our empathy, become more cosmopolitan,
those same more-complex, energy-consuming

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:31.620
civilizations increase the entropy bill.
More energy, more depletion of resources,

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:36.170
a bigger footprint.
Today, we live in the most interconnected,

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:40.530
interdependent civilization in the world.
We're connecting the central nervous system

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:44.780
of the entire human race.
And the same technologies that we are using

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:50.230
right now are consuming vast amounts of the
earth's energy, taking us to the abyss of

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:54.780
climate change and the potential extinction
of our species. Bitter sweet.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:59.300
Because we can almost smell the summit, with
all the blowbacks.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:03.000
I mean, the zenophobism and the wars and the
terrible things going on.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.910
We can actually smell the summit where we
begin to think as a human species.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:13.059
Think Haiti -- within an hour on Twitter and
on YouTube and Google and everywhere.

00:26:13.059 --> 00:26:17.920
Within an hour, the whole human race was responding
with an empathic embrace.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:24.800
If the Enlightenment philosophers are right,
and we are detached, calculating, rational,

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:31.090
autonomous agents who pursue our own pleasure
and libido and self-interest, you can't account

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:35.179
for the response in Haiti.
The response was, "Now, we have the technology,

00:26:35.179 --> 00:26:41.640
thanks to Google -- to connect the entire
human race at the speed of light."

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:46.140
An empathic embrace.
The problem is, we're also smelling our potential

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.429
extinction.
We may get almost to the summit, and then

00:26:48.429 --> 00:26:50.720
that's it.
We may lose ourselves.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:55.990
I really believe that's possible within less
than three generations.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:27:00.630
How do you break the empathy/entropy paradox?
This is where you come in.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.650
But I'm going to say, You don't even know
where you come in yet.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:08.720
You have a lot of smart, young people here.
But here's where you come in.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:13.380
We are on the cusp of a Third Industrial Revolution
 -- a new convergence of communication and

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:22.220
energy that could get us to distributed consciousness,
thinking as homo empathicus and creating an

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:27.070
empathic civilization.
We had a very powerful ICT Revolution in the

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:31.230
last 15 years -- the personal computer and
the Internet.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:36.000
Started with Microsoft; now, we're at Google.
We had this very powerful revolution.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.940
This is second-generation electricity communication.
First-generation was centralized -- top down.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:49.970
This new communication revolution is distributed,
flat, and open -- biosharing, YouTube, Wikipedia,

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:55.990
Linux, Google.
This distributed communication revolution

00:27:55.990 --> 00:28:01.370
is just now beginning to converge with the
new energy revolution -- distributed energy.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:07.970
When distributed communication manages distributed
energy, we may be on the point of moving to

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:15.700
distributed consciousness -- biosphere awareness,
thinking as homo empathicus.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.860
What is 'distributed energy'?
Let's compare it with elite energies.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:25.030
Elite energies we know about.
Coal, oil, gas, uranium -- they're elite.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:28.059
They're elite, because if you go home today,
you're not going to find them in your backyard.

00:28:28.059 --> 00:28:32.549
Pretty good chance you won't find them there.
They're only found in certain pockets of the

00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:35.450
world.
They require huge, military investments to

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:39.429
secure them.
Huge, geopolitical investments to manage them.

00:28:39.429 --> 00:28:45.309
Massive capital to organize them.
Be clear, fossil fuels and uranium have given

00:28:45.309 --> 00:28:49.740
us the most centralized, complex civilization
in history.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.800
But those energies are sunsetting, and the
infrastructure we've embedded them in are

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.170
on life-support.
What are 'distributed energies'?

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:02.309
Go home tonight, all the energy you need is
distributed across your backyard.

00:29:02.309 --> 00:29:08.299
The sun shines all over the world every day.
The wind blows across this planet every day.

00:29:08.299 --> 00:29:11.720
Wherever we tread on the ground, there's a
hot, thermal core of heat under this earth

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.130
for energy.
Wherever there's water, we have small hydro

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:18.080
for electricity.
Wherever there's municipal waste, it can be

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.910
regenerated back to energy.
In the rural areas, we have agriculture and

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.940
forestry waste.
On the oceans, where most of the urban population

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.320
is, those tides are coming in and out every
single day.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:34.809
I've been privileged to work with the European
Union for the last ten years and was honored

00:29:34.809 --> 00:29:38.240
to develop the long-term Third Industrial
Revolution Game Plan for the E.U.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:43.960
It was endorsed by the Parliament in 2007.
We're rolling it across 27 member states from

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.780
the Irish seat to Russia now.
I'd like to lay this out for you here at Google,

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:52.350
because I think there's that pivotal role
that you have yet to play, but will play here,

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:55.960
which will transform your company into something
quite different.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.120
It'll take where you are -- take you to something
that's going to create a legacy for the human

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.410
race.
Let me lay out this four-pillar Third Industrial

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:08.490
Revolution.
Let me preface this by saying, the E.U. is

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:12.270
the lead economy in the world today.
We think about G-2 -- America and China. A

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:16.280
wake up call.
The GDP of the 27 member states of the E.U

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.710
 -- which is a political union -- exceeds
the GDP of the 50 states of the United States

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.990
of America.
And if you put the GDP of the U.S. and China

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:29.030
together, it's almost matched by the E.U.
Here's the laboratory.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:33.880
Four-pillar infrastructure, Third Industrial
Revolution to organize distributed communication,

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.520
to manage distributed energy, to create distributed
consciousness.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.390
First pillar, 20 percent renewable energy
by 2020 mandated.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:45.720
That's a third of the electricity in Europe.
Done deal.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.400
Pillar two -- buildings -- buildings, buildings,
buildings.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:55.870
Buildings are the No. 1 cause of climate change.
They are responsible for a third of the CO2.

00:30:55.870 --> 00:31:01.040
The No. 2 cause of climate change -- which
we never talk about -- is beef production

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:05.940
and consumption.
Nobody wants to talk about that, even Al Gore.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:10.360
Not one leader of 192 countries made a single
statement about the No. 2 cause of climate

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.100
change.
How serious are we about our own extinction?

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:18.600
No. 3 is worldwide transport.
So No. 1 pillar of this infrastructure, renewable

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.450
energy -- mandated.
Two, buildings.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:26.350
We imagine every single existing building
across the E.U -- every home, office, factory,

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:31.350
shopping mall, technology park that exist
today -- converted to a partial power plant

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:37.150
in the next 25 to 30 years.
So, the building collects all the distributed

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:41.330
energy around the neighborhood -- the sun
off the roof, the wind on the walls, the heat

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:49.770
under the ground, the garbage, etc.
Pillar three, storage. Because in California,

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:54.310
as in elsewhere, the sun isn't always shining.
The wind isn't always blowing. These are intermittent

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:58.120
energies.
So when they are -- when the sun is out, and

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.450
the wind is blowing -- you got to find a way
to store some of that electricity.

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:05.970
So the E.U. is committed to pillar three -- an
8 billion Euro rollout of hydrogen storage

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:09.510
technology.
So when the sun hits your roof, or the wind

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:14.900
hits the wall, you generate electricity.
If you have surplus, you electrolyze water.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:19.360
Hydrogen comes into a cell from the water.
And then, when the sun isn't hitting the roof,

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.070
convert it back.
How many engineers here?

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.980
Of course, now, a lot of people will say,
"Well, wait a minute.

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:29.890
Isn't that a waste of electricity twice?"
What every engineer knows is, you cannot escape

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:33.500
the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
That's what empathy/entropy is all about.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:37.660
You always pay the bill.
If we begin to understand the conversion price

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:43.200
in bringing oil and uranium all the way the
power to you, it's through the roof.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.720
So Pillar one, renewable energy.
Pillar two, the buildings become the power

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.860
plants.
They suck up the energy around the buildings

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.220
 -- renewables.
Pillar three, hydrogen storage.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:57.090
Pillar four -- and this is where you come
in -- you're not quite there yet -- Pillar

00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:03.630
four is where the distributed ICT revolution
begins to manage the distributed energy revolution

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:08.230
to create a Third Industrial Revolution, and
hopefully, distributed consciousness.

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:13.010
We take the exact same technology that created
the Internet -- identical.

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:17.290
And we take the power grid of the European
Union -- hopefully, North America and elsewhere.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:22.640
And we transform that power lines into an
intergrid that acts like the Internet.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:28.809
So that when millions and millions and millions
of buildings across Europe are collecting

00:33:28.809 --> 00:33:33.410
a little bit of their own energy -- renewables
that are around the site -- storing it with

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:38.950
hydrogen, like we store media in digital,
and then sharing what they don't need across

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:43.980
smart, distributed grids across all of Europe.
This is a Third Industrial Revolution.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:50.390
This is power to the people. This is distributed
capitalism.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:52.631
And this answers a question we couldn't answer
for 30 years.

00:33:52.631 --> 00:33:57.250
For 30 years, governments would say to me,
"Mr. Rifkin, my gosh, we love windmills and

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:01.200
solar roofs and garbage and all of that, but
you can't run a global economy on these soft

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.710
energies.
You still need coal, oil, gas, uranium, tar

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:07.929
sands.
They're hard energy."

00:34:07.929 --> 00:34:14.639
We couldn't answer this question for 30 years,
but now we can -- thanks to your industry.

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:19.779
It's called second-generation Grid IT.
Last seven years, we got the answer.

00:34:19.779 --> 00:34:25.929
We now have software -- grid IT -- that allows
us to connect hundreds of thousands, or even

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:30.919
millions of little desktop computers that
don't have a lot of power, but when we connect

00:34:30.919 --> 00:34:36.089
them with Grid IT software, the distributed
power of hundreds of thousands of little desktop

00:34:36.089 --> 00:34:41.349
computers exceeds by a magnitude anything
you can imagine with centralized supercomputers,

00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:45.220
correct?
We can take Grid IT to the power lines when

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:50.090
millions and then hundreds of millions of
structures are generating just a little bit

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:55.210
of their energy on site, storing with hydrogen
like you store media in digital, then distributed,

00:34:55.210 --> 00:35:00.150
sharing it across contiguous land masses of
the Great Continents, the power exceeds anything

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:05.700
you could ever imagine with centralized nuclear
and coal-fired power plants.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:12.099
This is a generational shift.
My generation still thinks centralized, top-down,

00:35:12.099 --> 00:35:17.160
and right-left.
Your generation thinks differently -- distributed,

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:21.940
collaborative, open-source.
And right at the heart of it is right here

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:28.029
at Google.
Old generation in this campus here.

00:35:28.029 --> 00:35:34.160
If we are able to make this shift, we can
begin to imagine empathy extended in a distributed

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.460
way across the world.
That is, when everyone takes responsibility

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:44.259
for that small swath of the biosphere where
we live, and harness the energy of the earth

00:35:44.259 --> 00:35:49.299
there, and then, share it across continents,
we begin to think distributed responsibility

00:35:49.299 --> 00:35:53.869
for the human race.
We have to be both entrepreneurial and collaborative.

00:35:53.869 --> 00:35:57.690
We have to create energy spaces that act like
social spaces on the Internet.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:02.150
We have to think 'commons'.
This is a revolution in thinking.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:08.220
It changes temporal/spatial orientation.
Unless we think this is impossible -- you

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:12.940
know what I imagine, and this will resonate
with you folks here -- remember after the

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:18.170
Iran elections that were flawed and the young
students protested in the streets and the

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:23.669
government started to get violent by shooting?
And they shot a young, college, premed student

00:36:23.669 --> 00:36:27.079
 -- a young woman.
And someone had a cell phone, and they videoed

00:36:27.079 --> 00:36:30.730
it.
And within an hour, across the world -- because

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:35.819
of Google and all of the communications -- an
entire generation was empathizing with the

00:36:35.819 --> 00:36:40.099
young students on the streets.
That's biosphere consciousness.

00:36:40.099 --> 00:36:44.499
Today, in every school, our young people are
learning, from the time they're six or seven,

00:36:44.499 --> 00:36:49.009
that everything they do each day affects someone
else -- the food they eat, the clothes they

00:36:49.009 --> 00:36:51.790
wear, the electricity they use, the family
car.

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:56.869
Every single thing they do actually intimately
affects the well-being of another human or

00:36:56.869 --> 00:37:03.819
another animal on this planet.
That's biosphere consciousness.

00:37:03.819 --> 00:37:07.869
The problem is, How do we break the paradox
of history -- more empathy, more entropy?

00:37:07.869 --> 00:37:12.160
A Third Industrial Revolution gives your generation
a shock, because this is distributed.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.739
It's sustainable.
It's 'think global' and 'act local'.

00:37:15.739 --> 00:37:18.230
There is no guarantee you're going to get
there.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:22.650
I honestly don't know, when I look at all
the younger folks here, who will be around

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:26.630
in 2050 -- 2075 -- I don't know whether you're
going to make it.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:31.369
Our scientists say we only have a few more
years to get one roadmap for the world.

00:37:31.369 --> 00:37:34.930
No mistakes.
And we've got to get to a post-carbon era

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:38.859
quickly.
I hope the scientists are all wrong, but I

00:37:38.859 --> 00:37:43.039
think they're underestimating the speed of
the feedback loops.

00:37:43.039 --> 00:37:47.160
So, how can consciousness change?
Let me use an example.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.829
First mirrors, and then, I want to move up
to Google maps.

00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:54.880
How many of you looked in a mirror today?
Raise your hands.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:59.220
You take that for granted, don't you?
Do you realize that up to the 14th, 15th century,

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:03.859
people did not see themselves clearly?
That's why there wasn't a lot of hygiene and

00:38:03.859 --> 00:38:07.269
grooming back then.
You could see yourself in a pond of water,

00:38:07.269 --> 00:38:11.589
woe! As it's streaming down the river or in
a piece of metal.

00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:16.609
But in the 1400s in Morano or Venice, they
started mass-producing mirrors.

00:38:16.609 --> 00:38:21.640
And they took these little mirrors, and whenever
you bought a printed book, you got a mirror.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:25.479
All of a sudden, the new pastime -- people
started looking at themselves.

00:38:25.479 --> 00:38:31.809
"Wow, that's me." You, me.
It wasn't about narcissism.

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:36.470
It allowed people to create self-reflection.
That's what mirrors do -- reflect.

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:40.400
So now, we call it 'self-reflection'.
It allowed us to develop selfhood.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:46.440
More individuality in a more existential sense
of how 'I am not you,' 'you are not I,' but

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:53.579
I can existentially support your struggle,
because I know you're a separate, individual

00:38:53.579 --> 00:38:58.249
identity.
Now, let's go up to Google.

00:38:58.249 --> 00:39:08.080
When I was young, and I remember in 1969 when
the Apollo spaceship passed the dark side

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.470
of the moon on the last journey, our guys
came up on the bright side.

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:15.130
The sun is shining on the Earth and in this
ship, they took some photos of the planet

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:18.869
Earth.
Those photos were put up on posters all over

00:39:18.869 --> 00:39:22.019
the world.
That was an out-of-body experience.

00:39:22.019 --> 00:39:28.269
Today, because of Google, you have a whole
generation that's wired their brain differently.

00:39:28.269 --> 00:39:33.999
You can take a Google map from outer space,
zoom down anywhere on this planet into the

00:39:33.999 --> 00:39:37.970
door and window of any building.
That out-of-body experience allows us to look

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:40.690
from the outside in.
From the upside down.

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:45.989
So we get a sense of how small this is.
And how we're responsible, because we're embedded

00:39:45.989 --> 00:39:49.210
and in charge of this little sphere called
'Earth'.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:55.849
That is truly a new change in consciousness.
People before that Google maps, they did not

00:39:55.849 --> 00:39:59.349
have that sense of framework from the outside
in and from top-down.

00:39:59.349 --> 00:40:07.210
So, can we make this in time?
What we have now is, 50 percent of the human

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:11.410
race living above our means in a nonsustainable
world with a big carbon footprint.

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:15.880
40 percent of the human race living on two
dollars a day or less, barely able to survive.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:23.239
How do we bring everyone together?
How do we break the empathy/entropy paradox?

00:40:23.239 --> 00:40:28.910
I think we revisit what makes us happy.
Now remember, John Locke said, "The negation

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:33.259
of nature, the acquisition of property, the
material wealth makes us happy."

00:40:33.259 --> 00:40:37.880
Or to quote one of the great sages of the
20th century, "Material girl, material world,"

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:43.450
she got it wrong too, all right?
But the new happiness studies are very interesting,

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:46.170
because they're showing us, "If you're really
poor, you're not happy.

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:51.289
You have very few emotional and empathic reserves
to think about the polar bears."

00:40:51.289 --> 00:40:55.400
As you get wealthier, you get happier.
Until you reach a threshold of what we call

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.789
'basic comfort'.
That's the threshold.

00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:02.960
Beyond that, the wealthier we get, the more
unhappy we are.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:09.779
Envy comes in, empathy goes down, we become
more insular and more isolated.

00:41:09.779 --> 00:41:13.239
So the question is, How do we take the top
half of the human race in terms of wealth

00:41:13.239 --> 00:41:17.349
and learn to live more sustainably while the
bottom half comes up to the threshold?

00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:21.369
And now, I'm going to step on some toes here
in the U.S.

00:41:21.369 --> 00:41:26.380
We got to move beyond the American Dream.
It's not suited for the biosphere world you're

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:30.800
going into.
That dream was the dream of the Enlightenment

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.329
philosophy, based on the idea that we're all
detached, autonomous, individual agents who

00:41:35.329 --> 00:41:40.450
pursue our self-interest and our utility.
And it worked for two centuries in a frontier

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:44.819
when the world was being colonized.
But can you imagine how we're going to bring

00:41:44.819 --> 00:41:50.979
the world together, create a global economy,
save the biosphere, with 6.8 billion cowboys

00:41:50.979 --> 00:41:59.130
each pursuing their individual self-interest?
There's a new dream emerging among your generation.

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:03.819
It's not the American Dream.
It still -- it doesn't discount personal opportunity,

00:42:03.819 --> 00:42:09.339
but it puts it in a larger context.
If you ask young people in Europe and much

00:42:09.339 --> 00:42:15.049
of America what the dream is, I hear more
and more this term, "quality of life."

00:42:15.049 --> 00:42:19.329
We want a good quality of life.
That's a community exercise.

00:42:19.329 --> 00:42:23.849
It requires individual empowerment and community
collaboration.

00:42:23.849 --> 00:42:29.019
What you're doing on Google is, you're creating
a new frame of reference with the technology.

00:42:29.019 --> 00:42:32.329
And that is, on Google, people don't say right
or left.

00:42:32.329 --> 00:42:35.619
They talk about collaborative. They talk about
the commons.

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:38.660
They talk about distributing and sharing knowledge,
correct?

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:43.130
That's a sea change.
That's the beginning of biosphere consciousness.

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:49.429
When young people saw that polar bear and
her cub on that ice flow -- that little video

00:42:49.429 --> 00:42:53.799
 -- and they knew they weren't going to make
it, an entire generation was empathizing right

00:42:53.799 --> 00:42:58.529
there at the moment, not just with the bear
and her cub on that ice flow because of climate

00:42:58.529 --> 00:43:04.489
change, but all our fellow species.
We're almost there. We're almost there.

00:43:04.489 --> 00:43:09.670
Can we get there?
I believe the mission here at Google is to

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:15.641
take this engine, which is allowing us to
connect the central nervous system of the

00:43:15.641 --> 00:43:22.269
human race, and connect every single aspect
of this planet into a single embrace.

00:43:22.269 --> 00:43:26.809
Connect that central nervous system -- that
distributed communication -- so we can organize

00:43:26.809 --> 00:43:32.089
distributed energy, take responsibility for
the energy that bays the planet distributed

00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:35.131
our consciousness.
And finally, here's what I'd like to see here

00:43:35.131 --> 00:43:40.420
at Google: You start a global conversation
right here.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:44.150
What is the purpose of this Internet?
What is the purpose of Google?

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:49.849
Is it more information?
More entertainment? Better commerce?

00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:55.391
That's all it is, that's a pretty tawdry reason
to connect the central nervous system of the

00:43:55.391 --> 00:44:00.589
human race -- I'm going to tell you that.
And if that is the case, we're going to dummy

00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:06.200
down the possibilities of saving our species.
What Google needs to do is prepare a global

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:14.880
conversation on how we began to use this new
Internet to ratchet up the conversation, to

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:20.130
begin a great, global discussion on how we
bring the human race together, create biosphere

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:27.140
consciousness, help us reduce the temperature
on the planet, think as homo empathicus.

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:32.390
Your mission, I think, is to help prepare
the groundwork for an empathic civilization.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:37.890
Don't squander this opportunity.
Help us lead the way into this new era.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:40.650
I think the mission is clear.
Thank you.

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:44.579
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:44:44.579 --> 00:44:53.450
&gt;&gt; I was told we should do a few minutes of
questions.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:54.450
Anyone? Yes.

00:44:54.450 --> 00:45:00.989
Q Yeah, when we talk about these previous
revolutions, a lot of them seem to have come

00:45:00.989 --> 00:45:05.469
fairly top-down.
There was a power or wealth opportunities

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:09.229
that were seen and seized by those who already
had capital to invest.

00:45:09.229 --> 00:45:12.009
While this one is being prevented mainly by
those people.

00:45:12.009 --> 00:45:16.660
And it doesn't look like those at the top
that have the centralized power are really

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:20.019
buying into this just yet.
And the market's going to take too long from

00:45:20.019 --> 00:45:23.690
what you're saying for this to catch up.
So I mean, how would you recommend a bottom-up

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:24.690
revolution to this?

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:27.539
A Well, I'm starting to see it happen.
I teach at the Wharton School.

00:45:27.539 --> 00:45:30.410
I've been at there for a long time, and I
teach in the executive program.

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:36.150
I teach CEOs -- our advanced management program.
I'm seeing a generational shift for sure.

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:41.680
The older generation is still top-down.
Patriarchal, from parenting styles, cool models,

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:45.819
business models, the work.
I'm seeing a younger generation in their 20's,

00:45:45.819 --> 00:45:49.700
30's, and 40's -- distributed, collaborative,
open-source.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:54.089
They're there.
The question is, How do we begin to bring

00:45:54.089 --> 00:45:59.529
this new, distributed thinking together in
a synergistic way so we bring distributed

00:45:59.529 --> 00:46:03.410
communication together with distributed energy
and create a distributed form of consciousness?

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:07.339
It's going to be very difficult.
I chair something called the Global CEO Third

00:46:07.339 --> 00:46:12.109
Industrial Revolution Business Round table.
We have 125 CEOs of leading companies -- not

00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:15.400
the energy companies -- but we have all the
major, renewable energy companies.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.519
Pillar one.
The major real estate and construction companies

00:46:18.519 --> 00:46:22.229
like Cushman &amp; Wakefield and CH2M Hills in
our group.

00:46:22.229 --> 00:46:26.190
Pillar three, we got the major hydrogen companies
like UTC Hydrogenics.

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:31.460
Pillar four, we've got IBM in our group now,
Cisco has just joined.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:35.450
You're not, but I would love you to be.
We've got Kima in our group.

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:39.380
We've got Phillips and Schneider.
And these are CEOs at their level.

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:43.479
And we have the major logistics company -- U.S.
postal service for example is in the group.

00:46:43.479 --> 00:46:48.359
And what we're doing now with this E.U. mandate
is, we're going into cities, regions, and

00:46:48.359 --> 00:46:53.009
countries, collaborating with major cities,
regions and countries to lay down masterplans

00:46:53.009 --> 00:46:56.450
all in the last year.
We just did San Antonio, seventh largest city

00:46:56.450 --> 00:47:00.789
in the U.S.
We're now doing Rome. Rome, the entire Rome.

00:47:00.789 --> 00:47:03.900
Third Industrial Revolution. 30 years, all
post-carbon.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:07.099
We just finished Monaco. We're going to Euchick
next week.

00:47:07.099 --> 00:47:10.809
We're working with Zapatero for an 8 billion
Euro rollout in Spain.

00:47:10.809 --> 00:47:15.470
We're working in Greece -- many countries.
So, I think the will is there among a whole

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:20.979
genre of businesses that get this.
We would love to have Google right there at

00:47:20.979 --> 00:47:25.961
the center of this revolution, because you've
already extended the central nervous system.

00:47:25.961 --> 00:47:30.900
Now, you have to allow us and help us extend
the distributed energy with that central nervous

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:35.410
system.
Tell your CEOs. Tell your senior manager.

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:38.759
We'd love to have them with us so we can begin
to develop this process.

00:47:38.759 --> 00:47:42.099
We don't really want to wait any longer, and
we're tired of pilot projects.

00:47:42.099 --> 00:47:45.339
We want to lay down whole infrastructures
in collaboration with regions.

00:47:45.339 --> 00:47:48.819
Anyone else?

00:47:48.819 --> 00:47:58.599
Q So the E.U. is mandating things.
And you mentioned something about both being

00:47:58.599 --> 00:48:05.519
bought by corporations being allowed nowadays.
But for the first one, that doesn't sound

00:48:05.519 --> 00:48:12.809
very distributed to me.
And you're getting corporations to basically

00:48:12.809 --> 00:48:18.329
cooperate -- or governments to cooperate with
the corporations to mandate things probably

00:48:18.329 --> 00:48:22.309
on the corporation's behalf.
So how do you balance this?

00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:24.930
A I'm glad you asked.
We have a set of rules in being involved with

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:30.990
this network for Google to know.
First of all, our CEOs are two different institutions

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:35.239
 -- global companies and the world's cooperatives.
At first, they were uncomfortable with each

00:48:35.239 --> 00:48:37.779
other.
We have the world's banking, construction

00:48:37.779 --> 00:48:41.959
cooperatives, retail, and housing cooperatives,
because we have some litmus tests.

00:48:41.959 --> 00:48:47.019
When we go into a city or region, first of
all, there has to be three players at the

00:48:47.019 --> 00:48:52.559
table -- the civil society, the local government,
and local business, and it's a collaborative

00:48:52.559 --> 00:48:57.461
effort with them and us.
Two, whatever energy is developed there has

00:48:57.461 --> 00:49:01.819
to be developed into cooperatives -- neighborhood
cooperatives, housing cooperatives, small

00:49:01.819 --> 00:49:07.119
retail cooperatives -- so people control their
own energy and distribute it across grids.

00:49:07.119 --> 00:49:11.869
Three, our companies have to engage in new
business models like performance contracts.

00:49:11.869 --> 00:49:16.829
So for example, Phillips is in my group.
Rudy Pruvost is the CEO of Phillips Lighting.

00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:21.430
They would come in, for example, to San Francisco
and say, "We'll do your outdoor lighting if

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:26.100
the community wants it.
We'll put in compact fluorescent LED to save

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:29.119
energy.
It's a performance contract. We'll finance

00:49:29.119 --> 00:49:32.289
it.
The city will pay us back on energy savings.

00:49:32.289 --> 00:49:38.140
If we can't do the energy savings, we lose."
So there's a whole set of new criteria.

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.779
All energy has to be local.
Energy cooperatives have to be set up.

00:49:41.779 --> 00:49:47.670
Whatever businesses emerge have to be local.
And the civil society, local government, and

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:51.789
business have to be in a joint collaborative
masterplan over a period of time with our

00:49:51.789 --> 00:49:54.070
global cooperatives and businesses.
Does that sound good to you?

00:49:54.070 --> 00:50:01.309
I don't know how else we would do it.
That engages everybody at the table -- everyone.

00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:10.279
So, my hope here is -- you've got a tremendous
opportunity here at Google.

00:50:10.279 --> 00:50:14.150
And you are privileged to be able to be at
a place where you can actually begin to roll

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:18.940
out the technology to allow us, not only to
connect our central nervous system, but to

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:24.650
connect our energy and connect our consciousness
and go to the next stage, which is biosphere

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:30.130
awareness -- and begin to think about preparing
an empathic civilization.

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:34.999
You're young, you've got the energy, don't
waste it.

00:50:34.999 --> 00:50:39.610
We need a legacy here, and that legacy is
to preserve our species, our fellow creatures,

00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:41.339
and the earth that we live in.
Thank you.

00:50:41.339 --> 00:50:41.450
&gt;&gt; [applause]
