goes through and I I think it's looking
 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.310
goes through and I I think it's looking
like every sign will it is about health

the on that systems level so when we've
 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.709
the on that systems level so when we've
talked about innovation in medicine what

talked about innovation in medicine what
 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.319

we've usually meant is will there be a

we've usually meant is will there be a
 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.720
we've usually meant is will there be a
new drug will we have the cure for

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730
new drug will we have the cure for
 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.479
new drug will we have the cure for
cancer and we are on our way with or

on health care there there's no shortage

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350
on health care there there's no shortage

on health care there there's no shortage
of money for those kinds of innovations

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439
of money for those kinds of innovations
 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.190
of money for those kinds of innovations
and I think those fields will prosper

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200
and I think those fields will prosper
 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.630
and I think those fields will prosper
but to take advantage of them and be

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640
but to take advantage of them and be
 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.670
but to take advantage of them and be
sure we're using them in every community

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680
sure we're using them in every community
 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.090
sure we're using them in every community
in the right way at the right time we

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100
in the right way at the right time we
 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.429
in the right way at the right time we
have not been innovating I think if

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439
have not been innovating I think if
 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.780
have not been innovating I think if
health reform doesn't pass that we will

health reform doesn't pass that we will
 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.880
health reform doesn't pass that we will
be very slow to innovate but there are

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890
be very slow to innovate but there are
 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.460
be very slow to innovate but there are
components in the health reform package

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470
components in the health reform package
 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.789

and also on the incentives end that is

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390
and also on the incentives end that is
 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.210

one of the reasons we don't come up with
 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.569
one of the reasons we don't come up with
these kinds of checklists is that

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579
these kinds of checklists is that
 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.590
these kinds of checklists is that

admitted to the hospital and they
 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.370
admitted to the hospital and they
recognize that a couple of components

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380
recognize that a couple of components

those two things they reduced admissions

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530
those two things they reduced admissions
 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.440
those two things they reduced admissions
for kids with asthma by eighty-seven

they found this experiment lost the
 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.010
they found this experiment lost the
millions of dollars and so they suddenly

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020
millions of dollars and so they suddenly
 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.140
millions of dollars and so they suddenly
were face to face with well maybe we

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150
were face to face with well maybe we
 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.240
were face to face with well maybe we
need to shut down this program in order

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250
need to shut down this program in order
 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.300
need to shut down this program in order
to survive as a hospital that's when you

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310
to survive as a hospital that's when you
 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.040
to survive as a hospital that's when you
know there's just something wrong with

know there's just something wrong with
 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.190
know there's just something wrong with
the way we are designing our system and

the best way to pay that hospital so

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050
the best way to pay that hospital so
 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.770
the best way to pay that hospital so
that it does the right thing but we have

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780
that it does the right thing but we have
 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.390
that it does the right thing but we have
some good ideas about the experiments to

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400
some good ideas about the experiments to
 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.990
some good ideas about the experiments to
try one is for example paying the

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000
try one is for example paying the
 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.230
try one is for example paying the
doctors and hospital together whether

about taking care of this kid with
 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.980
about taking care of this kid with

dollars for that diagnosis and care in
 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.750
dollars for that diagnosis and care in
that year and so let's simply give that

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760
that year and so let's simply give that
 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.770
that year and so let's simply give that
money and then have them work to try to

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780
money and then have them work to try to
 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.440
money and then have them work to try to
make the best of that financial

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450
make the best of that financial
 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.230
