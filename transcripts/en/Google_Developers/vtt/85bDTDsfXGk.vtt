00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:09.720
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.811
Welcome to the Google Developers
Live studio here in Paris.

00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:13.560
I'm with Francois.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.226
Hello, Francois.

00:00:14.226 --> 00:00:15.700
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
Hello, Alexis.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.110
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
And we're

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.580
here to talk about
channels in Chrome OS.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.790
So just like Chrome the
browser and Chromebooks,

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.750
you have Chrome OS.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.360
And you can have different
types of channels.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.244
So tell us which ones are
those, and what is the default?

00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:30.410
Maybe let's start with this.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.110
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: So yeah,
if you don't know anything

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.560
about channels, you are
on the stable channel.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.930
This is the safest one.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.890
That's the one you
should be on right now

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.940
if you don't know
anything about channels.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.430
And it has been fully tested
and blessed by the Chrome team.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.070
Really, that's the
one you should be.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.320
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: OK.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.680
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Just
need to remember one thing.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.054
ALEXIS
MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Great.

00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:49.830
So can I check?

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.256
Maybe I've been fiddling
with the options, and how can

00:00:52.256 --> 00:00:53.900
I look at and see where--

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.441
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
Let's have a look.

00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:59.780
Click on the Chrome menu
here, then Settings.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.110
Then click on the Help
section there-- more info.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.069
As you can see here, I'm
on the stable channel.

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:08.776
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
OK, very good.

00:01:08.776 --> 00:01:10.520
So I'm on the stable channel.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.320
This is great, but I'm
kind of adventurous.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.040
I want to--

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.510
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Are you?

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.301
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Well, sometimes.

00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:17.930
Let's pretend.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.380
And I want to see
things that I've heard

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.150
will be coming down the line,
and I want to test those.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.870
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: And that's--
yeah, there is a channel.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.240
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Beta is what I'm looking for.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.490
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Exactly.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.690
If you, like you say, if you
feel adventurous, a little bit,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.440
just go to a beta
channel, and you

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.400
will get all the cool
upcoming features

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.889
that will come to Chrome OS.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.930
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
So are we guaranteed--

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.042
these are just things that
are not stable enough--

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:43.000
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yes.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.125
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
But they will eventually

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:46.872
make it to the stable channel?

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:48.580
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
99% of the times, yes.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.121
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: And
how unstable are they, really?

00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:54.040
I mean how safe or unsafe
is it to use that channel?

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.130
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: It's beta,
so there might be a risk.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.010
But I think it's a fair
compromise between security

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.000
and OK, I want to
see what's happening.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.250
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: OK.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.881
So that's beta?

00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:06.880
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yeah.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.463
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: What
about updates to each channel?

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:11.764
Are they different in terms
of how frequent they are?

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:13.180
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
They are, sure.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.490
If you're on the stable
channel, every six weeks

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.840
you get a brand new
Chrome OS version.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.450
If you're on the beta
channel, every week

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.800
you've got an update.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.780
So this is pretty cool.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.130
If you stumble upon
a bug or a glitch

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.750
and say, ah, that's
weird, you can actually

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.290
report an issue to Chrome team.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.270
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Oh,
can I do this from Chrome--

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.680
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yeah.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.461
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Directly?

00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:34.960
Show me.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.251
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: So you
just click on the Chrome menu

00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:38.720
again and report an issue.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.303
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
That's all?

00:02:40.303 --> 00:02:44.170
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Or if
you are a keyboard lover,

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.130
you can just click
on Alt Shift I.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.630
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Oh, cool.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.088
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Now you can
send a message to the Chrome

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:53.980
team and-- actually
I was surprised,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.790
but they actually read it.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.560
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Now they do read this?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.010
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: No,
really, they consider it.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.150
So that's pretty cool.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.760
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
OK, great.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.960
So that's one way to do it.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.979
And then if you're used to going
to chromium.org and filing bugs

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:06.395
there, just don't
change anything?

00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:06.680
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Exactly.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.950
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
And this

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.830
is just a shorthand for doing
pretty much the same thing.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.660
It ends up in the same place.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.050
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
Definitely, yes.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.770
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
So dev,

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.360
I suppose if you are a developer
and you're watching this,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.751
you probably should try it out.

00:03:18.751 --> 00:03:19.750
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yeah.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.041
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
The edges are not too rough,

00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:22.951
I would think.

00:03:22.951 --> 00:03:24.200
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yeah, sure.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.310
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Now let's talk about something

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.380
that's really exciting.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.450
This is the dev channel.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.940
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yeah,
dev channel for development.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.460
Actually, that's my favorite.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.530
I'm always on dev
channel, and some weeks

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.940
are harder than
others, for sure.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.770
But it's very cool.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.870
You get all the cool new
features that will, or not,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.950
come to Chrome OS stable.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.679
That's the best way
to see what is coming.

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:48.220
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
OK, great.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.070
So do you want to show
us how this looks like?

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.815
Go to the dev, what does it say?

00:03:53.815 --> 00:03:55.981
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yeah,
it's pretty cool, actually.

00:03:55.981 --> 00:04:00.122
So you just click on
the channel button.

00:04:00.122 --> 00:04:02.330
As you can see, there is
three channels, like I said,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.220
stable, beta and developer.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.490
And if you want to go right
now to the developer channel,

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.330
let's click on the change
channel button again.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.732
And bing, you just wait now.

00:04:13.732 --> 00:04:15.690
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
So what happens now?

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.260
Now I'm doing--

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.740
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
So it's downloading

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.360
in the background the updates.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.879
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: OK.

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:21.920
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: So
maybe let's skip that part.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.878
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
OK, let's skip that.

00:04:23.878 --> 00:04:28.222
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: And OK,
now we've reached the 100%.

00:04:28.222 --> 00:04:30.680
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: So
it takes about a few minutes,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.640
depending on how big the update
is, how big of a pipe you have,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.390
and eventually you get
to a point where-- 100%.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.430
And you restart--

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.040
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: And it works.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.570
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
And there you

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.410
have those new features.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.380
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yes.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.713
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
OK, so that's super exciting,

00:04:46.713 --> 00:04:48.890
but there might be things
here that I don't want.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.980
It's really just too
unstable for what

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.170
I'm doing, what I need to do.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.940
Can I move back?

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.514
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Sure.

00:04:55.514 --> 00:04:56.930
If you want to
move back, there is

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.380
one thing you need to remember.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.249
That will power
wash your machine.

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:02.040
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
So power washing

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.710
is something which
sets the machine

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.325
to be like in a "I
just bought it" mode.

00:05:07.325 --> 00:05:08.450
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Exactly.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.189
So--

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:10.980
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
No user defined,

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.820
no local data, nothing.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.190
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Exactly.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.400
So all the files
you've done on it

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.252
and not saved on your
cloud, that will be lost.

00:05:20.252 --> 00:05:22.460
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
OK, so that's not too bad.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.770
Hopefully everything is
in the cloud, anyway.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.450
But what about the updates?

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.430
Are these full-blown updates of
Chrome OS you get all the time?

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.411
And they're big, and--

00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:37.910
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: That's a
cool part, actually, of updates.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.610
They are powered by the
project called Courgette,

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.850
which means in French, zucchini.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.720
So the Courgette
project-- basically

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.780
what the Chrome team did is
they have built a compression

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.260
algorithm that analyzes
the Chromium source code,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.240
and compress it like
ever to send the smallest

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.044
byte to your device.

00:06:04.044 --> 00:06:05.960
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
But it's also diff.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.720
It's super compressed,
and it's a diff.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.220
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: It's diff
between two versions of Chrome.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.800
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: OK.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.330
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: That's
pretty cool, pretty quick.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.246
And, like you said, just
two minutes, and I've

00:06:14.246 --> 00:06:15.120
got a new version.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.495
ALEXIS
MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Right.

00:06:16.495 --> 00:06:20.482
So just to sum up this quick
presentation here, stable--

00:06:20.482 --> 00:06:21.440
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yep.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.220
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Development--

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.178
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Dev.

00:06:24.178 --> 00:06:26.350
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
And beta in the middle.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.060
So that's great.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:33.320
There are ways to send feedback
right from the tool here.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.312
What do you use?

00:06:34.312 --> 00:06:36.020
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: I
use the dev channel,

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.830
but like you said,
stable for everyone.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.080
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: OK.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.180
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Beta, eh.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.320
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Everybody watching this should

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.050
try beta--

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.280
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yeah.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.910
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
At least I think.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.451
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
You should try it,

00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:50.030
report bugs if you find some.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.170
And dev channel, be careful.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.290
But I love it.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.490
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
OK, well, if you love it,

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.260
you probably need
to try dev, as well.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.470
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yeah.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.360
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Well, that's

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.260
all the time we have for it.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.100
Thank you, Francois.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.730
Merci.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.422
And we'll be seeing you for--

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:03.380
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yep.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:03.960
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Another short episode

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.560
hopefully.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.710
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: See you guys.
