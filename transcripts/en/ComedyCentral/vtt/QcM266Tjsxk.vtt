00:00:00.701 --> 00:00:01.902
AND THE LAST ONE IS SOCK
PUPPETS.

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.537
I KNOW--
I KNOW IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS,

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.372
BUT YOU'RE NOT GETTING PAID
UNTIL YOU DO IT.

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:06.740
PLUS, IT SAYS
IT'S A LOT OF FUN.

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.976
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS
A SOCK PUPPET SAYING THAT.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.978
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN
REALLY TAKE HIS WORD FOR IT.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.881
[ethereal music]

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:17.317
â™ª

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:20.521
OKAY, THOSE ARE...
GREAT, ACTUALLY.

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:24.224
SO LET'S USE 'EM.
- THIS IS SO DUMB.

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:25.626
I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS.

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.961
- DUDE, IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.
OKAY? SOCK UP.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:29.029
- USE THE PUPPET.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:32.466
- FINE. THIS IS <i>DUMB.</i>

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.835
ALMOST AS DUMB AS NOT DRINKING
FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.604
- EVERYTHING
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS DUMB.

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:40.340
- AND <i>FARTSI'S </i>
A <i>GENIUS</i> IDEA!

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:43.143
- YEAH.
FOR ONCE, ADAM'S RIGHT, BLAKE.

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:45.145
IT'S TIME YOU GREW UP
AND PUT YOUR TIME TOWARDS

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.514
SOMETHING THAT'S WORTH SOMETHING
TO SOMEBODY

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:48.549
ANYWHERE ON THIS PLANET.

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:49.850
- GET HIM!

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:54.621
- DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:58.692
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME,
YOU FAKE-ASS GROWN-UP.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.093
- OOH...

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:02.095
- OH, I'M SORRY, MAYBE
IF YOU WEREN'T SO IMMATURE,

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.698
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO HOLD YOUR
HAND AND WIPE YOUR ASS FOR YOU.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.733
- OKAY, THAT WAS ONE TIME.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:09.436
AND I TOLD YOU, I'D NEVER BEEN
CAMPING BEFORE.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.606
- HEY, GUYS, WHY DON'T WE
TALK ABOUT ME NOW?

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:14.441
- OH, OF COURSE.
WHO COULD FORGET YOU?

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.076
I LOVE HOW IT TAKES US
TO QUIT DRINKING

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.079
TO REMEMBER HOW SELFISH ADAM
"THE MAIN ATTRACTION" DEMAMP

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.314
REALLY IS.

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:23.116
- OH, I LIKE HOW YOU'RE USING
THAT NICKNAME

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.452
TO HURT MY FEELINGS,
BUT GUESS WHAT, ANDERS.

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:26.653
- YEAH?
- I LOVE IT.

00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:29.323
AND I'M GONNA USE IT
ALL THE TIME NOW.

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:31.525
- DO YOU EVER STOP TALKING?

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.094
- YEAH, BLAKE, I'LL AGREE.
BUT AT LEAST HE KNOWS

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.663
HOW TO WRITE A RENT CHECK
ON TIME, LIKE AN ADULT.

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:39.233
- MM-HMM.
- OH. YOU WANT ME TO GROW UP?

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.969
YEAH, I'M IMMATURE.
I'M <i>REAL</i> IMMATURE.

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:46.807
BUT I'M IMMATURE
BECAUSE I KNOW, WHEN I GROW UP,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.876
IT MEANS I'M GONNA BE
THAT MUCH CLOSER

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.377
TO MOVING AWAY FROM YOU GUYS,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.579
AND MARRYING GIRLS AND STUFF.

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:55.582
- COME ON, MAN,
DON'T SAY THAT.

00:01:55.616 --> 00:02:00.087
- NO...HE'S RIGHT.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.689
[voice breaking]
I'M SORRY TOO.

00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:05.225
I KNOW I CAN BE
SELF-CENTERED SOMETIMES,

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.862
BUT...
I NEVER HEARD "NO" GROWING UP.

00:02:08.896 --> 00:02:12.299
NOW THAT I'VE LOGGED
10,000 HOURS OF BEING A BRAT,

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.768
I'M JUST A TOTAL
SELF-SERVING OUTLIER,

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.838
AND THAT'S NOT HOW ADAM
"THE MAIN ATTRACTION" DEMAMP

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.072
WANTS TO LIVE!

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:21.074
- OH, MAN. ADAM, LOOK...
[sniffs]

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:22.843
IT'S HARD TO SAY NO
TO THAT FACE.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.311
IT'S A CUTE ONE.
- IT IS.

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:25.579
- THANK YOU.

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:27.581
- I KNOW I CAN BE
CONTROLLING SOMETIMES,

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:30.250
BUT IT'S JUST BECAUSE
I CARE ABOUT YOU,

00:02:30.284 --> 00:02:32.519
AND I WANT THE BEST
FOR YOU.

00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:34.521
BUT SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S BEST.

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:37.224
AND THAT--
THAT SCARES ME.

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:40.527
- LIFE...IS...SCARY.

00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:42.796
- I KNOW THAT I CAN
TELL YOU GUYS THIS,

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.099
AND YOU WON'T JUDGE ME.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.904
I...LIKE...YOU GUYS!

00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:52.339
- [crying]
I LIKE YOU TOO, MAN!

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:54.908
I LIKE YOU.
LET'S STOP FIGHTING.

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:57.344
- LET'S STOP FIGHTING.
I LIKE YOU GUYS!

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.780
I LIKE YOU GUYS!

00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:02.482
- WOW.
THAT WAS INTENSE.

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:02.583
THIS BOOK WORKS.
