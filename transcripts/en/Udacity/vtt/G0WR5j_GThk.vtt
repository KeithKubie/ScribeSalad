Unlike a fish-eye lens, lines remain straight on the screen with both a

00:00:03.548 --> 00:00:08.511
perspective and an orthographic transform. Normal perspective matrices cause

00:00:08.511 --> 00:00:12.790
distant objects to appear smaller. Orthographic do not. The Z depth varies

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.327
nonlinearly with perspective. It's linear with orthographic. The nonlinearity

00:00:17.327 --> 00:00:20.194
for perspective is connected with the fact that lines stay straight when

00:00:20.194 --> 00:00:24.775
transformed. In perspective, parallel lines usually meet at a vanishing point.

00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:28.061
Orthographic is useful in computer-aided design, because lines are made

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.080
parallel.
