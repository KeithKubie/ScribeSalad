00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.780
SAL: I'm here with Jessica.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.550
What do you do here, Jessica?

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.910
JESSICA: Great question, Sal.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.020
My title here is
the chief of staff,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.400
but I like to think of it as
a catch-all for any position

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.460
that we haven't hired
full-time for, I pick up.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.106
So it's a lot on the business
strategy and operations

00:00:17.106 --> 00:00:18.730
side of the house
and covers everything

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.660
from recruiting and prepping
our documentation for our board

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.170
meetings to going to
Costco and picking up

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.030
the toilet paper if we need it.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.880
SAL: When necessary.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.880
JESSICA: When necessary.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.440
SAL: From very high level
tasks to somewhat low level--

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.240
but sometimes has to get done.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.570
And how did you end up here?

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.350
Where did you start your career?

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.430
What did you think you're
going to end up being?

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.270
JESSICA: I am a
native of California,

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.750
so I went through the UC
system, went to UC San Diego,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.760
and started studying
electrical engineering.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.557
SAL: And you went on some
type of super scholarship.

00:00:53.557 --> 00:00:55.640
JESSICA: I was a Jacobs
scholar while I was there.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.890
It is a full merit scholarship.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.259
SAL: Named for Irwin Jacobs.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.800
JESSICA: Yes.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.330
Dr. Irwin Jacobs and his wife,
Joan, very generous supporters

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.350
of UC San Diego and had
started the scholarship program

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.600
in hopes of attracting talent on
the caliber of the Ivy Leagues.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.010
He had been at MIT
before that and had

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.090
wanted to create that
culture [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.584
SAL: And this was a full ride.

00:01:16.584 --> 00:01:17.750
JESSICA: It was a full ride.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.137
SAL: And how many students
got this at UCSD every year?

00:01:21.137 --> 00:01:22.720
JESSICA: So I was
the inaugural class,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.875
and we were a class of 10.

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:24.915
SAL: A class of 10.

00:01:24.915 --> 00:01:26.280
JESSICA: A class of 10.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.040
SAL: Probably not
too easy to get.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.050
JESSICA: I figure I was
just really, really lucky.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.370
My parents were very happy, too.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.950
SAL: And a lot less.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.075
They could go buy
a car or something.

00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:40.200
JESSICA: They were able to
retire a little earlier.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.990
SAL: Retire a
little bit earlier.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.865
And so you majored in
electrical engineering,

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:45.239
and so you thought
you were going

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:46.496
to be an electrical engineer?

00:01:46.496 --> 00:01:47.120
JESSICA: I did.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.610
So I did all of my internships
in electrical engineering,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.195
had worked at a number
of defense companies,

00:01:53.195 --> 00:01:54.890
worked at Qualcomm.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.670
And then I ended up
going to Stanford

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.559
for a PhD in
electrical engineering.

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:02.100
And then my first
quarter, I actually

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.740
got sidetracked when
a friend took me

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.270
to a management consulting
info session that was actually

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.350
geared towards engineers.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.835
And I had no idea
what this field was.

00:02:11.835 --> 00:02:13.260
I'd never heard of it.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.442
SAL: Few people do.

00:02:14.442 --> 00:02:15.900
JESSICA: But they
had talked about,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.360
you can have all this impact.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.350
You get to work with amazing
companies and learn a lot

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.032
and travel the world
while you're at it.

00:02:23.032 --> 00:02:25.240
And I just thought, what
could be a better education,

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.990
while getting paid a little
bit at the same time.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.740
SAL: And staying
in nice hotels--

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.486
JESSICA: Exactly.

00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:30.860
SAL: Nice dinners.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.068
JESSICA: It's amazing how
quickly you become obsessed

00:02:33.068 --> 00:02:33.900
with travel points.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.410
SAL: And how long
did you do that for?

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.370
JESSICA: I did that for
three and a half years

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.078
following my master's,
so I went directly

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:43.470
from Stanford into McKinsey.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.990
SAL: So you are now
in your early 20s?

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.930
JESSICA: Mid-20s.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.750
SAL: Mid-20s, now.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.210
And what kind of work-- how
was McKinsey what you expected,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.960
or how was it different
than you expected?

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.810
And what kind of stuff
did you end up doing?

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.900
JESSICA: So I ended up
focusing on consultancy jargon

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.130
of operational and
organizational transformation,

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.540
which looks at the operational
piece goes into organizations--

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.270
oftentimes it's technology
organizations in my case--

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.910
and looking at how
people did things,

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.493
and thinking of ways they could
do it more effectively or more

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:14.220
efficiently.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.760
So I worked with engineers,
data centers, executives,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.900
and the like.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.880
On the organizational side, it
was actually looking more at

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.980
how company culture
was, and how you

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.130
could make that thrive
in an organization

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.810
and think about
development for people.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.030
SAL: Which sounds eerily similar
to some of what you do here.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.710
JESSICA: Yes, very
eerily similar.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.940
And then a third piece of
what I did at McKinsey, I

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.760
had this awesome stint in
their internal learning group--

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.200
so developing the
training of how

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.760
to make a consultant
a consultant

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.470
and looking at how to allow
people to learn how to problem

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.210
solve and become better
with client relationships

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.700
and interpersonal skills.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.719
So I really loved the
learning piece of it.

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.760
SAL: And then, while you
were at McKinsey, that's

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.970
where you first met Shantanu
who is our president.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.620
JESSICA: Yes, we worked on
several projects together.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.200
SAL: And despite that, you
still wanted to work with him.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.120
JESSICA: Despite that.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.320
For some reason, rose
colored glasses [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.740
were really good
memories out of it.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.170
Yeah, consulting
was interesting.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.095
It was a lot of long
hours, a lot of travel.

00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:15.720
People think it's
glamorous when you're

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.803
traveling to other places.

00:04:16.803 --> 00:04:19.840
Oftentimes it was like,
typing up my PowerPoint

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.589
slides as I was on the
go and on my phone.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:22.390
SAL: It's probably a
little bit of both.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.220
It was a little bit glamorous.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.770
JESSICA: The
traveling was amazing.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.277
I don't think I ever would
have had an opportunity

00:04:27.277 --> 00:04:28.150
to [INAUDIBLE] otherwise.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.750
SAL: And you were interfacing
at a very high level

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.166
with a lot of these
organizations,

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:32.250
the senior executives.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.730
JESSICA: Best
learning experience

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.180
I could have ever hope
for coming out of school.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.150
SAL: Especially
at that age, to be

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.770
able to interface
with senior people

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.600
at some major
organizations, I could

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.620
imagine would be
very great learning.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.453
JESSICA: Absolutely.

00:04:41.453 --> 00:04:44.265
It was and incredible
training ground.

00:04:44.265 --> 00:04:46.576
SAL: And then after
that-- what was it,

00:04:46.576 --> 00:04:49.076
three and a half years-- and
then you decided to leave for--

00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:51.034
JESSICA: Yeah, so after
three and a half years,

00:04:51.034 --> 00:04:52.040
the lifestyle was tough.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.420
I found whenever
I was at home, I

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.850
was just sleeping to make
up for the work week.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.770
And so I decided to leave,
and I went to Yahoo!

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.730
Given my background
in transformations,

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.820
this was a company that was
in the midst of a huge one.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.590
And I thought I could help.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.590
So I went there-- also was
a great actual learning

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.320
ground for me.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.480
I was able to interface
with everybody

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.550
from the engineers to marketing,
finance, legal, and just

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.210
learned about the
entire organization

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.280
and how things worked both on
the search side of the house

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.420
as well as on the advertising
side of the house.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.700
SAL: And you worked with a
whole-- you ended up at Search.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.200
You were--

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.420
JESSICA: I did end up in Search.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.650
SAL: --a product manager there.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.191
JESSICA: Yes.

00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:37.780
So I ended up in Search as
a senior project manager

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.619
by the time I left.

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:40.160
SAL: And so that
sounded pretty good.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.300
So how did you end up here?

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.330
JESSICA: Yeah.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.060
SAL: Which now, in hindsight,
is the worst decision you ever

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.560
made.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.923
JESSICA: Best decision ever.

00:05:48.923 --> 00:05:50.200
You can pay me $5 after.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.070
SAL: Yes, yes.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.250
JESSICA: Just kidding.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.730
SAL: I would have edited out
any negative remarks anyway.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.690
JESSICA: I had kept in
touch with Shantanu.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.577
And so he he had
told me, over time,

00:06:02.577 --> 00:06:04.910
about how he was interfacing
with this guy named Sal who

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.456
was making these YouTube
videos, and I just

00:06:08.456 --> 00:06:09.580
thought it was really cool.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.204
I had checked out the site, seen
that we had all these practice

00:06:12.204 --> 00:06:14.090
modules and some
analytics behind it,

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.770
and just thought what was
happening here was awesome.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.540
So I offered up my
free time and said,

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.820
hey, I'd love to volunteer.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.500
I started doing that.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.810
And then right around
the time of the Ted talk,

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.510
things kind of got really
crazy for you guys.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.900
And I had been helping
to try to find, actually,

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.680
a different role that you were
thinking of hiring at the time.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.000
And then when things got crazy,
Shantanu said, hey actually,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.430
you might actually
be a great fit.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.060
SAL: Yeah, I think
we realized you

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.700
were doing more
in your free time

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.866
than we would have expected
from a full [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:43.866 --> 00:06:47.240
It was like, maybe Jessica's
the right person for this.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.510
And then you've come, and
that was 18 months ago.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.900
But it was at an early stage.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.930
I mean, how many
people were we then?

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.980
JESSICA: Yeah, when
I joined, I think I

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.900
was employee number
six, after Marsha.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.166
She was really early on.

00:07:00.166 --> 00:07:01.290
SAL: And now we're at what?

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.410
We're at--

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.544
JESSICA: We're now, I believe,
we're in our early 30's.

00:07:05.544 --> 00:07:06.210
SAL: Early 30's.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.830
JESSICA: Early 30's.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.830
SAL: 31, 32 people.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.560
And we have a bunch
of interns right now.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.309
JESSICA: Yeah, a bunch
of awesome interns.

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:15.680
SAL: We're like five
times bigger than we were.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.640
JESSICA: It's incredible
how much we've grown.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.972
SAL: Yeah, it is incredible.

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:20.775
Wow.

00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:22.670
And what's your takeaway?

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.775
What's the experience been
like, and where do you

00:07:24.775 --> 00:07:25.858
think this is going to go?

00:07:25.858 --> 00:07:28.065
JESSICA: Yeah, so my
experience has been phenomenal,

00:07:28.065 --> 00:07:29.690
I think beyond what
I could have hoped.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:30.731
SAL: I don't believe you.

00:07:30.731 --> 00:07:32.378
I'm sure, but anyway.

00:07:32.378 --> 00:07:33.901
Continue.

00:07:33.901 --> 00:07:35.400
JESSICA: But it's
just been amazing.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.480
I think the people
here are all just

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.180
so thoughtful and so
nice and just awesome.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.070
Everyone's brilliant but
just humble about it.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.870
And so I just feel
incredibly lucky to be

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.414
amongst this group of folks.

00:07:49.414 --> 00:07:50.830
I think as we've
grown, we've been

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.080
able to [? main ?] the
quirky, fun culture of being

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.925
proactive and thinking epic
and shipping beats perfection.

00:07:57.925 --> 00:07:59.870
Some of our values,
we've been really

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.260
great at keeping that going.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.280
As we grow, it's interesting.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.120
I think you once posed
the question around,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.130
where would we be
500 years from now?

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.670
What would that ideal
picture be like?

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.940
And I think it'd be awesome
if Khan Academy still

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.160
exists in 500 years and that
we're still completely free

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.210
and that we have all
the content that anybody

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.170
could want to learn.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.420
SAL: And plug directly into
their brain at that point.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.760
JESSICA: Yes, by at that point,
hopefully it's just plug in,

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.600
and you're done.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.710
But I think that
would be amazing,

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:40.049
if we could leave something
for future generations

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:43.200
to be able to use and
have a resource, that,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.600
at this point in time, seemed
unthinkable that it would be

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.195
free and that anybody can access
that quality of education.

00:08:51.195 --> 00:08:54.690
SAL: You're inspiring
me, Jessica.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.910
JESSICA: The feeling
is mutual, Sal.
