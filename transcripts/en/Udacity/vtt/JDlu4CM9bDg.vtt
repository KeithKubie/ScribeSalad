Algebra is a language. It's the language of problem solvers. Have you ever

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:07.831
wondered how many songs could fit onto a flash drive? How much did the world's

00:00:07.843 --> 00:00:11.896
largest cup of coffee cost? Or how to design your own crop circles. We'll teach

00:00:11.908 --> 00:00:15.942
you the tools needed to model problems, analyze patterns, and visualize these

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:21.515
types of questions using algebra. While you may not use these tools everyday,

00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:25.710
algebra will allow you to frame and solve problems, make informed decisions, and

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:30.180
describe the world around you. This class may lead you to more advanced courses

00:00:30.192 --> 00:00:33.875
in mathematics or, at the very least, give you a new way of looking at the

00:00:33.887 --> 00:00:37.935
world, and prepare you for the workplace. See you in class.
