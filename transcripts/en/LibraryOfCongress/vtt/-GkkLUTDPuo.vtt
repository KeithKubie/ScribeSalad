00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.510
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentleman acting
Librarian of Congress David Mao.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.630
[ Applause ]

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.220
&gt;&gt; Mr. Blair, members of Congress,
distinguished guests good evening.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.520
We are deeply honored to
welcome to the Library

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.100 position:56%
of Congress tonight the right
Honorable Tony Blair, Prime Minister

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.260
of the United Kingdom
and Great Britain

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.790
and Northern Ireland
from 1997 to 2007.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.400
We are right now in the great Hall
of the Thomas Jefferson building,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.770
the historic Thomas Jefferson
building of the Library of Congress

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.890
and as you can see we
are surrounded by artwork

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.960
that symbolizes the progress of
civilization and the traditions

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.480 position:56%
of knowledge and learning so I think
it's a very, very fitting venue

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.690
for us tonight to have the
seventh Kissinger lecture.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.540
Mr. Blair will be speaking
in conversation

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.910
with Ambassador Martin Indyk.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.990
The Kissinger lecture was
established during the library's

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.270
bicentennial year in
2000 and the purpose was

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.910
to foster nonpartisan
foreign policy discussion

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.180
in this our nation's capital.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.350
The lecture has been
delivered by former president

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.070
of Mexico Felipe Calderon,
former president

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.090
of Brazil Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, former president

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.860
of the French Republic [inaudible],

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.720
as well as the former United States
secretaries of State James Baker,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.710
George Schultz and
Mr. Kissinger himself.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.060
Tonight's speaker, Mr.
Tony Blair, is a statesman

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.950
with deep democratic values

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.900
and a positive vision
for the world's future.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.350
He's built bridges among cultures
and people around the world

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.500
and during his tenure
expanded access to education

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.090
and health care throughout
his country.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.380
Mr. Blair we admire you
very much for your courage

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.350
in championing security,
democracy and the rule of law.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.700
Your leadership developed
unprecedented levels of cooperation

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.680
between your country and ours
and although you are retired

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.750
from public office you
continue to commit yourself

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.730
to building a better world
for future generations to work

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.480
with numerous foundations and
leadership councils so ladies

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.830
and gentlemen please join me

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.510
in welcoming a great
statesman, Mr. Tony Blair.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:47.840
[ Applause ]

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.250
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much indeed
David and ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.370
It's a great honor to be giving
the Kissinger lecture this evening

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.210
in this wonderful [inaudible]
building.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.700
Henry Kissinger was always a great
foreign-policy role model of mine

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.590
and he is now actually
a role model of mine

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.670
for the aging process [laughter].

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.990
I always say to him if I manage to
get to his age I'll have done well

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.560
but if I get to his age with
even a quarter of his intellect

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.020
and brilliance I will
be truly blessed.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:37.400
I once actually asked Henry what's
it like being Henry Kissinger?

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.010
And he said to me well you know
he said a few months back I was

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.000
at a party and a woman came
up to me and she said -

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.880
Dr. Henry Kissinger, people will
tell me you are so fascinating,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.770
so fascinate me [laughter].

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.600
He said that's what
it's like [laughter].

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.320 position:56%
I said it could be worse [laughter].

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:10.410
So tonight I'm going to
give a 20-minute lecture.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.480
The subject is around Islamic
extremism which is certainly for us

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:24.420
in Europe today the topic of
the day and then I'm going to be

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.050
in conversation with Martin Indyk
who I'm delighted has kindly agreed

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.220
to do the interview and
question/answer session

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.360
of this talk this evening, and
because obviously the time for me

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.200 position:56%
to speak is limited I'm actually
publishing tomorrow morning a longer

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.030
essay, an 8000 word essay on this
topic and what I think we should do

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.700
about it so tonight of necessity
what you will get is the outline

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.800
and the general points but if you
want greater detail you will see

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.840
this set out in the essay tomorrow.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.080
To defeat Islamic extremism we need
a strategy that is comprehensive.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.210
Defeating Daesh or ISIS is
only a necessary beginning

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.930
and force alone will not prevail.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.700
The challenge goes far wider
and deeper than the atrocities

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.210
of the jihadist fanatics.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.550
The Islamist ideology has
also to be confronted.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.060
Today it can be in alliance with
the modernizing and sensible voices

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.500
within Islam determined to take the
name and reputation of the faith

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.030
of Islam back from extremists,
but a continued failure

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.050
to recognize the scale
of the challenge

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.840
and to construct the means
necessary to meet it will result

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.970
in terrorist attacks
potentially worse than those

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.400
in Paris producing a backlash
which then stigmatizes the majority

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.860
of decent law-abiding Muslims and
puts the very alliance that is

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:14.190 position:56%
so necessary at risk creating a
further cycle of chaos and violence.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.040
9/11 came out of the
Al Qaeda training camps

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.690
of Afghanistan permitted to
grow there by the Taliban

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.480
but today Daesh controls
an area of land in Syria

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.250 position:56%
and Iraq roughly the size of the UK.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.480
It has a significant
presence in Libya around Sert.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.570
It is a foothold in the Sinai
and in several other areas.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.510
It has the allegiance of Boko
Haram in Nigeria as well as groups

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.500
in other parts of sub-Saharan
Africa, but you can add

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.580
to Daesh [inaudible] and half
a dozen other such groups

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.620
and they are all active, trained,

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.370
battle hardened reasonably
well armed and funded

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.480
and in many cases they are
on the doorstep of Europe.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.690
It is true that our security
services are vastly more equipped

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.620
and experienced in dealing
with the threat than in 2001

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.900
but this is also true of the enemy.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.920
They now know that a
handful of gunmen prepared

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:26.930
to kill totally innocent and random
people can traumatize a nation.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.330 position:56%
Does anyone doubt that if they could
kill thousands not hundreds they

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:37.870
would or that they would use any
means available to them to do it.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.630
The impact of terrorism
is never simply

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.850 position:56%
about the tragedy of the lives lost.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.720
It is the sense of
instability, insecurity

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.200
and fear that comes in its wake.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.520
It can paralyze the country and
in the case of nations like ours

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.820
with our proud and noble
traditions of tolerance

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:04.860
and liberty it makes those very
strengths seem like weaknesses

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.840
in the face of an onslaught that
cares nothing for our values

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.640
and hates our way of life.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.190
Europe is facing this
dilemma in a very direct way.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:22.660
It is with courage and compassion
bringing large numbers of refugees

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.860
from the carnage of Syria and the
wider Middle East into Europe.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:33.990
Greece alone has around 700,000
refugees awaiting clearance.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:40.630
The other week the Prime Minister
told me it had 15,000 people enter

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.660
Greece in the space of 12 hours.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:48.680
We need to prepare host
communities and incoming refugees

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.650
for what will be an
extraordinary undertaking.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:56.790
Of course it would be
inhumane to refuse entry

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.800 position:56%
but I'm not sure we fully comprehend
the size of this challenge.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:07.830
So what are the pillars of
such a comprehensive strategy?

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:13.060
First the immediate task is
of course to defeat Daesh.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.950
Paris has galvanized
opinion but we need

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:22.430
to understand the full nature
of what has to be done.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.450
They have to be eliminated on the
ground not just in Syria and Iraq

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:32.890 position:56%
but in Libya too and the other
countries in which they are present.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:37.280
Together with our allies we have
to do what it takes to defeat them

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.950
and defeat them completely.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.850
This will require a
combination of military,

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.440
diplomatic and political measures.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:50.380
Now this does not always have to
center on our boots on the ground.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.660
Our forces can play a
supporting role to others

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:59.800
but destroying the so-called
caliphate is an essential part

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.460
of destroying the concept of
it as a unifying structure

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:09.350
for extremist groups which underpin
so much of the jihadist propaganda.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:16.760
It is also essential to securing a
just outcome in Syria which in turn

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.690
of course is the only
solution to the refugee crisis.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:28.360
To begin with many in the West
thought Syria was a nightmare

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.210
but not our nightmare.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:36.550
Now we know we're in
it like it or not.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.720
We must show sufficient commitment
to Syria to give us the leverage

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.580 position:56%
to be able to negotiate a settlement
which will allow the country

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.470
over time to progress
with full respect

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:53.880
from minorities but without Assad.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.910
Second then in the
medium term we have

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:03.140
to construct the force capability
internationally through a coalition

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.590
of nations willing to commit their
armed forces which would allow us

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:12.180
to fight the jihadist extremists
effectively wherever they try

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.890
to gain a foothold.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:22.120
They must know that they are
never safe to plan or to expand.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.240
And further and longer
term and most important,

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.380
the subject of my talk
tonight, we must realize

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:37.760
that the problem is not only the
violence of groups like Daesh

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.850
but the ideology of
extremism behind them.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.170
It is correct that the number

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:53.100
of jihadist fanatics is relatively
small but the numbers who buy

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.460
into significant parts of
their underlying worldview are

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.040
unfortunately much larger.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:05.020
Islam is practiced and understood
by the large majority of believers

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.170
as a peaceful and honorable faith.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:13.910 position:56%
It has contributed greatly to human
existence and progress but there has

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:18.100
to be an end to the denial about
the nature of the problem we face.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.910
Of course a large majority

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.950
of Muslims completely
reject Daesh-like jihadism

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.170
and the terrorism that
comes with it,

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:34.220
however in many Muslim countries
large numbers also believe

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:40.350
that the CIA or Jews
were behind 9/11.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.350
Clerics who proclaimed
the nonbelievers

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.510
and [inaudible] must be
killed or who call for jihad

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:52.340
against Jews have twitter
followings running into millions.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.910
Those who believe in concepts like
the caliphate and the apocalypse

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:04.100
so much of the Daesh propaganda
stretched deep into parts

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:11.120
of Muslim societies and the belief
in innate hostility between Islam

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.900
and the West is unfortunately
not the preserve of a few.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:22.730
More than that every day millions
of young people are taught a view

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.250
of the world in religion
completely incompatible

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.590
with peaceful coexistence.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:33.870
As with for example some of
the Madrassas in Pakistan

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:38.810
or the Almijiri schools in
northern Nigeria, indoctrination

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:44.430
of children is happening
on a daily basis.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:48.870
Even in countries like my own a
recent documentary in the UK showed

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.760
that there are community
centers, mosques,

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.430
seemingly innocuous
charity organizations,

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:59.000
that are effective
fronts for this ideology.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.090
My foundation Center on Religion

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:06.070
and Geopolitics tracks
this extremism day by day.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:10.210
You can see the results
on our website.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.870
It's fascinating but alarming.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:20.330
So this ideology has
deep roots and we have

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:26.920
to reach right the
way down to uproot it.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.840 position:56%
We need for example in a similar way
to the campaign on the environment

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.150
to agree what I've called an
international global commitment

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:41.260
on education where it is part of
each nation's global responsibility

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:47.000
to promote culture and religious
tolerance and to eradicate culture

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.610
and religious prejudice within
their education systems,

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:52.910
formal or informal.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:59.540
Again it is not acceptable
for governments

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:05.810
to support extremist groups whether
violent or not and where hostility

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:10.720
and hatred towards others is being
promulgated whether in mosques

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:18.750
or community centers it has
to be exposed to and stopped.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:24.940
Fourth, on the positive side we
have actively to support those

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.790
who are confronting the religious
doctrines of the extremists.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:34.100
There are in fact now many brave
and serious theologians like those

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.090
from the Al Azhar Mosque
in Cairo, renowned clerics

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:42.550 position:56%
like Shaikh Abdallah Bin Bayyah, who
are showing how the true teaching

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:46.870 position:56%
of Islam leads to peace and
reconciliation with the modern world

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.110
but they need the weight

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.360
of a concerted international
effort behind them.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:56.800
We have to organize the use of the
internet to disseminate messages

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:04.450
of peaceful coexistence and hope
but we have to do it at scale

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.780 position:56%
and we have to build the alliance
between Judeo-Christian civilization

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.830
and those within Islam who
are prepared to lead the fight

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.770
against the [inaudible] of their
faith and the extremism that goes

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:20.780 position:56%
with it but again we have to do this
with urgency and heft and we have

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.090
to organize ourselves
to do it effectively.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:33.480
Fifth, we sometimes look at the
Middle East and we see such a mess

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.450
that we prefer to stay out.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:42.370 position:56%
The attacks in Paris as if we needed
further reminding shows the futility

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.210
of that.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:50.610
The Middle East's harsh and
tumultuous transition is our affair

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.190
because it is near to
us certainly in Europe,

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:58.150
because it is where the
heart of Islam beats,

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:03.860
because we have our own
large Muslim populations,

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.200
because we have allies not only
Israel but Arab nations too

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:12.170
who expect and deserve our support
and whose support in turn we need

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:16.810
to succeed and because
if we don't act then

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.000
into the vacuum will step
those whose interests

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.740
and values may be opposed
to our own.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:29.430
In my view it is better to see
the Middle East and indeed Islam

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:32.870
as in a long process of
transition, the Middle East

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:38.600
to achieve rule-based economies
and religiously tolerant societies

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.300
and Islam to recover its
rightful place as a faith

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.410
of progress and humanity.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:53.190
Looked at in this way the Middle
East is not an impenetrable mess

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:58.470
to stay clear of but a
life-and-death struggle

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.960
in which our own interests
are intimately engaged

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:06.380
so across the region we
should be supporting those

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.400
who are fighting back
against the extremism.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:14.640
In each case we should be promoting
those who will work for a modern

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:21.070
and open-minded future for
the Middle East and for Islam.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:27.080
For the Gulf states Egypt and
Jordan these are our allies

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.410
and where our allies have
their own challenges of change

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:34.280
and modernization to go through
we should be helping them actively

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:40.520
to evolve in order to avoid the
destabilization of revolution

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.660
and whether our groups or nations
who are trying to impose or export

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.490
and ideology of extremism as
with Sunni extremist groups

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.130
of various varieties
or Shia as with Iran

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:58.710
and Hezbollah we should be
again actively constraining

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:04.200
and opposing their influence
and we should not lose sight

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.470 position:56%
of the continuing crucial importance

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:13.630 position:56%
of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict important in its own right,

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:18.340
important for what a resolution
of it means for the principle

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:25.330
of peaceful existence and important
also because it stands in the way

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.500
of the obvious convergence
of interest

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.870 position:56%
between Israel and the Arab nations.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:37.830 position:56%
In short we should learn the lessons
of the whole period from 9/11

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:44.640
to today and try to forge a
new synthesis of foreign-policy

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.880
which recognizes the need for
an active policy of engagement

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:56.400
but in a way sophisticated by our
experience not incapacitated by it.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:06.650
For Europe there is a huge
calculation to be made.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:10.420 position:56%
This security threat is at our door.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.700
It is actually within our home.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.720
We have a paramount
interest in defeating it

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.600
which is why last night's
vote in the British House

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.510
of Commons was so important.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:28.150
Europe has to create within its
nation states the armed force

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:35.370
capability to allow us not just to
play our part but where necessary

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:40.100
to lead and we have to educate our
own citizens and those now coming

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:45.210
into our countries on what our
values and our way of life mean,

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:54.550
why they matter to us and why
we will defend them to the last.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:56.800
So we need that comprehensive
strategy

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.190
with all these different
elements brought together.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:07.560
Elements that aren't just about
military power but are also going

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.850
to the roots of the
extremist ideology

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.630
that gives rise to the violence.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:20.420
But let me end on a
note of optimism.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.580
This is a battle we will win.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.530
There is no doubt in
my mind of that.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:29.390
From one corner of the world to
another the overwhelming majority

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:34.520
of people whatever their faith
want to live in harmony and peace.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:41.730
The Islamists fanatics will never
kill the spirit of civilization.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:48.720
They will be defeated and we
will endure of that I'm sure.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.450
But to defeat this
fanaticism and the ideology

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:56.620
that accompanies it
would require leadership,

00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:02.820
vision and a determination that
only full measures will do.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.620
Thank you.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:22.190
[ Applause ]

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.540
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much
Tony, that was,

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.640
how shall I say it,
fascinating [laughter].

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:36.050
&gt;&gt; Well I'm glad I fascinated you.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:44.590
&gt;&gt; Fascinating because as coherent
and compelling the strategy

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.680
that you presented is there's a gap

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.600
between the very [inaudible]
argument that you make

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:58.690
about what needs to be done and
the will in the United States

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:03.530
and the capacity in
Europe to actually do it.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:08.100
So how do you actually
bridge that gap

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:12.100
if you agree that that gap exists?

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:17.260
&gt;&gt; I mean I think it is the same
challenge here in my country

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.800
or in Europe and the
first thing you've got

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.630
to ask yourself is how
serious is this problem

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:30.470
and are we exaggerating it, are we
making it more than it really is?

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.370
And that then, the onset

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:39.520
of that then obviously implies the
measures you have to take, mind you

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:45.360
and I spent a large time in office
dealing with this issue post 9/11.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.680
I've spent the largest
part of my life

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.910
since leaving office
looking at it, studying it.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.240
I think this is a big problem.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.000
I think it's fundamental and
it threatens our security

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.250
in a profound way so if you
think that then you have

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:04.930
to do what is necessary and
I think if we get our heads

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.600
into a slightly different
place and look at this

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:12.480
as a long-term generational
struggle, I mean similar

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.990
to the struggle we faced against
revolutionary communism if you want

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:19.820
to put it like this, there will
be many different phases of it,

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:24.480
you will have to attack the
problem in many different ways

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.040
but in the end if you believe
it is really life-threatening

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.000
for your country and for its
stability you have to be prepared

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.880
to do what it takes and
I think it's that bridge

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.510
that people find difficult for
reasons I completely understand.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:45.710 position:56%
In the aftermath of 9/11 people felt
this is the issue we have to tackle

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:52.820
but then in the distance with time
people realize it's very tough

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.010 position:56%
and I know this having gone
through Afghanistan and Iraq to deal

00:24:56.010 --> 00:25:02.630
with the problem, but I think if we
look from 9/11 to the present day

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.090
when we've tried intervening it's
been difficult, when we stayed

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.390
out it's been difficult,

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.690
when we partially intervene
it's been difficult.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:12.170
Now there are two alternative
conclusions from that.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:16.020
One is that we're just
not very good at our jobs

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:19.920
and the other is it's tough and
it's going to take a long time

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.250
but I think the people in Europe

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.950
after Paris I think
the mood has changed.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.160
&gt;&gt; One part of this
gap that I'm pointing

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.470
to here is a definitional one.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:37.190
You define the problem
as Islamist extremism.

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:43.520
In Washington it's
called violent extremism

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:49.960
and there's an unwillingness
to label it in the way

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:55.000
that you have essentially
because of the belief

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:03.830 position:56%
that this will make it harder to get
the Muslim world behind the effort

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:06.820
to deal with the extremists.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.470
How do you answer that?

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:14.520
&gt;&gt; I completely understand that
and indeed I went through a period

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:23.970
when this was all first happening
when I tended to that view

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:31.340
and obviously building an alliance
with people within Islam is central

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:36.880
to defeating this challenge
for sure, but one of the things

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:42.200
that I discovered in
politics is if you go too far

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.720
from what a nonpolitical person

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.970
of reasonable intelligence
would think is fair

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:55.030
and clear then you don't end up
dealing with the problems you face

00:26:55.030 --> 00:27:05.430
so I don't think that it disables
us in achieving the alliance

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:12.250 position:56%
within Islam to call it Islamist
extremism because that is what it is

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:18.530
and you can't divorce, I mean do
they represent the proper faith

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:19.840
of Islam?

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:27.010
No. But are they doing what they
are doing by reference to religion?

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.310
Well they are.

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:33.520
I remember when I was
dealing with the peace process

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.270
in Northern Ireland and having
a conversation with people

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:41.730
where they said to me in all
this business between Protestants

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.200
and the Catholics there's nothing
really to do with religion.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:48.350
And I said well that's
a pity because they seem

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.980
to think it is [laughter].

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:55.870
So I get this completely and I also
understand why it's important you

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:59.490 position:56%
don't also stigmatize people's views

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.580
because not all Islamists
are violent

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:08.070
but here's what I've come
to think studying this.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:12.660
When Boko Haram kidnapped
girls and treat them

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:18.020
as in effect sexual slaves
I think that is connected

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:26.410
to a much broader feeling within
for example the Muslim brotherhood

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:31.120
which sees women as
second-class citizens.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.600
So I think if you have an ideology

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.970
that says the West is
fundamentally opposed to Islam

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:41.980
and its values are a threat
to us and our belief system,

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:46.850
if that's what you believe in large
number you will get a small number

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.520
of people who say well if we
are humiliated by the West

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.700
in this way we should fight back.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:56.940
So my point is until you destroy
the narrative that underpins this,

00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:02.050
okay we could defeat ISIS
but we'll have someone else.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:06.360
&gt;&gt; So that goes to one
part of your strategy

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:11.120
which is the ideological
battle and you laid

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.920
out a few points, elements of this.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:20.530
I know in your article you go
into greater detail but part

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:26.450
of it requires mobilizing
Muslim preachers

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:29.870
against the Muslim preachers
that are preaching extremism

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:35.530 position:56%
and you cited the head of the Al
Azhar Mosque in Egypt as one example

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:40.970
of that but I think
we have the impression

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:45.390
that those voices are
pretty thin and small

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:49.160
and there is an apparent -,

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:55.290
it appears that there is an
unwillingness amongst Muslim

00:29:55.290 --> 00:30:02.320
religious leaders to actually
speak out clearly and continuously

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:11.040
against the kind of extremism that
you speak of so is it realistic

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:17.380
to expect them to mobilize
and how are we going to do it

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.290
because it doesn't seem
very successful so far.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.590
&gt;&gt; It's changing.

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:24.760
And remember in all of these
countries they've now got a

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.060
problem themselves.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:33.530
I mean the big difference and
possibly opportunity for us

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:38.500 position:56%
in this situation is that in each of
the countries, and the countries you

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.110
and I know are well
out in the Middle East,

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.180
they've all got their own
internal problems today.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.480
This is their problem.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:52.450
And I think for a long period of
time political leadership certainly

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.300
in the Middle East but
also elsewhere was content

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:58.530 position:56%
to channel some of the political
energy for change often to this kind

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:02.700
of Islamist ideology, but now
it's a big problem for them

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:06.710
and you see I think one
of the first ways you deal

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:13.560
with a problem is get it out on the
table, just make clear what it is

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:19.860 position:56%
that you're dealing with, so I would
say I can see a lot of evidence,

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.160
I would say quite a
lot of evidence now,

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.720
that people are getting prepared
to mobilize and they are prepared

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:34.330 position:56%
to fight back and in the end you saw
maybe the leading [inaudible] Muslim

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:38.970
organization the other day which is
got 50 million members issued what

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:44.930
was not just a call to reject
violence and jihadism and extremism

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.910
but was a theological justification

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.450
of why modernizing
Islam was sensible.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:52.880
So this is important.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.450
I feel this is -- , you see one of
the things that I think we've got

00:31:56.450 --> 00:32:01.510
to do in the West as we've got
to organize with our allies.

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:04.490
When you take the amount of stuff
that's out there on the Internet

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:07.770
from the jihadists, okay we can go
and pressure the internet companies

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:10.420
to take it down and so
on, but we're fighting

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.290
against the tide the
whole time but we need

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:16.470
to be mobilizing those people who
are going to put different images

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:22.810
and metaphors and analogies out
there and there are such people

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:26.210
so I'm not pessimistic about it,

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:30.090
I just think if we think
this threat is as serious

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:33.840
as I think it is then we
need to get a different level

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.360
of organization commitment.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.860
&gt;&gt; Let's talk about ISIS.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:45.600
Part of your strategy is to destroy
ISIS, not to defeat and degrade

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.830
but to actually destroy it,
but I sense that you kind

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:53.300
of pulled your punch there by
saying well it shouldn't be boots

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.010
on the ground or we should
play a supportive role.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:58.880
Don't we really need boots
on the ground to do the job

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.000 position:56%
that you think is so important here?

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.320
&gt;&gt; You're going to have to have
full [inaudible] on the ground.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.930
I mean I personally think -- , I
know we already are by the way,

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:12.360
we are moving from a position
where we're merely supporting

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:16.170
to actually doing more
active engagement.

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:18.680
I think -- , let me put it in --

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.830
, and I'm choosing my
words very carefully

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:26.240 position:56%
because we've just got authority in
the U.K. yesterday to do airstrikes.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:32.620
There's not an appetite I would
say in the U.K. or probably here

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:37.630
for force capability on the
ground but we need to consider --

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:39.440
, if it is important
to destroy them we need

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.790
to decide what it takes to do that.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:46.060
Now there are people by the way,
again allies that we can work with,

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:49.520
but they're going to need a
lot of support and help from us

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:55.180
and there is no way with
this so-called caliphate

00:33:55.180 --> 00:34:01.650
that you can think of it as
being constrained in some way.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:07.990
I mean the training
camps of Al Qaeda

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:12.080
in Afghanistan before 9/11 were
on a much more restricted basis

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.760
than these are now and so
I mean again it depends

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.760
on how serious you think the threat
is but I don't think you can allow

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:22.870
that large part of territory
to be used as a training camp

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:25.280
for terrorism and we've
got, you know obviously

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.100
from Europe we've got thousands
of our own people going there

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.980
and they come back and
they're our citizens

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.870
and I think also destroying
the concept of the caliphate

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:39.990
as represented by ISIS is
also very important, so -

00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:46.740
&gt;&gt; There's one country in
the region, a NATO ally right

00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:50.330
on the border of Syria, that
probably is the only country

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:55.490
with an army capable of
providing the troops on the ground

00:34:55.490 --> 00:35:00.340
that could do the job with
our support and that's Turkey,

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:08.980 position:56%
but Turkey seems to prefer to fight
the Kurds than they do to fight ISIS

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:12.780
so are they critical
to this strategy

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:16.310
and if they are how do
you get them to step up?

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:19.640
&gt;&gt; They are critical to
it and I actually sat

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:23.800
with President [inaudible] a
couple of weeks ago in [inaudible].

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:28.870
I mean I think they have
their own real concerns

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:34.540
around the Kurdish issue which are
understandable whatever view you

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:41.280
take of the future but they also do
understand now they've got a major

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.210 position:56%
problem with Isis and as [inaudible]
explain to me they have two

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:51.040
and a half million refugees
themselves and so if they don't --

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.700
, you know one of the complexities
of these situations is people deal

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:58.010
with multiple problems at the same
time but I think it is possible

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:00.660
and I know the U.S. government at
the moment is working very hard

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.150
to do this, it is possible to
get the right type of alliance

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.430
with Turkey that will
help us in this

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:13.660
and I think there is a case
again for a safe haven or enclave

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:18.700
from which the opposition can
be secure and which can help

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.630
with the refugee problem
and that's important

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.950
because we need the leverage
of the negotiating table

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:29.690
for the eventual solution in
Syria and that will be the --

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:35.400 position:56%
, I mean the Vienna process is going
to be incredibly difficult to do

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:39.230
but there will be no acceptable
outcome that leaves Assad there

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.550
for anything other than
a transitional period

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:44.170
and the Turks understand that.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:48.810
As you know [inaudible] and
Assad were once very close.

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:53.460
Now there's obviously a complete
breach so we will need Turkey.

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.390
&gt;&gt; You'll need them to
protect the safe haven too.

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:58.910
You're going to have troops
for that purpose as well.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:03.780
&gt;&gt; We will need that to happen but
you see here's the thing with Syria

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.980
that we've watched
over these last years.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:13.810
As we thought it would
resolve itself and it hasn't

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:18.390
and now you've got a situation
particularly with Russia coming in

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:22.130 position:56%
and obviously Iran, Hezbollah on the
ground is what made the difference

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:24.370
and propped up Assad
and then when it looked

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:30.320
as if he was crumbling again
than the Russians have come

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.840 position:56%
in to support him but you think of
the refugee crisis we've got arising

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.740
out of it and the numbers of people
that have died, the disintegration

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:42.060
of the country and at each stage
we have thought there's a way

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.860
that we could just stay out
of it but certainly in Europe

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:46.570
and maybe this looks different here

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:50.230
but in Europe today we
are facing a situation

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.610
where Germany may be taking
what a million or more refugees.

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:57.830
As I say you talk to
the Greek Prime Minister

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:02.250
and he's got 700,000 people
waiting for clearance.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:08.910
How are we going to be able
to do that effectively and so

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:11.000
of course it would be inhumane

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.910 position:56%
to refuse people sanctuary who've
suffered so much but I think this --

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:19.570
, I don't think we've even
begun to understand the nature

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:22.130
of the challenge this is
going to pose for us in Europe

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:27.080
so my view is however difficult
it is the alternative is worse

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.320
and I think one of the problems
you get to in situations

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.750
like this is you come to a
moment whether as a choice

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:40.730
but on either side it's ugly.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:42.440
So this is where I think we are.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.830
&gt;&gt; So let's focus on
Europe for a moment.

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:50.930
There's this huge challenge
from the refugees

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:55.430
and that refugee flow could
increase quite dramatically.

00:38:55.430 --> 00:39:04.190
That comes on top of the whole
problem of economic stagnation,

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:10.120 position:56%
the challenge to the euro, the
issue of [inaudible] and the Greeks,

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.400
now we've got the potential
for a British exit.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:20.870 position:56%
So if you put that all together it
looks from an American point of view

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:27.310
like Europe, the European
experiment is in trouble.

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:32.910
How deep is that trouble?

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:41.400
&gt;&gt; Personally I think the
basic rationale for Europe is

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:47.220
as strong today as it's ever been
in a world where China will be

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.610
as powerful, more powerful
than it is today,

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:52.430
India with over a billion people,

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:56.150
a country like Indonesia population
three times that of Germany.

00:39:56.150 --> 00:40:00.260
You know for European
nations to keep influence

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:03.870 position:56%
in the world they need to come
together so the rationale for Europe

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:08.170 position:56%
after the second World War was peace
and today it's power and I think

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:11.480
that basic rationale is still
there and it holds good.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:14.820
Europe's got two problems though.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:22.440
The first is that the single
currency was a policy motivated

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.590
by politics but expressed
in economics

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:29.970
and it's caused huge difficulty
for the members of the euro zone

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:33.210
and stagnation of the
European economy.

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:37.200
Secondly, Europe is
close to the epicenter

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:44.060
of all this radical Islamist
mess and we are not --

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.990
, our Armed Forces aren't
really geared up to deal with it

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:49.130
so I think this is a
big challenge for Europe

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:51.900
and it can go one of two ways.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.910
You will either get what I
would call a muscular center,

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:58.520
ground that seizes the initiative,

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.310
in economic terms realizes you've
got to stimulate the economy

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:05.580
and do structural reform, in other
words not choose between austerity

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:11.300
and reform but combine a
stimulus of the economy and growth

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:15.940
with the structural form Europe
needs and gives itself up,

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.790
in a way I have to say that I think
President Hollande is doing quite

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:25.730 position:56%
effectively for France, gears itself
up to take this threat seriously

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:27.230
but if they don't do that,

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:32.020 position:56%
if that center does not exert itself
I think there is a real danger

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:38.590 position:56%
in Europe of a resurgent nationalism
that could be very dangerous

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:40.200
for the European experiment.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:44.310
&gt;&gt; Are you worried
about British vote?

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:48.230
&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm worried because
there is a vote [laughing]

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:52.400
and I think Britain
will vote to stay in

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.480
but people sometimes ask me here
is it possible that Britain votes

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.740
to leave which I'll say
well it's certainly possible

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:03.030
because there's a referendum
and the opinion polls

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:06.450
at the moment are pretty
50-50 and the other thing

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:09.110
if this refugee crisis
is not handled

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:12.280
in the right way then I think
you could have a situation

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:17.050
in which anti-European
feeling in the U.K. is stronger

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:19.300
so in my view it's not
sensible in the end.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:23.240
I think the interests of Britain
are hugely in favor of staying

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.040
and I think that's David
Cameron's instinct as well

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:31.250
but it's definitely a risk.

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.750
&gt;&gt; We're going to go to audience
questions in a moment but I have

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:38.310
to ask you my last question
which is about the issue that you

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:43.940 position:56%
and I worked on so hard for so
long, the Israeli-Palestinian issue.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.850
You were of course
the quartet envoy,

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:50.330
I was for a while there
the U.S. envoy.

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:55.980
The situation has gone
from bad to worse to worse.

00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.470
We now have a low level
[inaudible] of the knives,

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:06.880
a right-winged government in Israel
that is moving if anything further

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:12.830
to the right and further away
from the two state solution

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:14.330
that we were trying to promote.

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:17.200
What do you think needs
to be done there?

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.220
What do you think can
be done there now?

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.250
&gt;&gt; Well you've got a
lighter scent of this than me

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:25.910
because you were [laughter]
in a shorter period of time

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:30.910 position:56%
and by the way I hope you
understand that the work you did was

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:36.200
of fundamental importance and will
stand the test of time in the end.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.360
Whatever solution they come back to
will be very much based on the work

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:45.480
that you and John Kerry did in my
view because ultimately my view

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.800
of this matter is ultimately

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.100
if the issue were a simple
negotiation it would be tough

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.480
but doable.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.050
The idea you can't find an
answer to the border question

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:57.350
or security, of course you can.

00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:58.650
If you want to find an answer

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:00.260
to these problems you can
find an answer to them.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.370
Even Jerusalem by the
way I think you can.

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:08.180
So the problem is the context
in which this is happening

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.520
and my view it is very
simply because otherwise you

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.300
and I both could talk for
several days on this topic.

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:20.520
My view very simply is that the key

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:24.250
to reviving the peace
process lies in the region.

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:27.460
I don't think Palestinian politics
is strong enough at the moment

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.830
to carry the process and I don't
think Israeli politics is strong

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:34.770
enough to carry the process but
I think both could be helped

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:39.860
with guidance from
America obviously.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:44.550
The Arab nations decided that
this was a priority for them

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:50.230 position:56%
to help revive the peace process
and assist in resolving these issues

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:53.310 position:56%
and I do think you need the economic
security and the political all

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:56.880
to go together but
then you know that.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.490
&gt;&gt; But I mean we've
come full circle.

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:03.300
It all comes down -- , what you're
saying is it all comes down,

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.600
all of these problems come

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:09.580
down to the Sunni Arab
states and their leaders.

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:12.910
&gt;&gt; Well it comes down to a basic
issue of cultural acceptance.

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.970
I mean I really do believe that.

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:23.810 position:56%
What globalization does is it throws
the world closer together and what

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:26.180
that means is if you have a
closed-minded attitude towards the

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:30.750
world in that process of
integration you're seeing a threat

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:36.620 position:56%
and you're fighting against that and
you think that this moving together

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:40.440
of the world is somehow threatening
your belief system or your way

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:44.230
of life or your community
and the alternative view is

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:47.140
to say look this is
a great opportunity

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:49.280
but the reason quite apart

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.630
from everything else why I think
the Israeli-Palestinian issue is

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:55.260
important is what a symbol of
peaceful coexistence it would be

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.950
if you could solve
it but it requires --

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:03.770
, there's a deep cultural division
that needs to be overcome their

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:08.480
and I do think these things are
all in the end linked together

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:14.260
but the one thing I would say
about the world today arising

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:18.730
out of the conflicts in the
Middle East is that it's in flux

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:22.580
and usually when things are
in flux there's an opportunity

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:27.550
to shape things so this is
why I think we need to be kind

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:32.880
of imaginative and creative enough
to build an alliance with those

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.880
within Islam who share
the understanding

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:39.880
that in the end you've got
to open your mind to others

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.340
and that actually trying to
run countries by reference

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.240
to religion is not
a -- , you can't do

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.380
that in today's multi-faith world.

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.970
You've got to be religiously
tolerant.

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:51.480
If you're not religiously tolerant

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.120
as a society you're
going to go nowhere.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.950
You look at the successful
countries in the world.

00:46:55.950 --> 00:47:00.800
They're all countries that
are open to the world.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.590
Those that shut down in the face
of it they go nowhere so this is

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:08.870
where I think the situation
is and in the Middle East.

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:12.960
You've got this politics that
has been disfigured and deformed

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:16.260
over a long period of time, you've
got these young populations.

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:19.600
I mean a country like
Egypt is 90 million today.

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:24.090
50 years ago, 60 years
ago it was 30 million.

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:27.490
You know the average age
in Gaza was about 19.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:30.800
One quarter of the population
is under the age of five.

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:34.240
You've got these young
populations, this deformed politics

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.700
and then you throw
into this religion

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:40.390
and particularly very dogmatic
view of religion, well -

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.690
&gt;&gt; It's a potent brew.

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:42.990
&gt;&gt; Yes it is.

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:46.340
&gt;&gt; Let's go to some
audience questions.

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:53.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; The first question is can Islamic
extremism be effectively fought

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:57.170
without a commitment to
a new spirit of openness

00:47:57.170 --> 00:48:00.070
and democracy in Arab nations?

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:09.830
&gt;&gt; I think ultimately you
certainly do need that spirit.

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:12.330
You at least need an acceptance

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:17.790
that society should be religiously
tolerant so you can argue

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:22.810
about democracy certainly in
relation to some of the Gulf states

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:30.310
but an open mind certainly there
is no way out of that I don't think

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:34.860 position:56%
and I think this is where we've also
got to recover our own confidence

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.040
and our own belief system.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:41.790 position:56%
I mean I think -- , it's interesting
I was in Congress earlier today

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:46.930
and talking to several members
of Congress and I was interested

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:48.230
in the sense that people --

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:51.160
, I think it's quite important for
America to understand sometimes

00:48:51.160 --> 00:49:00.040 position:56%
that even though people will be very
critical of America underneath all

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:05.230
of that there is also an
admiration and I will say

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:07.770
to people it's a great test of a
country, are people trying to get

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:10.920
into it or out of it [laughing].

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:16.080
I mean basically I think your
problem is immigration as it is

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:22.510 position:56%
in ours so I think -- , I mean maybe
I'm completely wrong about this

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:27.690 position:56%
and far too sort of utopian about
it, but I actually think most people

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:33.890
if they are given the choice would
prefer to be living in a spirit

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:39.530 position:56%
of open-mindedness with other people
and I find even in the most --

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:41.460
, you know the countries, even
in the countries where all

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:45.720
of this Islamic stuff is most
rife I still believe a majority

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:49.350
of people would be
perfectly happy in coexistence

00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:53.240
but this is always the way that
the extremes can create the tension

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.530
through violence that
divides the community

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:58.200
but yes I think a spirit
certainly of the open mind

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.950
and in the end I think of
democracy as necessary.

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:10.420
&gt;&gt; The next question is about
both the United Nations and NATO

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:15.920
and what roles they each
may play in this conflict.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:21.930
&gt;&gt; I don't know, I think it's very
hard for the United Nations to --

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:25.740 position:56%
, one of the things I'm saying today
is we need to get organized and one

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:29.020
of the things I found
when I was Prime Minister

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:32.030
but I think it's even
more true today

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:38.130 position:56%
which is probably why the G20 was
created is that United Nations is --

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:42.190
, it's hard to get it to
focus down and implement

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:48.760
so it's obviously important
as an authoritative body

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:52.000
because it assembles
all the world's nations

00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:00.690
but if you wanted something done
[laughter] you wouldn't necessarily

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:06.210
go there first [laughter] and
that's why I think on this

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:11.660 position:56%
for example you need something that
is somewhat more ad hoc and informal

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.230
and that's why I'm suggesting --

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:17.260
, the UN for example actually does
have a good counter extremism unit

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:23.790
but most countries don't operate
through it and I feel there needs

00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:27.250
to be a lot more organization in
this and then I think when you come

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:31.240
to the armed force capability part
of it you also need to do that

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.110
and NATO alone is not -- ,
that's not what NATO was created

00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:40.480
for so it's difficult and I think
you need again to look at how

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:44.880
for example Europe definitely
needs to up its defense capability.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:50.270
The fact that the U.K. has now
recommitted to minimum 2% of GDP

00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:53.180
on defense is good but other
countries need to commit

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:55.750
but also it's not just the fact
you've got the armed force you've

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:59.490
got to have the combat
capability and what is necessary

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:02.720
to fight this new asymmetric
type of warfare.

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:05.380
I think the Gulf states are already
looking at how they come together

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:08.890
and of course they're fighting
this big battle, the Saudis

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:14.740
and [inaudible] in Yemen and then
we need American leadership always

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:20.480
so I think NATO has a role to
play in that but I'm not sure

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:24.130
that NATO institutionally is
capable of doing it so I feel

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:30.440
that right now given the
urgency of this we need to look

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:34.830
for different ways of assembling
the right coalition of purpose.

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:40.630
&gt;&gt; It struck me though that NATO
could play a role in your strategy

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:45.310
of safe havens and no-fly
zones building on the fact

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:47.380
that Turkey is a NATO country.

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:55.030 position:56%
If you can't get UN Security Council
cover then a NATO cover could

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:58.370
actually be quite useful if
you could persuade Turkey

00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:02.100
to play the role that you
want it to play on the ground.

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:06.530
NATO basically maintaining
the no-fly zone.

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:14.180
The UN side of it relates to a
question I had about the aftermath.

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:18.400
It's a question that President
Obama asks his aides all the time

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:22.380
which is okay let's say we go
in there and defeat them again.

00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:26.360
Who's going to do the
job afterwards?

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:29.680
Who's going to fill that vacuum?

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.600
We saw what happened in Libya.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:37.440
There is a fundamental problem
of collapse of institutions

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:41.750
and how do you rebuild the
institutions and who does that

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:47.870
and couldn't the UN actually
play an important role there?

00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:50.650
&gt;&gt; I mean we went through this
in Afghanistan and Iraq obviously

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:57.900
and then Libya now and one of
the problems is it's not just

00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:01.640
about rebuilding institutions
often it's about creating them

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:06.360
because so-called strong men were
often in charge of weak states

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:16.150 position:56%
because of the way that they were
run and I think change today I think

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:20.060
that would allow us to do this
better is a) we've got experience,

00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:23.050
b) we have allies and
c) we now understand

00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:26.250
that without the security
element being

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:31.150
in the correct place it's
impossible to do anything else.

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:36.220
I mean my instinct about this is
though is that we've got to --

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:39.830
, this is why I say we've got to
look upon this in a different way.

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:43.830
If we are expecting a quick
result and a clean sort

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:48.980
of okay now that's done, I
think we are kidding ourselves

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:53.620
but I think sustained
engagement over a period

00:54:53.620 --> 00:55:00.350 position:56%
of time though difficult is
preferable to a vacuum that is going

00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:05.570
to be filled by either extremists
or other interests and powers

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:09.500
that may have an agenda
completely contrary to our own

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:18.090
and therefore I suppose what I
think ultimately is the difficulty

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:26.910
of doing it is not as great as the
danger of not doing it but I say

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:28.740
to people all the time
this is really difficult.

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:32.250
&gt;&gt; Yes, and Americans listening

00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:38.480
to you I think a lot would say
we did that, we went in there

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:42.020
and we tried to rebuild Iraq and
we tried to rebuild Afghanistan

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:48.800
and we spent a huge amount of
American blood and British blood

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:55.040
and treasure, trillions of
dollars, and it didn't work

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:59.890
so why do you think it
can work this time around?

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:02.410
Just because we know
better how to do it?

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:06.010
&gt;&gt; I think partly but I think
also because you've always got

00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:09.200
to ask the question,
the counterfactual,

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:15.950
so I mean leave aside Iraq
from being more controversial

00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:18.030
in this sentence but if you look

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:23.480
at Afghanistan it would really
be better if we had done nothing

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.420
or if we hadn't tried
to do that building.

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:32.050
You see when we were fighting
the Cold War and if you'd said

00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:36.640
to somebody in the 70s or 80s well
you're spending all this money

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:37.940
fighting the Cold War

00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:44.780
but you would've said well I'm
afraid were going to do it and I --

00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:47.760
, it all depends how you
identify the problem.

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:53.790
If the problem is violent
extremism, a group of fanatics,

00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:56.030
then you're probably right.

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:57.330
&gt;&gt; You try to contain it.

00:56:57.330 --> 00:57:00.080
&gt;&gt; Yes, but if it isn't
and it's broader

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:06.290
than that then I think you do have
to try and defeat it completely

00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:14.240
and so I think so much of
the policy consequence flows

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.620
from that initial analysis.

00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:21.310
I always say to people I've
approach to this with huge humility

00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:29.630
and I think it's a poor [inaudible]
to get into who is responsible

00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:36.680
for this or that or whatever but
I think we've got to try in a way

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:40.670
to say well what really
have we learned from 2001?

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:43.550
Now if we've decided we've
learned is we should stay

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:46.610
out of everything I would
argue that Syria shows you

00:57:46.610 --> 00:57:52.300
that that's not a great strategy
either and maybe what we can do,

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:54.580
and this is what I was
arguing in my remarks,

00:57:54.580 --> 00:58:00.380
is you can actually synthesize
those two periods of policymaking

00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:06.840
and construct a policy of active
engagement with allies that is

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.810
as I said sophisticated by our
experience and not incapacitated

00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:17.260
by it but I can't see myself that
we've got an option in the end

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.860
and by the way we've talked
a lot about the Middle East

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:23.730
but in my view the single
biggest threat sub-Saharan Africa

00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:26.680
in development terms today
could be this extremism.

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:32.800
In countries like Kenya I mean this
is absolutely existential for them.

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:37.170
You have a country like
Somalia or Mali or [inaudible]

00:58:37.170 --> 00:58:42.650
in northern Nigeria, now you
look at how we deal with that

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:46.560
but you've already got now almost
three million people displaced

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:51.460
in northern Nigeria so I think
one of the things I also say

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:55.270
to Europeans is we've got to look
at our own responsibilities here

00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:58.820
because you guys are a long
way away from all this.

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:02.770
Now you're still America so you're
still the big power and we need you

00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:05.780
but you know we in Europe why

00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:09.530
if you've got these Syrian
refugees how could we say no

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:13.540
to the refugees coming
from northern Africa

00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:16.030
or the northern part
of sub-Saharan Africa?

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:17.760
&gt;&gt; Do you have another question?

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.060
&gt;&gt; We have time for two more.

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:22.960
The first is actually a
question about Lebanon,

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:26.000
it's role in the conflict
and the probability

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.670
of violence there reigniting.

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:32.360
&gt;&gt; I think people are right to
be very worried about Lebanon

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:35.770
and it's a tragedy for the
country, it's a great country,

00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:42.110
fantastic people but you know
it's the same issue isn't it?

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:46.190
They are kept in a permanent state
of destabilization by Hezbollah

00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:52.480
and Iran and that's why I
think one of the things we have

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:58.200
to do is we have to be pushing back
against that power very strongly.

00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:03.590
But if Lebanon were completely

01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:05.710
to destabilize it would
have a serious impact

01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:09.130
on the whole region
including obviously on Israel.

01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:13.690
&gt;&gt; You know it's interesting
that this is the first time

01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:15.680
that Iran has entered
into our discussion

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:24.380 position:56%
which would not have been the case I
think before the Iran nuclear deal.

01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:30.700
It's kind of taken the wind out
of their argument in a strange way

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:36.080
but is Iran part of the problem or
part of the solution when it comes

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.380
to the broader Middle East?

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:41.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Well at the moment for the region

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:46.140
as a whole it's a destabilizing
influence.

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:54.870
Now can they be persuaded or
can there be change within Iran

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:57.580
that allows those people who
obviously have a different

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:02.130
and more moderate view,
can we get to a stage

01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:05.460
where that strain of
thinking prevails?

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:06.760
I don't know.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.420
I hope so.

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:17.830 position:56%
But if you look at the activities of
Iran and whether in Lebanon or Syria

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:23.120
or Yemen or the attempts to
destabilize the Gulf states,

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:29.690 position:56%
even attempts to get support within
Hamas, I mean I find it hard to look

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:32.710
at Iran's influence in the
region and see it positively.

01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:36.110
&gt;&gt; Last question.

01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:40.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; The final question is on Northern
Ireland and the peace process

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:43.650
and whether there are parallels
or lessons from your experience

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:50.170
that could be applied
to the Middle East.

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:54.550
&gt;&gt; There are some but
we were very fortunate

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:58.120
in the Northern Ireland
process of having leadership

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:03.030 position:56%
on virtually every side that really
wanted to do things and was prepared

01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:07.290
to be quite brave with
their end support.

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:10.450
David Trimble with [inaudible],
Jerry Adams [inaudible],

01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:13.670
[inaudible] the Irish
prime minister [inaudible].

01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:21.070 position:56%
You know we had a good constellation
of leaders at that time

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.380
but there are certain lessons.

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.670
I mean one is that you have to
get a framework that is fair.

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:29.640
The second is you will spend
long time implementing it.

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:36.020
The third is never to
give up and I still think

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:38.550
in the Middle East peace
process we should never give up.

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:45.460
I fear that personal
consequences of carrying on my head

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:48.170
against that brick wall
but the other great factor

01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:51.050
in Northern Ireland was the
spirit of the Irish obviously

01:02:51.050 --> 01:03:02.440
and I remember what we used
to do in Northern Ireland is

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:09.820
when we hit a logjam in a
negotiation we'd take the Irish

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:13.930
and the different parties all the
way for a sort of weekend kind

01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:16.720
of brainstorm and get
everyone back on track again -

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.020
&gt;&gt; Get everybody drunk [laughter]?

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:23.550
&gt;&gt; Right, I was putting that
more diplomatically [laughter],

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:28.710
but I remember there
was an occasion in 1999

01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:35.820
when my wife was then pregnant
with our child who was born

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:39.540
on Downing Street and
during the course of one

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:43.590
of these weekends away
one of the delegation

01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:45.290
from Northern Ireland came up to me

01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:48.530
and said congratulations Prime
Minister, it's a wonderful thing,

01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:51.080
you know your wife
is expecting a baby

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.280
and he said what do you
think you will call it?

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.190 position:56%
And I said well I don't know I think

01:03:56.190 --> 01:04:00.990
if it's a boy I think I'll
call it after my father, Leo.

01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:04.880
And he said oh that's a lovely
thought, that's a lovely thought.

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:10.310
Anyway, my wife gave birth,
we were away a month later

01:04:10.310 --> 01:04:14.830
and I saw this guy again and
he had a fantastic suntan.

01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:17.940
Now I don't know whether you've
ever been to Northern Ireland

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:21.260
but [laughter], there's many great
things about Northern Ireland

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:23.900
but you're not liable to come
away with a suntan so I said

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:28.360
to him my God you look fantastic,
where did you get that suntan from?

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.410
And he said well actually
you're responsible for.

01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:32.300
I said I'm responsible for it?

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:35.000
He said yes remember that
conversation I had when I asked

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.950
about your wife being
pregnant and I asked

01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:38.780 position:56%
about what you might call the child?

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:40.080
And I said yes.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.730
He said well the next day I
went down to the bookmakers

01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:44.530
and put 1000 pounds on
the name of the child -

01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:52.050
[ Laughter ]

01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:55.980
So that was another major reason
why it succeeded [laughter].

01:04:57.830 --> 01:05:01.830
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen I think we
should thank Tony Blair very much

01:05:01.830 --> 01:05:03.300
for a fascinating conversation.

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.460
[ Applause ]

01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:06.760
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.000
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
