00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.650
SPEAKER: We are pleased to
announce the 1.0 release

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.430
of the play billing library.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.784
This library includes
convenience classes, as well as

00:00:06.784 --> 00:00:08.200
a wrapper for the
billing service,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.741
allowing you to
focus on implementing

00:00:09.741 --> 00:00:12.010
your app's specific logic.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.040
To use the library, begin by
adding the following dependency

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.000
in your [INAUDIBLE] file.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.910
The next step is to create
a billing client instance.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.550
You'll use this class
for interactions

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.760
with the in-app
billing API, including

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.900
listing available products,
starting the billing

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.850
flow for in-app products
or subscriptions,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.740
opening the Google
Play payment screen,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.259
getting users' purchases,
and creating or modifying

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.430
subscriptions.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.630
When creating your
billing client instance,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.365
you'll need to set up
purchases updated listener.

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:40.990
This allows your app to receive
updates from the in-app billing

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.660
API, like transaction
results and updates

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.870
from payments started
in other devices.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.180
Here's the code for
creating the billing client.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.430
Remember that it's required
that you set up purchases

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.630
updated listener.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.880
After you have successfully
created the billing client

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.100
instance, you are ready
to start sending requests

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.810
to the in-app billing API.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.960
It's just a few lines of code
to get the details about a skew,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.940
or to start the purchase flow.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.680
For more details
about billing client,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.410
