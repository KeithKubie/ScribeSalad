00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:02.668
It is now time for the section
of the show

00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:05.538
known as the #HashtagWars.

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:07.307
(cheering and applause)

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:14.447
On this day in the year
of our Lord 1781,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.582
astronomer William Herschel
discovered the seventh planet

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:19.185
in our solar system: Uranus.

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.354
Or "Urinous," as some people
falsely call it.

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:23.056
And before you start
with your childish giggling,

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.624
the word "Uranus"
has nothing to do

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.193
with your immature jokes
about the human anatomy.

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:29.562
It's actually a Latinized
version of Ouranos,

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:31.798
the name of the Greek god
of the sky.

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.700
Seen here with his nut sack
hanging hanging out.

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.336
We're gonna handle this
important astronomical discovery

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.806
in the most mature way possible,

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.508
with tonight's hashtag,
#ButtsScience.

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.812
Examples might be...

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:48.381
That's a wire frame,
that makes it grownup.

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.583
Shut up.

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:52.618
Examples might be
"Badonka da Vinci,"

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:54.687
And "My anaconda don't want none

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.656
unless you've got
Bunsen burners.”

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.324
I'm gonna put 60 seconds
on the clock and begin.

00:00:58.357 --> 00:00:59.826
Jim Norton.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.794
"She blinded me
with her big fat ass."

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:03.529
All right, points.

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:04.764
Ricky.

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:06.699
Bill Nye the Anal Guy.

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:08.668
(laughter)

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.340
Still could be true,
we don't know.

00:01:14.373 --> 00:01:15.808
Uh, points. Jim.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:17.443

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:19.612
Ricky.

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:21.147
"Houston, I have a boner."

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.615
Yes, points, very good.

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:24.250
"Anal string theory."

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:26.552
Points. Jim again.

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.821
"Galile-- Oh, (bleep)!
That's a big fat ass."

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:30.356
HARDWICK:
All right, points.

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:31.557
Ricky.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.392
Neil Dat Ass Tyson.

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:35.228
Points. Jim.

 to the Future.</i>

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:37.730
HARDWICK:
Points.

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:39.365
Wow. Jim again.

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:41.601
-Butts Aldrin.
-HARDWICK: Points.

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:44.437
We really found Jim Norton's
sweet spot in this one.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.305
Camilla.

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:47.907
"Dat NASA, though."

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.775
Yes, points. Very good.

00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:51.344
