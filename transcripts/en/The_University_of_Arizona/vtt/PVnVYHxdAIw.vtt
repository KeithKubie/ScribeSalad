00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.270
 Today we're so
interested in the study

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.914
of how some of these
extreme climate

00:00:07.914 --> 00:00:09.330
events that we've
been seeing, how

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.724
they affect human societies.

00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:13.890
You know, how dop they
affect them over a long term?

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.040
How do they affect them over
a wide geographic region?

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.872
How does the same
climate event play out

00:00:18.872 --> 00:00:20.580
in lots of different
parts of the planet?

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.260
Well, today, of
course, we can watch

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.860
that evolve when an event hits.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.070
But what happened in the past?

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.610
Tree rings provide this
incredible way to do that.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.860
Because they're
these kind of passive

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.850
sentinels recording time
and lots of other things

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.330
to go with that time.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.360
So in each time capsule
that's locked away

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.030
in a tree ring sequence, we
have all kinds of information.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.650
We have the radiocarbon that was
in the environment at the time

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.330
that tree ring formed.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.140
We have maybe oxygen isotopes,
maybe other carbon isotopes

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.050
that tell us about
rainfall, that might tell us

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.850
about temperature.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.830
We can know that a tree is
putting on a ring every year.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.327
And the amazing thing is
that if we start with today,

00:01:04.327 --> 00:01:05.910
if you or I, if we
went outside and we

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.118
took a sample from under
the bark of any of the trees

00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:10.920
that we see outside, we
would find a ring forming.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.360
And it would be
this year's ring.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.194
So we know the date.

00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:15.401
And so we know the date of
the one before and the one

00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:17.580
before and the one before
and the one before.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.950
And the neat thing is
about tree ring research

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.940
is we can overlap these
patterns back 12,000 years

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.920
dated from today
all the way back,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.380
each year represented
by a single ring.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.240
So that's an amazing
way to measure time.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.615
And it's an amazing archive.

00:01:31.615 --> 00:01:33.240
And all the time
we're finding new ways

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.570
to unlock the secrets
of the tree rings.
