00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.220
Once you have a simple version of your
game, you'll want to test it out.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.170
But how did developers start testing?

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.590
&gt;&gt; Many developers give their game
to their friends and family to play.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.660
And once they have
a more polished version,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.980
they deploy it to an app store to get
reviews from a much wider audience.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.570
&gt;&gt; But
only some players submit reviews and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.870
it takes a while to read through them.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.940
Is there a quicker way to get feedback?

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.990
&gt;&gt; Actually, yes.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.800
Many developers use analytics tools,
like Amazon Mobile Analytics, which

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.310
tracks app usage and revenue over all
your users without any player reviews.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.220
These tools help you identify
where players stop playing,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.270
when they buy in app items, and
what games are most popular.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.720
&gt;&gt; So don't be afraid to submit
a game with a few imperfections,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.800
analytics can help you identify any
flaws and strengths early on and

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.270
regular updates can help you create
the best ongoing experience for players.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.110
&gt;&gt; Next, we'll show you one more way
to test your game in real time and

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.640
improve it.
