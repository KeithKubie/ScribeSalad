00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.975
Let's do another synthetic
division example.

00:00:02.975 --> 00:00:04.670
And in another
video, we actually

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.310
have the why this works relative
to algebraic long division.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.040
But here it's going
to be another just,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.460
let's go through
the process of it

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.450
just so that you get
comfortable with it.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.770
And now is a good chance to
give it a shot, to actually try

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.200
to simplify this
rational expression.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.370
So let's think about
this step by step.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.910
So the first thing
I want to do is

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.190
write all of the coefficients
of the numerator.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.910
So I have a 2.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.480
Oh, I have to be careful here.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.870
Because the 2 is the
coefficient for x to the fifth,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.860
I have no x to the fourth term.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.120
Let me start over.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.500
So I have the 2 from
2x to the fifth.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.010
And then I have no
x to the fourth.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.910
So it's really 0x to the fourth.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.090
So I'll put a 0
as the coefficient

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.910
for the x to the fourth term.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.540
And then I have a negative
1 times x to the third.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.965
And then I have a positive
3 times x squared.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.320
Negative 2 times x.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.410
And then I have a constant
term, or zero degree term, of 7.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.920
I just have a positive 7.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.360
And now let me just draw my
little funky synthetic division

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.870
operator-looking symbol.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.040
And remember, the type of
synthetic division we're doing,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.030
it only applies when we are
dividing by an x plus or minus

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.190
something.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.720
There's a slightly
different process

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.840
you would have to do if it
was 3x or if was negative 1x

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.740
or if it was 5x squared.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.250
This only works when we have
x plus or minus something.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.200
In this case we have x minus 3.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.150
So we have the negative 3 here.

00:01:47.496 --> 00:01:48.870
And the process
we show-- there's

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.950
other ways of doing it-- is
you take the negative of this.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.640
So the negative of
negative 3 is positive 3.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.200
And now we're ready to perform
our synthetic division.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.950
So we'll bring down
this 2 and then multiply

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.780
the 2 times the 3.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.900
2 time 3 gives us 6.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.680
0 plus 6 is 6.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.520
And then we multiply that times
the 3, and we get positive 18.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.300
Negative 1 plus 18 is 17.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.226
Multiply that times the 3.

00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:37.690
17 times 3 is 51.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.350
3 plus 51 is 54.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.700
Multiply that times 3.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.556
The numbers are getting
kind of large now.

00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:47.680
So that's going to be what?

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.562
50 times 3 is 150.

00:02:49.562 --> 00:02:51.440
4 times 3 is 12.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.020
So this is going to be 162.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:02.200
Negative 2 plus 162 is 160.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.890
And then finally, 160
times 3 is going to be 480.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.330
And you add 480 to
7, and you get 487.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.650
And you can think of it, I only
have one term or one number

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.060
to the left-hand side
of this bar here.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.050
Or I'm just doing the standard,
traditional x plus or minus

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.660
something version of synthetic
division, I should say.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.810
So I can separate
this out, and now I've

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.380
essentially gotten my answer.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.089
And it looks like voodoo,
and it kind of is voodoo.

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:37.630
And that's why I
don't like to do it,

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.764
because you're just
memorizing an algorithm.

00:03:39.764 --> 00:03:41.680
But there are other
videos why we explain why.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.660
And it can be fast
and convenient

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.820
and paper saving very often,
like you see right here.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.520
But then we have
our final answer.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.560
It's going to be-- and
let me work backwards.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.270
So I'll start with
our remainder.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.170
So our remainder is 487.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.300
And it's going to be
487 over x minus 3.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.970
And so this is
our constant term.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.540
And so you're going to have plus
160 plus 487 over x minus 3.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.250
Now this is our x term.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.730
So it's going to be
54x plus all of this.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.930
This is going to be
our x squared term.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.720
So this is going to be 17x
squared plus 54x plus 160

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.790
and all of that.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.170
Then this is going to
be x to the third term.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.320
So this is going to be 6x to
the third plus all of that.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.000
And then finally, this is
our x to the fourth term--

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.240
2x to the fourth.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.700
And let me erase this.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.620
So then I have my x
to the fourth term.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.180
So it is 2x to the fourth.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.520
And we are done.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.540
This thing simplifies
to this right over here.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.000
And I encourage you to verify it
with traditional algebraic long

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.199
division.
