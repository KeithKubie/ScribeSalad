00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:10.376
 I was with Akmal when
he was killed in Chad.

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:15.681
He died a hero for a
just and noble cause.

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:21.154
 If it was so noble, perhaps
you should have died with him.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.555
 Look, I know it was rough.

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:25.091
But letting Andrew go
was the last shot we had.

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:26.092
Decision's on me.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.160
 Yeah, damn straight it is.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.227
 Bruno.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.695
She did what she had to do.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:30.597
You did the right thing.

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.301
 You got something
to say to me?

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:38.171
 I'm just wondering
whose back you've got--

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.440
hers or ours?

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.842
 Bud, you have to move on.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.243
 I'm sorry, jefe.

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:45.812
But I can't do that.

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.580
I've never going to do that.

00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:52.185
 Ever since Rip died, you
have questioned every decision

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.721
that I have made for this team.

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:58.191
That has to stop.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.559
Now.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:00.693
 Check this out.

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:03.329
It's a surf shop in Santa Cruz.

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:04.664
It's for sale.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.165
You could do this.

00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:07.600
We do this.

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:09.302
 I'll think about it.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:11.337
Show me some more pictures.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.739
 I need you back on the team.

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:16.742
 Can you clear a medical,
then be good to go?

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:17.677
 I'll be good to go.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.846
 Vern.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.814
 Your clearance
has been revoked.

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:23.683
You shot that man in cold blood.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:24.817
 This is still in play.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.718
We still have a
shot of getting--

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:26.853
 Quiet!

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:28.488
This is how this
is going to work.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:29.755
You keep your mouth shut.

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.624
You never contact Nasry again.

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:32.859
You don't lawyer up.

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:35.495
And the video disappears.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:38.364
Otherwise, the charge
will be murder.

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:39.899
 Well, that was some show.

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:43.336
Here's my take on
how this went down.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.738
You weren't expecting
to be attacked.

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:49.709
You defended your
HVI and your team.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:54.247
Then your CIA officer bigfoot-ed
you, let Nasry go on her own.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.348
Is that right?

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.782
- That is correct.
- Yes, sir.

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:59.352
 Is there anything else
I should be aware of?

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:00.520
 No, sir.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:02.922
 No, sir.

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:06.526
 I still think you
made the wrong call.

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:11.631
 You get your own team,
and you make your own calls.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.399
 The CIA wants me
to infiltrate you.

00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:14.434
They want me to be their mole.

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:21.207
 And the bitch who they
gave you the name of someone

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.343
in my organization,
someone on the payroll?

00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:27.613
 Javid Dasmani, your
Pakistani courier.

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:30.249
 And now he's dead.

00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:31.350
But I still don't trust you.

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:33.286
 OK, but she does.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.756
So feed her false
intel through me.

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.258
 Put him with Andrew Hall.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.162
 Who are you?

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:46.832
 Where'd you get it?

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:48.668
 I took the magazine out.

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:51.837
 You know there could still be
a round in that chamber, right?

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.973
This is what gets
people like you killed.

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:55.641
This is what kills our kids.

00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:57.376
And it happens all the time.

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.579
This piece is around $600,
and I know you didn't buy it.

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:02.248
So who gave it to you?
God damn it!

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:02.848
Who gave it to you?

00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:05.952
 Alex called her.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:09.388
 Any other symptoms?

00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:10.957
 None.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.994
 As far as I'm concerned, you
have the ability to tolerate

00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:17.563
operational conditions.

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:19.432
 Did you just give
me medical clearance?

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.467
 You still have to
see the psychiatrist

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.303
to confirm that you're
psychologically fit.

00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:25.605
 Doc, I'm a SEAL.

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:26.606
I haven't been
psychologically fit since I

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.841
slid down the birth canal, OK?

00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:30.476
Thank you.

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:32.612
Thank you.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:35.615
 Does it bother
you, killing people?

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:38.417
 Everyone is surprised at
the moment of their death.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.855
I'm thinking that this
has to be a mistake.

00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:45.291
You can see it in their eyes.

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:47.227
 Who knocked the
Harvard out of you, man?

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.732
 Bobby.
Are you OK?

00:03:57.936 --> 00:03:58.805
 Yeah, I'm good.

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:03.843
 I have a sleeper
in the States--

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:05.311
the one who killed the Seals.

00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:07.747
 Lies, lies, lies.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.914
 She's out there!

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:12.018
Waiting to kill whoever I say!

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:14.887
 Show me.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.988
 Who are you?

00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:18.024
 It's me, Marissa.

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:19.859
Michael.

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:21.761
Are you still in place?

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:22.795
 Yes.

00:04:22.828 --> 00:04:23.896
What do you want me to do?

00:04:23.929 --> 00:04:24.930
I'm not feeling well.

00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:25.931
 We're going to kill them.

00:04:25.964 --> 00:04:27.600
 I need to go home.

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:29.368
 All of them.

00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:29.969
 Ricky can take you.

00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:37.977
[phone ringing]

00:04:39.044 --> 00:04:40.680
 Hey, we're almost there.

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:42.415
Call you in a few?

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.750
OK, bye.

00:04:44.783 --> 00:04:47.086
I remember you.

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:49.822
Yeah, I waited around all night
for you, and you never showed.

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:56.062
 Well, I'm here now.

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:59.632
 You'll feel better
once you kill something.

00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:03.069
You should ride that
darkness, my man.

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:04.704
That's who you are.

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:06.439
 You must be the
great Michael Nasry.

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:07.006
 Where's hole?

00:05:12.878 --> 00:05:15.014
 We need to leave now.

00:05:21.086 --> 00:05:22.889
 Holy [muted].
