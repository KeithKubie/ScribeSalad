00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.372
(dramatic music)

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.275
(applause)

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:43.710 line:0%
Fernando: Good evening.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.011 line:0%
It's a special honor
for me to be here

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:49.348 line:0%
at National Geographic
because probably

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:51.583 line:0%
if I was born again
I would give it a try

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:54.320
to be part of this organization.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.888
My poor kids, all my life

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:57.456
whenever we went on vacation,

00:00:57.456 --> 00:00:59.692
once they told my
little daughter said,

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:03.462
"Dad, why do we always end up
in the boondocks?" (laughter)

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:05.198
Because the passion
to go to the jungle,

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:06.533
to go to the countryside,

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.235
to go see nature
and be close to it

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.571
was close to my heart.

00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:13.907
I had the pleasure and honor

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.975
to meet Bill Garrett
when he was editor

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:17.977
of the magazine.

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:22.481
I went to hear him speak at
a university in Honduras.

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.250
Had nothing to do
there other than wanted

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.118
to go hear him speak,

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:28.153
and we became very good friends

00:01:28.153 --> 00:01:30.589
and I enjoyed wonderful
trips with him

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:33.626
to Maya sites and photography

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:36.296
and learned a lot
from Bill Garrett.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:41.366
He was the founder of this
wonderful organization

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:43.135
incorporated here in Virginia,

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:45.972
La Ruta Maya
Conservation Foundation.

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:49.842
His vision was to
preserve Maya heritage

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:51.277
in different ways.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:54.514
I took the presidency
of this organization,

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:59.152
and took it to a
different emphasis

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:04.790
and tried to do with
it the best we could

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.861
to preserve this
heritage for Guatemalans.

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.629
The piece you'll see on screen

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.199
is called the Cancuén Panel.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.803
It narrates the history
of the kings of Cancuén,

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:20.839
their heritage, who they fought,

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.174
who they captured, and so forth,

00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:24.443
a very important
archaeological piece

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:26.445
that the foundation acquired,

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:30.349
and it keeps today
and offers to museums.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.285
This piece has traveled
the world visiting museums,

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:36.689
and we are constantly
putting it on loan

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.891
for exhibits locally.

00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:41.693
So we promote education
and we are also

00:02:41.693 --> 00:02:44.630
trying to archive and
document everything

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.333
that the collection has.

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:52.070
These pieces on screen
are vases that were

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.739
acquired here in United States,

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.542
or received as donations
here in United States

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:58.878
that were sent back home.

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:00.780
The piece here on the
left is very important

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.483
because that little
Mickey Mouse guy

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:08.321
with the ears on the bottom
is the glyph for Mirador,

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:12.625
a site in the jungles of
Guatemala, pre-classic site,

00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:16.162
and this glass was
used to drink chocolate

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:19.565
by the king when he
was appointed king.

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:23.403
Around the vase it says
who his grandfather was,

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:24.704
who his father was,

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.305
who he is, and
today he's appointed

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:29.975
king of Mirador with
the dates of all this.

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:31.610
This is called an ascension cup,

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.779
archaeologically
extremely interesting

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:35.647
and extremely valuable.

00:03:35.647 --> 00:03:38.117
This piece was donated
by a collector here

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:40.619
in United States.

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.923
Pieces very artistic
or archaeologically

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:46.926
very important are
what we are endeavoring

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:52.232
to bring to Guatemalans
through the collection.

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:55.001
We brought a container of pieces

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.870
out of United States
in one shipment.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.139
Sophia Paredes,
the executive director

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.475
of the foundation,
you can see her smile

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:04.276
on the face because
she was so happy

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:06.112
these pieces were
coming back home.

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:07.780
Bringing pieces
back to Guatemala

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.716
is not a simple story.

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:12.518
There's no legislation to
bring them into the country,

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:15.655
so I bumped into
customs with legislation

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:17.924
that treats these
pieces that are

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.927
Guatemalan pieces
as merchandise.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:24.697
They want us to pay duties
when we bring them in.

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:26.632
I raise hell and I
don't pay the duties,

00:04:26.632 --> 00:04:29.168
and I find a way to
bring them in (laughter)

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:32.104
because I was so offended
when they told me

00:04:32.104 --> 00:04:33.472
that we had to pay duties.

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:34.707
I said, "These are Guatemalans

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:36.208
"coming back to Guatemala.

00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:38.677
"You cannot charge us for it."

00:04:38.677 --> 00:04:40.913
And I even threatened
to take them back

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.815
bring them back to the States.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:46.152
But the truth is the
fellow from customs

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:47.753
said, "Please don't
be angry with me.

00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:50.355
"I just don't have
legislation to back me up,

00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:52.691
"and I have to charge the duty."

00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:55.628
So I got the Ministry of Culture

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:58.831
to run them through
customs for me,

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:02.468
and they avoided the law and
we did not pay. (laughter)

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.336
We did not pay the duties.

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:06.605
We have a law right now
in hands of Congress

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:08.607
that we have worked
and spent quite

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:11.744
a bit of effort to correct this

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:16.716
so we can in the future
import these pieces legally.

00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:19.785 line:0%
In 2012 we bought these
pieces in California.

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:21.654 line:0%
They were part of a
private collection,

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:23.222 line:0%
very important pieces.

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:28.193 line:0%
These are part of a
staircase of La Corona,

00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:31.697 line:0%
a very important site
that archaeologists

00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:33.632
were crazy looking for
because they only knew

00:05:33.632 --> 00:05:35.034
by reference with other sites

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:38.471
that La Carona existed
and it was finally found.

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:40.840
These pieces, the
companion of these pieces

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.576
are in American
museums illegally.

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:45.978
We're going to ask nicely to see

00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:47.346
if we can get them back,

00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:51.650
and if not, later we will
think of other ways. (laughter)

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.619
But these pieces
need to go back.

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:55.921
They left the country illegally.

00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:57.089
We can prove that.

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:58.190
We have photographs
of archaeologists

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.726
at the site with these pieces.

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:02.161
And the last piece
is very interesting

00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:06.398
because it says this king
enjoyed drinking pulque

00:06:06.398 --> 00:06:11.570
which is a wine made
out of maize, corn.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.539
So the Maya had a lot
of sense of humor.

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.141
Not everything they
put on their stelaes

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.578
is very important
information like this one

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:20.747
saying that he was
drinking pulque.

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:25.450
But they're very important
archaeologically for us.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.588
Every piece we have
we invest huge effort

00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:30.356
in documenting them.

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:32.325
Our files for every
piece are as good

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:34.794
as any museum here
in the States.

00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:36.229
We're very proud of that,

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.098
and we are working to
put all these photographs

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:44.503
online, high resolution,
20 megapixel photography.

00:06:44.503 --> 00:06:47.974
We're putting them
online as we speak.

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:49.976
Every piece, we
abide by the law,

00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:54.147
it's properly registered
with the National Registry

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:56.982
of Antiquities,

00:06:56.982 --> 00:06:59.885
and the instant they become
part of that registry,

00:06:59.885 --> 00:07:02.354
they obviously are
available to any researcher.

00:07:02.354 --> 00:07:04.723
But if a researcher comes to us,

00:07:04.723 --> 00:07:06.225
we make the pieces available,

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:08.827
the photography, everything
available for free.

00:07:08.827 --> 00:07:12.098
Our collection is
right now 3,300 pieces

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.665
that are registered.

00:07:13.665 --> 00:07:18.671
Some as I say are
extremely valuable

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:20.106
and very important.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.407
Every museum in the
country has pieces

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:23.409
from our collection.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:26.244
We focus today on that effort

00:07:26.244 --> 00:07:31.550
of documenting and repatriating,

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.519
and we have received donations

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:35.120
from Guatemalan collectors,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.089
or international collectors.

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:40.125
One of the most
touching moments for me,

00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:42.561
I went to a house of a friend,

00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:44.797
gives me a piece and
I am admiring it.

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:47.332
I said, "My, God, this is
really an important piece,"

00:07:47.332 --> 00:07:48.634
and I'm putting it
back on the shelf.

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:50.336
He said, "No, no,
no, no. Take it.

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:52.238
"It's for you. It's
for the museum.

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:54.507
"It's for the foundation."

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:57.276
My hair just, you know,
you can imagine the emotion

00:07:57.276 --> 00:07:59.412
of receiving that,

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:02.547
and I have a friend
in North Carolina

00:08:02.547 --> 00:08:08.020
and he puts in my hands
a mosaic jade mask,

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.621
and I'm putting it back.

00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:11.457
He says, "No, no. Take
it, but take it fast

00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:14.059
"before I change my
mind." (laughter)

00:08:14.059 --> 00:08:16.561
And I took it in my
hand and I smuggled

00:08:16.561 --> 00:08:19.698
into the country and
it is happily sitting

00:08:19.698 --> 00:08:21.633
in a museum in Museo Miraflores

00:08:21.633 --> 00:08:23.702
in Guatemala City today.

00:08:23.702 --> 00:08:29.174
So this effort
it's controversial.

00:08:29.174 --> 00:08:31.577
Some archaeologists
don't like what I do.

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:33.446
I'm very proud of what I do,

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:35.847
and we can have a very
solid discussion about it,

00:08:35.847 --> 00:08:37.182
and we can agree to disagree,

00:08:37.182 --> 00:08:40.385
but these are public places

00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:42.221
where our pieces are exhibited.

00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:45.824
They have no place
in a warehouse.

00:08:45.824 --> 00:08:48.360
I don't have enough
places to exhibit them,

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.428
and we need to create a place,

00:08:50.428 --> 00:08:53.199
a world-class place to exhibit.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:56.368
The Arts Show of Los
Angeles invited us

00:08:56.368 --> 00:08:58.136
to exhibit there,

00:08:58.136 --> 00:09:00.873
and we presented the
piece in the center there.

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.908
It's almost 10 feet long.

00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:05.144
It's a monumental piece.

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:07.312
It's a very important
piece we acquired

00:09:07.312 --> 00:09:09.181
from a collector.

00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:14.553
These pieces today should
be the core of a museum.

00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:17.156
These pieces are part
of the collection

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:19.624
like this rattle here
on the left for a child,

00:09:19.624 --> 00:09:22.160
or for an instrument for music.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.664
You can see they're really fun

00:09:25.664 --> 00:09:27.900
and very beautiful some of them.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.403
For example, this
bust is the only bust

00:09:31.403 --> 00:09:35.708
that we know that
comes from Tikal,

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:36.942
very beautiful also.

00:09:36.942 --> 00:09:40.278
That piece we
acquired in Florida.

00:09:40.278 --> 00:09:42.548
The one on the right
there is another vessel

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:44.783
to drink chocolate.

00:09:44.783 --> 00:09:47.253
Maya considered
chocolate very important,

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:50.288
and it says, "Lord
how so and so.

00:09:50.288 --> 00:09:51.757
This is his cup for chocolate

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.592
just like you have one in
the kitchen that says sugar

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:57.095
and he had one that
says chocolate.

00:09:57.095 --> 00:09:59.864
These are really fun
pieces, very beautiful.

00:09:59.864 --> 00:10:03.269
This takes us to the big dream.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:06.871
We want to create a
museum, world-class museum.

00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:09.174
We want to replicate the success

00:10:09.174 --> 00:10:13.412
of cities in Europe like Bilbao,

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:16.248
and the Museum of
Bilbao that changed

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:19.218
a fairly ugly industrial city

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:21.620
into a cultural destination.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.357
Today Bilbao has 1.1
million tourists a year

00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:27.692
it did not receive before.

00:10:27.692 --> 00:10:29.962
Bilbao formerly
was a crisis in Spain

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:31.296
this last few years,

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.366
because Bilbao was
receiving double or triple

00:10:34.366 --> 00:10:37.002
the tourism than the
rest of the country was

00:10:37.002 --> 00:10:38.737
because of one museum.

00:10:38.737 --> 00:10:41.006
If we can do that for Guatemala,

00:10:41.006 --> 00:10:44.009
we can increase the GNP by 1%.

00:10:44.009 --> 00:10:45.177
Because the country receives

00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:46.712
1.8 million tourists a year,

00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:50.249
I think the museum can
bring 600,000 people a year.

00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:52.585
The math we do
with the government

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:57.022
one percentage increase
in gross national product

00:10:57.022 --> 00:10:59.258
that could be done
through culture

00:10:59.258 --> 00:11:01.660
through an
institution like this.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.695
I won't bore you
with the museum,

00:11:03.695 --> 00:11:05.130
but that's my big dream today.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.365
I'm dedicating and committing

00:11:07.365 --> 00:11:09.502
probably the next 10
or 20 years of my life

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:12.170
that I hope we
can enjoy to bring

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.341
a world-class museum dedicated

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:18.944
to the preservation of
this wonderful heritage.

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:22.314
We went to the best
architects of the world,

00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:24.716
and we found some
architects in Switzerland.

00:11:24.716 --> 00:11:28.520
This is seen from an airplane
view over the museum.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.190
This is the view of
what we intend to build.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.226
It's a 60,000 square
foot building.

00:11:34.226 --> 00:11:36.962
It will take quite a bit of
money that we need to raise,

00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:38.831
and we're in the
process of that.

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:41.200
The government will
give us the land.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.701
There's a lot more
to talk about that,

00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:46.405
but the purpose is conservation.

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:48.473
The purpose is to
bring well-being

00:11:48.473 --> 00:11:51.010
to our country through tourism,

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.711
and for me one of
the biggest purposes

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:55.180
is to give the Maya
people of my country

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.515
a sense of pride
of being Indian,

00:11:57.515 --> 00:11:59.651
a sense of pride of being Maya

00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:01.720
because there is a huge heritage

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.657
to be proud of and
a museum like this

00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:09.361
would be built and created
to celebrate that heritage.

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:13.565
So National Geographic
with this invitation

00:12:13.565 --> 00:12:16.635
is giving us credibility
for this effort

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.804
and for that I
thank you very much.

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:19.972
Thank you.

00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:21.740
(applause)

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:27.213
(thoughtful music)
