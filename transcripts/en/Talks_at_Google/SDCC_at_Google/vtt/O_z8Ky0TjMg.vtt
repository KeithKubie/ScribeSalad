[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.482 --> 00:00:04.190
JONATHAN ROBERTS: It
is great to be here.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.880
I know a couple
of familiar faces

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.540
from the time I came and gave a
very different talk, about six

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.690
months ago.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.154
So thank you very much
for having me back.

00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:14.570
So today we're
going to talk a bit

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.900
about the process I went
through when I ended up

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.520
landing the commission to do
the maps for "Game of Thrones,"

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.050
for "The Lands of
Ice and Fire" book.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.157
Just to give you a bit
of a context, the maps

00:00:26.157 --> 00:00:28.240
you see here-- I'll talk
a bit more about the ones

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.330
that I brought a
little later today--

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.680
but that's the actual
size of the maps that

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.410
ended up in the final book.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.160
So the book itself has 12 maps.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.930
They're folded, rather
than rolled like this,

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.655
but it is just a book of maps.

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:45.880
So it is just 12 maps
of the world of Westeros

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.640
and the lands that go all
the way to the far east, way

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.330
beyond anything we've seen in
the books or in the TV show.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.150
Yeah, there we go.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.150
So this is how it all started.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.385
This is January 2012.

00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:04.069
I got an email
from Random House,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.200
which basically said, like, hi.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.760
Do you fancy mapping all
of Westeros and all lands

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.250
to the east?

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.970
And this was something
of a surprise

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.780
because my secret,
particularly at this point,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.210
was that I wasn't a
full-time professional artist

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.250
or cartographer.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.359
I was actually a
theoretical physicist.

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:25.150
So it's a little
surprising to get an email

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.483
like this landing in your inbox.

00:01:26.483 --> 00:01:29.820
Now I did draw maps
for third-party books,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.480
for some games, for those kind
of bits and pieces, for fun.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.950
But I was getting paid
on a regular basis

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.210
to do this kind of work.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.810
But when you look for
fantasy map artists,

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.100
there aren't many of
them in the world.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.650
And a lot of them
are a bit older,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.820
like 10, 12, 15 years older.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.885
And I just don't think they
understand search or SEO

00:01:50.885 --> 00:01:51.650
at all.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.060
So my little blog just quietly
floated up the rankings

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.050
until, when somebody
Googles fantasy artist,

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.364
my blog turned up right on
the front page for maps.

00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:03.280
And so clearly, Random
House had a bit of hunt

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.375
around, found this,
and said, oh, OK.

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:07.250
This guy sounds good.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.429
Let's see what we can do.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.720
Now I'd read the books already.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.852
I'd read them back in when I was
in college, back around 2001.

00:02:15.852 --> 00:02:17.560
And the one thing I
thought at that point

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.750
was that, wow, these
things could really

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.880
do with some-- like,
these are big worlds,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.570
and big worlds need big maps.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.900
So this was the maps
that existed at the time.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.590
These are the ones
that are actually

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.650
in the front of the paperbacks.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.316
They're kind of perfect
for a paperback.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:31.450
They're black and
white line art.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.950
There's a huge
amount of information

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.761
crammed in here, which
is why the style has

00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:36.510
to be super simple,
so that you can really

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.745
pull all that detail out.

00:02:39.745 --> 00:02:43.700
But it's a far cry
from the evocative maps

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.286
that you render up
in your mind when

00:02:45.286 --> 00:02:46.410
you're reading these books.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.280
This is a very rich world that
George R. R. Martin built,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.200
as HBO has shown
time and time again

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.400
with the stuff that
they put on top of this.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.332
And so when I originally read
the books, I remember thinking,

00:02:57.332 --> 00:02:59.040
yeah, these could do
with some good maps.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.050
At that point, I had never
drawn a professional map

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.760
when I read the books.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.051
So it's interesting that over
the course of the next 10

00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:05.718
years, me and the
books diverged wildly.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.217
I went off and
started drawing maps.

00:03:07.217 --> 00:03:09.176
And then they came crashing
back together again

00:03:09.176 --> 00:03:10.841
when I got this email
from Random House.

00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:13.260
I actually hadn't read them
for a long time at that point.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.250
I had this vague memory
of what the books were,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.291
and I definitely hadn't
read the most recent one.

00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:19.120
So the answer was,
yes, definitely,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.269
and then went out shopping.

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.060
Also, because I was a
theoretical physicist

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.810
at the time, it was
like, yes, definitely.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.324
I have no idea how this
is going to happen.

00:03:29.324 --> 00:03:31.240
And I more or less had
to run the entire thing

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.781
past who my wife,
who was like, yeah,

00:03:32.781 --> 00:03:35.030
I'll see you in the summer.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.170
Which is actually more or
less how that happened.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.760
So the brief was 12 poster maps.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.060
Each map is 22 by 36, so
2 foot by 3 foot maps,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.260
covering all of the
known lands that

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.020
existed plus more lands that had
yet to ever be seen by anyone.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.980
And there would be three
months to do it, so a week

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.440
a map, each one this size.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.226
Which was definitely
the, yeah, this

00:03:57.226 --> 00:03:58.350
is going to be interesting.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.660
So 72 square feet of Westeros.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.920
And this is, to
put it in context,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.400
a significant portion of
my apartment at the time

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.780
would be covered by Westeros,
Essos, and the two cities.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.980
Also, the actual process
of drawing the maps all

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.730
happened on this laptop.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.490
So everything that
you see here was all

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.740
drawn on a screen this size with
a Wacom tablet in Photoshop.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.210
So when I got these, which are
the intermediate edit stage,

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.710
was the first time
I'd ever seen any

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.340
of these full size, which
was a huge sigh of relief.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.690
It was like, oh, it worked.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.300
That's kind of good to know.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.660
During the process of this,
I upgraded my hard drive once

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.360
and my RAM three times.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.405
It was like 16 gig of RAM,
an external SSD, and-- yeah,

00:04:48.405 --> 00:04:50.530
a composite SSD hard drive
and this one [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.240
before Photoshop
would finally take it

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.837
all the way to the last stage.

00:04:54.837 --> 00:04:56.920
So the anatomy of a map,
because this is basically

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.500
how my process worked before
this commission started.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.740
So you talk to the author.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.990
You get the original sketches.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.110
You kind of chat back and forth.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.720
You get an idea of what
things are important,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.990
what things are less important.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.198
You try and find things that
maybe the author thought

00:05:08.198 --> 00:05:10.740
was a great idea but don't
work geographically-- deserts

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.604
beside forests,
rivers that flow right

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:14.520
across continents from
one ocean to the other.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.240
All those kind of
things just come up.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.556
And so you then pin
down the stuff that's

00:05:19.556 --> 00:05:20.930
still up in the
air, and then you

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.270
get on, use that information,
use their sketches

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.270
to create the line art, just
black and white line art.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.550
Get that signed off.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.190
Then do a full color render.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.890
At the line art stage,
you should always

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.430
have all the
information in the map.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.640
It should be a perfectly
functional, accurate, usable

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.060
map at the line art stage.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.350
Then everything after that
point is just extra credit.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.250
It's all style
from that point on.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.640
And really, the big part of
doing the full-color render

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.524
is making sure that
you're not losing access

00:05:48.524 --> 00:05:50.940
to all the information that
you got in at the first stage.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.606
And then at the end,
final tweaks, handover.

00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:58.230
Now this was obviously going to
be a slightly different process

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.610
because there were many more
people in this process than me

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.930
and the author, unsurprisingly.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.630
And also, having any discussion
which says, so, that thing

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.963
you came up with in the books,
that doesn't really work,

00:06:09.963 --> 00:06:12.610
so can we change it-- was not
going to happen in this case.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.220
In the end, I think there were
two or three editors involved

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.990
between me and
George R. R. Martin.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.300
So there was something of
a game of Chinese Whispers

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.620
between the two to get all
the stuff working, which,

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.180
given any email
that came through me

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.324
would have got in the way of
him writing "Winds of Winter,"

00:06:28.324 --> 00:06:30.365
I think everybody in this
room and also out there

00:06:30.365 --> 00:06:32.823
on the internet would probably
have murdered me in my sleep

00:06:32.823 --> 00:06:36.830
if anything had
pushed that back.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.100
So first thing, the sketches.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.645
What do these look like?

00:06:40.645 --> 00:06:41.270
I do have them.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.840
I have the full set
of original sketches

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.400
from George R. R. Martin that
were the basis for all of this.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.490
I am under an ND, so I can't
show you the full thing.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.200
I'm really sorry.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.700
On the other hand,
if somebody wants

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.820
to come up and have a
chat quickly afterwards,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.800
where we're not being videoed,
and this isn't being projected

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.420
straight onto YouTube, we
might be able to do something.

00:06:59.974 --> 00:07:02.140
So yes, I have the full set
of sketches just sitting

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.560
on my hard drive here.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.710
George R. R. Martin just
did a recent interview

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.610
in "Rolling Stone."

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.030
And this was a particularly
interesting line to me.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.240
It was like, oh, I don't
build the world first.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.710
I just kind of write the
book, put the story in,

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.070
and then put the world together.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.153
Drawing a map took me, I
don't know, half an hour.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.220
I've seen his sketches.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.210
He's got far more
detail in those

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.990
than you could ever
put in in half an hour.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.404
If I'd had a whiff that this was
the kind of thing he was saying

00:07:32.404 --> 00:07:33.820
about the maps
before I started, I

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.910
would have budgeted
a lot more time

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.540
for dealing with his
line art sketches.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.790
It would not have been needed.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.100
The sketches are
pinpoint accurate.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.690
Everything that you see
here was on those sketches,

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.080
more or less, all
in the right place,

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.250
all, when they combine
together, line up beautifully.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.640
This was a dream basis to
actually start working from.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.540
I've seen some which,
from other authors who

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.190
shall remain nameless, that
have been done in crayon.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.220
That's actually happened.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.834
His were beautifully
rendered in pencil

00:08:04.834 --> 00:08:06.250
with particular
things highlighted

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.624
in different
colors, like forests

00:08:07.624 --> 00:08:10.360
drawn in in green pen,
major locations all

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.220
noted with a symbol that
denoted what kind of location

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.280
they were-- like big
keeps, small towns,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.830
ruins, all that kind of stuff.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.880
I mean, spot on accurate.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.260
It was great.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.840
And huge.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.800
I mean, they're massive.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.820
They were all drawn out, on
his part, on loose leaf paper

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.404
and then just compiled together.

00:08:29.404 --> 00:08:31.320
So there were just all
these individual sheets

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.270
of letter-sized
paper, which have all

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.850
been drawn on individually,
and then he's clearly just

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.049
had pieces of tape that
he's stuck onto them.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:39.890
He's carried on
his pencil drawing.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.900
And he's drawn this one massive
composite, stitched together

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.510
world map on sheets
of paper, which

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.204
all works and is all accurate.

00:08:46.204 --> 00:08:48.870
And then what I got was the scan
of all of those sheets of paper

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.040
that I then reconstituted
back in in Photoshop.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.040
And when I was looking
at this, I thought, well,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.623
starting with the
kind of maps that we

00:08:55.623 --> 00:08:57.866
have on the front
sheets of these books,

00:08:57.866 --> 00:08:58.740
they're pretty small.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.899
How are they going to blow up
to be these things, particularly

00:09:01.899 --> 00:09:04.565
when there's three of these maps
that when you put them together

00:09:04.565 --> 00:09:06.770
are actually three separate
pieces of the world?

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.800
You've got the west, central
Essos, and the far east.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.860
And when you compile
those all together,

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.730
that's a six foot wide map,
which is three foot tall.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.099
I mean, this is a big map.

00:09:19.099 --> 00:09:20.640
But his pencil
sketches are four foot

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.430
wide when you compile
them in photo.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.410
I was like, oh, OK.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.160
We've actually got all
the detail we need.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.800
We've got the right
size to begin with.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.456
We're not going to be
filling in a lot of blanks.

00:09:30.456 --> 00:09:34.620
So it was an enormous relief.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.710
It came with incredibly
detailed notes.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.890
So there were like
paragraphs and paragraphs

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.690
about each of these areas.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.490
And so this-- I'm going
ahead a little bit.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.620
This was the very last note on
the notes that came through.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.814
Clearly he'd ended up
putting a lot more work

00:09:49.814 --> 00:09:51.980
into these maps in this
stage than he'd expected to.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.230
So he says, "I need to
stop mapping for a while.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.430
If I had to come up
with one more name,

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:56.679
I think my head would explode.

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.280
Then the Dothraki
would name my neck,

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.991
'the place of the bloody
stump.'" So that's how my notes

00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:02.490
got signed off when
they came to me.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.384
It was like, OK then.

00:10:04.384 --> 00:10:06.272
I think we're good.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.050
So that's the [INAUDIBLE]
from the author.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.750
We had a system set up, and
we had a couple of editors.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.250
We kind of knew
where we were going.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.880
We had a deadline,
which, by this point,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.060
was starting to get
relatively close.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.060
So there's a very,
very light background

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.830
there that you can
see, which was the base

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.920
that I used to begin with.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.440
And then as we'd go
forward, you start

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.150
adding onto the top
of that with lines.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.586
So this was taking the
rough pencil outlines

00:10:35.586 --> 00:10:36.710
and going into a coastline.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.418
So that's where the
coastline comes from.

00:10:38.418 --> 00:10:41.330
Then you add in the mountains,
put in the mountain ranges.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.792
And then you'll
see other features

00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:44.000
just kind of start to appear.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.380
This is the process
that it goes through.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.046
The mountains are
always the first thing

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:48.800
you want to do
because that gives you

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.074
all of the major structural
geographic features.

00:10:51.074 --> 00:10:53.240
You don't want to stick a
river in and then find out

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.220
your mountains are drawn
in the wrong place.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.760
So that's where
the rivers come in.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.010
You've got the hills in there.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:02.120
Then things like forests,
roads, they all come in later.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.625
And this was really
just an exercise

00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:05.602
in going into the
existing maps, going

00:11:05.602 --> 00:11:07.310
through all of those
features one by one,

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.000
and then just slowly
and categorically going

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.790
through each of the
individual steps

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.330
to make sure that all that
detail was uniform in style

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.900
and consistency across
the whole set of maps.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.905
So those lines you
see right there

00:11:19.905 --> 00:11:23.320
are exactly the lines you
see on the pieces of map

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.440
in front of you.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.560
The line art that underlies
this is exactly what

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.724
ends up in the maps.

00:11:28.724 --> 00:11:30.274
And really, at the
end of the day,

00:11:30.274 --> 00:11:32.065
this was just an awful
lot of line drawing.

00:11:32.065 --> 00:11:33.750
This took a bunch of time.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:38.545
So whilst all this was going on,
I got through a ton of Netflix.

00:11:38.545 --> 00:11:40.670
There are some good TV
series out there if you just

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.060
need to listen to them.
"West Wing" is great.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.421
I got through all of both
seasons of "Dollhouse" whilst

00:11:46.421 --> 00:11:46.920
doing this.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.391
And then I also decided,
rather than buying "Dance

00:11:50.391 --> 00:11:52.140
with Dragons" and
reading it in text form,

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.431
I just had it as an audio book.

00:11:53.431 --> 00:11:56.300
So I had "Dance with
Dragons" in my ear

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.650
as I was drawing the maps.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.970
It was kind of full
sensory "Game of Thrones"

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:04.186
immersion, which I'm
not sure is healthy.

00:12:04.186 --> 00:12:06.820
It was also, because
we're talking like March,

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.932
April time, "Game of Thrones"
just came out on the TV

00:12:10.932 --> 00:12:11.640
at the same time.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.380
It's like, oh, I should
be watching that as well.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.650
So there was actually
an evening where

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.733
I was sitting in a corner
at my friend's apartment

00:12:16.733 --> 00:12:17.710
because they had HBO.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.442
I was drawing the maps, and I
was watching "Game of Thrones"

00:12:21.442 --> 00:12:23.816
in the background so I could
keep an eye on if there were

00:12:23.816 --> 00:12:25.524
any major geographic
things that came up,

00:12:25.524 --> 00:12:27.960
and also because
it's a great show.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.550
There was a slight hiccup.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.900
So as I mentioned, I wasn't at
this point a full-time artist.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.210
I actually had a day
job I had to be in.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.820
And inconveniently,
there was a trip

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.454
to Argentina planned because
there's a big ultra-high energy

00:12:40.454 --> 00:12:42.870
cosmic ray telescope down
there, and there was a big group

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.020
meeting.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.229
So I spent a couple of weeks.

00:12:45.229 --> 00:12:46.144
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:46.144 --> 00:12:47.880
JONATHAN ROBERTS:
Yep, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.344
So I went to the
OJ meeting to do

00:12:50.344 --> 00:12:52.760
a whole bunch of ultra-high
energy cosmic ray astrophysics

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.300
in the middle of doing
this commission, which

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.240
means that a decent
chunk of these mountains

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.500
were all drawn in the back
of the conference hall

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.550
in Malargue whilst
listening to OJ talks.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.610
Conveniently, there
are an awful lot

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.902
of mountains in the high
Pampas in Argentina.

00:13:09.902 --> 00:13:11.610
Conveniently, there
are also an awful lot

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.600
of mountains in
"Game of Thrones."

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.950
So I spent a huge amount
of time actually using

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:20.060
the Argentinian Andes as
inspiration for the "Game

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.027
of Thrones" mountains.

00:13:22.027 --> 00:13:23.360
An odd version of synchronicity.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.230
OK.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:33.210
That's fine for all of the
big, sweeping geographic maps

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.270
you see here.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.400
There are a couple in
here which are city maps.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.480
It wasn't just going
to be drawing out

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.680
all the different
locations for the world,

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.260
but we're also digging
in and showing off

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.510
another map of King's Landing.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.093
King's Landing had
been mapped before.

00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:49.570
But the first ever map
of the city of Braavos.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.620
Just before I go any
further, how many people

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.740
here haven't read the books?

00:13:56.662 --> 00:13:58.300
OK.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.270
I think I've flagged up
most of the spoilers.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.230
I think we'll be all right.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.530
For the people who haven't
read the books, that

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.780
map that's right over there,
you should not look at.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.030
That has life lines
of characters.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.665
And when a line
stops, it either means

00:14:07.665 --> 00:14:09.581
you got to the end of
their story in the book,

00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:13.340
or you got to the
end of their story.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.180
You get to decide.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.700
So that's fair warning.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.630
Yeah, so there's a
couple of cities.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.391
These are two big
cities in the books.

00:14:23.391 --> 00:14:24.890
King's Landing,
obviously, everybody

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.200
knows about King's
Landing and the major part

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.480
it plays in the story.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.110
And there's also
Braavos, which we've

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.772
heard about in the TV series.

00:14:31.772 --> 00:14:33.230
We know the First
Sword of Braavos.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.210
We know the Iron
Bank of Braavos.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:37.500
We've started to hear
a bit more about it.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.064
It hasn't actually
been shown yet.

00:14:40.064 --> 00:14:41.522
I'm really intrigued
to see what it

00:14:41.522 --> 00:14:43.271
looks like when we get
there, having spent

00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:45.849
an awful lot of time mapping it.

00:14:45.849 --> 00:14:47.640
But they said, these
are the two city maps.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.990
We want to throw these in here.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.290
They're going to
be top-down maps.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.040
By top-down, I mean
like a satellite view.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.600
So you're just drawing
in roads and blocks.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.700
And that's a bunch of work.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.200
You've got a lot
of detail on there.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.660
But it's fine.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.880
So that was kind of a chunk
of time to be blocked aside.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.190
There we go.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.720
So for the people who
haven't read the books,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.650
there is a map of
Braavos coming up here.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:18.590
So this is the first ever
top-down view of Braavos.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:20.380
This is the overview
of the city.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.820
It's kind of a Venetian city.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.640
It's got a lot of canals, a
lot of boats, a lot of rivers.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:32.430
And this was an exercise that
was interesting because George

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.870
had a sketch of it
that he'd loosely done,

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.610
but he hadn't gone
into a lot of detail.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.300
And there's a lot of
locations that are just

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.720
mentioned in the
books that didn't

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.140
appear on the sketch map.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.670
So this was a point
of it where I actually

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.960
spent a bunch of time
going through the text

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.760
and trying to figure out where
everything should end up.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.468
King's Landing is on
the top right there,

00:15:49.468 --> 00:15:52.080
which is amazingly
rectangular as a city.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.950
It's like the New York-- it's
the Manhattan of Westeros

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:57.460
cities.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.180
It's like, right.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:58.888
It's a rectangle.

00:15:58.888 --> 00:16:01.040
Let's just go for a rectangle.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.540
And then down at
the bottom, you can

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:07.280
see the actual outline
of the Red Keep.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.127
The Red Keep didn't have
an outline or a floor plans

00:16:10.127 --> 00:16:11.960
that I'd ever seen, so
that was just my take

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.120
on what the Red Keep's
floor plan would be.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.175
We'll return to that particular
point in a little moment.

00:16:19.175 --> 00:16:20.794
But with Braavos,
it was much more

00:16:20.794 --> 00:16:22.710
a matter of taking the
rough outline, digging,

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.110
and throwing a lot more
detail, and putting the canals

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.443
and putting the bridges,
putting all the major locations

00:16:27.443 --> 00:16:28.850
in there.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.990
And this meant
going to the books.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:35.864
Obviously, leafing
through, page by page,

00:16:35.864 --> 00:16:37.280
all of the actual
books and trying

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.260
to find the sections
of Braavos in there

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.370
would have taken forever.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.910
Thankfully, there are Kindle
versions of these books.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:44.782
They are searchable.

00:16:44.782 --> 00:16:46.490
You can highlight them
and bookmark them.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.390
So I have a fully
bookmarked set of the books

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.240
to date, which have
pretty much everything

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.770
that has a major geographic
piece of information in it

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.560
just highlighted, so I can
go back and flick through it.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.780
Also, because in the books,
they have character names

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.196
at the beginning
of it, and I knew

00:17:01.196 --> 00:17:03.440
exactly who went to
the different places,

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.359
it made it very easy to pull out
the Braavos sections relatively

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:06.859
quickly.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.262
But that wasn't quite
as much far as it went.

00:17:13.262 --> 00:17:14.720
It turned out,
actually, Braavos is

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.930
going to become
and remain and stay

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:22.430
quite crucial to the
future of the books.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.410
So that meant that
I got chapters

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.150
of "Winds of Winter,"
which was very nice.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.950
Now just to give you
an idea, this is 2012.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:33.450
There were finished chapters
of "Winds of Winter" in 2012.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.700
I'm not going to say any more.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.080
So actual parts
of the Braavos map

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.240
are directly involved
with "Winds of Winter."

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.719
And so if you have read the
books, and you're thinking,

00:17:44.719 --> 00:17:47.260
that's fine, there's no spoilers
on earth in this [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.010
area, you're probably
wrong because somewhere,

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:50.610
I think, there's a Braavos
map kicking around.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.318
And that's definitely
got spoilers in it.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.790
And so this really meant
going through the books,

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:01.597
finding out, right down
to following characters,

00:18:01.597 --> 00:18:04.180
seeing exactly what their path
was, whether they turned right,

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.760
whether they turned
left, how far they'd go,

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.040
and taking all of those
different locations, which

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.090
had unspecified places, and just
figuring out where in the city

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.590
they could be without things
just being fundamentally

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.430
logically inconsistent.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.332
So that took a while.

00:18:19.332 --> 00:18:20.790
And then obviously,
I was basically

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.915
suggesting, sending these
notes back, saying, well,

00:18:22.915 --> 00:18:24.844
this is what I think
the city looks like.

00:18:24.844 --> 00:18:27.510
And that obviously caused fairly
lengthy chains of emails going,

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.260
well, we're not sure
this should go there,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.070
and then arguing back and forth.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.060
But this was actually a
great and really interesting

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.656
process and nailed down a
lot of places very quickly.

00:18:36.656 --> 00:18:39.214
And I learned an awful lot
about Braavos in the process

00:18:39.214 --> 00:18:40.880
because there was all
the justification.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.650
Oh, it can't be there.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:43.125
Even though it makes
sense geographically,

00:18:43.125 --> 00:18:45.458
it really should be here
because this is why it's there.

00:18:48.832 --> 00:18:50.540
I also found that most
of the places that

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:55.340
have a lot of distinction
are the brothels or bars.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.050
It's important to
know where they are.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:58.630
And so then you get the
line art signed off.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:59.290
So you say, OK, that's fine.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:18:59.990
Here's all the line art.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.820
We've had a lot of discussions.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.403
It's all good.

00:19:01.403 --> 00:19:02.610
Let's go into color.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.350
But wait.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:05.660
We have a twist.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.484
They have suddenly
said, oh, actually.

00:19:09.484 --> 00:19:11.670
We kind of like top-down
views of cities.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.211
But you know what
we like a lot more?

00:19:13.211 --> 00:19:14.950
We like three-quarter
views of cities.

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.925
So we like views coming
in from the side.

00:19:16.925 --> 00:19:19.579
We want to see as if you were
aerial view, looking down

00:19:19.579 --> 00:19:20.120
at the stuff.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.075
It's like, oh,
that's interesting.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.530
Because a week a
map for-- OK, right.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:33.520
So the response, obviously,
was like, I'm not

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.270
suggesting George R.
R. Martin is actually

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:39.260
a swap for God of Death.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.349
Yeah, so we said, well, OK.

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:43.640
Clearly we're going to do that.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.292
Clearly those maps
would be amazing

00:19:45.292 --> 00:19:47.625
if we can have a three-quarter
view of all these cities.

00:19:47.625 --> 00:19:49.220
You can actually
start to really see

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.040
what these locations look like.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.580
It's going to take
a little longer.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.900
And I didn't have a lot
of experience drawing.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.210
I'd done a bunch of city
maps before, but never

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:01.990
anything on this
sheer scale before.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:03.810
So just trying to
figure out, when

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.025
you get to a map of this
size, when you do a city

00:20:06.025 --> 00:20:08.700
map in that kind of style, what
you end up getting away with,

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.080
what you can actually do and
what you need to throw in there

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.881
is tricky.

00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:15.130
And it was kind of an unknown.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.230
So I gave myself a
decent amount of leeway,

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:21.580
but I think with city maps like
that, you can put as much time

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.200
as you ever wanted into it,
and you're still never going

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.379
to be able to get every
single detail right.

00:20:26.379 --> 00:20:27.920
And so then we
started saying, right,

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.430
which way do want
to see these cities?

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.680
How do you want to look at it?

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.960
So we threw back and forth
a bunch of layout sketches.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.960
This is the layout sketch
that actually ended up

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.720
going into the Braavos map.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.395
So now we start seeing the whole
thing's got a big perspective

00:20:39.395 --> 00:20:40.150
skew on it.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:44.360
We can now start seeing
mountains and the surrounding

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:44.860
lagoon.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.610
We start getting some
structural details.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.026
You can see at the top right,
that's the Sealord's Palace,

00:20:49.026 --> 00:20:50.790
where you start
seeing some spires.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.590
Just really roughly laying
in which of the regions

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.390
you're going to start
getting proper detail out of.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:02.720
And then a little over--
plan view on the bottom left.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.724
And then for King's
Landing, this

00:21:04.724 --> 00:21:06.140
was what it ended
up looking like.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.850
So this is, you can
see all the streets,

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.000
but you can see all
the little houses.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.385
Braavos, each of the
blocks is a block.

00:21:12.385 --> 00:21:14.200
It's an actual single building.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.030
King's Landing, it's all
tiny little buildings.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.460
Thousands upon
thousands upon thousands

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.445
of tiny little buildings.

00:21:22.445 --> 00:21:24.190
So that was the
first ever outlined

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.590
sketch for King's
Landing, to give

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.530
a rough idea of how
this would look.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.250
So you see the big
surrounding wall.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:33.622
Now, King's Landing's a
big, highly populated city.

00:21:33.622 --> 00:21:35.372
If you actually broke
those down and tried

00:21:35.372 --> 00:21:37.788
to calculate the population
per individual building there,

00:21:37.788 --> 00:21:40.690
you don't get enough
houses for the population.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.790
So it still should be
representative rather

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.120
than realist.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.010
And obviously, you can see the
height of the towers there.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.430
This is a multi-- well, this
is a hell of a lot of people.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.490
With a city this
size, you would never

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.790
be able to see the wall
on that scale around it.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:59.140
So it was trying to go for some
kind of forced realism, where

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.780
you have much larger
representations

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.380
of the key buildings.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.820
So a really big Red Keep
because that's obviously

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.510
very important.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.070
You can see the Sept of Baelor.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:11.330
You can see the
dragons, the dragon pit.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.600
And you can see the big
gates, and you get some idea.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.475
You can see where Flea
Bottom is because it's

00:22:15.475 --> 00:22:18.476
much denser, richer,
much more mashed up.

00:22:18.476 --> 00:22:20.850
But also, when you look at it
from a three-quarters view,

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.470
it's kind of hard to
get the sense of height.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.660
And King's Landing has three
big hills in it, like big hills.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.280
So you've got the one with the
dragon pit on the top right.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.321
You've got the Sept of
Baelor on the bottom left.

00:22:30.321 --> 00:22:33.470
And you've got the hill that
the Red Keep itself sits on.

00:22:35.652 --> 00:22:38.110
Yeah, we'll talk a bit more
about the hills a little later.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.270
But this was basically,
when it got to this point,

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:40.830
everyone's happy.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:41.770
This is what we're
going to do with.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.478
These are the two
layouts for the cities.

00:22:43.478 --> 00:22:45.730
At which point,
we put that aside,

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.700
and I just started
drawing hundreds

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.260
upon hundreds upon
thousands upon thousands

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.745
of little houses.

00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:53.730
I think about a
month after this,

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.500
my wrists started
moving properly again.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.900
It was a long process.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.050
A note on all the names.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.165
These maps are
great illustrations.

00:23:03.165 --> 00:23:05.540
I really enjoyed doing all
the illustration work on them.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:09.160
They are massively detailed
text documents as well.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.600
There's a huge density
of names in this place.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.080
When you actually
get to Westeros--

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.470
I think somebody's got
the actual Westeros

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:15.330
map running around.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:17.415
If there's a bigger one
somewhere down there.

00:23:17.415 --> 00:23:20.800
The sheer number of names
on there is astonishing.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.860
And these names aren't ones
that you can just spell check.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.870
So if I'd had to do
all of that as well,

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.304
this would never
have got finished.

00:23:30.304 --> 00:23:32.220
Random House and Del Rey
did an amazing thing.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.580
They went to the guys who
run Westeros.org, which

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:40.560
is the biggest website Wikipedia
database for "Game of Thrones"

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.290
knowledge.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:44.240
And they got the two people
who run that, Elio and Linda,

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.661
to come on as fact checkers.

00:23:45.661 --> 00:23:47.910
And they ended up running
through all of these things.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.850
They cross-checked every
single one of these maps

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:53.490
to make sure that all
of the text was right,

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:58.370
which was an astonishingly
long task to go into.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.680
And for the journeys map,
which is just over there,

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.790
they actually put together
the path of every character

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.962
through every book to the
end of the published books

00:24:06.962 --> 00:24:09.420
and basically printed out that
map I showed you earlier on,

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.020
which was the one in the
front of the books, with--

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.270
and there were, well, one
for every single character.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:17.090
It was just this massive
FedEx tube of these maps,

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.510
where they'd just drawn every
single path on with notes

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.310
on what happened at each place.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.915
Yeah, they did an epic
amount of work on this.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.930
OK.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.610
So now we've got the
line art signed off.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:30.735
All is well with the world.

00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:32.255
We're moving on quite nicely.

00:24:32.255 --> 00:24:33.630
The process I
actually go through

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.512
for rendering a set of maps.

00:24:35.512 --> 00:24:36.970
You pick a good
background texture.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.178
You always start with a
good, interesting, solid base

00:24:39.178 --> 00:24:41.520
with a bunch of texture on it.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.595
Lay in the core colors.

00:24:42.595 --> 00:24:43.970
Add in the basic
light and shade,

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.430
which starts to give you a
three-dimensional feel to it.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.452
Deepen and lighter,
deepen shadows and add

00:24:48.452 --> 00:24:49.410
some bright highlights.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.454
And then stick your text
or labeling on top of that

00:24:52.454 --> 00:24:54.870
and work on the whole image
at once to retain consistency.

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:56.290
And that's an interesting
one because when

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:58.390
you have things these size and
you have a screen this size,

00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:59.855
you don't want to
work on a piece,

00:24:59.855 --> 00:25:01.730
go off and do something
different over there.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.813
You're basically like, I'm
doing all my mountains.

00:25:03.813 --> 00:25:05.857
I have to do all the
mountains now and do that

00:25:05.857 --> 00:25:07.690
not just on one map,
but across all the maps

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.140
because a lot of these
cover the same area.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.320
So you see the same places
in different regions of maps.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.310
So retaining consistency
both in style, but also

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:20.510
exact representation across all
of these, was really important.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.500
To the extent that when you take
the really big maps, the ones

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.832
of the west, central
Essos, and the far east,

00:25:25.832 --> 00:25:28.040
and you line them up, it
should actually line up spot

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:33.410
on in most places-- at least for
the far east and central Essos,

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:37.180
you can line those up directly,
and they'll just match up.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:43.260
So this is a screen shot
from the center of Essos.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.490
This is the Bone
Mountains, which

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:47.329
divides places like
Qarth and the Red Waste

00:25:47.329 --> 00:25:49.620
from all the stuff that lies
to the further [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.100
like Asshai and the Shadow.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.930
So these are like big, epic
mountains sitting on top.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:58.669
So starting off
by taking the sea.

00:25:58.669 --> 00:26:00.710
Throwing in the details
there, adding some color,

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.168
playing around with
different tones

00:26:02.168 --> 00:26:03.610
and how that's going to feel.

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.815
And then starting to
pull in the color.

00:26:05.815 --> 00:26:06.680
You can see that.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.432
And then throwing the shadow,
adding in the highlights,

00:26:09.432 --> 00:26:11.640
and then finally throwing
in the roads and the labels

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.504
and the icons on top.

00:26:14.504 --> 00:26:15.920
And so that's what
really takes it

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.710
from being just a straight-up
piece of line art,

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.780
where you can see all of
these individual things,

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.530
but you don't really
have feeling for it,

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:22.946
to actually starting
to build this

00:26:22.946 --> 00:26:24.464
into a proper illustration.

00:26:24.464 --> 00:26:26.130
And you hope that at
the end of the day,

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.845
you still see all
the detail you threw

00:26:27.845 --> 00:26:30.120
in there at the beginning.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.810
And so this was the first
version of the known world.

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:37.400
That is the original
color scheme

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.025
that went in for the maps.

00:26:40.025 --> 00:26:41.650
Now, as you can see,
there's actually--

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:45.790
so this is the version
of it which exists,

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:47.605
which was version two.

00:26:47.605 --> 00:26:49.271
So you kind of see
the-- I'll throw this

00:26:49.271 --> 00:26:51.330
up here so you can see
there-- so you can actually

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.360
see the difference in the color
scheme that went in there.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.570
So that was the first pass.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.429
They were like, oh,
that's kind of nice.

00:26:57.429 --> 00:26:58.470
But we have some changes.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:59.410
So it went back.

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:07.210
And the feeling was, good.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:07.710
Nice.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:08.610
We have all the ideas
in the right place.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.220
We kind of like the colors.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.970
But it's a bit too cold.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.420
Let's make it more inviting.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.400
Which was a comment I
was surprised at, given

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.559
that the one phrase
you hear over and over

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:20.100
and over again is
"Winter is coming."

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.840
Well, I kind of
thought cold and grim

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.256
was where we were
going with this.

00:27:23.256 --> 00:27:24.610
But OK, we can warm this up.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:26.620
We can warm this up a lot.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.510
Let's make Westeros
more inviting.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.006
Go for it.

00:27:31.006 --> 00:27:33.630
And so this is the color scheme
that went into the newer world.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.005
So this the map that you see
kicking around on the table.

00:27:36.005 --> 00:27:38.470
And this was basically
a one-off recolor

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.580
of the whole lot, which
wasn't actually going

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.830
back and recoloring mountains.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.635
So mountains, all the light
and shade is still the same,

00:27:43.635 --> 00:27:45.830
but you need to put in a
bunch of adjustment layers

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.767
which change the
warmth and the hue,

00:27:47.767 --> 00:27:49.850
and make sure that all
works without screwing up--

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:53.104
like if you warm up your
plains, and you don't do it

00:27:53.104 --> 00:27:54.770
to your forests
correctly, then it's all

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:55.811
going to look very weird.

00:27:55.811 --> 00:27:58.120
So went back, recolored
a bunch of stuff.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.420
That's these maps
that you see here.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.240
And then there was a comment in
this one that pretty much came

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.780
straight back from Mr. Martin,
which is like, too beige.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:08.910
Far too warm.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:14.280
This is an intense world.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.860
We should have lots
of contrast, and it

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.435
should feel-- you
should really feel

00:28:18.435 --> 00:28:19.810
the cold in some
of those places.

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:21.550
Like, OK, right.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:22.700
We'll go back again.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.250
And so this is now
the color scheme

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.700
that ended up going
with at the end there.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.340
So you can see this
process back and forth,

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.140
changing different
things, working

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.170
on the particular
pieces that need

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.054
to be emphasized
more than others.

00:28:39.054 --> 00:28:40.720
So one thing you'll
notice here, there's

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.010
much more detail in the sea.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:47.140
There was a real feeling
that the Summer Sea-- so this

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.320
is where Daenerys had
been sailing right

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.320
before she got to
the Slaver's Bay

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.080
and went in to start
sacking slaver cities,

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.910
she sails through
the Summer Sea.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:00.740
And it was made quite clear that
this is a Mediterranean feel.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.170
This is like bright azure
seas and should really

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.055
feel like summer.

00:29:07.055 --> 00:29:08.680
And then we go farther
north, we should

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.580
be starting to throw
in like ice floes

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.735
as it gets dark
and cold up there.

00:29:12.735 --> 00:29:14.110
And then towards
the bottom left,

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:18.130
you see it gets into this
really dark, almost black blue

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.900
because that's really
a feeling of this,

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.650
like you're reaching
the end of the world.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:22.733
There's nothing out there.

00:29:22.733 --> 00:29:25.790
There's nowhere to go from here.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.250
This was also, all
these maps were

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.160
supposed to be drawn
from the point of view

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.760
of one of the maesters
of the Citadel.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.540
So it's a very Westeros-centered
view of the world.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:38.770
The detail starts to
fall out as you go east.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:41.690
But also, a lot of the
things-- the different lands

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.700
are quite literally represented.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:47.390
So the Red Waste
went from being kind

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:51.210
of reddish but mostly desert
to being properly red.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:53.786
And the Shadow went from
being darkish to being

00:29:53.786 --> 00:29:54.660
really close to that.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.290
We have like a dark purple
forest out in the bottom right,

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.550
in Ulthos.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.230
So this isn't supposed
to be literal.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.910
It's supposed to be an
impression of the world.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:05.999
So Valyria went
from, in these maps,

00:30:05.999 --> 00:30:07.790
I think it's just kind
of a peninsula which

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:08.865
is kind of green.

00:30:08.865 --> 00:30:10.239
And this is old Valyria.

00:30:10.239 --> 00:30:12.780
This is where the dragon empires
were and the Fall of Valyria

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.390
happened.

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:16.952
And so it was-- we
had the discussion.

00:30:16.952 --> 00:30:19.160
It's like, no, actually,
this place is still burning.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.640
The Smoking Sea is smoking.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.980
There are fires going on here.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.450
There are ruins.

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.669
And so that was basically,
there were these great emails

00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:29.710
that went back and forth.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.257
It was like, is
this burning enough?

00:30:31.257 --> 00:30:32.840
And do you want it
to be burning more?

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.923
It's like, yeah, add lava.

00:30:33.923 --> 00:30:37.420
Right, OK, we can
add lava to this.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.587
So when you look at the
actual maps the final maps--

00:30:39.587 --> 00:30:41.461
we don't have them here
today, unfortunately.

00:30:41.461 --> 00:30:43.670
But if you get a hold of
the actual books themselves,

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:45.169
and you go through,
and you say, oh,

00:30:45.169 --> 00:30:46.770
why is this
represented like this?

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.810
I can tell you, you
can see how kind

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.700
of geographic the
intermediate ones that

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.100
went to being much more
heightened, much more

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.320
fantastical in the
end version like this.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.483
That's all for a reason.

00:30:57.483 --> 00:30:57.983
Yeah.

00:30:57.983 --> 00:31:00.067
AUDIENCE: So were you working
on some theory about what

00:31:00.067 --> 00:31:01.275
actually happened to Valyria?

00:31:01.275 --> 00:31:03.040
I don't see a volcano in here.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.590
JONATHAN ROBERTS: There are a
couple of volcanoes in there.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:09.310
I didn't have an explanation
of the exact theory,

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:11.060
but a number of the
questions that I asked

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:15.424
had very clear answers, so
there is very clearly a theory.

00:31:15.424 --> 00:31:16.840
One interesting
thing that came up

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.250
was you see these very
straight lines up there?

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.790
These are the dragon roads.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:24.360
And so these are old
roads of Old Valyria that

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.630
are die straight because
they were created by dragons.

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:29.130
These are the
earth-moving equipment

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:30.384
of the Valyrian Empire.

00:31:30.384 --> 00:31:31.800
They could just
cut through hills.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.630
They could cut
through mountains.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:33.920
They would just go straight.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:34.580
So that's all emergent.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:35.920
It's like, oh, we'll make
them kind of wandery.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.490
And I got shouted
at, so they went back

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:38.406
to being die straight.

00:31:38.406 --> 00:31:41.030
So they're that straight
for a very good reason.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:42.860
But you also see that
some of these roads

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.320
actually go through
big chunks of water.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.129
And that's because that
section of Valyria has sunk.

00:31:48.129 --> 00:31:49.295
That used to be above water.

00:31:49.295 --> 00:31:50.506
It no longer is.

00:31:52.766 --> 00:31:54.890
Also, there are a bunch of
cities still represented

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:55.950
in Valyria.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:32:01.170
And a lot of the discussion
was, how ruined are these?

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:02.802
And in the final
maps, they ended up--

00:32:02.802 --> 00:32:05.260
there's actually an individual
drawing of every single city

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.680
in there, which
reflects to some extent

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.690
the extent of
ruination of that city.

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:11.410
So if you get
interested in Valyria,

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.230
you should definitely check
those out and figure out

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:14.855
which ones are more
ruined than others.

00:32:14.855 --> 00:32:17.012
AUDIENCE: The [INAUDIBLE]
actually sort of bothered

00:32:17.012 --> 00:32:18.428
me the first time
when I saw that.

00:32:18.428 --> 00:32:20.918
Everywhere else on the map,
you don't represent the roads

00:32:20.918 --> 00:32:23.980
at all or make them very,
very shadowy, very little.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.840
But here, they are
just like marks like

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.812
drawn with a pen on top.

00:32:27.812 --> 00:32:32.154
It's really inconsistent
with the rest of the map.

00:32:32.154 --> 00:32:34.070
JONATHAN ROBERTS: So
they get a little lighter

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:35.730
than this one in
the final version

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.290
but the dragon roads
were solid lines

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:41.409
because they were very important
geographic features to people

00:32:41.409 --> 00:32:42.700
who went there to look at them.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.241
So they were emphasized
for a reason.

00:32:47.147 --> 00:32:48.980
Some of the other roads
got bumped up a bit.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.870
Maybe they didn't get bumped
up quite enough in some places

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.703
because of the color
that was underneath it.

00:32:52.703 --> 00:32:56.420
So the Red Waste
got a lot redder.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:00.190
And then you can see-- so that's
the final version of the Bone

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:03.960
Mountains that I showed
in the animation before.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.640
And then we get to
the far, far east.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.850
So this is Asshai.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.050
So this is where
Melisandre comes from.

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.399
And you have the
Shadow Lands, a couple

00:33:12.399 --> 00:33:13.440
of other cities in there.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.140
A whole bunch of radioactive,
fluorescent pink ghost grass.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.140
The pink, again, was a color
that was specifically chosen.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.570
And then the deep, dark,
almost purple forests,

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:26.720
jungles of Ulthos, which is
definitely terra incognita.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.930
This is falling off
the edge of the map,

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:30.980
as far as the maesters
were concerned.

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.012
Other edits were less subtle.

00:33:38.012 --> 00:33:40.180
So in this case,
we have the Paps,

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:43.030
which is isles off the Fingers,
which ends up on the right,

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:45.020
before and after.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:49.700
This is my first ever
cartographic boob job.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.945
It's like, they're named
that way for a reason.

00:33:51.945 --> 00:33:53.090
It's like, oh, OK, right.

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:54.274
There we go.

00:33:57.256 --> 00:33:59.700
I can make the Paps Islands
a double-D. That's fine.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.690
There we go.

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:05.410
So yeah, it was a broad range
of comments that came back.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:06.868
And so basically,
what happened was

00:34:06.868 --> 00:34:09.400
you see all of these maps
that are lying around.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.840
And each of those came back with
just a snow of Post-it notes,

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.344
where the editors and
George had gone through,

00:34:15.344 --> 00:34:17.760
and they'd just added notes,
painstakingly, piece by piece

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.980
by piece by piece, going through
all the different things that

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.980
needed to be changed or
edited or moved around.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.896
So you can see on some
of these, they actually

00:34:23.896 --> 00:34:24.770
went on it with pen.

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.820
So you can see some of the
edits still remaining there.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.569
But my job doing this
was just to lay them

00:34:28.569 --> 00:34:31.858
across the floor of my
studio and start tearing off

00:34:31.858 --> 00:34:33.774
Post-it note by Post-it
note as the edits were

00:34:33.774 --> 00:34:34.832
made to the digital file.

00:34:34.832 --> 00:34:36.290
And then at the
end of day, we just

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:38.330
had this massive waste
bin of Post-it notes.

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:40.580
It was like,
excellent, we're good.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:44.090
Let's go on and
crack on from here.

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:46.909
So that was the total world map.

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:49.210
A lot of these dig into
much more focused maps.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:51.418
So this is going to be
looking at the Beyond the Wall

00:34:51.418 --> 00:34:54.560
map, which is sitting down here.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.390
So this is taking
it from line art

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:59.280
to throw you
parchment backgrounds,

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:03.520
time to throw in some sea on top
of it, putting in the forests,

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.020
playing around a
lot more with that,

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.880
and then finally
completely changing

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.530
the color at the last step.

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:11.740
We'll do that once more so you
can have a quick skim through.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:14.080
So you start off with
this parchment background

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.880
and then start throwing in
layers and layers of colors,

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.750
almost like watercolor.

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.930
You're building up very light
layers, one after the other

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.685
after the other, until you get
this kind of deep intensity

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:21.954
at the end of the day.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:29.440
Yeah, so now,
about those cities.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.290
The first thing, the
most important thing,

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:35.976
is to get the featured
locations right.

00:35:35.976 --> 00:35:38.350
You need to make sure that
the places the people's eye is

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:40.766
drawn on these maps, the actual
details that people really

00:35:40.766 --> 00:35:43.380
care about, are correct.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.160
So King's Landing, this was
the finished colored locations

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.590
in the first map that went back.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:51.711
We have the Red Keep
on the left there.

00:35:51.711 --> 00:35:53.960
Each of the buildings there,
each of the towers there,

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.626
reflects one of the
towers in the books.

00:35:55.626 --> 00:35:58.119
So you have the
Tower of the Hand.

00:35:58.119 --> 00:35:59.660
You have the White
Sword Tower, which

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.040
is where the Kingsguard live.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.150
You've got the Maiden's Sept.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:06.260
You've got the core keep itself,
and you've got this holdfast.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.250
And a bunch of others,
seven towers in total,

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:09.000
they're all there.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.330
The godswood is there.

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:11.812
You can see there's water
down there because there

00:36:11.812 --> 00:36:12.720
was a moat in there.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.386
So all that kind of
stuff got reflected.

00:36:14.386 --> 00:36:16.335
And this was what I said before.

00:36:16.335 --> 00:36:18.210
I couldn't find a floor
plan of the Red Keep,

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:19.668
so it's like, oh,
let's make it up.

00:36:19.668 --> 00:36:21.085
It'll be fine.

00:36:21.085 --> 00:36:22.580
There's the Great
Sept of Baelor.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:26.350
So that's where-- has
anybody not read the books

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.530
or seen the TV show?

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:30.070
Good.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:32.111
That's where Ned Stark
gets his head chopped off.

00:36:32.111 --> 00:36:36.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:38.235
There we go.

00:36:38.235 --> 00:36:38.860
It's Sean Bean.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.860
Everybody knows
he's going to die.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.780
The dragon pits on
the bottom right,

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.584
which I couldn't find
any reference for at all.

00:36:46.584 --> 00:36:49.250
And this was actually before the
first season, so it's like, oh.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:50.430
Maybe when the first
season comes out,

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.560
then oh, we actually have
a reflection of these.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.190
Maybe I should correct this
to be the view of that.

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.690
Yes.

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:57.231
AUDIENCE: The dragon
pit is very well

00:36:57.231 --> 00:37:00.670
described in the recent,
what was this, description

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:04.219
of the war that George wrote
between Greens and Blacks.

00:37:04.219 --> 00:37:05.135
JONATHAN ROBERTS: Yes.

00:37:05.135 --> 00:37:06.530
AUDIENCE: But it was
after you'd already drawn?

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:07.488
JONATHAN ROBERTS: Yeah.

00:37:07.488 --> 00:37:10.735
That came out well
after I did this.

00:37:10.735 --> 00:37:12.910
But then I was
made aware of this,

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:15.900
which is an amazing illustration
by one of my favorite artist,

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.540
Ted Nasmith, who's done a bunch
of Middle Earth stuff as well,

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:23.954
is a proper, solid, hard-core
go-to for fancy art.

00:37:23.954 --> 00:37:25.620
And he did this really
epic illustration

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.490
of the Red Keep, which is
totally different from mine

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.912
and really, really red.

00:37:30.912 --> 00:37:33.120
And it also has the Great
Sept of Baelor in the back.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.203
So the answer was like,
oh, we kind of like these,

00:37:35.203 --> 00:37:38.090
but could you make it
a lot more like this?

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:38.880
OK.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.000
And so I went back, and this is
now the same actual floor plan

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.235
layout as the keep
that he has there,

00:37:45.235 --> 00:37:47.570
as close as I could get it.

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.344
That really, really
intense, rich red

00:37:49.344 --> 00:37:50.510
works for his color palette.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.051
It didn't work at
all for these maps,

00:37:52.051 --> 00:37:54.150
so it's a much
lighter red, but still

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:58.180
actually red, rather
than gray stone.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.170
The Great Sept of Baelor got
completely redesigned as well,

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:03.190
and the dragon pit
stayed exactly the same

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.570
because there was still no
reference that anybody could

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:09.460
find for the dragon
pit at that point.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.675
Which led to an odd
thing because when

00:38:11.675 --> 00:38:14.050
you do something on these
maps, and then the maps go out,

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:16.716
and then suddenly you see things
running around on the internet,

00:38:16.716 --> 00:38:18.120
it was like, wait a minute.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.190
So I drew that in
like 10 minutes.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:22.210
It's a pretty quick
sketch for the dragon pit.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:23.668
And then somebody
went and built it

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:27.642
in "Minecraft," brick by brick.

00:38:27.642 --> 00:38:30.510
Huh.

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:34.080
Be careful what you pit
in these kind of things.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.941
And if you haven't done
it, Google Minecraft King's

00:38:36.941 --> 00:38:37.440
Landing.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.430
It will blow your mind.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:41.010
These guys have
just gone to town.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:41.785
It's astonishing.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.380
So a few more things
got thrown in here.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.830
So these are a few more full
resolution details here.

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.227
The Dragon Gates, this
now has the East Barracks

00:38:54.227 --> 00:38:55.060
got thrown in there.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.070
We started getting a bit more
detail from King's Landing.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.800
The original maps, if you look
in the books, of King's Landing

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.640
basically only have
three locations.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.490
They have the dragon pit,
they have the Sept of Baelor,

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:04.620
and they have the Red Keep.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.630
And now we have a
three-foot-wide poster

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.240
with three locations on it.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.220
So a bunch more stuff
got thrown in there.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.740
We now have the tourney
grounds are located out here

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:16.390
with all the bright pavilions,
where the jousting happens.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:18.010
We have the Iron Gate.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:21.457
Shae's manse gets featured here.

00:39:21.457 --> 00:39:23.540
In the books, she doesn't
live up at the Red Keep.

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.400
She actually gets put
way out in the city,

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:31.036
so she's not under the
eye of Tyrion's father.

00:39:31.036 --> 00:39:33.510
And lots and lots and
lots and lots and lots

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:35.380
and lots and lots
of little buildings.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:40.380
The one comment that
came back every time

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:43.390
was like, more buildings.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:45.120
Definitely needs more buildings.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.780
Like up to and including some
really interesting discussions,

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.580
which we're saying,
should there be

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.611
buildings outside the
walls of King's Landing?

00:39:53.611 --> 00:39:55.485
How many buildings should
there be out there?

00:39:55.485 --> 00:39:58.190
I mean, this is a city which
has been very, very recently

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:02.330
sieged and then
recently re-sieged.

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:06.372
Would you, as a
government, allow

00:40:06.372 --> 00:40:07.830
people to build
outside your walls?

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:10.780
Would you, as a people, want
to build outside the walls

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.840
when sieging is something
that's happening

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.060
on a fairly regular basis?

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.610
Would you, as a
government, allow

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:18.890
people to build right
inside the walls?

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:20.969
And the argument
was, well, actually,

00:40:20.969 --> 00:40:23.010
it's much cheaper to build
three walls than four,

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.046
so if you're building
a house, you're

00:40:24.046 --> 00:40:25.810
going to build it
against the wall anyway.

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:28.760
But those discussions
happened, went through,

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.320
and ended up directly
affecting how

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.640
the map ended up
getting created.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.134
So that's the final
version of King's Landing.

00:40:36.134 --> 00:40:38.050
You see the Red Keep
down at the bottom right.

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:39.020
You see the Sept of Baelor.

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.250
You can see the dragon pit.

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:43.010
There's also Tobho Mott's shop.

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:44.940
A bunch of other
stuff went into this,

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.320
to line that up with what's
going on in the books.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.320
There's even, at the bottom,
you can see the two watchtowers

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.950
at the mouth of
Blackwater Bay, which

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.980
is where Tyrion's
chain was built.

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.900
So you can actually see
precisely when in the books

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.610
these maps would represent
because some things have turned

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:02.312
up and some things have not.

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:06.380
This is a bit more of Braavos.

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.130
In Braavos, the buildings
are much bigger,

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:10.700
which was a complete lifesaver.

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.334
And also, it's flat.

00:41:13.334 --> 00:41:15.000
So we didn't have to
deal with questions

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.810
of like, how high do
the hills need to be.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.680
One of the things that took
a bunch of time was saying,

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.638
well, actually, the hills
should be much taller

00:41:20.638 --> 00:41:21.399
than they appear.

00:41:21.399 --> 00:41:23.440
And when you have that
many little houses, trying

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:27.620
to just raise that hill--
like, this isn't a 3D model.

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.110
This is a full-on
2D illustration.

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:32.962
Trying to make a hill
bigger is tricky.

00:41:32.962 --> 00:41:34.420
But we went back
and forth on that.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.260
And the hills got
to be this size.

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:41.000
I think there's still a few
that could go a lot higher.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.150
Braavos, on the other
hand, totally flat.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:47.760
Much, much simpler as a
piece of work to go after.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.270
And then you see all the canals.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:51.228
And in this case, it's
just all little bridges.

00:41:51.228 --> 00:41:53.580
There are so many
bridges in this city.

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.340
And then you get the
featured locations.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.800
We have the Arsenal of Braavos.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.800
We have the Chequy Port.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.540
We have the Canal of Heroes.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.500
And we have the
Sealord's Palace,

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:04.730
with an island behind it
which has a zoo on it,

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:07.010
which in an earlier version
of the map, the isle--

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:08.020
the zoo was not there.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.150
It got added by request.

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:10.670
So I'm intrigued
to find out what

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:14.840
that means for
"Winds of Winter."

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.230
And then we have
all the temples.

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:18.021
So we have the temple
of the Lord of Light.

00:42:18.021 --> 00:42:20.800
We have Isle of the Gods,
House of Black and White.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.460
My favorite comment that
I've had so far on these

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.610
was about a week ago, when
somebody looked at this

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:27.440
and said, the
colors of the doors

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.190
on the House of Black and
White are the wrong way round.

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:31.580
The black should be on
the left, and the white

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.538
should be on the right.

00:42:32.538 --> 00:42:34.720
You can see how small that is.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.220
I'm very glad somebody had that
amount of care and attention

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.460
to get them the right
way round and to comment

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.360
that I'd missed that
particular detail.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.630
And so that's the
final map of Braavos.

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:47.590
So that's the end of the talk.

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.757
Now we've got like eight
minutes left for questions.

00:42:49.757 --> 00:42:51.090
You can check out the full maps.

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:52.910
And they're all
on the table here,

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:54.944
but also you can go
and pick up the book.

00:42:54.944 --> 00:42:56.735
I'd assumed there would
be some here today.

00:42:56.735 --> 00:42:58.890
There was a complication,
so some of you

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:01.572
are definitely winning
these, I believe.

00:43:01.572 --> 00:43:03.030
There's a bunch
more stuff up here.

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:05.030
Website, I have
a website which I

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:07.400
have both these on, a bunch
of my other mapmaking work,

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.600
a load of tutorials up there.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.040
I learned this the long way.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.900
I'd like to help out
people by giving them

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:17.210
some tips and some YouTube
videos that go along with that

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:20.010
and then a couple of
social media things.

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:23.270
Google apparently decided that
my web page for this stuff

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:24.270
was fun and interesting.

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:27.040
So if anybody works at Google+
or had anything to do with that

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.460
classifier, thank you very much.

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:32.590
And I get 3,000 followers
a day, so cheers.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:34.190
And add my Twitter feed as well.

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:35.431
But thank you very much.

00:43:35.431 --> 00:43:41.814
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:41.814 --> 00:43:44.269
AUDIENCE: What about the
political boundaries,

00:43:44.269 --> 00:43:48.089
the borders of all the vassals?

00:43:48.089 --> 00:43:50.380
JONATHAN ROBERTS: So I think
that would be fascinating.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.431
I think it's tricky
to figure out.

00:43:52.431 --> 00:43:54.430
In Westeros, that would
probably work quite well

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:56.732
because you have clear
enough allegiances.

00:43:56.732 --> 00:43:59.190
In the case of the Free Cities,
that gets quite complicated

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:02.430
because there are--
what's really on the maps

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:04.510
is the big political
centers, but there's

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:07.790
so much more in
those grasslands.

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:10.761
Like the Disputed Lands is a
land of warring baron states,

00:44:10.761 --> 00:44:11.260
I believe.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:14.930
So it doesn't get represented
in full detail here.

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:18.445
But yeah, a political map of
Westeros would be fascinating.

00:44:18.445 --> 00:44:19.945
I think people have
done a few shots

00:44:19.945 --> 00:44:23.420
at that in kind of the
style of the HBO map,

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.560
where they colored blocks
of it like a Risk map

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:26.820
to say who's controlling
what and where.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.361
But that's a really
good dynamic map.

00:44:28.361 --> 00:44:30.350
That should be like
taking one of these,

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:33.330
throwing it up on a nice,
slippy Google Maps layer,

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:35.650
putting a polygon
there on top of that.

00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:37.935
More than happy to work
on any of the JavaScript

00:44:37.935 --> 00:44:39.435
that needs to go
into that because I

00:44:39.435 --> 00:44:42.312
would love to see that happen.

00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:45.080
AUDIENCE: What
projection do these use?

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.554
Is the world spherical?

00:44:46.554 --> 00:44:47.470
JONATHAN ROBERTS: Yes.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:48.410
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.910
Thanks.

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:50.535
JONATHAN ROBERTS:
Yes, it is spherical.

00:44:50.535 --> 00:44:54.480
And there is no defined
projection for these.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.020
One thing that the really
careful observer will notice

00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:00.330
is that there are compass
roses and lines on these ones.

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.777
They disappear from
the finals [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:02.777 --> 00:45:04.860
These are not-- there's
no mathematical projection

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.810
for these maps.

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:07.636
Yes.

00:45:07.636 --> 00:45:12.820
AUDIENCE: So the show's showing
Braavos I think next week.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.682
Do you know if those people who
work on [INAUDIBLE] of the show

00:45:15.682 --> 00:45:18.184
reference your maps,
or if they're just

00:45:18.184 --> 00:45:19.100
doing their own thing?

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.516
JONATHAN ROBERTS: I do know
that the books and the TV show

00:45:21.516 --> 00:45:23.330
are quite distinct properties.

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:26.390
So for example, when I asked
the question, the two Red Keeps.

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:28.140
There's one which is
drawn by Ted Nasmith,

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:28.880
and there's one that
appears in the show,

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:29.990
and they look
completely different.

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:31.070
Which should I go with?

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:33.670
And I was quite clearly told,
go with the Ted Nasmith one.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:36.320
That's what it looks like.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.580
So yeah, I would expect it's
going to be quite different.

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.420
I know that the
Titan is different

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:45.280
because it turns out he
doesn't have a spear.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.741
But that was something which
I had failed to find anywhere

00:45:47.741 --> 00:45:49.990
in the books, and we checked
and didn't find anything.

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:52.710
So I think he has a sword
in the HBO show, though.

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.180
It'll be different,
but I'm going

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.130
to be looking quite carefully.

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:55.905
It's like, oh.

00:45:55.905 --> 00:45:58.500
How close did they go?

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.150
AUDIENCE: So tricky question.

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.480
Greywater Watch is
a castle that moves.

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:05.945
Do you have any idea of
the range [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:05.945 --> 00:46:08.420
that it exists in,
or a spatial plane?

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.490
JONATHAN ROBERTS: Yeah,
I don't know that one.

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:12.292
That one I left
well out of this.

00:46:15.659 --> 00:46:17.990
AUDIENCE: Do you ever
come across-- you

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:20.010
know how the age of
heroes, they had that lamp

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.690
where supposedly the
First Men crossed.

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:25.000
Did you have to take that into
account when mapping it out,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.270
what the maesters
of the Citadel would

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:29.976
have thought it would have
been, or what the remnants of it

00:46:29.976 --> 00:46:30.160
would have been?

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.790
JONATHAN ROBERTS: So
that one didn't come in,

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:33.920
but I'm pretty sure-- well,
my guess would be it's

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.950
related to the Stepstones,
which comes across

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:38.911
at the very bottom
edge of there.

00:46:38.911 --> 00:46:40.869
AUDIENCE: When you were
going through the books

00:46:40.869 --> 00:46:46.060
and breaking down in relation
to each city and location

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.940
in relation to one another,
did you find any contradictions

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:51.780
that just-- the way in
which they mapped out

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.760
in the narrative
wouldn't work when

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.480
you were translating to the map?

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.965
And how did you
sort of negotiate

00:46:57.965 --> 00:47:00.857
any of that to try and
actually have it work?

00:47:00.857 --> 00:47:03.190
JONATHAN ROBERTS: There was
one tricky piece in Braavos,

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:08.610
where there was something that
just wouldn't quite work out.

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:12.390
I think I shouldn't go into
any more detail-- well, yeah.

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:15.020
There was a very detailed
conversation there

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:16.050
basically about it.

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:18.750
AUDIENCE: --itself, or maybe you
have two different characters

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:21.710
going to the same location, and
the way in which they describe

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:25.677
navigating it, it actually
makes it two different places.

00:47:25.677 --> 00:47:27.260
JONATHAN ROBERTS:
So in Braavos, there

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.093
were-- there's lot of
different descriptions

00:47:29.093 --> 00:47:30.305
and lots of different places.

00:47:30.305 --> 00:47:32.180
But it turns out that
it was all loose enough

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:34.496
that it was possible to find
a consistent way of placing

00:47:34.496 --> 00:47:34.996
everything.

00:47:34.996 --> 00:47:35.614
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:35.614 --> 00:47:38.030
JONATHAN ROBERTS: And all of
that got very, very carefully

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:40.384
cleared because, obviously,
that makes a difference,

00:47:40.384 --> 00:47:42.800
and there was a bunch of Braavos
stuff I had not seen yet.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.431
AUDIENCE: So you do have
to take a little bit

00:47:44.431 --> 00:47:45.470
of creative liberty.

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:46.150
JONATHAN ROBERTS:
For Braavos, yeah.

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:48.660
Everything else was actually
really precisely mapped out.

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:49.900
Braavos was the one
case where there

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.275
were a lot of locations that
were mentioned that actually

00:47:52.275 --> 00:47:54.321
hadn't turned up
in the sketch yet.

00:47:54.321 --> 00:47:55.855
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:55.855 --> 00:47:57.396
AUDIENCE: Is Martin
now going to have

00:47:57.396 --> 00:47:59.642
to write the books to be
consistent with your maps?

00:47:59.642 --> 00:48:02.010
JONATHAN ROBERTS: No.

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:02.850
Absolutely not.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:05.339
And part of that
is because-- this

00:48:05.339 --> 00:48:07.380
is part of the reason for
the projection question

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.379
and part of the reason
for a lot of these things

00:48:09.379 --> 00:48:11.400
is that this, these
are all supposed

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.980
to be not even factual in
a fantasy world, factual.

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.473
These are all loose
representations.

00:48:17.473 --> 00:48:19.400
If you look at historical
maps from people

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.900
who had the same
kind of technology,

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:24.610
they were wildly different
between one map or another.

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:27.170
This is definitely
supposed to reflect

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:28.880
that kind of map of the world.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.338
When you go to the
far east, you've

00:48:30.338 --> 00:48:32.552
got things like City
of the Bloodless Men.

00:48:32.552 --> 00:48:34.990
Who the hell knows what that is?

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:36.930
But that is the
whole sense of these.

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:39.860
There's a bunch of this which
is just very, very unknown

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.652
and, yeah.

00:48:41.652 --> 00:48:43.360
These aren't supposed
to be fundamentally

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.940
accurate in the long term.

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:46.420
And particularly, when
you look at the far east,

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.656
there's a big difference
between how the far east

00:48:47.656 --> 00:48:50.110
was represented in these maps
and how they're represented

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:51.900
by any of the maps
that come out of HBO.

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.125
It's a completely
different land structure.

00:48:54.125 --> 00:48:56.500
The seas are in different
places, all that kind of stuff.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.041
Totally consistent with how we
look at our own medieval maps.

00:48:59.041 --> 00:49:03.860
The differences of that scale
were common and ever-present.

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:08.157
AUDIENCE: How do you decide
on the shape of coastlines?

00:49:08.157 --> 00:49:10.073
JONATHAN ROBERTS: The
shapes of the coastlines

00:49:10.073 --> 00:49:11.810
were actually really
carefully laid out already.

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:13.080
I mean, they were
smooth pencil lines,

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.371
so they were just broken up
and made a bit more jagged.

00:49:15.371 --> 00:49:18.540
But there are descriptions
down to the individual cliffs

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.185
as to what they are, what they
look like, how jagged they are.

00:49:21.185 --> 00:49:22.560
I got notes back
saying, oh, this

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.870
should be much more like small
islets and islands coming off

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:26.370
here.

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:27.703
This should be much more jagged.

00:49:27.703 --> 00:49:29.490
This is a coastline
you can't land in.

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:30.562
This is smoother.

00:49:30.562 --> 00:49:31.270
This has a beach.

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:32.910
That beach should be this color.

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:36.080
We're talking like super
granular responses.

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.991
So I did the closest I
could get with those notes

00:49:38.991 --> 00:49:41.240
I had, and then we went
through iterations, going back

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.950
and forth on those kind
of levels of detail.

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:46.220
Down to the point where
in the final maps,

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:48.990
there's five different
distinct color and styles

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:51.882
for farmland across
the world map.

00:49:51.882 --> 00:49:54.340
It's going to be hard to spot
if you don't know it's there,

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:57.910
but there are specifically five
different layers of farmland.

00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:59.920
So in this world
here, I think, it's

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.497
classified A, B, C,
D, and E. And so those

00:50:02.497 --> 00:50:04.580
were all specifically
different types of farmland,

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:07.080
to get an idea of the different
arable land around the world.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.590
When you get that
level of feedback,

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:12.090
your job gets really easy.

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:15.978
AUDIENCE: So what part of
this-- I'm just wondering,

00:50:15.978 --> 00:50:18.408
is there a particular part
where it took a very long time,

00:50:18.408 --> 00:50:21.201
collaborating between you and
the editors and George R. R.

00:50:21.201 --> 00:50:23.268
Martin to actually
agree on how to do it,

00:50:23.268 --> 00:50:25.452
as opposed to being put
together, and how it worked?

00:50:25.452 --> 00:50:26.660
JONATHAN ROBERTS: Not really.

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:30.152
I think from my perspective,
it's impossible to tell,

00:50:30.152 --> 00:50:31.860
like the round trip
time for that message

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:34.390
was due to at any point.

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:36.250
The editors were all
working very hard.

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:38.250
They passed things
on to George when

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:40.520
it needed to be something
that he decided on.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.230
And then he went through
this in great detail

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:45.290
a couple of times
through the process

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:48.001
to get very granular feedback.

00:50:48.001 --> 00:50:48.500
Yeah.

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.690
Any big project with any
large group of people,

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:53.410
you get some mental lag
in there for all sorts

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:54.640
of different reasons.

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.880
Definitely not unexpected.

00:51:00.064 --> 00:51:04.894
AUDIENCE: So the Green Fork of
the Trident flows from the neck

00:51:04.894 --> 00:51:14.010
to between a whole lot of hills,
down into the Bay of Crabs.

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:14.912
Is that downhill?

00:51:14.912 --> 00:51:16.120
JONATHAN ROBERTS: Yes, it is.

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.050
And so--

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:20.459
AUDIENCE: It just doesn't look--
it never looks downhill to me.

00:51:20.459 --> 00:51:22.407
It goes between these
enormous mountain ranges

00:51:22.407 --> 00:51:23.910
but doesn't have
any mountains on it.

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:24.705
JONATHAN ROBERTS: If
the north is uphill

00:51:24.705 --> 00:51:25.962
and the south is-- [LAUGHS]

00:51:25.962 --> 00:51:27.670
AUDIENCE: So it's
Coriolis effect, right?

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:28.586
JONATHAN ROBERTS: Nah.

00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:31.740
Yes.

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:33.740
In that case, there are
some hills on that side,

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.500
but yeah, it is
higher up at the top.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.700
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
all we have time for.

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.800
We're going to lose the
room in a few minutes.

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.300
So--

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:40.650
[APPLAUSE]
