closer approximation to truth and out of
 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.979
closer approximation to truth and out of
a closer approximation to truth came

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989

in science and technology there's

in science and technology there's
 

00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:59.880
in science and technology there's
another difference and it's a difference

about it was asked of my daughter as we
 

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:58.380
about it was asked of my daughter as we
sat at a dinner in Washington I asked my

today it is unlikely he said and I think

today it is unlikely he said and I think
 

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:25.890
today it is unlikely he said and I think
he was right that we have reached some

we do that seems natural to us that will

don't know what the answer to that is

don't know what the answer to that is
 

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:47.040
don't know what the answer to that is
perhaps it is aspects of the way we
