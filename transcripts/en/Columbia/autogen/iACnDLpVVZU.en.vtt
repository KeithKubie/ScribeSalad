00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.310
or lack of education and either the
commission of terrorist acts or societal

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:35.320
commission of terrorist acts or societal
 

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.739
commission of terrorist acts or societal
support for terrorist acts and that's

00:29:37.739 --> 00:29:37.749
support for terrorist acts and that's
 

00:29:37.749 --> 00:29:38.940
support for terrorist acts and that's
really significant because that means

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:38.950
really significant because that means
 

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:40.859
really significant because that means
that terrorism is caused by factors that

00:29:40.859 --> 00:29:40.869
that terrorism is caused by factors that
 

00:29:40.869 --> 00:29:42.450
that terrorism is caused by factors that
are different from the causes of other

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:42.460
are different from the causes of other
 

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.669

Oxford University who's an economist did
research at the World Bank that

research at the World Bank that
 

00:29:49.179 --> 00:29:50.999
research at the World Bank that
demonstrated that political violence in

00:29:50.999 --> 00:29:51.009
demonstrated that political violence in
 

00:29:51.009 --> 00:29:53.369
demonstrated that political violence in
society civil war is correlated with

00:29:53.369 --> 00:29:53.379
society civil war is correlated with
 

00:29:53.379 --> 00:29:55.409
society civil war is correlated with
economic inequality but acts of

00:29:55.409 --> 00:29:55.419
economic inequality but acts of
 

00:29:55.419 --> 00:29:57.299
economic inequality but acts of
terrorism and support for terrorism do

00:29:57.299 --> 00:29:57.309
terrorism and support for terrorism do
 

00:29:57.309 --> 00:29:58.970
terrorism and support for terrorism do
not seem to be correlated with economic

00:29:58.970 --> 00:29:58.980
not seem to be correlated with economic
 

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:02.279
not seem to be correlated with economic
inequality so what does cause terrorism

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:02.289
inequality so what does cause terrorism
 

00:30:02.289 --> 00:30:05.129
inequality so what does cause terrorism
well scholars tend to divide the

00:30:05.129 --> 00:30:05.139
well scholars tend to divide the
 

00:30:05.139 --> 00:30:07.980
well scholars tend to divide the
societal level from the leader level and

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:07.990
societal level from the leader level and
 

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:09.869
societal level from the leader level and
so what do we know about the societal

00:30:09.869 --> 00:30:09.879
so what do we know about the societal
 

00:30:09.879 --> 00:30:11.850
so what do we know about the societal
level if you think about it the people

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:11.860
level if you think about it the people
 

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.859
level if you think about it the people
who commit and support acts of terrorism

00:30:13.859 --> 00:30:13.869
who commit and support acts of terrorism
 

00:30:13.869 --> 00:30:15.720
who commit and support acts of terrorism
are really different from each other

than the foot soldiers and then they're
 

00:30:23.259 --> 00:30:25.320
than the foot soldiers and then they're
the citizens who tolerate terrorism and

the citizens who tolerate terrorism and
 

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:27.660

overwhelming evidence again from Kruger
that societies that spawned terrorism

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:36.190
that societies that spawned terrorism
 

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.460
that societies that spawned terrorism
societies where the population seems to

societies where the population seems to
 

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.860

the government suffer from political

the government suffer from political

inequality and a lack of political
 

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.490
inequality and a lack of political
opportunity so acts of terrorism don't

and the lack of political opportunity
the majority of terrorist acts appear to

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:01.390
the majority of terrorist acts appear to
 

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:03.030
the majority of terrorist acts appear to
be committed by people who believe that

they live in a politically unjust

they live in a politically unjust
society where they have no chance to

make a difference through nonviolent
action so that's the first thing we know

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520
action so that's the first thing we know
 

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.740
action so that's the first thing we know
the second thing we know is that the

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:13.750
the second thing we know is that the
 

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:17.370
the second thing we know is that the
vast majority of terrorism is local so

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:17.380
vast majority of terrorism is local so
 

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.050
vast majority of terrorism is local so

al-qaeda attacks that followed in
 

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.580
al-qaeda attacks that followed in
various places around the world were

various places around the world were
 

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.620
various places around the world were
rare in not being carried out in the

rare in not being carried out in the
 

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.150
rare in not being carried out in the

Crenshaw had been talking about that

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:35.100
Crenshaw had been talking about that
 

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.050
Crenshaw had been talking about that
even before the al-qaeda attacks

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:37.060
even before the al-qaeda attacks
 

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.030

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:39.040
happened she's a Stanford professor now
 

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.560
happened she's a Stanford professor now
who's been writing on terrorism since

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:40.570
who's been writing on terrorism since
 

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:43.290
who's been writing on terrorism since
1972 but now others have started

demonstrating that fact with cross

national data and so again Krueger

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:47.250
national data and so again Krueger
 

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:49.470
national data and so again Krueger
demonstrated that ninety percent of

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:49.480
demonstrated that ninety percent of
 

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.750
demonstrated that ninety percent of
terrorist attacks have occurred in the

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760
terrorist attacks have occurred in the
 

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.330
terrorist attacks have occurred in the
country where the perpetrator lives

ninety percent well what does this mean

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:57.790
ninety percent well what does this mean
 

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.880
ninety percent well what does this mean
how can we explain September 11th in

00:31:59.880 --> 00:31:59.890
how can we explain September 11th in
 

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:01.920
how can we explain September 11th in
al-qaeda it may mean that the real

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:01.930
al-qaeda it may mean that the real
 

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.950
al-qaeda it may mean that the real
target was their home countries those

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960
target was their home countries those
 

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.420
target was their home countries those
were countries who were allied with the

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:06.430
were countries who were allied with the
 

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.910
were countries who were allied with the
United States but the societies were so

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:08.920
United States but the societies were so
 

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.310
United States but the societies were so
closed and so repressive and such police

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:11.320
closed and so repressive and such police
 

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.440
closed and so repressive and such police
states that there was no way for them to

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:13.450
states that there was no way for them to
 

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:15.570
states that there was no way for them to
reasonably get away with the terrorist

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:15.580
reasonably get away with the terrorist
 

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.820
reasonably get away with the terrorist
attack in those societies and so it may

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:17.830
attack in those societies and so it may
 

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:19.590
attack in those societies and so it may
have been easier to attack the United

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600
have been easier to attack the United
 

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.870
have been easier to attack the United
States as an open society and as an ally

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880
States as an open society and as an ally
 

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.730
States as an open society and as an ally
of those societies rather than

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:23.740
of those societies rather than
 

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.500
of those societies rather than
committing the acts at home and Martha

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:25.510
committing the acts at home and Martha
 

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.000

Crenshaw was again the first person to

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.010
Crenshaw was again the first person to
 

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:29.730
Crenshaw was again the first person to
make that argument so that's a second

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:29.740
make that argument so that's a second
 

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.230
make that argument so that's a second
thing that we know that most terrorism

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240
thing that we know that most terrorism
 

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.440
thing that we know that most terrorism
is local a third argument that has

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:34.450
is local a third argument that has
 

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:36.480
is local a third argument that has
provoked some controversy but that seems

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:36.490
provoked some controversy but that seems
 

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:38.070
provoked some controversy but that seems
to have a fair amount of truth behind it

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080
to have a fair amount of truth behind it
 

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.060
to have a fair amount of truth behind it
is that terrorism may

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:40.070
is that terrorism may
 

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.200
is that terrorism may
be in rien relation in reaction to what

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:44.210
be in rien relation in reaction to what
 

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.810
be in rien relation in reaction to what
is perceived as a foreign occupation if

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:46.820
is perceived as a foreign occupation if
 

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.240
is perceived as a foreign occupation if
this is true what matters is not having

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:49.250
this is true what matters is not having
 

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.160
this is true what matters is not having
alliances with particular countries per

se but having a military presence abroad
 

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.960
se but having a military presence abroad
that's associated with those alliances

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:54.970
that's associated with those alliances
 

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:57.340
that's associated with those alliances
so the argument here is that the US

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:57.350
so the argument here is that the US
 

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.320
so the argument here is that the US
bases in Saudi Arabia at the time of the

00:32:59.320 --> 00:32:59.330
bases in Saudi Arabia at the time of the
 

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.300
bases in Saudi Arabia at the time of the
September 11th attacks meant that the

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:01.310
September 11th attacks meant that the
 

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.600
September 11th attacks meant that the
infidels were in Mecca and Medina and

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:03.610
infidels were in Mecca and Medina and
 

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:06.550
infidels were in Mecca and Medina and
from this point the United States kept

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:06.560
from this point the United States kept
 

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.500
from this point the United States kept
on making things worse by sending large

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:08.510
on making things worse by sending large
 

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.150
on making things worse by sending large
numbers of ground troops into Iraq and

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:10.160
numbers of ground troops into Iraq and
 

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.130
numbers of ground troops into Iraq and
Afghanistan where they were perceived as

Afghanistan where they were perceived as
 

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.710
Afghanistan where they were perceived as
occupiers and this argument is most

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720
occupiers and this argument is most
 

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.870

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:36.800
groups they're not comparing terrorist
groups with something else with some

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:36.810
groups with something else with some
 

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:39.950
groups with something else with some
other type of political action for

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:39.960
other type of political action for
 

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.750
other type of political action for
example this is a little bit like trying

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760
example this is a little bit like trying
 

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:45.260
example this is a little bit like trying
to decide if a drug is effective in a

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:45.270
to decide if a drug is effective in a
 

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:46.790
to decide if a drug is effective in a
medical study when you're giving

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800
medical study when you're giving
 

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.930
medical study when you're giving
everybody the drug and you're not

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:47.940
everybody the drug and you're not
 

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.640
everybody the drug and you're not
looking at a comparison category or a

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:49.650
looking at a comparison category or a
 

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:51.350
looking at a comparison category or a
control group so there should have a

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:51.360
control group so there should have a
 

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.720
control group so there should have a
basic problem and a basic inability to

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:53.730
basic problem and a basic inability to
 

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:56.690
basic problem and a basic inability to
answer some of our most basic questions

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:56.700
answer some of our most basic questions
 

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.910
answer some of our most basic questions
about effectiveness and so what I'm

00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920
about effectiveness and so what I'm
 

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.070
about effectiveness and so what I'm
trying to do in this project is to look

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:01.080
trying to do in this project is to look
 

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:04.520
trying to do in this project is to look
at civil wars as a set of cases where

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:04.530
at civil wars as a set of cases where
 

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:06.110
at civil wars as a set of cases where
there's a relatively comparable

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:06.120
there's a relatively comparable
 

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.300
there's a relatively comparable
population there are rebel groups in all

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:08.310
population there are rebel groups in all
 

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:10.250
population there are rebel groups in all
of these wars they're all organized they

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:10.260
of these wars they're all organized they
 

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.810
of these wars they're all organized they
all have a political grievance against

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:11.820
all have a political grievance against
 

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.900
all have a political grievance against
the state and some of them use terrorism

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:14.910
the state and some of them use terrorism
 

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:16.550
the state and some of them use terrorism
and some of them Josh and so we can

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560
and some of them Josh and so we can
 

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.680
and some of them Josh and so we can
compare the outcomes of four groups who

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:18.690
compare the outcomes of four groups who
 

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:20.960
compare the outcomes of four groups who
use terrorism and groups that junk and

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:20.970
use terrorism and groups that junk and
 

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:22.160
use terrorism and groups that junk and
so that's kind of what I'm trying to do

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:22.170
so that's kind of what I'm trying to do
 

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:23.840
so that's kind of what I'm trying to do
in this larger project and i'll talk

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:23.850
in this larger project and i'll talk
 

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:27.530
in this larger project and i'll talk
about one piece of it today and so

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:27.540
about one piece of it today and so
 

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.810
about one piece of it today and so
defining terrorism for the purposes of

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:29.820
defining terrorism for the purposes of
 

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.810
defining terrorism for the purposes of
this project i'm defining terrorism

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:31.820
this project i'm defining terrorism
 

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.490
this project i'm defining terrorism
fairly narrowly so this is a definition

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:34.500
fairly narrowly so this is a definition
 

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.730
fairly narrowly so this is a definition
that fits within the definition that Kim

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:36.740
that fits within the definition that Kim
 

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:39.500
that fits within the definition that Kim
just gave us but it's a little bit

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:39.510
just gave us but it's a little bit
 

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:42.200
just gave us but it's a little bit
narrower because all rebel groups are

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:42.210
narrower because all rebel groups are
 

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:44.570
narrower because all rebel groups are
using political using violence for

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:44.580
using political using violence for
 

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:46.160
using political using violence for
political ends and it turns out the

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:46.170
political ends and it turns out the
 

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:48.620
political ends and it turns out the
studies of violence against civilians in

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:48.630
studies of violence against civilians in
 

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:51.500
studies of violence against civilians in
civil wars suggest that almost all

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:51.510
civil wars suggest that almost all
 

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:53.990
civil wars suggest that almost all
virtually all rebel groups target

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000
virtually all rebel groups target
 

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.850
virtually all rebel groups target
civilians in some way so I want to look

00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:55.860
civilians in some way so I want to look
 

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:58.270
civilians in some way so I want to look
at a specific type of targeting of

00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:58.280
at a specific type of targeting of
 

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:01.490
at a specific type of targeting of
civilians and that's a symbolic and

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:01.500
civilians and that's a symbolic and
 

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.720
civilians and that's a symbolic and
indiscriminate violence against

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:02.730
indiscriminate violence against
 

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:05.230
indiscriminate violence against
civilians and by symbolic I'm using them

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240
civilians and by symbolic I'm using them
 

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.550
civilians and by symbolic I'm using them
this is sort of from the terrorism

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560
this is sort of from the terrorism
 

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.440
this is sort of from the terrorism
literature what that means is that the

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:09.450
literature what that means is that the
 

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:12.350
literature what that means is that the
audience of the violence is somebody

00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:12.360
audience of the violence is somebody
 

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.300
audience of the violence is somebody
other than the target of the violence so

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:14.310
other than the target of the violence so
 

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:16.670
other than the target of the violence so
groups are targeting civilians generally

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680
groups are targeting civilians generally
 

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.350
groups are targeting civilians generally
in order to put pressure on a government

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:18.360
in order to put pressure on a government
 

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:21.290
in order to put pressure on a government
not to put pressure on those civilians

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:21.300
not to put pressure on those civilians
 

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:25.400
not to put pressure on those civilians
per se so this distinguishes this type

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:25.410
per se so this distinguishes this type
 

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:27.680
per se so this distinguishes this type
of violence against civilians from for

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:27.690
of violence against civilians from for
 

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:29.600
of violence against civilians from for
example ethnic cleansing where you're

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:29.610
example ethnic cleansing where you're
 

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:31.100
example ethnic cleansing where you're
targeting people to try to get them to

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:31.110
targeting people to try to get them to
 

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:32.870
targeting people to try to get them to
get up and move out of territory that

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880
get up and move out of territory that
 

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.390
get up and move out of territory that
you want or the most common most

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400
you want or the most common most
 

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:38.030
you want or the most common most
ubiquitous form of violence against

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040
ubiquitous form of violence against
 

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.190
ubiquitous form of violence against
civilians in civil wars is targeting

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200
civilians in civil wars is targeting
 

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.750
civilians in civil wars is targeting
individuals because you think that

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760
individuals because you think that
 

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:42.650
individuals because you think that
they're collaborating with the other

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:42.660
they're collaborating with the other
 

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:43.970
they're collaborating with the other
side or you want to deter them from

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:43.980
side or you want to deter them from
 

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:45.260
side or you want to deter them from
doing so or you want to force them to

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:45.270
doing so or you want to force them to
 

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:46.820
doing so or you want to force them to
collaborate with your own side that

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:46.830
collaborate with your own side that
 

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:48.950
collaborate with your own side that
happens in ninety-nine point nine nine

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960
happens in ninety-nine point nine nine
 

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.320
happens in ninety-nine point nine nine
percent of all civil wars and so in

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:51.330
percent of all civil wars and so in
 

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:54.650
percent of all civil wars and so in
order to distinguish rebel groups that

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:54.660
order to distinguish rebel groups that
 

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:55.940
order to distinguish rebel groups that
use terrorism from those that don't I

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:55.950
use terrorism from those that don't I
 

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:56.840
use terrorism from those that don't I
don't want to use such a broad

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:56.850
don't want to use such a broad
 

00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:58.640
don't want to use such a broad
definition that I'm capturing everybody

00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:58.650
definition that I'm capturing everybody
 

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:00.710
definition that I'm capturing everybody
and so I want to use this more specific

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720
and so I want to use this more specific
 

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.680
and so I want to use this more specific
type of terrorism so more concretely

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:03.690
type of terrorism so more concretely
 

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:05.630
type of terrorism so more concretely
what do I mean by terrorism are

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640
what do I mean by terrorism are
 

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.820
what do I mean by terrorism are
terrorists rebel groups I mean groups

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:07.830
terrorists rebel groups I mean groups
 

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:09.470
terrorists rebel groups I mean groups
that use a sustained and deliberate use

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480
that use a sustained and deliberate use
 

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:13.280
that use a sustained and deliberate use
of small-scale bombs Karan bus bombs IED

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:13.290
of small-scale bombs Karan bus bombs IED
 

00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:15.980
of small-scale bombs Karan bus bombs IED
suicide bombs to attack public civilian

00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:15.990
suicide bombs to attack public civilian
 

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:18.560
suicide bombs to attack public civilian
places restaurants bombs markets etc and

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:18.570
places restaurants bombs markets etc and
 

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.690
places restaurants bombs markets etc and
so that's Fitz fairly well with what we

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:20.700
so that's Fitz fairly well with what we
 

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:22.070
so that's Fitz fairly well with what we
think I've sort of intuitively as a

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:22.080
think I've sort of intuitively as a
 

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.350
think I've sort of intuitively as a
terrorist attack and if you look at the

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:24.360
terrorist attack and if you look at the
 

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.960
terrorist attack and if you look at the
set of rebel groups that show up as

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:26.970
set of rebel groups that show up as
 

00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:29.780
set of rebel groups that show up as
terrorists if you you as if you use this

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:29.790
terrorists if you you as if you use this
 

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:32.090
terrorists if you you as if you use this
definition and this measurement it fits

00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:32.100
definition and this measurement it fits
 

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:33.350
definition and this measurement it fits
pretty well with the groups that we

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:33.360
pretty well with the groups that we
 

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.180
pretty well with the groups that we
think of as terrorists rebel groups and

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:35.190
think of as terrorists rebel groups and
 

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:37.130
think of as terrorists rebel groups and
some of the examples are there on the

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.140
some of the examples are there on the
 

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:41.890
some of the examples are there on the
screen and in terms of thinking about

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:41.900
screen and in terms of thinking about
 

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:44.270
screen and in terms of thinking about
effectiveness or winning what what do we

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.280
effectiveness or winning what what do we
 

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.880
effectiveness or winning what what do we
mean by that and a lot of the debate

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:46.890
mean by that and a lot of the debate
 

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:48.350
mean by that and a lot of the debate
about effectiveness has sort of gotten

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:48.360
about effectiveness has sort of gotten
 

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.880
about effectiveness has sort of gotten
into a little bit of a quagmire over

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:49.890
into a little bit of a quagmire over
 

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:51.710
into a little bit of a quagmire over
what counts as success and what counts

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720
what counts as success and what counts
 

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.720
what counts as success and what counts
as failure and I think we can get a rat

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:53.730
as failure and I think we can get a rat
 

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:56.330
as failure and I think we can get a rat
away from some of that craig peyer by

00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:56.340
away from some of that craig peyer by
 

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.280
away from some of that craig peyer by
thinking of this as a continuum and the

00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:58.290
thinking of this as a continuum and the
 

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:01.010
thinking of this as a continuum and the
two endpoints of the continuum are

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:01.020
two endpoints of the continuum are
 

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.800
two endpoints of the continuum are
pretty straightforward it's obviously

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:02.810
pretty straightforward it's obviously
 

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:04.820
pretty straightforward it's obviously
rebel groups you know what they really

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:04.830
rebel groups you know what they really
 

00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:06.160
rebel groups you know what they really
want is to win out

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:06.170
want is to win out
 

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:08.170
want is to win out
through a military victory and what they

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:08.180
through a military victory and what they
 

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:09.730
through a military victory and what they
least want is for the government to

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:09.740
least want is for the government to
 

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:12.790
least want is for the government to
crush them through a military defeat and

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800
crush them through a military defeat and
 

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.740
crush them through a military defeat and
so those are pretty obvious I argue that

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:14.750
so those are pretty obvious I argue that
 

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:17.110
so those are pretty obvious I argue that
the sort of second best outcome from

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:17.120
the sort of second best outcome from
 

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:19.660
the sort of second best outcome from
rebel groups perspective is a negotiated

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:19.670
rebel groups perspective is a negotiated
 

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:21.520
rebel groups perspective is a negotiated
agreement so this means that the

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:21.530
agreement so this means that the
 

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:23.050
agreement so this means that the
government has recognized them as a

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:23.060
government has recognized them as a
 

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.030
government has recognized them as a
legitimate negotiating partner and there

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040
legitimate negotiating partner and there
 

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.230
legitimate negotiating partner and there
have been concessions on both sides

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240
have been concessions on both sides
 

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.970
have been concessions on both sides
generally altering the status quo so

00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:27.980
generally altering the status quo so
 

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.380
generally altering the status quo so
there are some political concessions to

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:29.390
there are some political concessions to
 

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:31.180
there are some political concessions to
the rebel group if there's a negotiated

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:31.190
the rebel group if there's a negotiated
 

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:34.750
the rebel group if there's a negotiated
agreement there's a kind of second worst

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:34.760
agreement there's a kind of second worst
 

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.310
agreement there's a kind of second worst
outcome from the rebels perspective

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:36.320
outcome from the rebels perspective
 

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.840
outcome from the rebels perspective
these are wars that in the data that I'm

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:37.850
these are wars that in the data that I'm
 

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:39.700
these are wars that in the data that I'm
looking at just kind of fizzle out so

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:39.710
looking at just kind of fizzle out so
 

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:41.050
looking at just kind of fizzle out so
the group still exists it hasn't been

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:41.060
the group still exists it hasn't been
 

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.820
the group still exists it hasn't been
eliminated outright otherwise it would

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:42.830
eliminated outright otherwise it would
 

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:44.620
eliminated outright otherwise it would
be coded as a military government

00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:44.630
be coded as a military government
 

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:46.180
be coded as a military government
military victory but these are groups

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:46.190
military victory but these are groups
 

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:47.890
military victory but these are groups
that have been causing a lot of trouble

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:47.900
that have been causing a lot of trouble
 

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.140
that have been causing a lot of trouble
in wars that have been killing over a

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:50.150
in wars that have been killing over a
 

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:51.640
in wars that have been killing over a
thousand people a year and now they've

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:51.650
thousand people a year and now they've
 

00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:53.200
thousand people a year and now they've
fizzled down to such a low level that

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:53.210
fizzled down to such a low level that
 

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:55.540
fizzled down to such a low level that
fewer than 25 people are dying a year

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:55.550
fewer than 25 people are dying a year
 

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:57.430
fewer than 25 people are dying a year
and often they're no deaths in these

00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440
and often they're no deaths in these
 

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.590
and often they're no deaths in these
cases but the group still exists and

00:50:59.590 --> 00:50:59.600
cases but the group still exists and
 

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.820
cases but the group still exists and
then in the middle I think about ongoing

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:00.830
then in the middle I think about ongoing
 

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:02.650
then in the middle I think about ongoing
conflict so these are groups that

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:02.660
conflict so these are groups that
 

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.380
conflict so these are groups that
continue to survive they haven't you

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:05.390
continue to survive they haven't you
 

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:06.880
continue to survive they haven't you
know so fizzled away or been defeated

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:06.890
know so fizzled away or been defeated
 

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:10.060
know so fizzled away or been defeated
but they have not yet achieved any of

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:10.070
but they have not yet achieved any of
 

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:11.500
but they have not yet achieved any of
their political go so they're sort of in

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:11.510
their political go so they're sort of in
 

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:16.450
their political go so they're sort of in
the middle of this spectrum and so so

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:16.460
the middle of this spectrum and so so
 

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:18.040
the middle of this spectrum and so so
what I'm trying to do in this project is

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:18.050
what I'm trying to do in this project is
 

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:20.530
what I'm trying to do in this project is
to compare rebel terrorist groups and

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:20.540
to compare rebel terrorist groups and
 

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:22.930
to compare rebel terrorist groups and
rebel mom terrorist groups and see how

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:22.940
rebel mom terrorist groups and see how
 

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.520
rebel mom terrorist groups and see how
they fare along this spectrum that's

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:24.530
they fare along this spectrum that's
 

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:28.620
they fare along this spectrum that's
kind of the basic idea so I argue that

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:28.630
kind of the basic idea so I argue that
 

00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:30.700
kind of the basic idea so I argue that
terrorists will generally be

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:30.710
terrorists will generally be
 

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:33.580
terrorists will generally be
unsuccessful they will rarely if ever

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:33.590
unsuccessful they will rarely if ever
 

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:36.130
unsuccessful they will rarely if ever
win outright because on balance

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:36.140
win outright because on balance
 

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.230
win outright because on balance
terrorism undermines military effective

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240
terrorism undermines military effective

terrorism undermines military effective

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920
terrorists Robo tactics and I'm not
 

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.740
terrorists Robo tactics and I'm not
going to go through all of the reasons

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:44.750
going to go through all of the reasons
 

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:46.000
going to go through all of the reasons
that I think this because I don't have

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:46.010
that I think this because I don't have
 

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:49.000
that I think this because I don't have
time but just to sort of skim over a few

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:49.010
time but just to sort of skim over a few
 

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.090
time but just to sort of skim over a few
of them terrorism is pretty much by

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:52.100
of them terrorism is pretty much by
 

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:54.370
of them terrorism is pretty much by
definition not useful for taking and

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:54.380

opponent's military capacity it is a

00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:58.130
opponent's military capacity it is a

opponent's military capacity it is a
low-cost way to inflict a lot of pain in

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:00.530
low-cost way to inflict a lot of pain in
 

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:02.500
low-cost way to inflict a lot of pain in
a war of attrition but it tends to

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:02.510
a war of attrition but it tends to
 

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:05.350
a war of attrition but it tends to
backfire and it can often be used as a

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:05.360
backfire and it can often be used as a
 

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.350
backfire and it can often be used as a
way to signaling resolve but it tends to

00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:08.360
way to signaling resolve but it tends to
 

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.300
way to signaling resolve but it tends to
signal weakness so it's not actually a

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:10.310
signal weakness so it's not actually a
 

00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:12.790
signal weakness so it's not actually a
credible signal of strength and resolve

00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:12.800
credible signal of strength and resolve

a sort of a catchword we talk about in

a sort of a catchword we talk about in

that the government will then repress

that the government will then repress

that the government will then repress

helps them that can work sometimes but
it can also end up just to find a

they're using or less likely if they're

using terrorism in part because it

governments are going to be less likely

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:54.080
governments are going to be less likely
 

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.780
governments are going to be less likely
to make political concessions to a group

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:55.790
to make political concessions to a group
 

00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:57.820
to make political concessions to a group
that is less militarily effective than

that is less militarily effective than
 

00:52:57.830 --> 00:52:59.530
that is less militarily effective than

one that is more militarily effective

commitment problems that makes

commitment problems that makes

terrorists we know that they break those
policies often but the fact that they

00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:13.820
policies often but the fact that they
 

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:15.010
policies often but the fact that they
have those policies and that rhetoric

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:15.020
have those policies and that rhetoric
 

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.270
have those policies and that rhetoric
makes it even harder for them to

00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:16.280
makes it even harder for them to
 

00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.220
makes it even harder for them to
negotiate with a rebel group that uses

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:18.230
negotiate with a rebel group that uses
 

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:20.980
negotiate with a rebel group that uses
terrorism than one fit doesn't on the

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:20.990
terrorism than one fit doesn't on the
 

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:22.930
terrorism than one fit doesn't on the
other hand I think that terrorism is

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:22.940
other hand I think that terrorism is
 

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.360
other hand I think that terrorism is
kind of good for organizational survival

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:25.370
kind of good for organizational survival
 

00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:27.580
kind of good for organizational survival
of rebel groups because Terrace rebels

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:27.590
of rebel groups because Terrace rebels
 

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:29.080
of rebel groups because Terrace rebels
are hard to defeat out right there

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:29.090
are hard to defeat out right there
 

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:31.410
are hard to defeat out right there
likely just to live a long time and

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:31.420
likely just to live a long time and
 

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:33.700
likely just to live a long time and
small organizations can continue to

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:33.710
small organizations can continue to
 

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:35.860
small organizations can continue to
inflict damage the kinds of spoiling and

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:35.870
inflict damage the kinds of spoiling and
 

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:37.930
inflict damage the kinds of spoiling and
outputting dynamics that Kim was talking

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:37.940
outputting dynamics that Kim was talking
 

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:40.380
outputting dynamics that Kim was talking
about tend to prolong conflicts and

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:40.390
about tend to prolong conflicts and
 

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:42.820
about tend to prolong conflicts and
counterterrorism often kind of flattens

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:42.830
counterterrorism often kind of flattens
 

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:45.160
counterterrorism often kind of flattens
out organizations and they and make them

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:45.170
out organizations and they and make them
 

00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:46.600
out organizations and they and make them
to decentralized so they're not good at

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:46.610
to decentralized so they're not good at
 

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:48.040
to decentralized so they're not good at
achieving their goals anymore but they

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:48.050
achieving their goals anymore but they
 

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:53.020
achieving their goals anymore but they
are continuing to launch attacks and I

00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:53.030
are continuing to launch attacks and I
 

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:55.570
are continuing to launch attacks and I
have sort of a thinking about this

00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:55.580
have sort of a thinking about this
 

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.920
have sort of a thinking about this
question about the effectiveness of

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:56.930
question about the effectiveness of
 

00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:58.150
question about the effectiveness of
terrorism some of the debate has been

00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160
terrorism some of the debate has been
 

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:01.480
terrorism some of the debate has been
about effectiveness versus democracies

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:01.490
about effectiveness versus democracies
 

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:02.890
about effectiveness versus democracies
whether tourism is more effective

00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:02.900
whether tourism is more effective
 

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.720
whether tourism is more effective
against democratic governments than non

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:04.730
against democratic governments than non
 

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:06.550
against democratic governments than non
democratic governments and I think there

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:06.560
democratic governments and I think there
 

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.750
democratic governments and I think there
are two reasons to think that it should

00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760
are two reasons to think that it should
 

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.750
are two reasons to think that it should
be more effective or less ineffective is

00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:10.760
be more effective or less ineffective is
 

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.220
be more effective or less ineffective is
paying me a better way to put it against

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:12.230
paying me a better way to put it against
 

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:14.970
paying me a better way to put it against
democracies one is that the basic

00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:14.980
democracies one is that the basic
 

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:17.050
democracies one is that the basic
strategy here is to put pressure on

00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:17.060
strategy here is to put pressure on
 

00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:19.120
strategy here is to put pressure on
civilians or to inflict pain on

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:19.130
civilians or to inflict pain on
 

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:20.320
civilians or to inflict pain on
civilians so that they'll put pressure

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:20.330
civilians so that they'll put pressure
 

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:21.610
civilians so that they'll put pressure
on their government that's going to be

00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:21.620
on their government that's going to be
 

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.670
on their government that's going to be
more effective if the civilians can more

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:24.680
more effective if the civilians can more
 

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:25.690
more effective if the civilians can more
effectively put pressure on their

00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:25.700
effectively put pressure on their
 

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.240
effectively put pressure on their
government which is true under democracy

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:28.250
government which is true under democracy
 

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:30.070
government which is true under democracy
and and it's also more likely that

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:30.080
and and it's also more likely that
 

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.660
and and it's also more likely that
you'll provoke a government from being

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:31.670
you'll provoke a government from being
 

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:33.220
you'll provoke a government from being
sort of too nice to be in this kind of

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:33.230
sort of too nice to be in this kind of
 

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:36.430
sort of too nice to be in this kind of
in the middle wishy-washy repressing but

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:36.440
in the middle wishy-washy repressing but
 

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.130
in the middle wishy-washy repressing but
not really effectively cracking down

00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:38.140
not really effectively cracking down
 

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:40.990
not really effectively cracking down
middle ground where a provocation

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:41.000
middle ground where a provocation
 

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.810
middle ground where a provocation
strategy and backlash can happen whereas

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:43.820
strategy and backlash can happen whereas
 

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:45.370
strategy and backlash can happen whereas
against an autocracy you're more likely

00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:45.380
against an autocracy you're more likely
 

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:46.960
against an autocracy you're more likely
just to justify really draconian

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:46.970
just to justify really draconian
 

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:49.750
just to justify really draconian
measures and get yourself defeated so

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760
measures and get yourself defeated so
 

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.670
measures and get yourself defeated so
there are a set of predictions that come

00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680
there are a set of predictions that come
 

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.290
there are a set of predictions that come
out of all of this that civil wars

00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:53.300
out of all of this that civil wars
 

00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:55.000
out of all of this that civil wars
involving terrorists rebel group should

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:55.010
involving terrorists rebel group should
 

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:57.640
involving terrorists rebel group should
be longer very unlikely to end in rebel

00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:57.650
be longer very unlikely to end in rebel
 

00:54:57.650 --> 00:54:58.990
be longer very unlikely to end in rebel
victory less likely to end in a

00:54:58.990 --> 00:54:59.000
victory less likely to end in a
 

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.850
victory less likely to end in a
negotiated agreement more likely to

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:00.860
negotiated agreement more likely to
 

00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:01.990
negotiated agreement more likely to
fizzle out or end in a government

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000
fizzle out or end in a government
 

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.750
fizzle out or end in a government
victory and relatively more effective

00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:04.760
victory and relatively more effective
 

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:08.310
victory and relatively more effective
versus democracies again all compared to

00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:08.320
versus democracies again all compared to
 

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:12.280
versus democracies again all compared to
non terrorists rebel groups and that is

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:12.290
non terrorists rebel groups and that is
 

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:14.260
non terrorists rebel groups and that is
if the world is all else equal but of

00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:14.270
if the world is all else equal but of
 

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:16.510
if the world is all else equal but of
course the world is never all else equal

00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:16.520
course the world is never all else equal
 

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.970
course the world is never all else equal
and and so the first thing I have to do

00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:18.980
and and so the first thing I have to do
 

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:21.550
and and so the first thing I have to do
in this project is to think about which

00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:21.560
in this project is to think about which
 

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:23.020
in this project is to think about which
groups use terrorism why are some groups

00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:23.030
groups use terrorism why are some groups
 

00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:25.180
groups use terrorism why are some groups
using terrorism and some not this is a

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:25.190
using terrorism and some not this is a
 

00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:28.360
using terrorism and some not this is a
strategic decision and so terrorism you

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:28.370
strategic decision and so terrorism you
 

00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:30.340
strategic decision and so terrorism you
know it's it's a random act of violence

00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:30.350
know it's it's a random act of violence
 

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:32.440
know it's it's a random act of violence
but it's not a strategy that has chosen

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:32.450
but it's not a strategy that has chosen
 

00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:35.140
but it's not a strategy that has chosen
at random and so the first thing I do in

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:35.150
at random and so the first thing I do in
 

00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:36.550
at random and so the first thing I do in
this project is to look at all of these

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:36.560
this project is to look at all of these
 

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:39.310
this project is to look at all of these
rebel groups and this is a post the data

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:39.320
rebel groups and this is a post the data
 

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:40.960
rebel groups and this is a post the data
that I have here is from the post-cold

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:40.970
that I have here is from the post-cold
 

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:42.670
that I have here is from the post-cold
war and about thirty percent of the

00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:42.680
war and about thirty percent of the
 

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.650
war and about thirty percent of the
groups that I'm looking at in civil wars

00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:44.660
groups that I'm looking at in civil wars
 

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:46.540
groups that I'm looking at in civil wars
in this period are using terrorism and

00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:46.550
in this period are using terrorism and
 

00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:49.090
in this period are using terrorism and
seventy percent aren't and so drawing on

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:49.100
seventy percent aren't and so drawing on
 

00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:50.830
seventy percent aren't and so drawing on
the Terrorism literature and on the

00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:50.840
the Terrorism literature and on the
 

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:52.060
the Terrorism literature and on the
literature on Civil War I look at a

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:52.070
literature on Civil War I look at a
 

00:55:52.070 --> 00:55:53.740
literature on Civil War I look at a
bunch of things that we might think will

00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:53.750
bunch of things that we might think will
 

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.360
bunch of things that we might think will
make groups more likely to use terrorism

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:55.370
make groups more likely to use terrorism
 

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:56.980
make groups more likely to use terrorism
and a number of the things that I find

00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:56.990
and a number of the things that I find
 

00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:59.680
and a number of the things that I find
kind of fit pretty squarely with the

00:55:59.680 --> 00:55:59.690
kind of fit pretty squarely with the
 

00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:01.960
kind of fit pretty squarely with the
broader terrorism literature terrorism

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:01.970
broader terrorism literature terrorism
 

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:03.730
broader terrorism literature terrorism
is more likely against democratic

00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:03.740
is more likely against democratic
 

00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:05.230
is more likely against democratic
governments again remember that this is

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:05.240
governments again remember that this is
 

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.000
governments again remember that this is
these are all just cases where there is

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:07.010
these are all just cases where there is
 

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:09.880
these are all just cases where there is
a civil war it's more likely if there's

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:09.890
a civil war it's more likely if there's
 

00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:11.440
a civil war it's more likely if there's
a religious difference between the rebel

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:11.450
a religious difference between the rebel
 

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:12.670
a religious difference between the rebel
group and the government that it's

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:12.680
group and the government that it's
 

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:15.310
group and the government that it's
fighting more likely in larger or more

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:15.320
fighting more likely in larger or more
 

00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.110
fighting more likely in larger or more
populous countries and in richer

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:17.120
populous countries and in richer
 

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:19.720
populous countries and in richer
countries there's a regional effect that

00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:19.730
countries there's a regional effect that
 

00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:21.340
countries there's a regional effect that
hasn't been particularly well theorized

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:21.350
hasn't been particularly well theorized
 

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:23.350
hasn't been particularly well theorized
that the terrorism is significantly less

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:23.360
that the terrorism is significantly less
 

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.080
that the terrorism is significantly less
likely in civil wars in Africa but that

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:26.090
likely in civil wars in Africa but that
 

00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:27.790
likely in civil wars in Africa but that
all sort of fits pretty squarely with

00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:27.800
all sort of fits pretty squarely with
 

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.590
all sort of fits pretty squarely with
the rest of the literature there are a

00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:29.600
the rest of the literature there are a
 

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:31.210
the rest of the literature there are a
few surprising findings that come out of

00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:31.220
few surprising findings that come out of
 

00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:33.820
few surprising findings that come out of
this and one has to do with secessionist

this and one has to do with secessionist
 

00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:35.590
this and one has to do with secessionist

paper would predict I actually find that

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:41.930
paper would predict I actually find that
 

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:43.900
paper would predict I actually find that
terrorism is significantly less likely

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:43.910
terrorism is significantly less likely
 

00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:45.700
terrorism is significantly less likely
in secessionist conflicts than in non

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:45.710
in secessionist conflicts than in non
 

00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:49.360
in secessionist conflicts than in non
secessionist complex it's that I'd sort

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:49.370
secessionist complex it's that I'd sort
 

00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:51.700
secessionist complex it's that I'd sort
of threw in religion because this isn't

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:51.710

really conventional wisdom in the

really conventional wisdom in the
 

00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:54.370
really conventional wisdom in the
academic literature but the conventional

00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:54.380
academic literature but the conventional
 

00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:56.560
academic literature but the conventional
wisdom kind of on the street that is the

00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:56.570
wisdom kind of on the street that is the
 

00:56:56.570 --> 00:56:58.390
wisdom kind of on the street that is the
terrorism is associated with Islam

00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400
terrorism is associated with Islam
 

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.030
terrorism is associated with Islam
there's absolutely no evidence for this

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040
there's absolutely no evidence for this
 

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.650
there's absolutely no evidence for this
in fact if anything Islamic groups are

00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:02.660
in fact if anything Islamic groups are
 

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:04.420
in fact if anything Islamic groups are
somewhat less likely to use terrorism

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:04.430
somewhat less likely to use terrorism
 

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:07.630
somewhat less likely to use terrorism
than non islamic rebel groups or

00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:07.640
than non islamic rebel groups or
 

00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:10.090
than non islamic rebel groups or
non-muslim rebel groups i should say and

00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:10.100
non-muslim rebel groups i should say and
 

00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:12.760
non-muslim rebel groups i should say and
then the most surprising thing here is i

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:12.770
then the most surprising thing here is i
 

00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:13.990
then the most surprising thing here is i
looked at the effect of relative

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000
looked at the effect of relative
 

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.770
looked at the effect of relative
strength now the fact that the fact that

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:17.780
strength now the fact that the fact that
 

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:20.950
strength now the fact that the fact that
terrorism is a weapon of the weak is in

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960
terrorism is a weapon of the weak is in
 

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:22.060

almost everything you read about

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:22.070
almost everything you read about
 

00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:23.500
almost everything you read about
terrorism it's become essentially a

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:23.510
terrorism it's become essentially a
 

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:25.300
terrorism it's become essentially a
cliche that terrorism as a weapon of the

cliche that terrorism as a weapon of the
 

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:26.920
cliche that terrorism as a weapon of the
weak it turns out nobody actually ever

weak it turns out nobody actually ever
 

00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:31.330
weak it turns out nobody actually ever
looked um which was surprising to me but

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:31.340
looked um which was surprising to me but
 

00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:33.250
looked um which was surprising to me but
if you actually measure the strength of

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:33.260
if you actually measure the strength of
 

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:34.660
if you actually measure the strength of
rebel groups and look at which one's

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:34.670
rebel groups and look at which one's
 

00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:36.370
rebel groups and look at which one's
views terrorism and which ones don't

00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:36.380
views terrorism and which ones don't
 

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:38.290
views terrorism and which ones don't
it's not the weakest groups that are

00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:38.300
it's not the weakest groups that are
 

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:39.850
it's not the weakest groups that are
using terrorism there's absolutely no

00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:39.860
using terrorism there's absolutely no
 

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:41.440
using terrorism there's absolutely no
evidence for that in fact with anything

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:41.450
evidence for that in fact with anything
 

00:57:41.450 --> 00:57:42.730
evidence for that in fact with anything
it's stronger groups that are using

00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:42.740
it's stronger groups that are using
 

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:44.590
it's stronger groups that are using
terrorism there's not a statistically

00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:44.600
terrorism there's not a statistically
 

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.600
terrorism there's not a statistically
significant effect the terrorism is a

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:46.610
significant effect the terrorism is a
 

00:57:46.610 --> 00:57:48.340
significant effect the terrorism is a
weapon of a strong but it is clearly

00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:48.350
weapon of a strong but it is clearly
 

00:57:48.350 --> 00:57:50.080
weapon of a strong but it is clearly
clearly clearly not a weapon of the weak

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:50.090
clearly clearly not a weapon of the weak
 

00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:54.310
clearly clearly not a weapon of the weak
again in this context of civil wars so

00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:54.320
again in this context of civil wars so
 

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.710
again in this context of civil wars so
all of these groups are are somewhat

00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720
all of these groups are are somewhat
 

00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:57.910
all of these groups are are somewhat
strong strong enough to launch a

00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920
strong strong enough to launch a
 

00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.160
strong strong enough to launch a
rebellion so that was something that I

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:00.170
rebellion so that was something that I
 

00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:02.050
rebellion so that was something that I
sort of found along the way but it's I

00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:02.060
sort of found along the way but it's I
 

00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:05.950
sort of found along the way but it's I
think a very interesting finding ok so

00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:05.960
think a very interesting finding ok so
 

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:07.360
think a very interesting finding ok so
then getting back to my original

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:07.370
then getting back to my original
 

00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:08.950
then getting back to my original
question about the effectiveness of

00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960
question about the effectiveness of
 

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.980
question about the effectiveness of
terrorism and that in the paper there's

00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:11.990
terrorism and that in the paper there's
 

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:14.770
terrorism and that in the paper there's
a lot of statistical tables and I'm not

00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:14.780
a lot of statistical tables and I'm not
 

00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:17.680
a lot of statistical tables and I'm not
going to put up my multinomial logit you

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:17.690
going to put up my multinomial logit you
 

00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:19.750
going to put up my multinomial logit you
know stuff here but i'll just give you

00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760
know stuff here but i'll just give you
 

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.300
know stuff here but i'll just give you
kind of a crude look at the at the data

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:22.310
kind of a crude look at the at the data
 

00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:24.730
kind of a crude look at the at the data
in in some graphs so there are a couple

00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:24.740
in in some graphs so there are a couple
 

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.110
in in some graphs so there are a couple
of things i think this has a laser

00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:26.120
of things i think this has a laser
 

00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:27.670
of things i think this has a laser
pointer and there are a couple things to

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680
pointer and there are a couple things to
 

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:30.580
pointer and there are a couple things to
notice about this graph in terms of the

00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:30.590
notice about this graph in terms of the
 

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:32.800
notice about this graph in terms of the
outcomes of civil wars the first is that

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:32.810
outcomes of civil wars the first is that
 

00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:34.440
outcomes of civil wars the first is that
was my

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:34.450
was my
 

00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:36.300
was my
they're real the first is over here so

00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:36.310
they're real the first is over here so
 

00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:38.160
they're real the first is over here so
the red bars are the chairs rebel groups

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:38.170
the red bars are the chairs rebel groups
 

00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:40.800
the red bars are the chairs rebel groups
and the blue bars are the non terrorists

00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:40.810
and the blue bars are the non terrorists
 

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:42.990
and the blue bars are the non terrorists
rebel groups so where we go over there

00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:43.000
rebel groups so where we go over there
 

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.349
rebel groups so where we go over there
there are no cases in this timeframe of

00:58:46.349 --> 00:58:46.359
there are no cases in this timeframe of
 

00:58:46.359 --> 00:58:48.569
there are no cases in this timeframe of
full-scale civil wars in which a

00:58:48.569 --> 00:58:48.579
full-scale civil wars in which a
 

00:58:48.579 --> 00:58:50.040
full-scale civil wars in which a
terrorist group achieves outright

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:50.050
terrorist group achieves outright
 

00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:52.980
terrorist group achieves outright
victory not a one and terrorist groups

00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:52.990
victory not a one and terrorist groups
 

00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:55.800
victory not a one and terrorist groups
are much more likely to last longer to

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:55.810
are much more likely to last longer to
 

00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:57.569
are much more likely to last longer to
be ongoing at any given point in the

00:58:57.569 --> 00:58:57.579
be ongoing at any given point in the
 

00:58:57.579 --> 00:58:59.490
be ongoing at any given point in the
data but they're less likely to reach an

00:58:59.490 --> 00:58:59.500
data but they're less likely to reach an
 

00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.620
data but they're less likely to reach an
agreement than our non terrorist groups

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:01.630
agreement than our non terrorist groups
 

00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:03.089
agreement than our non terrorist groups
and they're more likely to have these

00:59:03.089 --> 00:59:03.099
and they're more likely to have these
 

00:59:03.099 --> 00:59:04.620
and they're more likely to have these
sort of bad outcomes for the rebels

00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:04.630
sort of bad outcomes for the rebels
 

00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:06.750
sort of bad outcomes for the rebels
either fizzling out too low act through

00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:06.760
either fizzling out too low act through
 

00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:09.329
either fizzling out too low act through
low activity or a government victory so

00:59:09.329 --> 00:59:09.339
low activity or a government victory so
 

00:59:09.339 --> 00:59:10.859
low activity or a government victory so
that sits pretty well with a set of

00:59:10.859 --> 00:59:10.869
that sits pretty well with a set of
 

00:59:10.869 --> 00:59:12.089
that sits pretty well with a set of
predictions that terrorism will make

00:59:12.089 --> 00:59:12.099
predictions that terrorism will make
 

00:59:12.099 --> 00:59:14.640
predictions that terrorism will make
Wars last longer but that terrorist

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:14.650
Wars last longer but that terrorist
 

00:59:14.650 --> 00:59:17.460
Wars last longer but that terrorist
groups will fare less well and then non

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:17.470
groups will fare less well and then non
 

00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:20.220
groups will fare less well and then non
terrorist groups I also looked at this

00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:20.230
terrorist groups I also looked at this
 

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:22.380
terrorist groups I also looked at this
issue of democracy and again this is

00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:22.390
issue of democracy and again this is
 

00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:24.089
issue of democracy and again this is
kind of a crude look at the data but all

00:59:24.089 --> 00:59:24.099
kind of a crude look at the data but all
 

00:59:24.099 --> 00:59:25.859
kind of a crude look at the data but all
this holds up in the more complicated

00:59:25.859 --> 00:59:25.869
this holds up in the more complicated
 

00:59:25.869 --> 00:59:28.530
this holds up in the more complicated
sophisticated statistical analysis so

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:28.540
sophisticated statistical analysis so
 

00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:30.660
sophisticated statistical analysis so
this is the terrorist groups fighting

00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:30.670
this is the terrorist groups fighting
 

00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:33.089
this is the terrorist groups fighting
democracies versus non democracies and

00:59:33.089 --> 00:59:33.099
democracies versus non democracies and
 

00:59:33.099 --> 00:59:35.400
democracies versus non democracies and
here I've just collapsed the category so

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:35.410
here I've just collapsed the category so
 

00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:37.740
here I've just collapsed the category so
this is success here defined as either

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:37.750
this is success here defined as either
 

00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:39.359
this is success here defined as either
reaching an agreement or outright

00:59:39.359 --> 00:59:39.369
reaching an agreement or outright
 

00:59:39.369 --> 00:59:40.950
reaching an agreement or outright
victory there are no outright victories

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960
victory there are no outright victories
 

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.620
victory there are no outright victories
here as we saw before so this is really

00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:42.630
here as we saw before so this is really
 

00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:45.390
here as we saw before so this is really
whether groups are achieving a political

00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:45.400
whether groups are achieving a political
 

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:47.460
whether groups are achieving a political
settlement and they're more likely to do

00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:47.470
settlement and they're more likely to do
 

00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:49.920
settlement and they're more likely to do
so against democracies than against non

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:49.930
so against democracies than against non
 

00:59:49.930 --> 00:59:51.839
so against democracies than against non
democracies and then if we compare that

00:59:51.839 --> 00:59:51.849
democracies and then if we compare that
 

00:59:51.849 --> 00:59:56.190
democracies and then if we compare that
to the the non terrorist groups here non

00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:56.200
to the the non terrorist groups here non
 

00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.329
to the the non terrorist groups here non
terrace groups are actually more

00:59:57.329 --> 00:59:57.339
terrace groups are actually more
 

00:59:57.339 --> 00:59:59.010
terrace groups are actually more
effective against non democracies than

00:59:59.010 --> 00:59:59.020
effective against non democracies than
 

00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.500
effective against non democracies than
against democracies but again you see

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:01.510
against democracies but again you see
 

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:03.599
against democracies but again you see
that the success rate for the non

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:03.609
that the success rate for the non
 

01:00:03.609 --> 01:00:05.280
that the success rate for the non
terrorist groups is higher than it is

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:05.290
terrorist groups is higher than it is
 

01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:08.640
terrorist groups is higher than it is
for the terrorists rebel groups how am i

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:08.650
for the terrorists rebel groups how am i
 

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:13.710
for the terrorists rebel groups how am i

they do last longer and but terraced

01:00:21.569 --> 01:00:21.579
they do last longer and but terraced
 

01:00:21.579 --> 01:00:23.579
they do last longer and but terraced
rebel groups are extremely unlikely in

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:28.140
fact in this data they never win
outright they're less likely to get

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:28.150
outright they're less likely to get
 

01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:30.329
outright they're less likely to get
through the second best outcome from the

01:00:30.329 --> 01:00:30.339
through the second best outcome from the
 

01:00:30.339 --> 01:00:31.620
through the second best outcome from the
perspective of a rebel group of a

01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:31.630
perspective of a rebel group of a
 

01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:33.480
perspective of a rebel group of a
negotiated agreement that involves

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:33.490
negotiated agreement that involves
 

01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:36.450
negotiated agreement that involves
concessions to their side and they are

01:00:36.450 --> 01:00:36.460
concessions to their side and they are
 

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:38.069
concessions to their side and they are
more effective or less ineffective

01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079
more effective or less ineffective
 

01:00:38.079 --> 01:00:39.750
more effective or less ineffective
against democracies than against non

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760
against democracies than against non
 

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.490
against democracies than against non
democracies but overall

01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:41.500
democracies but overall
 

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.620
democracies but overall
rebel groups generally fare quite a bit

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:43.630
rebel groups generally fare quite a bit
 

01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:45.210
rebel groups generally fare quite a bit
worse than non terrorists rebel groups

01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:45.220
worse than non terrorists rebel groups
 

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:48.210
worse than non terrorists rebel groups
now again as I keep repeating this is in

01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:48.220
now again as I keep repeating this is in
 

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:50.670
now again as I keep repeating this is in
the context of civil wars so what if

01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:50.680
the context of civil wars so what if
 

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.930
the context of civil wars so what if
anything does that tell us about

01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:51.940
anything does that tell us about
 

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:56.130
anything does that tell us about
al-qaeda well for one thing as Kim

01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:56.140
al-qaeda well for one thing as Kim
 

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:59.460
al-qaeda well for one thing as Kim
mentioned most terrorism takes place in

01:00:59.460 --> 01:00:59.470
mentioned most terrorism takes place in
 

01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:01.440
mentioned most terrorism takes place in
the context is domestic terrorism local

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:01.450
the context is domestic terrorism local
 

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:03.240
the context is domestic terrorism local
terrorism the context of civil wars and

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:03.250
terrorism the context of civil wars and
 

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:06.030
terrorism the context of civil wars and
so I think part of the point of this

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:06.040
so I think part of the point of this
 

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.000
so I think part of the point of this
research is to kind of make us broaden

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:08.010
research is to kind of make us broaden
 

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:10.230
research is to kind of make us broaden
our perspective a little bit to think

01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240
our perspective a little bit to think
 

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.660
our perspective a little bit to think
about not just the terrorism that

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:12.670
about not just the terrorism that
 

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:14.460
about not just the terrorism that
affected us here in New York in the

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:14.470
affected us here in New York in the
 

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:16.500
affected us here in New York in the
United States 10 years ago but the

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:16.510
United States 10 years ago but the
 

01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:18.120
United States 10 years ago but the
terrorism that affects most people

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:18.130
terrorism that affects most people
 

01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:19.440
terrorism that affects most people
around the world is this type of

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:19.450
around the world is this type of
 

01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:21.330
around the world is this type of
terrorism this type of terrorism is

01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:21.340
terrorism this type of terrorism is
 

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:23.430
terrorism this type of terrorism is
quite ineffective how well this

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440
quite ineffective how well this
 

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.010
quite ineffective how well this
translates over to the effectiveness of

01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:26.020
translates over to the effectiveness of
 

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.900
translates over to the effectiveness of
transnational terrorism is something my

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:27.910
transnational terrorism is something my
 

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:29.580
transnational terrorism is something my
research can't speak to directly because

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:29.590
research can't speak to directly because
 

01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:31.760
research can't speak to directly because
I don't have a set of comparable

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:31.770
I don't have a set of comparable
 

01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:34.560
I don't have a set of comparable
transnational non terrorist groups to

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:34.570
transnational non terrorist groups to
 

01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:36.450
transnational non terrorist groups to
compare them to but I think a lot of the

01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:36.460
compare them to but I think a lot of the
 

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:38.580
compare them to but I think a lot of the
logic of this about though the reasons

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:38.590
logic of this about though the reasons
 

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:42.690
logic of this about though the reasons
that terrorism is ineffective spillover

01:01:42.690 --> 01:01:42.700
that terrorism is ineffective spillover
 

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.490
that terrorism is ineffective spillover
essentially that the issues especially

01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:44.500
essentially that the issues especially
 

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.320
essentially that the issues especially
about undermining legitimacy and

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:46.330
about undermining legitimacy and
 

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:48.810
about undermining legitimacy and
undermining political support I think

01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:48.820
undermining political support I think
 

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.180
undermining political support I think
translate to transnational terrorism as

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:51.190
translate to transnational terrorism as
 

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:52.680
translate to transnational terrorism as
well as to domestic terrorism but again

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:52.690
well as to domestic terrorism but again
 

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:53.820
well as to domestic terrorism but again
this is sort of my theoretical

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:53.830
this is sort of my theoretical
 

01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:56.190
this is sort of my theoretical
speculation more than my empirical hard

01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:56.200
speculation more than my empirical hard
 

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.560
speculation more than my empirical hard
data because we don't have a comparison

01:01:58.560 --> 01:01:58.570
data because we don't have a comparison
 

01:01:58.570 --> 01:02:00.000
data because we don't have a comparison
group that allows us to make that

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:00.010
group that allows us to make that
 

01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:03.690
group that allows us to make that
comparison empirically so I will just

01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:03.700
comparison empirically so I will just
 

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.140
comparison empirically so I will just
conclude by saying that I think what

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:07.150
conclude by saying that I think what
 

01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:08.550
conclude by saying that I think what
this project can do is revived

01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:08.560
this project can do is revived
 

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.290
this project can do is revived
introducing variation buy by introducing

introducing variation buy by introducing
 

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.960
introducing variation buy by introducing
a control group of a group of relatively

a control group of a group of relatively

allows us to shed light on two very

01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:20.200
allows us to shed light on two very
 

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.830
allows us to shed light on two very
important policy relevant questions that

01:02:22.830 --> 01:02:22.840
important policy relevant questions that
 

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.390
important policy relevant questions that
have not been particularly well

01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400
have not been particularly well
 

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.650
have not been particularly well
addressed in the terrorism literature

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:25.660
addressed in the terrorism literature
 

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.240
addressed in the terrorism literature
because the terrorism literature is so

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:27.250
because the terrorism literature is so
 

01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:29.490
because the terrorism literature is so
focused only on the terrorist groups and

01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:29.500
focused only on the terrorist groups and
 

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.920
focused only on the terrorist groups and
not at these other groups and so the

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:31.930
not at these other groups and so the
 

01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:33.510
not at these other groups and so the
first is where does charism occur which

01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520
first is where does charism occur which

as I mentioned I kind of looked at kind

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:35.770
as I mentioned I kind of looked at kind
 

01:02:35.770 --> 01:02:37.320
as I mentioned I kind of looked at kind
of on the way to getting to my main

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:37.330
of on the way to getting to my main
 

01:02:37.330 --> 01:02:38.460

question but some of the most surprising

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:38.470
question but some of the most surprising

question but some of the most surprising
findings are there and then the question

findings are there and then the question
 

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.050
findings are there and then the question
of whether terrorism work so on the

of whether terrorism work so on the
 

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:45.690
of whether terrorism work so on the
first question and this research and

01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:45.700
first question and this research and
 

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:48.030
first question and this research and
calls into question a lot of a

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:48.040
calls into question a lot of a
