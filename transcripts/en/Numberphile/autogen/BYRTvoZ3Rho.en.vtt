asked me to talk a little bit about the

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500
asked me to talk a little bit about the
 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.470
asked me to talk a little bit about the
new innovations and voting systems and

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480
new innovations and voting systems and
 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.789
new innovations and voting systems and
so I'd like to tell you about end-to-end

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799
so I'd like to tell you about end-to-end
 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.950
so I'd like to tell you about end-to-end
verifiable voting systems which is the

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960
verifiable voting systems which is the
 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.299
verifiable voting systems which is the
buzzword that academics are using to

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309
buzzword that academics are using to
 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.129
buzzword that academics are using to
describe this which means really that

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139
describe this which means really that
 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.020
describe this which means really that
you can verify the whole flow of

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030
you can verify the whole flow of
 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.640
you can verify the whole flow of
information from your head as to who you

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650
information from your head as to who you
 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.530
information from your head as to who you
think you want to vote for all the way

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540
think you want to vote for all the way
 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.880
think you want to vote for all the way
through the casting of the vote and the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890
through the casting of the vote and the
 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.189
through the casting of the vote and the
tabulation and then the final tally so

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199
tabulation and then the final tally so
 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.720
tabulation and then the final tally so
that you can verify every step of the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730
that you can verify every step of the
 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.859
that you can verify every step of the
way as is going with the way it should

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869
way as is going with the way it should
 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.420
way as is going with the way it should
and that your vote counts the way you

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430
and that your vote counts the way you
 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.040
and that your vote counts the way you
intended the final result is the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050
intended the final result is the
 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.990
intended the final result is the
accurate representation everybody's

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
accurate representation everybody's
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.849
accurate representation everybody's
votes and right now with many voting

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
votes and right now with many voting
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.259
votes and right now with many voting
systems you have a certain amount of

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
systems you have a certain amount of
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.479
systems you have a certain amount of
verifiability it's the lovely thing

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489
verifiability it's the lovely thing
 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.400
verifiability it's the lovely thing
about paper ballots is that you can see

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410
about paper ballots is that you can see
 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.110
about paper ballots is that you can see
that you know what you wrote down is

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
that you know what you wrote down is
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.060
that you know what you wrote down is
what you intended and so that that's a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070
what you intended and so that that's a
 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.190
what you intended and so that that's a
very important property very nice but

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200
very important property very nice but
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.869
very important property very nice but
once you've cast the paper ballot you're

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
once you've cast the paper ballot you're
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.760
once you've cast the paper ballot you're
trusting the chain of custody those

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
trusting the chain of custody those
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.410
trusting the chain of custody those
paper ballots to make sure that the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420
paper ballots to make sure that the
 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.450
paper ballots to make sure that the
countess does done right and that the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460
countess does done right and that the
 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.100
countess does done right and that the
ballots being counted to the right ones

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
ballots being counted to the right ones
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.990
ballots being counted to the right ones
talk to me about the Sophie thing some

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
talk to me about the Sophie thing some
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.400
talk to me about the Sophie thing some
people like to take a photo of that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
people like to take a photo of that
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.139
people like to take a photo of that
ballot don't know it's a lot of fun and

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149
ballot don't know it's a lot of fun and
 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.850
ballot don't know it's a lot of fun and
I think it may increase the voter

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860
I think it may increase the voter
 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.350
I think it may increase the voter
participation to have a little more fun

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
participation to have a little more fun
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.970
participation to have a little more fun
like that in the ballot booth and so on

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980
like that in the ballot booth and so on
 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.979
like that in the ballot booth and so on
to the thing that is worrisome about it

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
to the thing that is worrisome about it
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.959
to the thing that is worrisome about it
though from a security point of view is

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
though from a security point of view is
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.090
though from a security point of view is
that you know with a selfie of you

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
that you know with a selfie of you
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.980
that you know with a selfie of you
casting your ballot you can sell your

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
casting your ballot you can sell your
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.539
casting your ballot you can sell your
ballot and that's one of the things that

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
ballot and that's one of the things that
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.649
ballot and that's one of the things that
we've learned the hard way over many

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659
we've learned the hard way over many
 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.390
we've learned the hard way over many
many decades is that you don't want to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
many decades is that you don't want to
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.370
many decades is that you don't want to
enable people to sell their ballots so

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
enable people to sell their ballots so
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.440
enable people to sell their ballots so
you shouldn't leave the voting booth

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
you shouldn't leave the voting booth
 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.539
you shouldn't leave the voting booth
with any kind of proof as to how you

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549
with any kind of proof as to how you
 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.219
with any kind of proof as to how you
voted you shouldn't have a receipt

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
voted you shouldn't have a receipt
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.570
voted you shouldn't have a receipt
saying you voted this way you shouldn't

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580
saying you voted this way you shouldn't
 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.340
saying you voted this way you shouldn't
have a copy of your ballot you shouldn't

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
have a copy of your ballot you shouldn't
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.539
have a copy of your ballot you shouldn't
have any anything that proves how you

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
have any anything that proves how you
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.010
have any anything that proves how you
voted because that can be worth you know

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020
voted because that can be worth you know
 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.140
voted because that can be worth you know
20 bucks to the you know to you from the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150
20 bucks to the you know to you from the
 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.210
20 bucks to the you know to you from the
guy down the bar who wants to you know

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220
guy down the bar who wants to you know
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.190
guy down the bar who wants to you know
buy your vote or maybe course you so

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
buy your vote or maybe course you so
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.390
buy your vote or maybe course you so
yeah how can you possibly know that the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
yeah how can you possibly know that the
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.649
yeah how can you possibly know that the
to your vote was counted the way you

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
to your vote was counted the way you
 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.780
to your vote was counted the way you
wanted this is a hard question and it

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
wanted this is a hard question and it
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.030
wanted this is a hard question and it
makes it fascinating research area and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040
makes it fascinating research area and
 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.319
makes it fascinating research area and
it turns out you can thread this needle

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
it turns out you can thread this needle
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.060
it turns out you can thread this needle
with a bit of care and a bit of

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070
with a bit of care and a bit of
 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.060
with a bit of care and a bit of
cryptography a bit of mathematics so how

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
cryptography a bit of mathematics so how
 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.859
cryptography a bit of mathematics so how
do you how do you do this so the idea

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869
do you how do you do this so the idea
 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.929
do you how do you do this so the idea
would be that you get a receipt when you

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939
would be that you get a receipt when you
 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.210
would be that you get a receipt when you
vote and the receipt is not the plain

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220
vote and the receipt is not the plain
 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.620
vote and the receipt is not the plain
text as to how you voted but an

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
text as to how you voted but an
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.539
text as to how you voted but an
encryption of how you voted so it's

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
encryption of how you voted so it's
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.249
encryption of how you voted so it's
something that you can't sell down at

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
something that you can't sell down at
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.200
something that you can't sell down at
the bar because it's not something

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
the bar because it's not something
 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.999
the bar because it's not something
that's interpreted by somebody else so

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
that's interpreted by somebody else so
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.429
that's interpreted by somebody else so
it is like a number or a box the number

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
it is like a number or a box the number
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.690
it is like a number or a box the number
a barcode or something like that it

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
a barcode or something like that it
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.249
a barcode or something like that it
represents how you voted so you get a

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259
represents how you voted so you get a
 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.280
represents how you voted so you get a
receipt and the new thing here in these

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290
receipt and the new thing here in these
 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.350
receipt and the new thing here in these
end-to-end verifiable systems is the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
end-to-end verifiable systems is the
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.360
end-to-end verifiable systems is the
copies of all the receipts get posted on

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
copies of all the receipts get posted on
 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.640

your encryption of your vote is is

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269
your encryption of your vote is is
 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.039
your encryption of your vote is is
actually correct

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049
actually correct
 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.720
actually correct
everyone is encryption looks different

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730
everyone is encryption looks different
 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.009
everyone is encryption looks different
like everybody's encryption looks

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019
like everybody's encryption looks
 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.270
like everybody's encryption looks
different so it's not a simple

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280
different so it's not a simple
 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.520
different so it's not a simple
encryption where it in a deterministic

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530
encryption where it in a deterministic
 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.410
encryption where it in a deterministic
way it's a good point yeah so if

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420
way it's a good point yeah so if
 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.119
way it's a good point yeah so if
everybody's voting for Alice all the

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129
everybody's voting for Alice all the
 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.410
everybody's voting for Alice all the
Alice's don't look the same and all the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420
Alice's don't look the same and all the
 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.509
Alice's don't look the same and all the
Bob's don't look the same so there's a

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519
Bob's don't look the same so there's a
 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.729
Bob's don't look the same so there's a
couple of subtleties here one is well

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739
couple of subtleties here one is well
 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.979
couple of subtleties here one is well
how do you verify that tally them so

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989
how do you verify that tally them so
 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.250
how do you verify that tally them so
somebody is announcing that Alice won

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260
somebody is announcing that Alice won
 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.190
somebody is announcing that Alice won
and so all these encrypted votes are

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200
and so all these encrypted votes are
 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.300
and so all these encrypted votes are
primarily for Alice and there's some for

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310
primarily for Alice and there's some for
 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.649
primarily for Alice and there's some for
Bob but there's more for Alice

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659
Bob but there's more for Alice
 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.809
Bob but there's more for Alice
that's the assertion that the election

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819
that's the assertion that the election
 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.149
that's the assertion that the election
officials have made how do they know how

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159
officials have made how do they know how
 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.309
officials have made how do they know how
do they convince anybody that that's

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319
do they convince anybody that that's
 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.539
do they convince anybody that that's
right and they'd like to convince

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549
right and they'd like to convince
 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:18.830
right and they'd like to convince
everybody that that's right without

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840
everybody that that's right without
 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.170
everybody that that's right without
showing the decryptions of everybody's

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180
showing the decryptions of everybody's
 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.000
showing the decryptions of everybody's
vote so they've got this pile of

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010
vote so they've got this pile of
 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.430
vote so they've got this pile of
encrypted votes and an announced result

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440
encrypted votes and an announced result
 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.379
encrypted votes and an announced result
and you'd like to know

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389
and you'd like to know
 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:28.640
and you'd like to know
do you like if you're an election fish

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650
do you like if you're an election fish
 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.780
do you like if you're an election fish
you'd like to convince everybody that's

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790
you'd like to convince everybody that's
 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.610
you'd like to convince everybody that's
the right result so there's a number of

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620
the right result so there's a number of
 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.809
the right result so there's a number of
ways of doing this and there's quite a

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819
ways of doing this and there's quite a
 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.940
ways of doing this and there's quite a
large literature on this here's a way

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950
large literature on this here's a way
 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.949
large literature on this here's a way
that's pretty simple to describe so you

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959
that's pretty simple to describe so you
 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.420
that's pretty simple to describe so you
can use something called homomorphic

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430
can use something called homomorphic
 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.159
can use something called homomorphic
encryption what does that mean so it

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169
encryption what does that mean so it
 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.099
encryption what does that mean so it
means that you could multiply ciphertext

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109
means that you could multiply ciphertext
 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.780
means that you could multiply ciphertext
together and end up them with them

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790
together and end up them with them
 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.909
together and end up them with them
representing the sum of their plaintext

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919
representing the sum of their plaintext
 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.309
representing the sum of their plaintext
so encryption of a one times an

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319
so encryption of a one times an
 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.080
so encryption of a one times an
encryption of a two will give you an

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090
encryption of a two will give you an
 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.470
encryption of a two will give you an
encryption of a three right so you end

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480
encryption of a three right so you end
 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.150
encryption of a three right so you end
up adding the plaintext when you

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160
up adding the plaintext when you
 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.460
up adding the plaintext when you
multiply the ciphertext so this is cool

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470
multiply the ciphertext so this is cool
 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.229
multiply the ciphertext so this is cool
you can do lots of wonderful things with

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239
you can do lots of wonderful things with
 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.849
you can do lots of wonderful things with
this and particularly you can do the

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859
this and particularly you can do the
 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.039
this and particularly you can do the
tally for the voting system for example

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049
tally for the voting system for example
 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.800
tally for the voting system for example
if your vote is a vote for Alice you

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810
if your vote is a vote for Alice you
 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.259
if your vote is a vote for Alice you
might have an encryption of a 1 if your

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269
might have an encryption of a 1 if your
 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.670
might have an encryption of a 1 if your
vote is a vote for Bob you might have an

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680
vote is a vote for Bob you might have an
 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.189
vote is a vote for Bob you might have an
encryption for a 0 and suppose Alice and

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199
encryption for a 0 and suppose Alice and
 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.170
encryption for a 0 and suppose Alice and
Bob are the only two candidates so then

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180
Bob are the only two candidates so then
 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.750
Bob are the only two candidates so then
each ballot is either a 1 or a 0 and

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760
each ballot is either a 1 or a 0 and
 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.159
each ballot is either a 1 or a 0 and
basically what you want to do is add

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169
basically what you want to do is add
 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.529
basically what you want to do is add
them up but their ciphertext so you

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539
them up but their ciphertext so you
 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.570
them up but their ciphertext so you
don't see the ones in the zeros but you

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580
don't see the ones in the zeros but you
 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.010
don't see the ones in the zeros but you
can do this as homomorphic property you

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020
can do this as homomorphic property you
 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.540
can do this as homomorphic property you
can multiply all these ciphertext

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550
can multiply all these ciphertext
 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.129
can multiply all these ciphertext
together

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139
together
 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.360
together
end up with a number which represents

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370
end up with a number which represents
 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.540
end up with a number which represents
the sum of all of the plaintext ballots

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550
the sum of all of the plaintext ballots
 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.429
the sum of all of the plaintext ballots
and that sum is just the number of votes

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:33.439
and that sum is just the number of votes
 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.860
and that sum is just the number of votes
cast for Alice then right so the tally

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870
cast for Alice then right so the tally
 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.600
cast for Alice then right so the tally
for Alice is the sum of all these things

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610
for Alice is the sum of all these things
 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.040
for Alice is the sum of all these things
and Bob is just the number of votes

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050
and Bob is just the number of votes
 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.689
and Bob is just the number of votes
minus the tally for Ellis of course

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699
minus the tally for Ellis of course
 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.140
minus the tally for Ellis of course
so if Alice says more than half she wins

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150
so if Alice says more than half she wins
 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.219
so if Alice says more than half she wins
so there you can multiply these

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229
so there you can multiply these
 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.019
so there you can multiply these
ciphertext together and get a ciphertext

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:47.029
ciphertext together and get a ciphertext
 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:49.149
ciphertext together and get a ciphertext
that's the cipher text for the sum and

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159
that's the cipher text for the sum and
 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.950
that's the cipher text for the sum and
that ciphertext can be decrypted

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960
that ciphertext can be decrypted
 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.050
that ciphertext can be decrypted
publicly in a way that everybody can see

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060
publicly in a way that everybody can see
 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.850
publicly in a way that everybody can see
is proper so you can say yes that is

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860
is proper so you can say yes that is
 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.110
is proper so you can say yes that is
never everybody could also do this

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120
never everybody could also do this
 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.360
never everybody could also do this
multiplication so that is they can check

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370
multiplication so that is they can check
 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.249
multiplication so that is they can check
that that's the ciphertext to decrypt

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.259
that that's the ciphertext to decrypt
 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.050
that that's the ciphertext to decrypt
and the election officials could decrypt

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060
and the election officials could decrypt
 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.149
and the election officials could decrypt
that in a nice way and show that that's

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159
that in a nice way and show that that's
 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:06.309
that in a nice way and show that that's
the proper decryption so that we have

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319
the proper decryption so that we have
 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.140
the proper decryption so that we have
the right tally for Alice so that's

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150
the right tally for Alice so that's
 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.939
the right tally for Alice so that's
that's one part of what you need to do

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949
that's one part of what you need to do
 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.040
that's one part of what you need to do
that is everybody can verify the tally

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050
that is everybody can verify the tally
 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.200
that is everybody can verify the tally
from these encrypted things and that's

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210
from these encrypted things and that's
 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.820
from these encrypted things and that's
cool all right so that's one part of it

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830
cool all right so that's one part of it
 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.980
cool all right so that's one part of it
the other part you want to deal with is

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990
the other part you want to deal with is
 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.179
the other part you want to deal with is
the fact that you need to know that your

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:19.189
the fact that you need to know that your
 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:20.740
the fact that you need to know that your
ciphertext is really representing your

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750
ciphertext is really representing your
 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.089
ciphertext is really representing your
vote right so you go into the voting

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099
vote right so you go into the voting
 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:23.679
vote right so you go into the voting
booth you're getting this receipt and

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:23.689
booth you're getting this receipt and
 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.839
booth you're getting this receipt and
you want to know that that receipt

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849
you want to know that that receipt
 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.219
you want to know that that receipt
really represents your vote so you vote

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229
really represents your vote so you vote
 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.170
really represents your vote so you vote
for Alice and you get this receipt which

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180
for Alice and you get this receipt which
 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.189
for Alice and you get this receipt which
is a ciphertext

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199
is a ciphertext
 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.809
is a ciphertext
you can't decrypt that ciphertext in

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:31.819
you can't decrypt that ciphertext in
 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:32.980
you can't decrypt that ciphertext in
fact you shouldn't be able to decrypt

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990
fact you shouldn't be able to decrypt
 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.480
fact you shouldn't be able to decrypt
that ciphertext because then you could

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490
that ciphertext because then you could
 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.619
that ciphertext because then you could
sell your vote just like you could with

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:35.629
sell your vote just like you could with
 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.290
sell your vote just like you could with
a selfie right so so you want to know

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300
a selfie right so so you want to know
 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.809
a selfie right so so you want to know
that that ciphertext is really for say

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819
that that ciphertext is really for say
 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:43.170
that that ciphertext is really for say
Alice if you're voting for Alice so

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180
Alice if you're voting for Alice so
 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.899
Alice if you're voting for Alice so
that's a little more subtle

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:45.909
that's a little more subtle
 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.579
that's a little more subtle
maybe this matchbox analogy is not a bad

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:48.589
maybe this matchbox analogy is not a bad
 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:50.769
maybe this matchbox analogy is not a bad
way to explain it how do you know that

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:50.779
way to explain it how do you know that
 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:52.149
way to explain it how do you know that
you've got a good match you're going on

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159
you've got a good match you're going on
 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:53.980
you've got a good match you're going on
a camping trip you can't you're allowed

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990
a camping trip you can't you're allowed
 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.899
a camping trip you can't you're allowed
to take only one match how do you know

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909
to take only one match how do you know
 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:57.850
to take only one match how do you know
you've got a good match well you could

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860
you've got a good match well you could
 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.409
you've got a good match well you could
take a box out of the drawer you can say

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419
take a box out of the drawer you can say
 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.149
take a box out of the drawer you can say
well maybe this is a box of good matches

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159
well maybe this is a box of good matches
 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:03.610
well maybe this is a box of good matches
and you try randomly sampling those

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620
and you try randomly sampling those
 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.230
and you try randomly sampling those
matches and like get that one likes that

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240
matches and like get that one likes that
 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.429
matches and like get that one likes that
one lies but you want to take with you a

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:06.439
one lies but you want to take with you a
 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:08.700
one lies but you want to take with you a
match you haven't tried yet and so you

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710
match you haven't tried yet and so you
 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.959
match you haven't tried yet and so you
may be the last match you say well I

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969
may be the last match you say well I
 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.070
may be the last match you say well I
haven't tried that match but all the

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080
haven't tried that match but all the
 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.179
haven't tried that match but all the
others in the box were good and

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:13.189
others in the box were good and
 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:14.619
others in the box were good and
therefore I'm going to trust that this

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:14.629
therefore I'm going to trust that this
 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:16.240
therefore I'm going to trust that this
one is good you put that your pocket and

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250
one is good you put that your pocket and
 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.159
one is good you put that your pocket and
take it camping so you can do something

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169
take it camping so you can do something
 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.329
take it camping so you can do something
like that with the encryption here you

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:19.339
like that with the encryption here you
 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:21.760
like that with the encryption here you
can say I walk into the voting booth I

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770
can say I walk into the voting booth I
 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.700
can say I walk into the voting booth I
get an encryption of the first my first

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710
get an encryption of the first my first
 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.559
get an encryption of the first my first
representation of the choice may I say

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:26.569
representation of the choice may I say
 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:28.510
representation of the choice may I say
Alice and I get a Christian that I want

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520
Alice and I get a Christian that I want
 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.029
Alice and I get a Christian that I want
to see is that really a good encryptions

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039
to see is that really a good encryptions
 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:32.260
to see is that really a good encryptions
like seeing if it's a good match

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270
like seeing if it's a good match
 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.460
like seeing if it's a good match
so I'll strike it or I'll ask

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470
so I'll strike it or I'll ask
 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.560
so I'll strike it or I'll ask
that to be decrypted which the machine

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570
that to be decrypted which the machine
 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.270
that to be decrypted which the machine
can do for me since it encrypted in the

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280
can do for me since it encrypted in the
 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.280
can do for me since it encrypted in the
first place so so once I test it like

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.290
first place so so once I test it like
 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.410
first place so so once I test it like
once I see the doubt it decrypts

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420
once I see the doubt it decrypts
 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.060
once I see the doubt it decrypts
properly unfortunately I can't use that

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070
properly unfortunately I can't use that
 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.800
properly unfortunately I can't use that
to vote with because now I know how to

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810
to vote with because now I know how to
 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.930
to vote with because now I know how to
decree how it decrypts as well and I

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940
decree how it decrypts as well and I
 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.520
decree how it decrypts as well and I
can't post that because I could sell my

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.530
can't post that because I could sell my
 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.760
can't post that because I could sell my
vote if I were to post that one so

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770
vote if I were to post that one so
 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.950
vote if I were to post that one so
that's a spoiled ballot and we can't use

I'm only for Alice again maybe I don't

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240
I'm only for Alice again maybe I don't
 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.970

test that one and I said ok we'll go

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:22.980
test that one and I said ok we'll go
 

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.710
test that one and I said ok we'll go
with that we'll post that on the web and

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720
with that we'll post that on the web and
 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.360
with that we'll post that on the web and
then you've got confidence just like

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.370
then you've got confidence just like

with the matches that that encryption
was done properly it doesn't need to be

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:29.760
was done properly it doesn't need to be
 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.790
was done properly it doesn't need to be
done by a lot of people right it just

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800
done by a lot of people right it just
 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.290
done by a lot of people right it just
needs to be done enough so that you know

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300
needs to be done enough so that you know
 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.880
needs to be done enough so that you know
machines aren't trying to cheat in any

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:34.890
machines aren't trying to cheat in any
 

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.620
machines aren't trying to cheat in any
large-scale way so those are the two

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:36.630
large-scale way so those are the two
 

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.390
large-scale way so those are the two
parts of it getting encryptions that you

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400
parts of it getting encryptions that you
 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.760
parts of it getting encryptions that you
can trust even if you're not a computer

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:39.770
can trust even if you're not a computer
 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.560
can trust even if you're not a computer
and getting a tally that you can verify

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:42.570
and getting a tally that you can verify
 

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.990
and getting a tally that you can verify
even though these inputs of the tally

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000
even though these inputs of the tally
 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.300
even though these inputs of the tally
are encryptions and so this is a

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:47.310
are encryptions and so this is a
 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.280
are encryptions and so this is a
wonderful idea it's evolved over the

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:49.290
wonderful idea it's evolved over the
 

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.350
wonderful idea it's evolved over the
years with many different people putting

years with many different people putting
parts of it together but it means you

can have a voting system then that's
 

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.080
can have a voting system then that's

the result you can verify that the
 

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.140
the result you can verify that the
outcome is right so in the future this

outcome is right so in the future this
 

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.520
outcome is right so in the future this
might be the kind of voting system

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:07.530
might be the kind of voting system
 

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.650
