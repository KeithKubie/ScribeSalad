00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.310
Multiply 6 times 1/4.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.160
Simplify your answer and write
it as a mixed number.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.170
So let's just do the
multiplication.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.470
So at first when you try to
multiply 6 times 1/4, you'll

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.340
be like, well, gee, I know
how to multiply a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.720
fraction times a fraction.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.110
I know how to multiply a whole
number times a whole number,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.580
but what about a whole number
times a fraction?

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.110
And kind of the key insight
you need here is that any

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.430
whole number can be written
as a fraction.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.720
We can rewrite 6
as 6/1, right?

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.020
6 divided by 1 is 6.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.220
6 ones is 6.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.360
Depending how you think about
it, this is exactly the same

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.720
thing as 6.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.210
So we just rewrote our whole
number as a fraction.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.320
You can do it for any number.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.610
10 is the same thing as 10/1.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:54.930
So this become 6/1 times
1/4, and then we just

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.160
multiply the fraction.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.740
We multiply the numerators, so
this is equal to 6 times 1 as

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.590
our numerator.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.519
Let me do that in
another color.

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.270
So this becomes 6 times 1 for
our numerator and 1 times 4

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.190
for our denominator, for the
number on the bottom.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.260
And so this will become
6 over 4.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.000
And right now, it's just as an
improper fraction and it's

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.900
also not in lowest terms. You
immediately see 6 and 4 are

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.190
both divisible by 2, so let's
divide them both by 2.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.334
If you divide 6 by 2--
and I'll do it

00:01:25.334 --> 00:01:26.370
in a new color again.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.515
If you divide 6 by
2, you get 3.

00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:35.290
If you divide 4 by 2, you get
2, so this is equal to 3/2.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.300
So it's still written as
an improper fraction.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.570
We now have to write it
as a mixed a number.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.350
And the process for writing it
as a mixed number, you just

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.820
divide the denominator into the
numerator, so this just

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.920
becomes 2 into 3.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.820
Divide 2 into 3.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.560
2 goes into 3 one time.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.880
1 times 2 is 2.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.930
You subtract.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.680
You have a remainder of 1.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:10.474
So this will become one whole
and 1/2 left over.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.610
So this is 1 and 1/2.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.900
So that's our right answer.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.040
We've just simplified the answer
and wrote it is a mixed

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.810
number or we could simplify
it at this stage.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.830
We could say right here, well,
look, we could divide what's

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.310
eventually going to be in the
numerator by 2 and get a 3

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.660
there, and divide what's
eventually in the denominator

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.990
by 2 and get a 2 there.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.370
3 times 1 is 3.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.985
1 times 2 is 2, so it's 3/2.

00:02:38.985 --> 00:02:40.830
And you do this exact
same process.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.040
You say that 3/2 is the same
thing as 1 and 1/2.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.120
Either one of those will work.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.910
Now let's think about why
this makes sense.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.500
Let's think about what
6 times 1/4 is.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.410
Let me draw 1/4.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.130
Let's say that that is
1/4 right there, and

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.120
let's do six of them.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.450
So that's 1/4, that's 2/4 that's
3/4, that's 4/4, which

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.150
would be a whole, and then
you have 5/4, and

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.320
then you have 6/4.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.710
So this is 6 times 1/4.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.590
This right here is 4/4.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.090
This right here is 4 over 4,
which is equal to a 1, so this

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.600
is equal to 1.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.580
And then this right here
is two 1/4's, or this

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.710
right here is 2/4.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.600
You can imagine this is two out
of a potential, if a whole

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.300
has to have two more of them,
has to have four of them. so

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:42.860
this is 1 and-- let me do it
in the same colors-- 1 and

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.270
1/2, right?

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.720
2 out of 4 is the same thing as
1/2, so this right here is

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.930
one out of a possible
one, and then two.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.990
So this is 1 and 1/2, which is
exactly what we got before.
