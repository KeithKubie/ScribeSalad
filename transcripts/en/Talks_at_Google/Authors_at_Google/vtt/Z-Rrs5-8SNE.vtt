[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:07.630
ARIEL ALTMAN: So tell
us about your journey.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.030
How did you know you
wanted to be a doctor

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.774
and that this whole path
was really your calling?

00:00:12.774 --> 00:00:14.190
TAZ BHATIA: You
know, I always say

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.730
it was an accidental journey.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.180
I don't think anything was
super intentional until maybe

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.120
more recently.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.070
But the whole point of
the path of being a doctor

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.050
really began when I was a child.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.200
And we took a trip to India--
my parents are Indian.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.040
And we went to Kolkata, which
is a very busy bustling city

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.610
in India.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.170
And I just remember
being stunned.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.530
And I remember,
literally, getting up

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.960
from the airport all the
way into the city just

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.800
looking around.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.200
It was my first trip there,
that I could remember.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.170
And just being
shocked, stunned--

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.430
the poverty, the people, the
noise, the colors, the smells.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.810
It was just overwhelming.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.060
And there's so many things
I remember from that trip.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.950
From meeting my family
for the first time--

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.940
or extended family--

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.180
to trying to speak Hindi
in the most terrible way

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.380
you can possibly imagine,
and also other stuff.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.290
But the thing that
stuck for years

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.120
later was just people in
the street that were hurt.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.770
They looked like
they needed care.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.145
And something in
me at that age--

00:01:12.145 --> 00:01:14.760
I was 10-- and it was just
like, I want to help people.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.790
I want to do something.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.100
So, it's very naive.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.810
Everyone walks around saying
they want to help people

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.059
and they want to do something.

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:23.410
[INAUDIBLE] back as I
went through high school

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.270
and then as I got into college.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.376
In college, I had doubts.

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:28.750
And I had moments
where I'm like,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.640
I'm not sure if
medicine is for me.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.570
I love science,
I love chemistry,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.150
I love thinking
through all of that.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.400
But I also love writing
and I love speaking.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.590
And I was thinking maybe
more journalism, maybe

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.920
that's the way to go.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.520
And at the end of the
day, I chose medicine

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.400
and embarked on that path
and that journey-- which

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.440
consumed me, quite honestly.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.515
And left journalism behind,
left writing behind.

00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:50.890
Didn't read a
book, didn't write,

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.750
didn't do anything for years.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.550
And it's just funny
how life works out.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.780
Journalism found me again.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.990
So that was sort of the
path to becoming a doctor

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.239
and to entering this field.

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:01.280
ARIEL ALTMAN: Absolutely.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.290
That's so interesting.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.470
And not only are you a
doctor, but you've really,

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.620
in a profound way, combined
Western medicine with Eastern

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.370
medicine.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.710
So can you talk a
little bit about what's

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.670
guided you to not just do the
traditional medical route,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.420
but explore this whole
other world that may not

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.270
be as familiar to most people?

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.970
TAZ BHATIA: Yeah, so that
also is an accidental journey.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.540
I never intended to jump into
the world of Eastern medicine

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.710
or integrative medicine.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.470
I was a hardcore
doctor, quite honestly.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.040
I loved procedures,
I loved adrenaline.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.990
I wanted to be an ICU doctor.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.720
I interviewed across the
country for ICU fellowships.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.512
And the only reason I
detoured from that was there

00:02:43.512 --> 00:02:45.970
was a lot of stuff going on in
our family, back in Atlanta.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.340
And I was like, I really need
to be home for a year or two,

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.540
settle all that stuff down.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.980
Let me go back to Atlanta.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.110
And I took a job in urgent care.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.050
And so from urgent care, I got
recruited into the emergency

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.800
room.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.930
And the emergency room,
again, as high adrenaline.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.700
You're doing everything,
you're seeing everything,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.870
you're doing procedures.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.230
And you see everything
under the sun

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.230
and you meet every type
of person under the sun.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.080
So I liked it, I
actually really loved it.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.970
So that's the type
of doctor I was.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.170
But, unfortunately, the years
of medical school, the years

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.802
of ER work were taking a toll.

00:03:16.802 --> 00:03:18.010
And I didn't even realize it.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.700
I wasn't even conscious
or aware of it.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.330
I was completely
disconnected from what

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.380
was happening with me.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.870
I was more interested in
what I was accomplishing

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.380
or what I was doing.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.880
And the kind of silent whispers
that I always talk about.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.410
Like, you don't
feel quite right,

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.300
your joints are
hurting a little bit,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.424
you're starting to gain
weight and you can't really

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:37.080
explain it.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.704
Everything that was kind of just
very silent, kind of murmuring

00:03:39.704 --> 00:03:42.460
under the surface for
years, started to crescendo.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.664
To the point where I was losing
hair-- it was noticeable.

00:03:45.664 --> 00:03:47.080
I was gaining a
significant amount

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.120
of weight, had terrible acne.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.180
I didn't feel good.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.620
I would get dressed in the dark.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.940
I was just so embarrassed to
try to put myself together.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.222
And then, I still
didn't connect.

00:03:57.222 --> 00:03:59.180
I still didn't connect
that something was wrong

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.388
and I needed to do something.

00:04:00.388 --> 00:04:02.780
It's just I was so in my
head most of the time.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.820
And it was finally
a couple of things.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.875
It was my mom--

00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:08.140
who was really proud of
my original Indian hair,

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.950
because I had the best
hair in the family.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.490
And was absolutely devastated
that now, like, half of it

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.120
was gone.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.840
And it was my now-husband, who
we were dating at the time,

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.589
was just like, something's
wrong with you.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.839
You need to get
checked out know.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.450
He goes, I don't care, but I
feel like something's wrong.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.040
It was my patients.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.774
Because the ER, at some point,
is still primary care nowadays.

00:04:27.774 --> 00:04:29.440
So there are patients
that would come in

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.390
and had seen me for
a few years, and they

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.590
were staring up at my scalp.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.380
They weren't really looking at
me or paying attention to me.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.540
And so it was kind
of those three things

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.690
that motivated me to start this
journey of trying to understand

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.570
what was happening.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.110
What was happening with my
health, what did I need to do?

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.610
And that began my journey
for finding answers.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.300
And that journey
didn't go really well.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.730
It was so frustrating and
not to jump ahead, but I've--

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.890
to deal with my
mother-in-law right now, who

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.780
has a new diagnosis of cancer.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.670
And back in that
conventional medicine world.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.461
And that journey hasn't
changed for people.

00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:04.840
It's just as hellish
as I remember it being.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.110
And I went from doctor to
doctor trying to get answers,

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.050
trying to get solutions and
didn't really get anywhere.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.690
Went to the, quote unquote,
"best doctors in the city."

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.910
Was willing to travel
to get answers--

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:16.450
nothing.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.880
And then finally got
put on a medication

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.197
that one of the side
effects of the medication

00:05:21.197 --> 00:05:22.780
was that it dropped
my blood pressure.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.696
And I'm telling the story
not just to tell you

00:05:24.696 --> 00:05:27.760
what happened to me, but also
that explain how disconnected I

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.530
was, and I was a physician.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.750
So I'm put on this
medication, I'm

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.399
following what I was told to do.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:35.440
I'm not paying attention
or digging into the fact

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.546
that this might drop
my blood pressure.

00:05:37.546 --> 00:05:38.920
My blood pressure
is already low.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.100
Shame on me for that.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.350
I already have this knowledge.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.170
So anyhow, my blood pressure
dropped dramatically one day

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.010
while I was driving.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.540
And so I got into a wreck.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.241
I could have hit somebody else,
I could have hit another car.

00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:49.990
I could have died.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.782
And so that was sort
of just a jolt, like--

00:05:51.782 --> 00:05:53.031
ARIEL ALTMAN: A wake up, yeah.

00:05:53.031 --> 00:05:54.880
TAZ BHATIA: Like,
what am I doing?

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.390
And so, that began a
search for answers.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.850
That began going home
that day and being like,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.457
I've got to figure
something else out.

00:06:02.457 --> 00:06:03.790
And I've got to do it on my own.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.860
There's really nobody else
who's going to do this for me.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.320
There's no prints coming in,
and there's no magic solution,

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.700
there's no one pill.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.367
So I just started studying.

00:06:11.367 --> 00:06:13.200
So I did everything I
could get my hands on.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.210
And it began with a weekend
course in holistic medicine.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.900
And then that became wanting
to be certified in nutrition.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.520
And that became wanting
to learn Chinese medicine.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.370
So I flew to San Francisco and
became a licensed acupuncturist

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.077
and studied Chinese
herbal medicine.

00:06:27.077 --> 00:06:29.660
I learned about Ayurvedic, which
was a little bit of my roots,

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.077
and got reintroduced to that.

00:06:31.077 --> 00:06:33.410
And then finally did the
integrative medicine fellowship

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.760
with Dr. Weil,
which is in Arizona.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.540
And so, I spent two years
going through that program.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.740
And that kind of finally--

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.239
I finished that
program, I think was

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:43.250
2008-- that gave
me the confidence

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.980
to put all these little
pieces I had back together,

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.400
in terms of maybe taking
care of somebody else.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.820
And all the information I
gathered up until that point,

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.870
I had fixed myself.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.350
It took me a good two years,
but I had fixed myself.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.170
But then it was everybody
else asking questions.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.010
Like, what'd you do?

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.890
Well, how did that happen?

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:59.930
What was the solution there?

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.430
You know, what herb
would you take?

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.050
Would you do
acupuncture for this?

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.510
So all those questions, and
then finishing the fellowship,

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.970
that was kind of the
moment where like, hey,

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.860
I might have something here.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.195
I might be able to
help a few people.

00:07:14.195 --> 00:07:17.390
So that got me into the
world of Eastern medicine,

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.380
integrative medicine,
functional medicine,

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.963
nutrition-- all these
different fields

00:07:20.963 --> 00:07:22.200
that you hear about today.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.451
But that was my entry into it.

00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:24.491
ARIEL ALTMAN: Absolutely.

00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:26.070
No, really interesting journey.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.540
I think wellness is such
a buzz word everywhere.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.580
And it's kind of
just the new fad.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.920
So how do you define
wellness and how do you

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.940
break down some of those
stereotypes or misconceptions

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.667
that are out in the media and
in our everyday lives today?

00:07:41.667 --> 00:07:43.250
TAZ BHATIA: Yeah, I
feel like wellness

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.752
is such a used term, now.

00:07:45.752 --> 00:07:47.210
Everybody's talking
about wellness,

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.190
it's in our vernacular.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.670
Which I think is great.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.840
I mean, I think it's fantastic
that we've shifted from disease

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.980
management to wellness.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.650
I think that's a huge
accomplishment culturally,

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:58.857
so that's fantastic.

00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:01.190
The wellness means different
things to different people.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.710
And it depends on who
you're talking to.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.360
I remember I'm coming
from this vantage

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.540
point and this perspective of
having all this different types

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.580
of training under
my belt, including

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.260
conventional medical training.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.960
And so when I sit back and I
think about what does wellness

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.900
mean to me, and what does
it mean for my patients,

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.480
or for my center, or
for anyone that I touch,

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.530
it's really cumulative.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.230
It's additive, there's not one
factor that defines wellness.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.900
And so it's really
the accumulation

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.250
of a number of different things.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.740
And I would start with energy,
like where's your energy?

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.030
If you have good energy.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.440
Your emotional landscape.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.169
I mean, I think the further
I get along-- it's funny,

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:37.647
it's like, I know
so much chemistry

00:08:37.647 --> 00:08:39.230
and I know so much
physiology, and I'm

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.730
sure we'll talk
about all of that.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.110
But the further
I get along, it's

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.200
like I'm understanding how
powerful our emotions are,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.060
how powerful our sense
of connection is.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.740
That's a part of wellness, too.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.910
I think it is chemistry.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.700
It's your nutrition, it's your
biologies, your physiology.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.760
What's your gut doing?

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.980
Do you have inflammation?

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.970
It's all of those
things, as well.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.500
And then it is about community,
and family, and support,

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.090
and spirituality.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.990
All of those things
define wellness.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.555
And that is the reason I
think that so many peoples sit

00:09:06.555 --> 00:09:09.119
in my exam rooms, or my offices,
or talk to me when I'm out.

00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:10.910
And they're like, well,
I don't understand.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.220
I ate this way, I
did this, I did that.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.780
Why did I get X, Y, and Z?

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.780
It's because, again, it's
cumulative, it's additive.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.970
And it can feel overwhelming
to try to tackle all of that.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.920
But unless we start to sit back
and understand that it's all

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.570
influencing each other--

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.900
I had an expert tell me recently
that a hamburger on vacation

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.150
is metabolized completely
differently than a hamburger

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.733
when you're stressed out, or you
might be eating it right now.

00:09:34.733 --> 00:09:37.670
So, again, it's so
cumulative and so additive.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.490
And we have to understand how
all those pieces come together.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.590
And the beauty of Eastern
systems of medicine

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.930
is that they stress
that from the get go.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.361
It wasn't just take this herb.

00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:49.610
It was like, well, what's
the rest of your life doing?

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.170
And then trying to understand
how to put all that together.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.086
ARIEL ALTMAN: Love it.

00:09:53.086 --> 00:09:53.900
I love it.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.420
So, obviously Western
medicine hat, then.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.950
What would be like
a hack or something

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.810
that you know is a general tip
that you could give to some

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.350
of our viewers or audiences?

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.230
I know that our
worlds are so crazy,

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.560
but if you could do one
thing today, what would

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.680
you suggest doing?

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.638
TAZ BHATIA: Oh my gosh.

00:10:14.638 --> 00:10:16.820
ARIEL ALTMAN: Besides buying
Super Woman right now?

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.950
TAZ BHATIA: Well, I think the
first thing I would stress--

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.720
and it's funny because I
think my answer's changed

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.270
over the years.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.228
But I think the very
first thing I would stress

00:10:23.228 --> 00:10:25.880
is the importance of being
connected to yourself.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.190
I think that's the most
important thing you can do--

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.600
to not ignore yourself.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.200
I think most people, and
most women, in particular,

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.630
ignore the soft
and silent whispers

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.220
that we hear on any given day.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.930
They'll ignore the fact that I'm
tired more days out of the week

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.100
than I'm not.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.710
Or that something's hurting,
or that my hair's falling,

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.780
or this joint's bothering me.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.700
Or why am I gaining
weight or losing weight--

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.260
either direction--

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.827
more so than I ever
have in the past?

00:10:52.827 --> 00:10:55.160
Or why am I suddenly getting
more anxiety or depression?

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.519
I think we collectively
ignore those things.

00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:59.060
And I think the most
important thing,

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.760
before you start any
health or wellness journey,

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.310
is to understand how to
get connected back to you.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:05.900
I would say that's
the first thing.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.980
And there's so many
different ways to do that.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.250
I mean that's a really
big blanket statement.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.684
But it's everything from
just adopt one habit

00:11:12.684 --> 00:11:13.850
that you could do every day.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.490
Maybe you journal every morning,
maybe you pray everyday,

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:17.810
maybe you meditate.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.680
Maybe you go for
a walk in nature.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.460
But whatever it is, have that
conversation with yourself

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.825
in whatever format you want to.

00:11:23.825 --> 00:11:25.700
Because that will bring
you back to yourself.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.910
So that would be my first, kind
of foundational starting point.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.240
Then we can keep building
from there, if you want.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.840
ARIEL ALTMAN: No, it's great.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.790
You know, Googlers are often
high-achieving individuals,

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.760
are constantly
plugged in, dealing

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.620
with many different
levels of stress.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.905
So what do you do to unplug?

00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:47.570
Or any suggestions
for when you feel

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.760
like you're on that
brink of burnout or you

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.316
feel something coming along.

00:11:51.316 --> 00:11:52.940
Besides getting in
touch with yourself,

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.260
what are some things that
maybe you like to do?

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.530
TAZ BHATIA: I think it's
so easy to get burned out

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.210
when you're a high
achiever because you

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:00.251
want to accomplish a lot.

00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:02.630
I still want to accomplish
a lot, I'm far from done.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.330
But you have to
watch your energy

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.330
and you have to watch,
kind of, your boundaries.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.538
And I think it's so hard to
do because there's always

00:12:08.538 --> 00:12:11.600
that goal or that next milestone
that you're trying to get to

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.990
or trying to accomplish.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.440
So, again, I think one of
the things in your schedule--

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.452
put the breaks in.

00:12:16.452 --> 00:12:18.660
I think you need to put in
breaks throughout the day.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.830
Especially for you guys, right.

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.560
Because you guys are
on technology a lot.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.450
And I think that in
itself is very draining.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.700
We're learning more and more
about the effects of that

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.910
as we get further along.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.410
But I think putting
those breaks in.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.100
I would take three 10-minute
breaks throughout your workday

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.930
where you are forced
to get up, get away

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.140
from computers, cell phones,
iPads, all that other stuff.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.390
Maybe walk outside the
building for just a little bit,

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.470
get fresh air.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.630
It's amazing how just
fresh air and sunlight can

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.110
shift your energy very quickly.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.477
So that's just a quick, easy
hack that you can do anywhere.

00:12:46.477 --> 00:12:47.810
So those three 10-minute breaks.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.570
I would also strongly advise--

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.370
this is so easy to
do, too-- but really

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.340
put in your schedule to block
maybe an hour to two hours

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.660
a week to do something
that lowers cortisol.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.982
So that means you're
not running necessarily,

00:12:59.982 --> 00:13:01.940
but you're walking, or
you're going for a swim,

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.170
or you're doing yoga.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.780
Or maybe you're just in
nature for a period of time.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.030
Or go ahead and schedule
that massage, or acupuncture,

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.546
or something along those lines.

00:13:09.546 --> 00:13:10.670
Those are ways to recharge.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.050
Because the biggest problem
with high achievers-- and I'd

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.174
be so curious to see what
everybody at Google tests

00:13:15.174 --> 00:13:17.360
outs as in the Power Type plan.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.460
But the biggest problem
with high achievers

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.580
is that they never take
time out to distress.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.520
You're in high adrenaline
mode all the time.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.140
And the problem
with high adrenaline

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.567
is, yes, you get stuff done.

00:13:28.567 --> 00:13:30.650
But at some point, you're
going to crash and burn.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.665
And that crash and burn comes
as, maybe, mild symptoms--

00:13:33.665 --> 00:13:36.040
I'm just tired, it's hard to
get to work in the morning--

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.550
to things that are so severe.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.080
Like I can't move, I'm
depressed, or things like that.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.400
So you never want to
get to that place.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.900
So putting those
natural breaks in.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.530
10 minutes throughout the day,
two to three hours a week,

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.300
where you're doing
something that's

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.460
very different from your
job, but you're also

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.679
doing something that's
forcing you to lower cortisol.

00:13:55.679 --> 00:13:58.220
Because that's the hormone that
you guys are at the most risk

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.010
for.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.340
And that could be any of
the modalities that do that,

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.970
whether it's walking,
doing yoga, swimming, doing

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.980
acupuncture, doing massage.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.450
Any of those things
that force you to relax.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.749
So those are probably my
strongest tips for that.

00:14:11.749 --> 00:14:13.040
ARIEL ALTMAN: Awesome, love it.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.650
And I know you said that
a really important piece

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.894
of this wellness journey
is knowing yourself.

00:14:17.894 --> 00:14:18.560
TAZ BHATIA: Yes.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.935
ARIEL ALTMAN: And
you've actually

00:14:19.935 --> 00:14:21.440
developed a really
interesting way

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.030
to know yourself
a little bit more

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.890
through this idea
of Power Types.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.500
So could you talk to us a little
bit about the different Power

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.814
Types and how you thought
of this whole methodology?

00:14:29.814 --> 00:14:30.980
TAZ BHATIA: Yes, definitely.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.640
So, again, I have all
this different types

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.200
of training under my belt--

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.961
Eastern medicine, Chinese,
Ayurvedic, nutrition.

00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:40.460
And then at the
same time, I'm doing

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.130
conventional Western
medicine labs in our office.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.830
I'm looking at hormone levels,
I'm looking at nutrient levels.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.170
I'm getting real
data to match what

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.880
I'm seeing with the
other diagnostic systems.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.015
And one of the
things I learned--

00:14:53.015 --> 00:14:55.757
I continue, as I sit with
women, in particular-- even men.

00:14:55.757 --> 00:14:57.590
There's probably a book
for men coming soon.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:58.440
But even--

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.440
ARIEL ALTMAN: Get ready.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.856
TAZ BHATIA: But for women in
particular, what I've noticed

00:15:01.856 --> 00:15:03.775
is, again, this
loss of what to do.

00:15:03.775 --> 00:15:05.900
They don't have a road map,
they don't have a plan.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.109
And that's the question I get
asked over and over again.

00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:11.150
It's classic, they'll
bring a bag of supplements,

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.859
or they'll bring five
books, or whatever.

00:15:12.859 --> 00:15:14.108
Like, I don't know what to do.

00:15:14.108 --> 00:15:15.260
Please tell me what to do.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.556
And we're all different.

00:15:16.556 --> 00:15:18.180
We're all unique,
we're all individual.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.990
But as I was talking to women--
and I'm about 12,000 women

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.175
in, over the last decade
of seeing patients--

00:15:23.175 --> 00:15:25.550
and you listen to them, and
you're hearing their stories,

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.260
and then you're
interpreting data--

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.210
the pattern started to line up.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.180
And so, somebody who had
this medical condition

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.570
and this hormone imbalance
was also this Ayurvedic type,

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.790
this Chinese medicine
meridian imbalance,

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.500
this nutritional
deficiency, over here.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.499
And I could start to see
them at a certain point

00:15:41.499 --> 00:15:42.410
in the practice.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.070
And then I started
to track them.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.020
And I started to
write them down.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.730
And when you start to write
them down and track them,

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.070
then you're like, oh my
gosh, there's something here.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.040
We would have this powerful
prescriptive formula

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.160
for empowerment, really,
to help us all feel amazing

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.980
if we use the tools of both
and merge them together.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.500
And we'd be able to understand,
OK, this is why I do this,

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.390
this is why I need
to eat this way.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.490
So that's how the whole
concept of Power Typing began.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.490
So it started with a
bunch of spreadsheets--

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.280
probably Google
spreadsheets, actually.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.430
ARIEL ALTMAN: I was going to
say, are they Google Sheets?

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.263
TAZ BHATIA: Used lots
of Google spreadsheets

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:15.150
and entered a lot of data just
to track what was happening.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.220
And then as I developed
the five types--

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.040
so these are five Power Types.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.540
And they each have a distinct
way that they need to eat,

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.350
they need to move.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.260
Their personalities tie into
it, their emotional tendencies

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.695
tie into that, as well.

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:29.070
There are supplements that
they might need, their hormone

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.180
imbalances.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:33.060
So as I developed them, then
the next step was to name them.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.310
And so the names, again,
I've stolen, literally,

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.170
from Eastern
systems of medicine.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.640
So the five Power Types, just
to review them real quickly.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.400
The first one is the Gypsy Girl.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.960
And the Gypsy's my creative.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.030
Super creative, some
of you may be Gypsies.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.450
But have that Vata energy
from Ayurvedic medicine.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.750
Have that sort of
adrenal issue where

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.980
they're more likely to
go into adrenal fatigue,

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.620
have anxiety, those
type of things.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.700
So there's a whole
set of issues that

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.400
are both pros and cons that
come with being a Gypsy.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.270
The second one is the Boss Lady,
and that's your high achiever.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.579
That's your go getter,
your commander.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:07.849
The Boss Lady is amazing.

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:09.390
We have a lot of
Boss Ladies we know,

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.910
and apparently there are
a lot of Boss Ladies that

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.500
are very high-achieving
women at work.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.910
But the biggest problem
there, in Ayurvedic,

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.230
they're more Pitta.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.240
And they hold all their stress
in their digestive system.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.970
So the first thing
to go for a boss lady

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.650
is usually something
with their gut.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:28.532
So, IBS, constipation,
reflux-- you name it.

00:17:28.532 --> 00:17:30.240
But then that goes
on-- and this is where

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.220
modern science intersects.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.740
We know that all inflammation
today begins in the gut.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.760
We know that in science.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.140
We're seeing that
when we do research

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.060
on the microbiome and all
that other good stuff.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.684
Chinese medicine and
Ayurvedic medicine

00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:42.330
had already talked about that.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.430
So, again, if you knew
this ahead of time,

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.847
if you know your
Boss Lady and you

00:17:45.847 --> 00:17:47.596
know that you're going
to hold your stress

00:17:47.596 --> 00:17:49.230
in your digestive
system, then all the

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.330
more important to be on
the right diet for you

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.430
to protect against
inflammation, to protect

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.179
against as autoimmune
diseases, and things like that.

00:17:56.179 --> 00:17:58.470
The next one is a blend and
that's what both of us are.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.700
We're both Savvy Chicks.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.530
And that's a blend of the
Gypsy and the Boss Lady.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.080
So, part creative,
part go getter.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.260
So at times, we're probably
lost somewhere in space,

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.074
and at other times
we're like go, go, go.

00:18:10.074 --> 00:18:11.490
So it's a blend,
but then you have

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.031
the medical issues of both, and
the hormone patterns of both,

00:18:14.031 --> 00:18:16.490
and the nutritional
needs of both.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.300
I think after that it
was the Earth Mama.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.040
And the Earth Mama
is the nurturer.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.590
I would say it's the person
that's the center of a home

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.240
and the center of a family.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.310
You guys probably
know an Earth Mama

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.830
around you or within
your own families.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:32.280
But they are the worst about
establishing boundaries

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.055
and really attending
to their own needs.

00:18:35.055 --> 00:18:36.930
They're usually worried
about everybody else.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.710
And they define themselves
really through everybody else.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.480
But there's a medical
consequence to that.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.188
And that's what we
find with Earth Mamas,

00:18:44.188 --> 00:18:46.920
they often have issues
with insulin resistance,

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.110
with diabetes, hypertension,
more cardiometabolic-type

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.610
issues.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.340
They're the ones the most
likely to get depressed

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.600
because, again, they
don't have their own

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.070
foundation and self-worth.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.980
So that's the Earth Mama.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.050
And then the last one
is the Nightingale.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.260
And the Nightingale is
that mission-oriented,

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.760
service-focused person
who just is about a higher

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.080
calling and a higher cause.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.530
But again, to the point that
they sacrifice themselves.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.500
And so they may be your
friend that's on mission trips

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.190
constantly.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:18.720
And then it turns around
that they're getting, like,

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.600
pneumonia, and bronchitis, and
all these different illnesses

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.730
over and over again.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.230
It typically taxes
their immune system.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.330
That's the first thing
that goes for them.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.130
So for them--

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.350
I've had a lot of Nightingales
in practice as well.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.050
And it's always reminding them
that the mission is important,

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.346
but the mission is only
as good as they are.

00:19:36.346 --> 00:19:38.970
So they've got to take the time
to rebuild their immune system.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.040
And, again, there's a
diet that matches that.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.540
They're supplements
that match that.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.430
There's a certain
way they should move.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:45.930
They should not be
running and doing

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.430
marathons, and all
that other stuff,

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.240
when they're in that
Nightingale phase.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.610
So it's fascinating to help
women understand who they are,

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.040
see them do the plan, and
then see them make changes.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.910
And then the other
important thing, though,

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.750
is as women, in particular,
at any given time,

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.545
we may be any one of
those power types.

00:20:02.545 --> 00:20:03.420
We're going to shift.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.290
We're hormonal creatures,
so we're going to shift.

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:07.020
We may have a phase
of our life where

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.740
we're full on Boss Ladies.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.560
But then we may switch
and have a phase

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.990
where the Earth Mama, or
have a later phase where

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:14.040
the Nightingale.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.630
All of that's irrelevant.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.060
It's more important
for you just to connect

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.310
to who you are at
any given phase

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.710
so that you understand how
to take care of yourself

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:23.520
at that phase.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.603
So, so many people when I
first came out with this

00:20:25.603 --> 00:20:26.880
was, well, what's better?

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.990
Which is the best one?

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.520
Which is the best one to be?

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.560
I'm like, they're all good!

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.880
Every single one is good.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.380
Is just that the
point of this was

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.600
to understand who
you are and really

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.830
put some thought into, hey, this
is who I am and therefore, this

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:41.890
is my roadmap.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:45.030
And then once you have that
roadmap, for me, what I really

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.710
wanted in writing
this particular book

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.420
and developing the
Power Type formula,

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.270
is I wanted anyone who
touched it and picked it up

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.790
to begin that conversation
with themselves.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.100
To begin to
understand themselves.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.560
I'm not saying I have
all the answers in there,

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.270
for every aspect
of their health.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.100
But I sure do have
a way for them

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.860
to at least begin that
road and that journey.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.690
So that you don't
waste five or six

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.070
years like I did, feeling
bad about yourself,

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.040
not going for it
or doing everything

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.220
you're supposed to do.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.730
You really are just
full-fledged ahead

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.560
being the superwoman
you're supposed to be.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.785
I now firmly believe that.

00:21:17.785 --> 00:21:19.035
ARIEL ALTMAN: Yeah, I love it.

00:21:19.035 --> 00:21:21.330
And you got the Super Woman
title from your daughter,

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:21.600
right?

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.308
TAZ BHATIA: Yeah!

00:21:22.308 --> 00:21:25.820
So, this was a fun story.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.730
I had this concept already
in my head of types of women

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.260
and was tracking and doing
all that other stuff.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.716
And I think it was--

00:21:32.716 --> 00:21:34.340
we were on a car ride
with my daughter.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.298
We just come from an
event where a lot of women

00:21:36.298 --> 00:21:37.760
had come up to me that we know.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.994
And had been making comments,
and she was with me.

00:21:39.994 --> 00:21:41.660
And we get in the car
and we're driving.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.400
And she's like, Mommy, you
need to write a book for women.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.800
And I'm like, I do?

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.009
And she's like, yeah.

00:21:47.009 --> 00:21:48.050
You need to write a book.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:49.910
I go, well, what
would you write?

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.680
What would you call it?

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.270
And she's such an
old soul, but she's

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.550
like, you need to write a
book called Super Woman.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:57.830
Because you're a super woman.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.869
I feel like every woman
I meet is always talking

00:21:59.869 --> 00:22:01.160
about how you're a super woman.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.534
So maybe you need to help
everybody else be a super woman

00:22:03.534 --> 00:22:05.746
because I just see you as Mom.

00:22:05.746 --> 00:22:07.370
So she actually came
up with the title.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:08.328
I'm like, you're right.

00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:09.630
That's a really great idea.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.420
So we called the book
The Super Woman Rx.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.030
And I dedicated the
book to her because it

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.830
is her idea and her title.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.660
And then she helped
me, actually,

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.454
too with the Power
Type names, as well.

00:22:19.454 --> 00:22:20.370
And she took the test.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.730
She was only eight, I think,
when I started the concept.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:23.480
ARIEL ALTMAN: Wow.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.147
TAZ BHATIA: And she
was nine, almost 10,

00:22:25.147 --> 00:22:26.313
when the book was published.

00:22:26.313 --> 00:22:28.160
But she still goes in
and takes the test.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.410
I'm like, half these questions
aren't relevant to you.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:31.130
She's like, it's OK.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.910
I already figured it out.

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:32.420
I'm a Gypsy.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.930
[LAUGHING]

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:34.870
It's hilarious.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:35.420
ARIEL ALTMAN: That's awesome.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.770
TAZ BHATIA: But
yeah, she's a cutie.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.228
ARIEL ALTMAN: I
love it, I love it.

00:22:38.228 --> 00:22:39.590
So we're at Google, right?

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:42.540
We're all about technology
and the digital world.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.140
How do you think about
digital technology

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.449
and how it integrates
with medicine today?

00:22:47.449 --> 00:22:49.490
Or even the things that
you do on a daily basis--

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.237
or your practice, or
how you help women.

00:22:51.237 --> 00:22:52.820
TAZ BHATIA: How much
time do you have?

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.405
[LAUGHING]

00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:54.530
ARIEL ALTMAN: Five minutes.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:54.850
[LAUGHING]

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:55.850
TAZ BHATIA: Well, to do.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:59.750
So, I am the biggest
technological idiot

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.190
you've ever met in you life.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.410
So my tech support,
when I was like 21,

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.090
was my 9-year-old sister.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:07.110
So I never thought
I'd have to spend

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.330
as much time thinking
about technology,

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.180
but it is a reality of today.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.030
And it has absolutely
impacted our business.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.170
It's impacted the practice.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.910
It's impacting patient
care, quite honestly.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.640
So technology is a must.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.300
And I have forcefully had to
immerse myself in that world

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:28.040
and try to understand how
this piece of the equation

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.011
fits into what I'm doing.

00:23:30.011 --> 00:23:31.010
And here's what I think.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.110
I think that
technology is amazing.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:37.520
We need technology to track
that-- to track our data,

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.780
to track our numbers.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.780
To help remind us of
habits and behaviors.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.280
And to help with resources.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.194
We absolutely need
technology for that.

00:23:45.194 --> 00:23:46.610
And I think one
of the limitations

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.070
that even I'm experiencing
with this type of medicine

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:52.520
that we're doing, is that
there's not a central place

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.930
to get this information.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:54.764
It's not coming out.

00:23:54.764 --> 00:23:57.263
So a lot of it's having to come
out of my mouth or something

00:23:57.263 --> 00:23:57.840
that I write.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.672
It would be amazing to have this
stuff available in real time

00:24:00.672 --> 00:24:01.880
for women so they understand.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.546
OK, I just told you
you're a Gypsy Girl,

00:24:03.546 --> 00:24:06.590
now go figure out-- here all
the other resources you need.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.480
And we continually update it.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.060
So I know that there's a need
for that type of technology

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.510
that is resourceful, data
tracking, motivating,

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:15.260
educational.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.190
There's that.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.894
From a practice standpoint,
what we have noticed--

00:24:18.894 --> 00:24:20.810
and we're actually
developing our own platform

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:22.340
because it's such an issue.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.639
Is that to do the
medicine that I'm doing,

00:24:24.639 --> 00:24:26.180
there's not the
technology out there.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.850
So it slows me down from
a practice standpoint

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.330
and it prevents my growth.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:32.870
So for medicine to
really move forward,

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.714
we've got to have
systems that integrate

00:24:34.714 --> 00:24:35.630
all that information--

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:36.830
ARIEL ALTMAN: Import it, yeah.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:38.955
TAZ BHATIA: --that put all
the information together

00:24:38.955 --> 00:24:41.030
and really help patients
with the full picture

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:41.696
of their health.

00:24:41.696 --> 00:24:43.820
I defined wellness
for you earlier.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.640
Well, that technology needs
to match that definition.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.770
And it needs to be
able to show people

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:52.100
this is a cumulative, additive
properties of your health.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.990
This is what your
wellness looks like.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:56.090
And it's taking all
of that into account.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.850
And then from a operational
standpoint, with a practice

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:02.210
and with a business, it needs
to mirror that, as well.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.290
So that's where we are.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.350
We're trying to develop a
platform so that we can then

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:10.070
take this medicine, make it more
efficient, make it scalable.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:13.510
And then allow it to grow beyond
just Atlanta, the few centers

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:14.510
that we have in Atlanta.

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:15.980
And be able to grow beyond.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.180
So that women everywhere
can have access to it.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:21.110
And then same thing with
the super women theory.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.000
We want technology
there so that women

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.220
can continue to grow in
that process of having

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.869
that conversation
with themselves

00:25:26.869 --> 00:25:28.160
and understanding who they are.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.107
Because I love the
books, I love writing,

00:25:31.107 --> 00:25:32.690
but not that many
people read anymore.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:33.470
[LAUGHING]

00:25:34.262 --> 00:25:35.720
They want quicker
information, they

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.975
want to download it faster.

00:25:36.975 --> 00:25:38.950
So the book is a great
foundational step,

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:40.700
but the next step is
probably technology.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.780
ARIEL ALTMAN: Absolutely.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.560
Super interesting.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.864
And I know you mentioned
this idea of expansion.

00:25:44.864 --> 00:25:45.530
TAZ BHATIA: Yes.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:48.800
ARIEL ALTMAN: So what's next
for you, for the center?

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.930
What are you most excited about
in the next six to 12 months,

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:54.570
maybe in your personal
life, the center's space,

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:55.820
but also in the medical world?

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.550
What excites you and gets
you out of bed every morning?

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.960
TAZ BHATIA: Oh my
gosh, there's so much.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.230
I think that, in
the medical world,

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.240
it's fascinating to
continue to watch

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:11.060
the intersection of
genetics, food and nutrition,

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.512
and all these other
data points that we've

00:26:13.512 --> 00:26:14.720
been talking about for years.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.310
How they intersect
and are really

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:20.260
redefining what prevention is
and redefining what healthy is.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.120
So the conventional world
needs some time to catch up.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.000
But what's super exciting is
seeing the integrative worlds

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.010
and the functional
medicine worlds really

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:29.730
start to gain their spot.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:32.180
Really start to come
into the forefront

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.010
and lead some of
these conversations

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.720
on what prevention really means.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.714
What does healthy really mean.

00:26:37.714 --> 00:26:39.380
And for the longest
time, there was just

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.790
a one-liner, flat
definition of that.

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:43.670
I think the other
thing that gets me out

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.490
of bed in the morning, just
from a medical standpoint,

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.370
is I'm a huge believer
in family wellness.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:52.850
I've lived in a situation
where the family was not well.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:55.490
And the center of that
family is always the woman.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.920
So that's why I decided
to start with women.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.300
Because when the
woman is not healthy,

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.080
it reverberates out into
her children, her husband,

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.190
her extended family,
her community, her city.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.070
So, I think it's so
important to shift culture.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.880
We have to create
strong families.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.676
And we have to create really
unified, healthy families.

00:27:14.676 --> 00:27:15.800
And it starts with a woman.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.490
So what gets me excited, and
the challenged, quite honestly,

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:22.400
is understanding that when
it comes to women's health,

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.520
there are miles, and miles,
and miles of work to do,

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.510
journeys to travel.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:30.482
Because we historically have
gaslight women's health issues.

00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:32.690
Women's health issues were
always brushed to the side

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.780
because it was a male-dominated
field when in Western medicine

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:36.830
was born.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:40.220
So to really change what's
happening within a family,

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.260
I've got to change what's
happening with women.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.850
And if I can change what's
happening with women,

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:45.800
then I can turn around
and impact that family.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.841
So that's what gets me
out of bed in the morning,

00:27:47.841 --> 00:27:50.570
is knowing that that's sort of
the framework from which I'm

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:51.110
functioning.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.710
And I love it.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.326
And to this day,
there's not a day

00:27:53.326 --> 00:27:55.700
that I walk into my practice
and I don't learn something,

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.199
or I speak and I don't learn
something from somebody I meet.

00:27:58.199 --> 00:28:00.110
And it's just such a
fascinating journey.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:02.980
As far as the practice
goes, and as far as I go,

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.480
we're just going to continue
to grow, and scale, and expand.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.700
We're trying to,
again, use technology

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.340
to make this old
way of doing things

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.230
better and more efficient.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:16.190
Because we're now in a culture
that we can't sit and talk

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.150
for two hours about something.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:19.850
So how do we create--

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.680
this take this old
system of medicine,

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.960
integrate it with the
newer modern medicine.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.180
But then at the
same time, preserve

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.119
the character, the flavor,
but also make it efficient

00:28:29.119 --> 00:28:30.660
and run the way it's
supposed to run?

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:31.710
So that's our challenge.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.577
So that keeps me
going in the center.

00:28:33.577 --> 00:28:35.660
And technology is a big
part of that conversation.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.480
So six to 12 months
from now I hope that we

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.520
have our technology wrapped.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.860
I hope that we are opening
and launching, maybe

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.960
here in New York, in
LA, and other places

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.160
around the country.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.719
And as far as I go,
I hope I continue

00:28:48.719 --> 00:28:51.260
to do the work that needs to be
done to get this message out,

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.310
louder and louder.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:53.390
ARIEL ALTMAN: Well
that's amazing.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:53.630
TAZ BHATIA: Thank you.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:55.500
ARIEL ALTMAN: What
a great mission.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.170
And we're here to
help and support.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.165
So we'll open up the
floor for questions.

00:29:01.165 --> 00:29:02.540
AUDIENCE: As you
were talking, it

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:06.794
makes me think a lot about
the, sort of, obesity epidemic

00:29:06.794 --> 00:29:07.460
in this country.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:16.170
I'm just wondering, where
does that all connect in here?

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:19.130
And how do you think
about bringing that

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:22.215
to folks who probably need it?

00:29:22.215 --> 00:29:23.590
TAZ BHATIA: That's
such a great--

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:26.270
AUDIENCE: More than, maybe,
some of us, or some others.

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:26.900
TAZ BHATIA: Yeah, definitely.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.400
I mean, I think the
obesity epidemic

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.440
has happened for a number
of different reasons.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.120
Probably the number one
reason is, honestly,

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.750
our food sourcing and the
production of our food.

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.880
The more and more
we dig into obesity,

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.830
we're understanding
that a lot of what

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.710
was used over the last 30,
40 years between additives,

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:45.080
and fillers, and preservatives,
and things like that

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.570
have been hormone disruptors
and have contributed

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:48.990
to that conversation.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.930
So when it comes
to obesity, again,

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:54.530
if we can educate a
family on the right way

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:56.230
to eat in a way that's not--

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:59.660
everyone has a preconceived
notion that eating healthy

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.680
is expensive.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:04.260
So if we can help families
learn to navigate that terrain

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:06.365
so they understand how
to make healthy choices.

00:30:06.365 --> 00:30:08.240
And, again, it usually
starts with the woman.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.260
Because the woman's
doing the cooking,

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.301
the shopping, the buying.

00:30:10.301 --> 00:30:13.580
So the more empowered you can
make the woman of the family,

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.980
typically it'll go
out into the children

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.170
and into the adult other
adults of the family

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:20.480
to help with the obesity crisis.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.480
We just are also a culture
of over-consumption,

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.410
quite honestly.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:27.290
You know we're eating way
more than we need to eat.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:30.170
And that goes to our children
and it goes to us as adults,

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:30.920
as well.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.740
So helping people understand
what normal consumption is,

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:34.970
I think is a big part of it.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:37.178
And that's where the whole
conversation on food waste

00:30:37.178 --> 00:30:38.000
also comes up.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.010
Because we waste
so much food, too.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:42.380
So the obesity
conversation, I know

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:46.310
there's been a huge spotlight
with movement and activity.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:49.700
I'm going to push back on that
and say it's honestly 80% food

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.505
and it's only 20% activity.

00:30:51.505 --> 00:30:52.880
And I think that's
where maybe we

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.200
have the conversation
wrong to a certain extent.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.720
I do also think that technology
is an issue for obesity

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.449
in the future.

00:31:00.449 --> 00:31:02.990
How are we going to take this
tool, this amazing tool that we

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:06.050
have, of being connected to
anyone, anywhere in the world,

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.400
and get information
at any given moment.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.030
But at the same time create
some boundaries and parameters

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.950
so that people are
using it in a way that

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:15.750
is productive and proactive
and not working against them?

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.410
So the biggest thing I've
seen in pediatrics, which

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:21.830
is another one of my
medical loves, so to speak,

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:25.670
but is that children
don't have the boundaries

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:27.200
to navigate technology.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.790
And adults don't
have the education

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.830
to help them navigate
those boundaries.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:33.200
And, again, as much
as I know, I've

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.150
struggled with my two children.

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.110
And what's normal,
what's not normal, what's

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.610
OK.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:40.340
So I think technology,
I think food, first.

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.260
I think our food is
the biggest problem.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.750
I think looking at
technology and looking

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.270
at how children are trapped
in rooms a lot of the times.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:48.590
They're not outside.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:51.380
I think the over scheduling
of families is an issue, too.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.810
I mean all of these
things are factors that

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:55.970
play into obesity, for sure.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:59.660
And then when it comes to
different socioeconomic groups,

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:03.050
helping them with
food deserts and areas

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:04.790
that aren't getting
high-quality food.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.748
There's so many-- I could
talk forever on this,

00:32:06.748 --> 00:32:08.924
and I'll probably need to stop.

00:32:08.924 --> 00:32:10.340
But there's so
many great studies.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.730
Like if you give a young child--
any socioeconomic status--

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:16.490
if you give them salads,
and healthy vegetables,

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.230
and all that other stuff, they
will continue to choose that.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.610
But the minute you introduce
a high-salt high-fat food,

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:24.680
their palate changes.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.270
And when they did
a study comparing

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.880
lower socioeconomic
kids and their parents,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.250
and giving them food
choices, the kids actually

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:32.840
chose the healthier foods.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.170
The parents had been so
acclimated to a certain taste

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:38.780
that they chose
the junkier foods.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.990
So a lot of palate
training is happening.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.550
There's a lot that needs
to take place there.

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:46.490
So I think it's
education, again.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:47.324
I think it's change.

00:32:47.324 --> 00:32:49.406
It's got to be change in
our industry and our food

00:32:49.406 --> 00:32:50.030
processing.

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:52.910
And then creating environments
where children can thrive

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:54.416
and adults can thrive as well.

00:32:54.416 --> 00:32:56.040
ARIEL ALTMAN: That's
super interesting.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:56.270
TAZ BHATIA: Yeah.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.936
ARIEL ALTMAN: What's
your view on sugar?

00:32:57.936 --> 00:32:59.000
That's another hot topic.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.880
TAZ BHATIA: [LAUGHING]
So sugar is probably,

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.430
maybe the number one culprit.

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:06.680
Sugar and salt, I think
those are the two things.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.875
And all the different
forms of it.

00:33:08.875 --> 00:33:11.990
So, high fructose corn syrup,
all the different sweeteners

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.336
and fillers, and Splenda,
and all that other stuff,

00:33:14.336 --> 00:33:15.710
is probably the
number one thing.

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:17.595
There is sugar in everything.

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:19.220
So sugar is probably
one of the biggest

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.980
culprits for the
obesity crisis, I think.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.380
And when you go back and
look at food manufacturing

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.945
and you look at what changed.

00:33:25.945 --> 00:33:27.320
There are a couple
of things that

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.600
changed 30 to 40 years ago.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.150
The amount of sugar and
sweeteners is one of them.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.320
The amount of additives
and salt is another.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.370
The third is the use of certain
pesticides and chemicals

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:38.690
in our food manufacturing.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:41.720
Those are probably your
three biggest changes.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.220
ARIEL ALTMAN: And I go
into a grocery store.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.130
And sometimes I'm like,
should I get organic,

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:47.171
should I not get organic?

00:33:47.171 --> 00:33:48.620
Should I get that
type, that type?

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.900
What are your tips,
or what do you

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.116
do when you go food shopping?

00:33:52.116 --> 00:33:53.240
TAZ BHATIA: So what we do--

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.740
I mean, we're the
majority organic.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.690
But I know that
that's hard to sustain

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:58.140
and it's hard to maintain.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.410
But I think it's, again,
the dirtiest foods.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:02.420
The Dirty Dozen,
like on the EWG.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.580
If you want, it's the
Environmental Working Group's

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.770
list, if you want to
familiarize yourself.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.840
Those are worth buying organic.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.929
But here's the challenge.

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:13.370
Even people that are eating
organic and buying organic,

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.409
there's so much
cross-contamination,

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:18.666
that you're still getting
exposed to different chemicals,

00:34:18.666 --> 00:34:20.290
different pesticides,
different things.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:22.839
So, again, that's
why being proactive

00:34:22.839 --> 00:34:25.130
and being in the sort of
integrative functional space I

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:26.094
think is so critical.

00:34:26.094 --> 00:34:28.010
Because it's hard to
control your environment.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:31.110
Even when you're being so
conscious, and so careful,

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.929
and so deliberate
about your choices.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:34.489
Sometimes it's
very difficult just

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:35.630
to control the environment.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:38.360
And our needs are different
than what they were.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.050
We had an infectious disease
problem, maybe 50 years ago.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:44.330
We had different medical issues.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.130
The medical issues
of tomorrow are

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:48.020
going to be environmentally
induced, they're

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.540
going to be toxicity
issues, they're going

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.310
to be diseases of inflammation.

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:54.210
Those are the diseases
of today and tomorrow.

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:55.835
That's why cancer's
on the rise, that's

00:34:55.835 --> 00:34:57.750
why autoimmune disease
is on the rise.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:00.770
So it's just so hard
to navigate the space

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.380
that I think that the more
you know what your body

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.740
chemistry is doing, and you're
being as proactive as you can

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.047
to support it, you're going
to have a better sort of come

00:35:10.047 --> 00:35:10.880
all the way through.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.671
ARIEL ALTMAN: Yeah.

00:35:11.671 --> 00:35:12.410
No, absolutely.

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:14.300
Super, super interesting.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.860
I think we had a question.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:16.430
Yes?

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:17.380
TAZ BHATIA: Awesome.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.463
AUDIENCE: First, thank you
so much for being here.

00:35:19.463 --> 00:35:20.970
I read the book and loved it.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:22.428
And what I really
loved is that you

00:35:22.428 --> 00:35:24.380
made it so accessible
for someone who doesn't

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.105
have a medical background.

00:35:26.105 --> 00:35:28.850
And I would love to hear any
tips or recommendations you

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:32.990
have, given there's just so much
information out there on health

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:34.520
and wellness and medicine.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.190
And you've mentioned,
with being a doctor

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.410
and having a medical
background, being

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:40.889
disconnected from some of that.

00:35:40.889 --> 00:35:42.680
So and recommendations
you have just, like,

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.160
navigating the noise and
knowing what's a credible source

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.682
and where we should
spend our time.

00:35:47.682 --> 00:35:48.640
TAZ BHATIA: Definitely.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.510
I mean, I think that's
probably the hardest

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:54.050
part, is trying to find
the information that you

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:54.800
can rely on.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.599
I think your first step is
to find a medical provider

00:35:57.599 --> 00:35:59.390
that you can have these
conversations with,

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:00.620
quite honestly.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:03.620
I think there there's a lot of
noise in the wellness space.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:07.980
So, again, turning-- not that
I'm trying to our own horns.

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.120
But turning to the integrative
and functional community where

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.100
there's so many great
providers coming along

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.110
and they have worked
really hard at getting

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.570
the conventional training,
but also getting the training

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:19.470
on the other side, so to speak.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:22.120
And understanding how--
where those worlds intersect.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.150
I think that's probably
your most efficient way

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:26.050
of going about it.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.440
Because after that, if you're
trying to navigate, like, well,

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.740
I read this article over here.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:31.600
And it's to take this.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.310
And I did this over here,
and it said to take that.

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:35.684
It's really difficult. That's
why I wrote the Super Woman

00:36:35.684 --> 00:36:36.226
Rx, honestly.

00:36:36.226 --> 00:36:37.600
Because I know
that there are not

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.060
integrative and functional
medicine providers everywhere,

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.104
but at least that's a start.

00:36:42.104 --> 00:36:44.770
At least if you can understand--
and even in the book, remember,

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:47.140
there are labs for you to check.

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:50.756
There's all that information for
you to advocate for yourself,

00:36:50.756 --> 00:36:52.380
when you walk into
the doctor's office.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.070
But I still firmly believe--

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.590
and as many different
types of providers

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:58.600
as there are in the
health and wellness space.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.308
I still really believe
that the physician

00:37:00.308 --> 00:37:03.744
has to sit at that table and has
to help direct those decisions.

00:37:03.744 --> 00:37:06.160
Because the physician ultimately
has the breadth and depth

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.620
of understanding of
how one decision will

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:11.920
play into another and what sort
of all of that relationship is.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.810
So I think finding
a strong provider

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:16.607
who can help you navigate
information will be helpful.

00:37:16.607 --> 00:37:18.190
And then once you
get the main ideas--

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:19.030
this is you.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.140
You understand you.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.900
Then do your digging,
and your research,

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.520
and anything else you want
to do, and read other books.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.640
To gain information
under that main idea.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.530
It's almost like
writing a chapter.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.964
Come out with that main
thesis about yourself.

00:37:31.964 --> 00:37:34.380
And then underneath that, you
can develop things out more.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.420
Because you may then find
things that particular provider

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:38.440
or doctor didn't know.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.760
And that's OK, it's
just digging deeper.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.796
But the confusion
comes when, well,

00:37:42.796 --> 00:37:44.170
do I need to eat
for my adrenals,

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:45.503
or do I need to eat for insulin?

00:37:45.503 --> 00:37:48.080
Or do I need to go paleo,
or vegan, or gluten free?

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.140
That's where the
confusion starts and gets

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:52.427
so frustrating to navigate.

00:37:52.427 --> 00:37:53.218
ARIEL ALTMAN: Yeah.

00:37:53.218 --> 00:37:54.310
Great question.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:55.000
Yes.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.450
AUDIENCE: This is kind
of following up to that.

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.390
But I think you're in
the unique position

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:01.390
of having both Western and
Eastern medical background

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:02.750
and training.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:04.510
What do you see as
the future of sort

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:06.790
of scaling these Eastern
medical practices

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:09.970
across Western medicine
across the country when

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:12.760
so many people are-- it's not
widely accepted, as you said.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.276
And it might not
be as easy for--

00:38:15.276 --> 00:38:16.650
it might not be
easy for everyone

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.500
or accessible to find someone
who's trained in both Eastern

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.200
and medical.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.470
And if someone isn't sure where
to start with their own Eastern

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.164
medical research
and how to apply it

00:38:25.164 --> 00:38:27.580
to Western, what do you see
as the future and the best way

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:28.685
to go about that?

00:38:28.685 --> 00:38:31.210
TAZ BHATIA: So, the
future of the industry,

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:33.460
if you're asking about
that, first, of merging

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:35.780
Eastern and Western
medicine is my passion.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.270
I really feel like
it's my purpose.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:39.380
How do we get this out there?

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.364
How do we get it in the
hands of more people?

00:38:41.364 --> 00:38:43.030
And there are different
ways to do that.

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:45.520
And there are different ways
to bring it into medicine

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.880
and change the medical model.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.350
So there are many of us,
I'm not the only one.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:49.725
But there are many
of us who want

00:38:49.725 --> 00:38:52.570
to change the medical
model and want to see it

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:54.280
more accessible to more folks.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.975
So I think that is
a definite goal.

00:38:56.975 --> 00:38:59.350
And something that you asked
me earlier, what gets me out

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:00.170
of bed in the morning?

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:02.628
I mean, I think that's something
that sort of motivates me.

00:39:02.628 --> 00:39:04.160
For you, that it's
worthless, right?

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.410
Because you're like, OK great.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:08.140
You're going to work on
this for the next 20 years.

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:10.640
Meanwhile, I have to
live the next 20 years.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.080
For you, I think it's,
again, pooling together

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.200
as many different resources
from the two systems.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.090
Or finding providers
like me, there

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:21.850
are others like me,
that do do consults.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:24.656
Sometimes you don't have to be
necessarily here in the city,

00:39:24.656 --> 00:39:26.530
they're remote, or things
like that that help

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.840
provide you at least
foundational framework

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.540
for doing that.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:32.860
And again, the intention of the
book was to do that for you.

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.510
To help you begin
that conversation.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:36.400
And then, again,
underneath that,

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.190
once you understand who you
are and what your needs are,

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:42.040
go ahead get the opinions from
a Chinese medicine practitioner,

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.230
from an Ayurvedic
practitioner, from your doctor.

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:46.220
And merge that
information together.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.550
But ultimately, you want to
find someone to guide you

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:49.450
through that process.

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.550
Because it can get very
overwhelming and confusing

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:54.080
to get information from
so many different places.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.380
So I think it's--

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.660
read the book and see
if that helps you.

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.300
I would say try to find
a practitioner that

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.460
is well versed in both
to give you some guidance

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.510
and direction.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:07.420
And then begin your journey
of exploring different aspects

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.340
of your health so
that you can start

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.417
to put some of that
information together for you.

00:40:11.417 --> 00:40:12.000
AUDIENCE: Hi--

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:12.220
TAZ BHATIA: Hi.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for being here.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.050
I had a quick question about how
you approach that conversation

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:18.700
with older generations.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.610
I think with parents and
grandparents sometimes

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:24.400
it can be harder to have
these types of conversations

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.170
and the education
background-- they're not

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:33.200
as, I guess open to changing
habits or lifestyle.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.680
Have you had older clients
or can talk for experiences

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.735
where you've approached it with
parents or grandparents that

00:40:38.735 --> 00:40:39.610
have been successful?

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:40.760
Or any tip for that?

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.870
TAZ BHATIA: Yeah,
what a great question.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:43.828
I've experienced this
one personally, for sure.

00:40:43.828 --> 00:40:46.430
We do have older patients
that come to the practice,

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:48.130
but they're typically
more engaged.

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:50.546
They've already done a little
bit of digging and research,

00:40:50.546 --> 00:40:52.030
so they're a little
bit more open.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:56.020
Now-- and within our
own family, my dad

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.914
doesn't listen to
anything I say.

00:40:58.914 --> 00:41:00.580
He'll say, OK,
sweetheart, I'll do that.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.380
And I'm sure he
doesn't do any of it.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.960
So, they're tougher because
they come from the generation

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.580
of the doctor was right.

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.130
I'm going to do what the
doctor said and Pharma is best.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:10.480
That's their generation.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.670
So they believe-- and their
medicine is transactional.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:16.510
You go to the doctor, you
get a script in your hand,

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.890
that visit is now complete.

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:19.390
If you did not get
a script in your,

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:21.140
there's no point to the visit.

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.300
So that's the generation
that they came from.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.710
So it's much more challenging.

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:28.210
So the best way to start is two
or three things, I've noticed.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:31.150
Like, hey, why don't you just
try doing these two things?

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.130
And not give them
too much information.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:34.810
I've actually seen
the reverse work.

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:36.401
Like somebody our
age or younger,

00:41:36.401 --> 00:41:37.900
they want the
information, they want

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:39.483
to understand how
everything connects.

00:41:39.483 --> 00:41:41.929
They want to be empowered
and an advocate.

00:41:41.929 --> 00:41:43.720
The older generation
doesn't want all that.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.140
They don't care about the
connection and the big words

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.157
like inflammation
and oxidative stress.

00:41:49.157 --> 00:41:50.740
They're not interested
in any of that.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:53.440
All they want to know is
almost that same transactional

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.970
language.

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:57.220
Your joints hurt, try this.

00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:59.230
And then you give
them two things to do.

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:00.850
And then you follow
back up, maybe

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:03.620
after, give them two weeks,
and see if after two weeks,

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.430
they were able to put those
two things into effect.

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:08.860
So I would think--

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:10.910
transactional is only word
that comes to my mind,

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:12.790
but simple commands.

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:13.940
This hurts, do this.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.310
That's not working, try this.

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:17.290
Do this-- I've noticed
that anytime I sit with

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:20.350
my mother-in-law,
my mom, or my dad--

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:20.884
any of them.

00:42:20.884 --> 00:42:23.050
And they're all so different
in their personalities.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:24.190
But, essentially,
the conversation

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:25.270
always goes the same way.

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:27.850
Anytime I try to
connect the dots,

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:30.850
put the pieces of their health
together, explain all of this,

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:33.750
I lose / So, don't do that.

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.710
Just be very simple
and be very direct.

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:36.910
And see if they feel better.

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:38.710
And oftentimes
they'll get results.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:40.915
And then that motivates
them to move on to step two

00:42:40.915 --> 00:42:42.430
or to step three.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:44.247
So try that.

00:42:44.247 --> 00:42:45.830
ARIEL ALTMAN: Coming
for you, Grandma.

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:47.140
TAZ BHATIA: I know.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.140
Tough!

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.770
Tough crowd.

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:51.280
ARIEL ALTMAN: Yeah, go for it.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:56.020
AUDIENCE: I have a question
on, just, technology again.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.090
So there are so
many apps now that

00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:01.030
can track your steps, or
your workouts, or calories,

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:04.120
or turn down your the
blue light on your screen

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.060
after a certain time.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.100
They have all these
different things.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.160
So I guess, do you
any advice to me,

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.340
people in this room, who may
be designing apps like there?

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.220
Or for the rest of us who
use all of these things.

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:18.610
Like how to navigate it,
how to design better,

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:21.376
how to incorporate
a holistic thing?

00:43:21.376 --> 00:43:22.750
Because I think
it, right now, it

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:24.395
gives almost a false
sense of control.

00:43:24.395 --> 00:43:25.270
TAZ BHATIA: Security.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.095
Like, oh, well, like, my phone
told me to stand up today.

00:43:28.095 --> 00:43:29.050
So, like, I'm great.

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:31.452
Like I'm on going on
a fitness journey.

00:43:31.452 --> 00:43:33.160
TAZ BHATIA: That's
such a great question.

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.170
And I have seen that.

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:35.505
People rely on their data.

00:43:35.505 --> 00:43:37.130
They come in the room
and they're like,

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:37.820
well, let me show you.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.020
I know I'm getting REM sleep,
because my sleep tracker

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.144
says I'm getting REM sleep.

00:43:41.144 --> 00:43:45.310
I'm like, why is your
sleep tracker in your room?

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:46.570
I see that all the time.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:48.050
It's good and bad.

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:49.960
It's not all it's not
all either direction.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.640
It's good because
you're getting data.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.260
You're getting information.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.480
You're getting sort of an
initial look at what you're

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:56.500
doing.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.750
But it's bad because it's
not the whole picture.

00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:59.770
That's the bad part.

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.240
So I think anyone
who's designing,

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.327
anytime they can design--

00:44:02.327 --> 00:44:03.910
and I challenge
myself with this, too.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:06.010
Anytime you can
design to where you're

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.350
trying to bring in the
whole picture in some form

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:08.890
or fashion.

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:10.540
If you're designing
a sleep tracker,

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.000
well maybe ask a few more
questions around sleep.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.030
Just because they
checked off on they

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:18.130
got this many hours of REM
sleep does not necessarily

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:20.350
mean that they're healthy
or that all that sleep

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:21.660
quality was good.

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.654
So it may be working
with somebody

00:44:23.654 --> 00:44:25.570
who has sort of this
well-rounded approach who

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:28.450
can bring more of the whole
picture into any of these.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:31.120
And then take taking some of
these folks who are using data

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.310
and using apps
through workflows.

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:34.900
That if this is
happening, then you

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.650
may want to consider
this, this, and this.

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:38.731
Not turning into
a doctor's office,

00:44:38.731 --> 00:44:41.230
necessarily, but, hey, have a
conversation with your doctor.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:42.896
You might want to get
your labs checked.

00:44:42.896 --> 00:44:45.030
Or you may need to
drink more water.

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:46.190
You know, whatever it is.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.820
But having more
well-rounded approach,

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:51.490
where other than just fixating
on one or two data points,

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:54.310
is going to help the patient on
the other end of that be more

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:57.050
successful in the long run.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:58.840
So I don't know if
that was helpful.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.340
ARIEL ALTMAN: No,
it is interesting.

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.810
Because there are
so many different--

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:02.600
TAZ BHATIA: There are
so many right now.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.340
ARIEL ALTMAN: --apps, now.

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:05.020
Just because you hit
your steps doesn't

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.775
mean that you're healthy.

00:45:06.775 --> 00:45:08.699
[LAUGHING] At all.

00:45:08.699 --> 00:45:10.990
TAZ BHATIA: It's a great way
to check in with yourself.

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:14.200
But it's not accomplishing,
like, who am I,

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.880
what are my main needs?

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.060
What do I need to build
under that main idea?

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:21.310
ARIEL ALTMAN: And I know you
went over it in the book.

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:23.710
But if I was going to go
get a blood test tomorrow,

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:27.182
what would be the two
or three top signals

00:45:27.182 --> 00:45:28.390
that I should be looking for?

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:30.430
TAZ BHATIA: So, I mean I
can answer that very easily.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:33.040
I think the number one thing
we're not taking for routinely,

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.460
which every doctor should be
checking every patient for,

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:36.969
are inflammation markers.

00:45:36.969 --> 00:45:39.010
They're easy to do, they're
covered by insurance.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:43.780
But checking like a CRP,
ESR, which is a sed rate,

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:44.620
and a homocysteine.

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.750
Those three things you should
be doing every six months.

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:48.580
Because to me, those are
the earliest warnings

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:50.996
that something is wrong with
your body and something's not

00:45:50.996 --> 00:45:51.584
quite right.

00:45:51.584 --> 00:45:53.750
And then the investigative
work can come after that.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:54.333
So that's one.

00:45:54.333 --> 00:45:56.500
For women, I think
it's so critical

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:57.850
to look at your hormone levels.

00:45:57.850 --> 00:45:59.599
I talk about this all
throughout the book.

00:45:59.599 --> 00:46:02.270
Looking at estrogen,
progesterone, thyroid.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:03.744
The derivatives
of those hormones

00:46:03.744 --> 00:46:06.160
because then it tells us what
your body's doing with them.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.132
And you want to do
them periodically.

00:46:08.132 --> 00:46:09.340
Because you want to track it.

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.500
Speaking of data, you want
to be able to track it.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.666
Because what's normal for
you, is not normal for me.

00:46:13.666 --> 00:46:16.330
So you know you might feel
really good at a TSH of two,

00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:18.370
but I feel good at a TSH of one.

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:20.680
So when, five years from
now, you have a baby,

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.530
or something happens and your
TSH shifts and you're, quote

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:25.630
unquote, "normal" by
the conventional range,

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:27.760
but you feel like crap,
then we can go look back.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.260
And say, oh, no,
no that's not where

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:30.740
your TSH needs to be for you.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.187
So I think tracking
this data, tracking

00:46:33.187 --> 00:46:35.020
these labs, that's the
beauty of technology,

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.870
is tracking it over the
course of your lifespan.

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:40.240
And knowing where you felt
great, where you didn't feel

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.050
so good.

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:43.720
And it also helps you
later when you guys enter

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.880
sort of the anti-aging
or, kind of,

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.620
the more prevention
conversation.

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:51.774
Because then we know where to
correct you back to, as well.

00:46:51.774 --> 00:46:52.690
ARIEL ALTMAN: Totally.

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:54.190
I love it.

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:55.660
Well, thank you so much--

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:56.050
TAZ BHATIA: Thank you, fun.

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:57.070
ARIEL ALTMAN: --for coming.

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:58.420
I know we're all really excited.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.250
So give an applause for Dr. Taz.

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:01.166
TAZ BHATIA: Thank you!

00:47:01.166 --> 00:47:03.900
[APPLAUSE]
