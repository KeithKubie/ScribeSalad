1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,460
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,020
but the celebrity aspect of basketball
is so huge. And like in baseball,

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,910
not baseball. I can't, yeah, you're a
rod and it's still theirs. But five,

4
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:14,070
10 min, Max, 10 guys on the court.

5
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:17,260
And if you do anything cameras right
on your face. Yeah. Versus you.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,980
Here's the thing about baseball.
This was pointed out to me,

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,920
the website deadspin did this thing
where they were like pointing out the

8
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,260
problem with baseball today. They
went around, they ask people, Hey,

9
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:27,990
can you name what's the most famous
baseball player that you could name?

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,250
And people were like, Derek Jeter, a
rod, big Papi, Manny, Manny Ramirez,

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,970
retired guys. And if you ask people they
could match. If they're a baseball fan,

12
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:37,080
they'd say,
someone from my team,

13
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:39,960
or maybe they'd say Mike Trout or they'd
say one of the guys on the Yankees.

14
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,210
Right. But there is no a rod [inaudible]
like level celebrity right now.

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,870
What happened? I don't know
exactly. I can't. I'm steroids
given back the steroids.

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,190
No one's getting hurt.
What the fuck is the problem?

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,070
We're not talking about fighting,
we're talking about baseball.

18
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:57,120
Give him the steroids.

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,210
The best part about that stupid
games with someone hits the ball.

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,870
Does the steroids make them hit the ball
better? Yes. Okay. We'll give it to him.

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,500
Yeah. The fuck are you guys doing testing
for that? Performance enhancing drugs,

22
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,230
man are the craziest
the debate about that.

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,110
We've never done this on the show
because I, so I'm not like, um,

24
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,910
you shouldn't fully boned up.
I would like to,

25
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:18,240
I've thought about it in the past
cause cause the, the divisions,

26
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,070
it's like the rest of the drug war,
right?

27
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,910
The divisions we make between the things
that are acceptable and not acceptable

28
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:28,710
are so arbitrary. Right? So the example
I always use is like, okay, why don't,

29
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,540
why don't we like it?
Performance enhancing drugs.

30
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,820
Not everyone has access to
them. So they're unfair. Right.

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,060
There are bad for your health and we
think they're on natural. Right. Okay.

32
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,820
So yeah, they're, yeah,
they're cheating. Yeah.

33
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:42,300
Well those are the reasons why we think
they're cheating. Right? Well it's also,

34
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:44,640
but there's some drugs you can
take that aren't cheating. Right?

35
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,280
Like you could take advantage
is the reason why it's cheating.

36
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,450
That's the primary reason. So here's, so
let me give you a counter example. Um, uh,

37
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:55,410
for runners, right? Uh, for endurance
athletes, like I like running,

38
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:57,690
I'm a shitty runner, but I like
it. I think it's a fun sport. Um,

39
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:01,800
so I follow it a little bit. Uh,
so runners, endurance, you know,

40
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:06,100
the big thing is like how much you're, how
much oxygen your blood can hold, right?

41
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,360
If you train at a high altitude,
then you can increase that. Right?

42
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:11,580
So there are these runners,
the American runners, right?

43
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,790
They live at a high altitude,
they live super high up, you know,

44
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,200
in Colorado or whatever. Right? And
then when they're not there, they train.

45
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:21,930
They're all year round. They buy a place
there. And then when they're not there,

46
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:22,830
when they're competing somewhere else,

47
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:27,510
they sleep in a chamber that
simulates low altitude. Right.

48
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,540
How is that not the same thing as taking
a performance enhancing drug? Like they,

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,120
they, you know, that's not a, it's
not illegal to do that. Right? Right.

50
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,720
It's unnatural,
right?

51
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,140
It is an unfair advantage
because not everybody can
afford one of those chambers.

52
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,210
And I'm not gonna say it's bad
for your health. I don't know.

53
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:45,840
But it's certainly as weird for your body
is taking a drug I would think. Right.

54
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,570
So why it's not.
Why do we draw the line?

55
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:52,160
Cause it's only like living it out to two.
It's really just simulates low out.

56
00:02:52,161 --> 00:02:54,810
So it's not like taking the CEO EPO,

57
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:57,930
which would be the drug that would
simulate that which I've got recent

58
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,920
experience with. Not Personally, but

59
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,780
because of the UFC just had one of its
champions stripped because of testing

60
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:08,560
positive for EPO and then
we're just finding out now
they don't test for EPO and

61
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:12,820
everybody that it's very expensive and
so they do it based on the athlete's

62
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:16,720
biological passport and what they think
are changing variables that you know,

63
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,590
for whatever reason it triggers their,

64
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,000
their interest and they start testing.
Additionally, it's a big deal to, it's a,

65
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:25,990
it's a serious drug.

66
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,780
I mean it's a serious endurance drug
but also has like some serious health

67
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,360
complications.
People have died from taking it.

68
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,600
A young guys in their twenties in cycling
have gotten strokes and died from EPO,

69
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,580
but there's no health negative effects
of sleeping at altitude. It's just,

70
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,740
couldn't you afford to live there? Can you
uproot your life? No. If you can't, yeah,

71
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,800
it's an advantage for that person over
you. So I'm just saying we, we have, uh,

72
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,080
we have sort of an are like,
yeah,

73
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,640
it's sort of an arbitrary w where we're
drawing the lines is not consistent and

74
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,230
it's kind of one that is a big one.
Does that in terms of uh,

75
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,140
the impact on endurance,
it is a big one.

76
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,840
They actually saying now
that they think the best, um,

77
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,320
best course of strategy is to train
at low altitude and then sleep at high

78
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:15,460
altitude. They think that when you train
at low altitude, you have more output.

79
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,000
So you're putting in more repetitions
because you get more oxygen so you have

80
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:23,510
more work and then you get the same
effect by living at [inaudible].

81
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,670
So you get, you'd get up there and sleep
and you don't have to train up there.

82
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:28,451
And if you train up there,

83
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:32,380
it's actually slightly less valuable
than training at low altitude and staying

84
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:34,570
up there damn cause whatever.
I'm whenever,

85
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:38,770
whenever I'm stands in more high alto
like I just did a weekend in Denver and I

86
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:42,010
was like going on a run up there and it
was like obviously torture compared to

87
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:45,190
like being here in la but I was like oh
I'm getting strong cause I'm running at

88
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:47,890
high altitude. That's not true.
That really fucks with me.

89
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,490
Well you just really simple
for me. Thank you. It's work.

90
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,270
It will help you but it's if you are
a net like athletes or we're literally

91
00:04:55,271 --> 00:05:00,271
working for one or 2% of an advantage
occasionally on many occasions when you

92
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:05,980
are living at high altitude
and training at sea level,

93
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:10,960
they think that that gives you a slight
advantage because you can put more work

94
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:12,670
in,
especially for fighters.

95
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,560
They think that skill work and repetitions
and drilling is one of the most

96
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:20,950
important aspects of it and you can
just simply get in more repetitions.

97
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,840
You get in more drills. Yeah. But they,
you know, again though, you're right,

98
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,570
cause this is sort of a
performance enhancing thing.

99
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:33,400
You're not just living and just being
yourself and then showing up and

100
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:34,120
competing.

101
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,650
You are engaging in this activity that
re significantly raises your red blood

102
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:43,330
cells, significantly raises your
oxygen capacity, Changes Your Cardio,

103
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,590
your vo two Max changes. No. Here's,
here's the weird thing is just this,

104
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,800
there's this weird idea
in sports and look,

105
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,470
you know shit love more about athlete
athletics. Cause then I do, it's not my,

106
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:55,550
it's not my real forte but I do,
I do enjoy.

107
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,160
And the thing that's
always weird to me is that

108
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,840
we have this idea that like there's some
kind of level playing field that the,

109
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:04,400
there's this like baseline
human that we can just say,

110
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:07,190
well you've got to be at the baseline.
Right? Yeah. And humans are so variable.

111
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,870
You're always going to
find these weird cases.

112
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:12,110
And when you try to adjudicate it gets
really weird. Like, do you know about,

113
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:16,360
you know, Castro's Romania?
Do you know who she is? No.
Uh, no. I do know this story,

114
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,470
this story pisses me off so much.
So she's a, she's not a marathoner.

115
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,470
She's a middle distance runner. I
believe she's south, South African. Um,

116
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,770
she's like the best in the world
at the 200 meters. You know,

117
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:31,880
I actually got to see her
because, uh, my, uh, uh,

118
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:34,640
I went to the Prefontaine
classic in Eugene,

119
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:37,610
Oregon with my dad to like watch the big
track meet, you know, best in the world.

120
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,420
People, this is like a Olympics,
you know, not qualifier,

121
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,910
but it's like the Olympic caliber
athletes saw her. She's incredible.

122
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:48,500
Just like one of the best in
the world. She's got, um, a,

123
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,120
uh, uh, she,

124
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:54,980
her whole life has faced
accusations that she, uh, that her,

125
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,650
that she's a man basically,
um,

126
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,080
because she has like an elevated level
of testosterone and this is their natural

127
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:03,650
body. Right? And so she's had to deal
with people saying, oh, we gotta,

128
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,950
we gotta do a, do a sex check on
you, which is humiliating and like,

129
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,820
also completely unscientific, you know,
like, what, what are they going to do? Um,

130
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,970
and, uh, like a sex check. We want
to look at her genitals. Well,

131
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:16,550
here's the weird thing, man, is that,
yeah, they want to look at her genitals,

132
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:19,100
first of all, which is humiliating to
have that happen. If you're an athlete,

133
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:23,120
you're like, people have to be in the
room. This is, this is the problem, right?

134
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:26,180
How do you judicate that? Right?
Right. And also, there's such a thing,

135
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,490
I don't know anything about
her personal situation, right.

136
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,380
There's such a thing as Intersex people,
right?

137
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:33,230
Where when you look at their genitals,
you can't tell. It's not like, hey,

138
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,200
just look at their junk. And you can
tell, right. This is a real phenomenon.

139
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:40,070
Like 1% of people are Intersex,
right? [inaudible] hi. Uh, I,

140
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,130
I was speaking off the top of my head,
but it's higher than you think. You know,

141
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:45,290
it's definitely hard. It's a non
zero number of people, right?

142
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:50,000
Intersex people are a real
thing. Um, and so, uh, so,

143
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,100
but so she got past that,
right?

144
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:55,040
They stopped challenging whether she
was like a man or a woman. They did it,

145
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:59,310
but it was on toast center.
Uh, I think you might be
right. Yeah. Um, but so she's,

146
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:03,870
she's had to deal with that. That's not
fair, right? She's a physical outlet.

147
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:06,710
She's a physical outlier.
And now the IAF,

148
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,580
which is the organization that runs
all, it's like FIFA for track, right?

149
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:14,090
They run all track.
They have tried to put forward a rule.

150
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:16,580
I don't know what the status is right now
because it's being challenged, but, um,

151
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,340
they've tried to put forward a rule that
says if you have a testosterone level

152
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:20,210
over a certain amount,

153
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:25,211
you have to take a hormone changing
clothes to change your hormones and she's

154
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:26,210
going to fall under that.

155
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,950
And so they literally want to change
the body that she was born with because

156
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:35,720
they're saying your body is unfair
to her. How fucked up is that? Right?

157
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:39,230
It's crazy. It's really, really
fucked up. And, and so the thing is,

158
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:42,110
when we make those decisions about
what's fair and what's not fair,

159
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,830
there's no baseline.
Human is always a value judgment.

160
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:48,470
And when we're excluding some people,
that's almost all,

161
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:50,630
we always need to look at that and say,
are we discriminating?

162
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,900
They're definitely discriminating against
Castro, Romania. And is this the IOC?

163
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:57,660
That's what does doing this. I A F,
which is the IOC is the Olympics.

164
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:00,360
IAV Olympics aren't doing this,
so they don't have an issue with her.

165
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,090
I don't know what the Olympic policy is.
The Olympics is fucked up.

166
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:04,170
We do a whole episode on the Olympics.

167
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:05,720
The Olympics is fucked
up in a lot of ways too.
