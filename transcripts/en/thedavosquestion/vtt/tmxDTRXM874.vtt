00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
&gt;&gt; Role models are very important almost in
any culture with respect to young people.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.360
&gt;&gt; The first quality is the person must be
attractive. An attractive person gains a lot

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.550
of attention and that is what is required
of a role model.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.439
&gt;&gt; The best thing I like it in my role model
it's he's human more than anything else. He

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:26.339
made a mistake and he can share his mistake
and his life with me.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.029
&gt;&gt; The second quality is the person needs
to be charismatic.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.840
&gt;&gt; There's a desperate need for role models
who will lead the region to the path of success

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.871
and will inspire people living in it.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:43.660
&gt;&gt; Third quality, which is the role model,
needs to be representing the group and not

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.979
representing themselves.

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:51.129
&gt;&gt; We need a leader, of role models of our
own, of our generation. So I think by having

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.379
such a role model it will bring a big revolution
in the sense that it will give, bring us,

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.012
a lot of talent to improve the Middle East.

00:00:59.012 --> 00:01:04.339
&gt;&gt; The last and final quality which is dedication
perseverance.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:12.560
&gt;&gt; Strong morals and good character. The desire
and determination for global peace and equality.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.350
And environmental and economical awareness.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.680
&gt;&gt; So what we want to do is essentially create
role models that youth, to show even at a

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.220
young age can achieve. Raising the bar because,
so the Middle East can be in the global picture

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.409
of accomplishments and achievements.
