00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.090
A controlled experience is kind of
the Holy Grail of scientific research.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.650
In human subjects research, a controlled
experiment is where we get some

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.450
participants, randomly assign
them to certain conditions and

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.560
then treat each condition
in a different way.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.660
What we do to each condition
is called a treatment and

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.250
then each group of participants
is called a condition.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.840
Typically we have
a control condition and

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.310
an experimental condition where
the experimental condition

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.100
is where we're trying out something
that we're interested in.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.260
Controlled experiments give really,
really nice generalizable and

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.380
clean results, but they're also
very difficult to do in education.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.150
Usually in education,
we're working in real classrooms,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.460
where we don't have the power
to randomly assign people.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.870
And usually we'll want to do things that
last several weeks or several months.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.000
And it's difficult to control for

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.320
everything when we're doing
controlled experiments.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.768
But if you're interested in doing
a controlled experiment, in this lesson

00:00:43.768 --> 00:00:45.948
we'll talk about the different
things that you need to be aware of,

00:00:45.948 --> 00:00:47.479
different tools that
are available to you, and

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.260
different things you need to
make sure to control for.
