00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:09.250
SPEAKER 1: Thanks, everyone,
for coming to this event.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.590
This is a Talks at Google
event in partnership

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.670
with [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.000
And we are thrilled to
have the national tour

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.940
cast of "Hamilton" here.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:27.290
So a little background on how
"Hamilton, an American Musical"

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.520
came to be.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.740
It started in 2004,
when a historian

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.300
named Ron Chernow actually
published a biography

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.012
of Alexander Hamilton.

00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:38.720
There hadn't really
been many biographies

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.170
written about him, at least
in the previous few decades.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.380
And in this biography,
it talks about Hamilton

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.540
from his immigration
to the United

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.430
States from the
Caribbean as an orphan,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.240
his joining the
American Revolution,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.430
and ultimately becoming
one of the founding fathers

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.840
of our country.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.259
And Lin-Manuel Miranda,
who was previously

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:00.800
doing "In the Heights"
at that time--

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.069
he was actually on vacation,
and was reading the book.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:08.649
And the themes of the
book stuck with him,

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.940
and he really wanted to tell
this story to more people,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.720
because it's a great story.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.430
And he wrapped that into a more
modern retelling, which started

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.050
out as a mixtape, actually.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.640
And you can look
it up on YouTube,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.040
when he originally played
this for the Obamas,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.890
actually, in the White House.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.980
And from the mix tape, it
went off Broadway in 2015,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.470
then eventually went onto
Broadway later that year.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.950
The Chicago company
started in 2016.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.800
And then 2017 kicked
off the Angelica tour,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.400
which is the national United
States tour of the play.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.170
And we are thrilled to be here.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.542
So it started in San Francisco.

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:47.000
We've been lucky to have them
here for about five months so

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.020
far, at the SHN.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.982
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:48.982 --> 00:01:51.387
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:51.387 --> 00:01:52.764
It's still here
for another week.

00:01:52.764 --> 00:01:53.930
If you haven't seen it yet--

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.740
I mean, hopefully most people
have been able to see it.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.080
But there's about another
week of performances, right?

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.810
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
Week and a half.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.143
SPEAKER 1: So definitely see
it before then, and if not,

00:02:01.143 --> 00:02:04.490
it's going to LA next, and
that's close plane ride.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.350
So without further ado,
let's welcome Ruben Carbajal

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.316
and Ryan Alvarado.

00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:10.816
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:12.244
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Thank you.

00:02:12.244 --> 00:02:16.519
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.810
SPEAKER 1: So I was wondering
if you guys could kick it

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.970
off just talking a little
bit about the characters

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.810
that you play.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.240
Some people in the audience
might have seen the show,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.260
some might not have.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.960
But a little bit about the
character or characters

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.826
that you guys play in the show.

00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:31.950
And then give us a little
fun fact about yourselves

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.790
if you have one.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.706
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: OK.

00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:34.995
Oh, cool.

00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:37.540
Hi, everyone, thank you
so much for having us.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.010
It's an honor to be here,
and to see all of you here.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.870
It's awesome.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.210
My name is Ruben J. Carbajal.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.410
I play two roles in "Hamilton."

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.790
I play John Laurens
and Philip Hamilton.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.360
So in act one I get to
play John Laurens, who

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.010
was a Revolutionary War hero.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.520
And in the world of the play,
he's Hamilton's best friend.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.950
I'd say he's his best one.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.090
So and then in--

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.400
Some may argue.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.220
And then in act two, I get
to play Hamilton's son,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.000
Philip Hamilton, his first son.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.530
Yeah, fun fact.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.028
Oh, man, you told me to
think about it, and I forgot.

00:03:23.028 --> 00:03:25.210
SPEAKER 1: Interesting or fun.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.340
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: I've been
dancing Mexican folk dancing

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.525
since I was three years old.

00:03:30.525 --> 00:03:31.316
AUDIENCE: Whoo-hoo!

00:03:31.316 --> 00:03:31.820
RYAN ALVARADO: What?

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:32.820
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Yeah.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.636
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:33.636 --> 00:03:34.900
SPEAKER 1: That's why
these things are good.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.790
Stuff like that comes out.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.998
RYAN ALVARADO: I don't have
anything as cool as that.

00:03:37.998 --> 00:03:38.530
My goodness.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.740
I'm Ryan Alvarado.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.270
I'm a principal standby in the
Angelica company of "Hamilton."

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.480
I'm responsible for covering
Alexander Hamilton, Aaron

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.810
Burr, King George III.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.030
Yeah, that's what I do.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.821
SPEAKER 1: One person
who runs three parts.

00:03:55.821 --> 00:04:00.970
RYAN ALVARADO: Yeah, and
slightly less interesting--

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.242
yeah, I was going to say
that I was born in the Bronx.

00:04:05.242 --> 00:04:05.950
I'm Puerto Rican.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.500
My parents are from Puerto Rico.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.500
Hey, hola.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.582
And wow, I did not grow
up Mexican folk dancing,

00:04:13.582 --> 00:04:14.290
but I wish I did.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.019
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: I'm
sorry, that's the first thing

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:16.621
I thought of.

00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:17.620
RYAN ALVARADO: No, yeah.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.161
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
I didn't mean to--

00:04:19.161 --> 00:04:21.240
RYAN ALVARADO: And I'm
an avid hip hop fan.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.500
I enjoy-- obviously.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.741
But yeah.

00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:26.240
Hi.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.794
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:27.794 --> 00:04:29.210
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
You have a dog.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.580
RYAN ALVARADO: I do have a dog.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.000
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: That's
really interesting.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.600
RYAN ALVARADO: I have a dog.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.970
SPEAKER 1: Is the
dog on tour with you?

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:32.886
RYAN ALVARADO: She is.

00:04:32.886 --> 00:04:33.606
She is, yes.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:34.980
She's sick at the
moment, I know.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.667
[GROANS]

00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:36.750
I was fielding some texts.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.541
But yeah, she's OK.

00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:38.395
She's OK.

00:04:38.395 --> 00:04:40.020
SPEAKER 1: First
question for you guys.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.520
As I mentioned, "Hamilton"
premiered in 2015 on Broadway,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.760
and made this huge
cultural splash back then.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.010
I'm interested in hearing
what your guy's exposure was

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.840
to the play when
it first came out,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.220
when you weren't part of it.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.670
And then how was stepping into
those roles, and those shoes,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.670
of the likes of Anthony Ramos,
and Jonathan Groff, and such?

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.320
Did you have any
contact with them?

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.220
How did you train
up on those roles?

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.700
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Well, I
first heard about the show

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.520
when it was still a glimmer
of a show, when it was still

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.770
the "Hamilton Mixtape."

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.250
I had been a huge fan of
Lin-Manuel Miranda's work.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.730
And growing up, I became very
invested in his musical "In

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.600
the Heights."

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.110
I got to see it at the Pantages
with Lin starring in it, which

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.700
was awesome and inspiring.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.780
I became obsessed with his
work, and with musical theater

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.250
in general because of
that show, and I just

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.450
started Googling everything
I knew about him.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.914
And this-- oh, Goo--

00:05:49.914 --> 00:05:51.396
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:51.396 --> 00:05:53.844
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:53.844 --> 00:05:56.010
SPEAKER 1: It's nice when
it's unintentional, right?

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.060
It's become such a
big part of my life.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.486
SPEAKER 1: That's
cool, that's cool.

00:05:59.486 --> 00:05:59.912
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
Thank you all.

00:05:59.912 --> 00:06:01.235
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:01.235 --> 00:06:02.297
Oh my gosh.

00:06:02.297 --> 00:06:03.880
I didn't get paid
for that, I promise.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.620
So yeah.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.250
I just was on the
computer, and I

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.110
came across this video of him
doing this thing at the White

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.610
House.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.020
And I was like, what is that?

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.010
Like, a rap about Alexander
Hamilton-- people laughed.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:24.230
I mean, if the way he
introduced it was he said,

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.430
I think something about somebody
who embodied hip hop for him,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.460
and he said it was
Alexander Hamilton.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.050
And so I got very
interested in that.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.580
And then it kind of was
quiet for a little bit,

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.830
because they were
still working on it.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.860
And then I knew
that it was going

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.224
to be off-Broadway in New York,
so I tried to get tickets.

00:06:47.224 --> 00:06:48.890
And I was in New York
a couple of times,

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.830
and it just didn't work out.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.990
And then it went to Broadway.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.630
And then they were
like, oh, we're

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.080
also going to do a Chicago
production and a national tour.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.120
So I was like, well,
how do I audition?

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.330
How do I do I get into it?

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.830
So yeah.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.420
I mean, when I saw that
the musical was going

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:17.630
to be what it is, which is
the story of America then told

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.400
as American now, with people
of color in these roles,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.890
I was like, I think
I fit right in.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:29.730
I mean, looks-wise, I think so.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.190
I'm a Mexican-American,
first generation.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.600
So I was like, this
is perfect, and this

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.810
is such an amazing story.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.910
And I think that with the cast
recording coming out shortly

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.360
after that, I just
became obsessed.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.240
It was just like always
playing, I knew all the words

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.260
within the first month.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:53.930
And yeah, I didn't actually get
to see it until late last year,

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.065
because it was so dang
hard to get a ticket.

00:07:56.065 --> 00:07:56.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.580
SPEAKER 1: Even the
inside people, wow.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.440
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.690
I was in and out of
auditions last year,

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.150
and to finally get
that call that I

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.210
was going to be a part of the
show that I have looked up to,

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.264
and the show that has affected
the lives of so many people--

00:08:11.264 --> 00:08:11.930
it was an honor.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:18.380
And so getting to talk with
some of the original cast--

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.800
I got to meet Chris
Jackson, who played

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.320
George Washington in
the original company,

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.470
and who has worked
with Lin dating back

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.240
to "In the Heights."

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.360
And speaking with him and what
he had to say about the show,

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:38.280
and how important it is,
and how lucky we are to--

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.594
I want to say be
alive right now, but--

00:08:40.594 --> 00:08:41.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:46.325
How lucky we are to be this
close to something so powerful.

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:48.336
RYAN ALVARADO: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:48.336 --> 00:08:50.540
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
That just gave me

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.110
all the inspiration I
needed to go and conquer

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.420
what I set out to do.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.150
But yeah, that's
been sort of my story

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.420
with the show in a nutshell.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.790
I'll let Ryan share his.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.940
RYAN ALVARADO: Oh, mine
is actually very similar.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.680
My introduction to Lin's world
was through "In the Heights."

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.300
I was fortunate enough to do
that work a couple of times.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.775
And it's one of those
things where yeah, it's

00:09:19.775 --> 00:09:21.150
modern tellings
of a great story.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.060
"In the Heights" is
telling the Latin story,

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.020
which I connect to it.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.030
I relate it to everything
that I saw on stage.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.770
And it was a great
honor and a privilege

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.750
and a pleasure to
perform in the show.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.890
Once you're in them, one
thing that Lin does--

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.260
and if you've seen the show--

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.926
no matter what the
story, there's always

00:09:34.926 --> 00:09:37.130
a great heart at the core.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.220
It's really about people.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.550
It's really about connections.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.840
And the work facilitates that.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.682
So it's always called me.

00:09:43.682 --> 00:09:45.140
I think it's called
most of us that

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.870
have made it to do
the work, and be

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:53.210
in this production of "Hamilton"
in some way or another.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.174
That's what I saw when
I was fortunate enough

00:09:55.174 --> 00:09:57.590
to see the original Broadway
company before there was even

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:58.340
a cast recording.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.215
And so I definitely--

00:09:59.215 --> 00:10:00.500
I like to know the words.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.630
I'm sure many of you
were told or warned

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.030
that a lot of information is
about to be thrown at you.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.190
Maybe you want to listen
to this cast recording,

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.457
and get a head start on it.

00:10:08.457 --> 00:10:10.790
I didn't even have the option,
but I did want to see it.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.110
So I saw it, I was
moved, I was thrown.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:23.870
It was a very big moment in
my artistic life, and growing.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.880
And similar, yeah, it
just kind of called to me,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.590
and I saw my spot.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:32.671
And I could taste it, you
know, and similar, and the work

00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:33.170
began.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:37.220
The cast recording came out
not too long after I saw it,

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.500
and I just started
like dedicating myself

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:46.330
to the distance between
me now and me then,

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.680
in terms of what I needed to do
to really maximize my chances

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.640
at getting this opportunity.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:58.240
So that was my way in,
and that's my connection.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.694
And as I do it now,
that's the greatest part,

00:11:00.694 --> 00:11:02.110
is getting to
connect with people.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.940
And we do this work, and
people love it, and it's great.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.210
But the thing that
I take from it

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.600
is the camaraderie,
the family that we

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.880
built through this
work, and then

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.830
the connection of the
people that see it

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.720
and understanding like
what it does for them.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.170
And that in turn does
even more for us,

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.322
to know that you can
be in the audience,

00:11:23.322 --> 00:11:25.030
and you're going to
have that same moment

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.590
that I had when I saw it.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:30.790
But now, I get to be
part of the gift givers.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.710
And that's a blessing
in and of itself.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:36.190
It's a constant reminder,
just being in rooms like this.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.020
And I'm constantly grateful.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:38.520
We all are.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.037
We're always thanking our lucky
stars together in big groups.

00:11:42.037 --> 00:11:43.120
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Always.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.120
RYAN ALVARADO: You know.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.720
But yeah.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.980
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Cool.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.340
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.320
Ruben, you touched a
little bit on the actual

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.520
trying out process.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.240
I'm interested.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.580
I don't think many of us in
this room have done theater.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.522
And what all entails of
trying out for a part?

00:11:58.522 --> 00:11:59.480
Like, how do you apply?

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.030
Do you send a resume somewhere?

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.660
Like, how do you
get from that to--

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:03.590
I don't know.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.535
Like, we do coding
interviews and stuff here.

00:12:05.535 --> 00:12:07.618
RYAN ALVARADO: It's a lot
like the "Hunger Games."

00:12:07.618 --> 00:12:09.010
SPEAKER 1: "Hunger Games," OK.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.470
What was it like for you guys
going through the process

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.520
of being on the outside, and
then going through this "Hunger

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.140
Games"-likesque process of
becoming part of the show?

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.670
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
Yeah, step one

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.000
was just to find out where and
when the audition was actually

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.210
going to be held.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.390
I have an awesome
representation.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.310
So my agency--

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.630
I got to contact
them and say, hey,

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.280
this is what I'm interested in.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.210
If there's any way that I
can audition for this show

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.660
I would love it, because
it's what I want to do.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.550
I think that me along
with everybody in SoCal

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.620
had the same idea, because those
agent appointments were booked.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.140
They were like, we tried.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.275
There's just no room.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.670
SPEAKER 1: So they
had regional tryouts?

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.170
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Yeah,
I auditioned in LA.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.470
I know they had some
in Dallas, and I

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.830
think Atlanta maybe had some.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:09.250
But yeah, they were
all over the country.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.720
For me, looking at that, I
was like this is overwhelming.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.530
There's so many people that
are going to go audition.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.960
Because I wasn't able to
get an initial appointment,

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.880
I went to the open call.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.990
So it's just like we
were at United Methodist

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.130
Church in Hollywood.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.360
The line was snaking through
this humongous parking lot.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:36.200
I think in total, it was about
700 to 1,000 people showed up.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.882
I was saying earlier,
it kind of felt

00:13:37.882 --> 00:13:39.340
like "American
Idol." it was like--

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:39.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.851
I went into the room,
and they were like, OK,

00:13:44.851 --> 00:13:46.850
the audition was supposed
to be about 30 seconds

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.380
of a nonmusical theater song.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.950
So immediately I'm like, OK,
well "Hamilton" is hip hop,

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.860
it's rap, there's some
singing involved too.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.929
So let me think
outside of the box,

00:13:59.929 --> 00:14:01.720
because a lot of the
times, I'm auditioning

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.980
with musical theater pieces.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:10.030
So I pick my song, and I sang
"Billionaire," by Bruno Mars.

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.080
And did like some of
the rap and stuff.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.370
So I was feeling myself,
and I was like, all right,

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:14.690
we're going--

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:15.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.170
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Let's get it.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.760
I went and did my thing.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.894
And then I went from
one room to the next,

00:14:22.894 --> 00:14:24.685
and they were like,
here's this red ticket.

00:14:24.685 --> 00:14:26.260
So I'm like, this
is "American Idol."

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.345
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:27.345 --> 00:14:27.845
If not--

00:14:27.845 --> 00:14:29.553
RYAN ALVARADO: Or the
ticket's a counter.

00:14:29.553 --> 00:14:32.110
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: I'm like,
being punked right now.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:36.790
So that room led me to
a callback the next day.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.550
And then after that,
it was about two weeks,

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:44.340
and I got invited to go to a
callback in New York and sing.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:48.430
So this whole time, I just been
singing for the casting people,

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.610
Telsey, who did the casting.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.740
So not even any of
the creative team.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.600
But when I went
to New York, I got

00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.790
to sing for Alex Lacamoire who
did the orchestrations and part

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.460
of the writing for the show.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.590
And he's a genius, and it's
been awesome to work with him.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.970
But sang for him, and
then got invited back

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.156
to sing for him
and Tommy Kail, who

00:15:12.156 --> 00:15:13.780
is the director of
"Hamilton," and also

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.210
directed "In the Heights."

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.055
Alex Lacamoire also
did orchestrations

00:15:18.055 --> 00:15:18.930
for "In the Heights."

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.509
So they've all worked
together, so they know exactly

00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:22.550
what they're looking for.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.110
So just to be in that room, I
knew that I had made somewhat

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.675
of a good impression.

00:15:27.675 --> 00:15:29.050
SPEAKER 1: At that
point, did you

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.315
know who you were going
to be trying out for?

00:15:31.315 --> 00:15:32.920
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Yes.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.605
After that, my agent sort of
handled all that information

00:15:35.605 --> 00:15:38.230
that they would pass on, and be
like, OK, like Alex Lacamoire's

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:39.790
going to be in the room today.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.630
And then the next time, it was
OK, Alex Lacamoire, Tommy Kail.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:47.310
And then I got invited to the
final callbacks in New York.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.460
I think I was in New York for
about 10 days, auditioning,

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.460
and meetings, and
dance calls, which--

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.660
dance isn't my strong suit.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:02.620
So I was nervous, like that was
the most nerve-wracking part

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.120
for me.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.020
And I was dancing for
Andy Blankenbuehler, who

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.840
did the original choreography.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.477
And then my final audition, they
had told me-- they were like,

00:16:13.477 --> 00:16:15.060
the creative team
will be in the room.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.700
Some of the producers
will be in the room.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.885
And it should be
about 15 minutes.

00:16:19.885 --> 00:16:20.800
I'm like, OK.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.050
So I prepared all my material.

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.180
By this time, they
had given me my packet

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:29.700
of material for the roles
that I was auditioning for.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.340
And then the funny thing
was, the whole time, I

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.510
was thinking like OK,
Lin-Manuel might be in the room.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.400
I'll just have to
prep myself for it.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.240
It'll be fine.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:39.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.800
I'm just like, deep breaths.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.210
Somebody at the audition
will tell me, oh yeah,

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.280
Lin's in the room, so
just like, you know.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.860
So I was prepping that whole
time to just play it cool.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.430
And then I was waiting
outside of the audition room,

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:58.380
and I'm just praying, and
also taking deep breaths,

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.140
and trying to hold
my breakfast down.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:06.780
And somebody in the room
walked out and, they were like,

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:07.560
is he here yet?

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.038
And they were like, oh no, I
think he's just running late.

00:17:10.038 --> 00:17:11.579
So I'm like, oh,
they must be talking

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:13.800
about somebody auditioning.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.750
And then the door opens,
and I see Lin-Manuel just

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.000
stroll into the audition room.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.666
And I was like--

00:17:18.666 --> 00:17:20.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.721
All my preparation just
went out the window.

00:17:22.721 --> 00:17:23.970
But I was like, you know what?

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:27.420
I can't let this
affect my audition.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.150
It actually made me more excited
to audition, because I'm like,

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.190
this is the man.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.710
This is his role,
this is his musical,

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.690
and now I get to
show him what I got.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:41.740
So that was an experience
I'll never forget.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:47.490
And I am sure that that helped
me to get to where I am today.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:51.150
Because still, after
that, it was a few months,

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:56.220
had three more auditions,
and finally booked the show.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.555
So yeah, I mean, it was--

00:17:58.555 --> 00:17:59.930
SPEAKER 1: That's
a long journey.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:00.160
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Yeah.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:00.600
RYAN ALVARADO: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.060
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: From when
I first auditioned to opening

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.319
night, it was about a year.

00:18:06.319 --> 00:18:08.860
SPEAKER 1: So were you working
on something else at the time?

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.120
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
Yeah, auditioning, and I

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.480
did a guest star on
a TV show last year,

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.970
which was really fun, and
it kind of kept me busy.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:23.730
And with a show like
"Hamilton," there

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.170
are more productions opening up.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.060
So they're always
looking for people.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.420
But something that I
just had to tell myself

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.870
was maybe not at this moment.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.600
So every time I came
out of an audition room,

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.790
and I felt like I gave
it my all, I said,

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.210
OK, well, I did
what I had to do.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.780
Now it's up to powers beyond me.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.890
So God granted me
with the opportunity

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.130
that I'm blessed with.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:58.170
And yeah, I'm lucky to be
here only a year later.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.100
I mean, I say a year, but
if I really think about it,

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:06.480
it's a short amount of time
to be where I wanted to be.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.904
So yeah.

00:19:08.904 --> 00:19:12.084
RYAN ALVARADO: The
process was similar-ish.

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:13.000
It was the same thing.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.870
It was definitely long.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.900
I think all said and done,
from first audition to getting

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.940
the phone call was about maybe
like five or six months for me.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.430
I was lucky enough that my
first audition, Alex Lacamoire

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.920
happened to be in the room.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.160
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Nice.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.243
RYAN ALVARADO: I don't
know why, but he was there.

00:19:30.243 --> 00:19:30.885
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:30.885 --> 00:19:35.490
And the funny thing is
that, not similar to Ruben,

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:36.870
I don't have representation.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.620
Still to this day, I
don't have a manager,

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.910
I just don't have an agent.

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:42.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.260
Anyone looking to sign--

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.186
no.

00:19:44.186 --> 00:19:45.720
SPEAKER 1: Casting
out a call now.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.095
RYAN ALVARADO:
Yeah, so I didn't.

00:19:47.095 --> 00:19:48.180
So much of it was just--

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.790
not more on me, but I
kept my head in the game,

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:56.010
eyes on the prize,
that kind of thing.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.280
I felt like that audition
went well, the very first one.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.260
But not having an
agent or manager

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.982
bridging the gap for
me, and figuring out

00:20:05.982 --> 00:20:07.190
when that next audition was--

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:11.560
I believe that I had a callback
coming, but I didn't know.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.361
So I just kept
going to auditions.

00:20:14.361 --> 00:20:16.110
SPEAKER 1: Did they
tell you what progress

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.384
you were towards the end goal?

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:18.300
RYAN ALVARADO: No, no.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.030
And I didn't care.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.113
I didn't care at the time.

00:20:20.113 --> 00:20:21.270
I just kept going.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:25.490
I felt like the time was
now, and I just felt it.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.329
So I kept going,
to the point that--

00:20:28.329 --> 00:20:30.120
they kept seeing me,
and then eventually, I

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.132
think that they were
just like, it's coming.

00:20:32.132 --> 00:20:33.090
And then they started--

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.640
they do this thing where they
type you in, and type you out.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.620
And we're types for this show.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.150
I've been typed in before.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.440
And all of a sudden, I was
just getting typed out.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.130
So I was like, this isn't
over, this isn't over.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.504
But then my callback came,
and then that process started.

00:20:45.504 --> 00:20:46.955
And it was slow.

00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:48.830
And again, yeah, it's
like this room is going

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.060
to have two casting associates.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.340
One is going to have
three casting associates.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.820
Now we have the head of casting.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.610
And then I did a work session
with the associate director,

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:59.000
and the associate music
director from Broadway.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.640
And then that led into doing
another session with Lac

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.124
and Tommy, who are our musical
director and director proper,

00:21:09.124 --> 00:21:10.790
to then the room with
all the producers.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.360
I actually never was
never in a room with Lin.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.760
But yeah, pretty much everyone
but, I would assume, yeah.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.480
Yeah, and then I found
out around Thanksgiving.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.920
I sank like, six floors
through my apartment building.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:30.875
And then yeah, and
the rest is history.

00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:31.507
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:31.507 --> 00:21:33.590
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, if you
guys haven't already seen,

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:35.030
we have another guest
joining us here.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:35.529
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:35.529 --> 00:21:36.540
Put your hands together.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.061
RYAN ALVARADO: Whoo-whoo.

00:21:38.061 --> 00:21:39.900
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Hi, guys.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:40.860
Hi.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.727
RYAN ALVARADO: Hey.

00:21:41.727 --> 00:21:42.810
SPEAKER 1: Solea Pfeiffer.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:43.310
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Hi.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.600
SPEAKER 1: So Solea, we'll
catch you up a little bit.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:45.870
SOLEA PFEIFFER: OK.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.200
SPEAKER 1: Can you just tell
us your role in the play,

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.325
just a little bit of a
description of who you play?

00:21:50.325 --> 00:21:50.700
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Yes.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.450
SPEAKER 1: And then if you have
one, a fun fact about yourself,

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:54.465
fun or interesting fact.

00:21:54.465 --> 00:21:57.360
SOLEA PFEIFFER: OK,
I'm Solea Pfeiffer.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.795
I play Eliza Hamilton, I am
wife to him, mother to him.

00:22:01.795 --> 00:22:03.294
SPEAKER 1: You got
the whole family.

00:22:03.294 --> 00:22:04.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.050
SOLEA PFEIFFER: At any
given day of this week.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.840
And my fun fact--

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.850
I've got two fun facts.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.620
I was born in Zimbabwe,
which is always my go to.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:15.890
People are always like, oh.

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:18.270
And so that's my fun fact.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.260
And I have a really
weird irrational fear

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.270
of Wallace and Gromit.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.228
So that's my other one.

00:22:23.228 --> 00:22:24.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.070
SPEAKER 1: Stop
motion animation.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.080
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Yeah.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.040
Can't explain it.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:30.830
Great.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.500
SPEAKER 1: Thank you
so much for joining us.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.650
OK, so let's go into
the next question.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.940
So you guys have been in the Bay
Area for about five months now.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.200
You've met a lot of fans here.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.800
You've seen what the
theater scene's like.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.176
I think a lot of
the sports teams

00:22:44.176 --> 00:22:45.633
and stuff have
reached to you guys.

00:22:45.633 --> 00:22:47.230
You've had some
opportunities there.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.640
I was wondering what your
thoughts are of the Bay Area

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.890
compared to other places
that you've performed before.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:53.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.610
I mean, you can
be blunt about it.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.080
It's definitely
not Broadway, but I

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.030
think there is some
sort of a scene here.

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:01.485
So I just wanted to--

00:23:01.485 --> 00:23:02.575
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:02.575 --> 00:23:04.200
I just want to hear
what you guys think

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.295
the fans have been like, and
the Bay Area has been like.

00:23:07.295 --> 00:23:08.670
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
You can start.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:09.090
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Me?

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:09.589
I'll start?

00:23:09.589 --> 00:23:10.710
OK.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.900
I think I couldn't
think of a better city

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.230
to start this tour in, really.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:20.700
What Tommy would always say as
we were starting this process

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:24.840
was that now once this
show and this piece

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.320
leaves New York City, instead
of people coming to New York,

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.050
and flying from all over to
come to New York to see it,

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.090
we are going to your home.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.150
And there's something really
special about having arrived

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.150
here, and being able to
bring it to the city,

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.680
as opposed to the
city coming to us.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.020
And these crowds have
been insane, you guys.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.080
I feel like I've
been really spoiled.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.256
I feel like our whole cast--

00:23:48.256 --> 00:23:50.130
after any other show,
we're going to be like,

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.220
is anybody even out there?

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:51.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.020
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Because it
is so raucous every day.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.600
I think our matinees are
usually the best ones,

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.180
and I think that's
kind of unique.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.138
I think it's because
that's when the kids come.

00:24:01.138 --> 00:24:02.970
And you will not find
a more dedicated fan

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.710
than a child fan of "Hamilton."

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.360
They are dedicated
and loyal to us.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.070
They know us.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.630
And it's amazing.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.490
And I think--

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.650
I mean, I'm excited
to see what it's

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:21.330
like when we bring the show to a
city that's maybe a little less

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.170
woke, if that makes sense.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:24.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:25.750
You know what I mean?

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:26.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.600
San Francisco-- everyone
here knows what's up,

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.190
and that's an amazing thing.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:36.834
And we can always count
on a huge, huge applause

00:24:36.834 --> 00:24:38.250
after the line,
immigrants, we get

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.280
the job done, without
fail, every single show,

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.752
and that's so amazing.

00:24:42.752 --> 00:24:44.460
But there are other
cities in the country

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.620
that maybe don't feel that way.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.890
And so right now, it
feels like a celebration,

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:50.850
and that's amazing.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:52.350
And I couldn't think
of a better way

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:55.410
to start this tour
than celebrating

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:56.826
what this show means.

00:24:56.826 --> 00:24:58.950
But it's going to be exciting
to bring it to cities

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.570
where we are challenging
how people think too.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.724
And I think that's one of
the most exciting things

00:25:03.724 --> 00:25:05.640
about this show, is that
it kind of challenges

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:10.110
people's perceptions, and
raises their consciousness

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.720
a little bit.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:14.175
And so I mean, yeah, like I
said, this is a woke city.

00:25:14.175 --> 00:25:15.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.610
And yeah, so I'm glad
we started with people

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.830
who are ready to just
embrace this show,

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.230
and embrace us all so 100%.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:23.204
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:25:23.204 --> 00:25:24.494
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Yeah

00:25:24.494 --> 00:25:25.910
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
Do you want to?

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:26.660
RYAN ALVARADO: Oh.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.176
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:27.176 --> 00:25:28.550
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
You don't want

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.050
to say what you
like about the city?

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:33.086
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:33.086 --> 00:25:34.960
RYAN ALVARADO: I am from
New York originally.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.910
I'm an east coast kid.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:36.950
I was born in the Bronx.

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:39.954
I've been to LA once
for like, five days.

00:25:39.954 --> 00:25:42.120
So my experience on the
west coast is super limited.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.400
But I was just saying
before we started

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.530
the talk, I welcome the change
of air, the change of pace.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:50.156
I love it here.

00:25:50.156 --> 00:25:52.530
It's something that you can
sense and feel as soon as you

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:53.530
get off the plane.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.946
It's just the pace is different,
the people are different.

00:25:55.946 --> 00:25:58.762
And it's just so open
minded, and these

00:25:58.762 --> 00:26:00.720
are things that you just
feel it before we even

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.300
say hello to anyone, or someone
says hello to you, which is--

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:03.585
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Totally

00:26:03.585 --> 00:26:05.053
RYAN ALVARADO: --so
against the New York norm.

00:26:05.053 --> 00:26:05.446
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:05.446 --> 00:26:05.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.673
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Yes.

00:26:06.673 --> 00:26:08.040
RYAN ALVARADO: You know?

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.220
Yeah, so it's been
really great to me

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.720
to just spend-- not
like a vacation.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.770
Even though we're here for work,
really, we're here to live.

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.554
So to live in it, to submerge
in it, it's been great.

00:26:20.554 --> 00:26:21.220
It's been great.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.935
I was saying, the sun just
feels differently here, it

00:26:22.935 --> 00:26:24.080
just shines a little brighter.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:24.350
SOLEA PFEIFFER: It does.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.493
RYAN ALVARADO: It's really,
really, cool, and just-- yeah.

00:26:26.493 --> 00:26:26.856
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Yeah.

00:26:26.856 --> 00:26:27.814
RYAN ALVARADO: Amazing.

00:26:28.797 --> 00:26:30.380
SPEAKER 1: If you
want to-- all right,

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.980
the next question is
of kind of like that.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:32.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.940
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: I like
the Bay, don't get me wrong.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:34.942
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:34.942 --> 00:26:36.900
SPEAKER 1: So you guys
have done a lot of stuff

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.720
with the local community.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.220
And one of the things that I
would like to hear a little bit

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.535
more about is the #EduHam.

00:26:42.535 --> 00:26:44.939
I know it's been with a
lot of the local schools,

00:26:44.939 --> 00:26:46.230
and being able to see the kids.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:47.938
Can you talk a little
bit more about that

00:26:47.938 --> 00:26:50.802
for people that aren't
familiar with the program?

00:26:50.802 --> 00:26:52.260
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
Yeah, I actually

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.560
got to host one of #EduHam
days, which was so much fun.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:03.090
What it is, is we reach
out to the high schools

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:06.000
that are around the area
in which "Hamilton" is in.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.262
So in New York, they're
doing it for the schools

00:27:11.262 --> 00:27:11.970
around that area.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.428
In Chicago, they're
doing the same.

00:27:13.428 --> 00:27:15.510
And now we've brought
it to San Francisco.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:20.040
They've partnered with the
Gilder Lehrman Institute.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:26.430
And they've created
a curriculum wherein

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:31.260
the culmination of that
curriculum is seeing our show.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:37.470
And so big companies often
buy out the entire theater

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.090
for these kids.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.150
And they end up only
paying $10 to see our show,

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.410
every single one of them.

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:49.410
So our matinee that
day is for them, only

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.590
them, and their chaperones.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.740
But before that, we get
to witness something

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.980
that I have never
witnessed before.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.480
And that's they get to do
original work based on what

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.810
they've learned on our stage.

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.940
And so they come up,
and they come up solo,

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.970
they come in groups
of three, more.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:16.830
And they'll do a rap, and
the girl will be like,

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:20.190
I'm going to be playing Martha
Washington, and this is my rap.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.550
And they'll do it, and it's
so historically accurate,

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:24.150
and just--

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.781
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:25.781 --> 00:28:26.280
Wow.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.180
RYAN ALVARADO:
Including the rapping.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.055
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Yeah.

00:28:28.055 --> 00:28:29.670
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
Yeah, yeah It's

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:34.210
just you get to see the
creative side of these kids.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:37.410
And I when I got to host,
I asked a couple of them--

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.086
I was like, oh my
gosh, so what shows,

00:28:40.086 --> 00:28:41.460
what musicals have
you guys done?

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:42.440
And they're like,
we don't do that.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.249
And I was like, oh.

00:28:43.249 --> 00:28:44.790
But they're like,
but we might start.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.920
I'm like, oh well,
that's awesome.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.340
We're introducing
art and history,

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:56.250
and we're kind of changing
how these kids think,

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.320
and I think that's so special.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.470
I want to have them kind of
see the experience of watching.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:03.900
But it was-- oh, my gosh.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.900
I just sat there, just
jaw to the ground, just--

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.108
SOLEA PFEIFFER: It's amazing.

00:29:07.108 --> 00:29:09.000
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
Wow, like, these kids--

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.690
I think they're sophomores
and juniors in high school,

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:15.490
getting ready to go
off into the world.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:17.970
And now they have
all this information

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:20.930
and this inspiration, so yeah.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:26.520
RYAN ALVARADO: Yeah, I was on
the guest panel at the #EduHam

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.750
that Ruben moderated.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:30.109
And it was quite
touching, actually.

00:29:30.109 --> 00:29:31.650
These kids, they
really get up there.

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:35.865
And some of them, their
performing experience

00:29:35.865 --> 00:29:37.710
is doing the same thing
that they just did,

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.490
but they did it in
their cafeteria,

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:40.740
or in their school auditorium.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.370
You

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:45.330
It's a big bridge to get--
we have a Broadway stage out

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:46.530
at the Orpheum.

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:48.870
It can be intimidating,
and it's just 2,300

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:52.190
of their peers watching them.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.840
And then they go, and they
do what they prepared,

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.740
and it's magnificent.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.510
And it's just like, wow.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:59.970
It reminds us how special
of what they are doing,

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:03.360
and how special of what the
opportunity that we're given.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.690
And it's a unique
thing that we're

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:10.824
in something that can
connect history to art,

00:30:10.824 --> 00:30:12.240
and really bridge
the gap, and get

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.360
these kids interested in
that subject, or in art.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.760
It's twofold, and we're
just sitting there

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.880
in the center of it,
just like, wow, wow, wow.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.230
Oh my goodness, wow.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:25.260
And it's really cool.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.790
To us-- we do the
show every day,

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.160
but that's like a real
treasure, a real treat

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.310
to just be in the
room to witness that.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:33.410
I've always enjoyed it.

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:34.320
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Yeah.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.260
The #EduHam days are always
my favorite days to perform.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.270
Because the reactions
from the audience

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.630
are always completely
different than any other show.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:46.710
You can always guarantee-- like,
kids love a kiss on a button.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:50.040
When we get married, and we
kiss, and it all buttons up,

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.080
every time, they go ooh.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.502
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:52.502 --> 00:30:53.350
They love it.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:56.010
And there's just different
reactions, so that's exciting.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:31:00.030
But you also know that they
are taking in this information

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.650
differently than
other audiences.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.200
And you can hear it in
the way that they react,

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.610
but also, seeing the
kids before they perform,

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:08.080
you can see their
hearts beating.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.990
You're like, this
is a huge moment,

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.130
and one that feels like it
might change them forever.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:15.360
It feels like it could
be their defining moment.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.026
You'll see them-- sometimes they
might stutter over their words,

00:31:18.026 --> 00:31:20.940
and the rest of the kids are
just there for them 100%,

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:25.860
and nothing fills our
hearts more than those days.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.440
And yeah, connecting
history to art.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.045
And then a lot of these
kids are from maybe more

00:31:31.045 --> 00:31:32.670
of a disadvantaged
school or something,

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.700
and maybe that was the
first professional show

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.110
that they had seen.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:40.560
And those days
especially, it feels

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.950
like you're there for
something bigger than yourself.

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:48.540
And I always feel like I have
my best shows those days,

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.534
because you're kind
of like, this is--

00:31:51.534 --> 00:31:52.950
I mean, the tickets
are expensive.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.960
And a lot of these
people would not

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.280
have a chance to see our show.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.769
And that's a weird thing, I
think, for our cast anyways.

00:31:58.769 --> 00:32:00.810
It's a weird thing to kind
of come to terms with,

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.780
that a lot of people who you
hope this show will reach

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.910
won't ever get the
chance to see it.

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:08.610
And then on those days,
it's like 2,300 people

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:12.470
who are like us a little
while ago, who are exactly us

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:15.521
a few years ago, having
the opportunity to share it

00:32:15.521 --> 00:32:16.020
with them.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.000
And so it feels so special.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.089
I love #EduHam.

00:32:20.089 --> 00:32:22.380
SPEAKER 1: That's awesome
that you guys are doing that.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.000
And I think Google-- when
you mentioned the companies--

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.490
Google is one of the ones that
sponsored one of the events,

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.531
so that's pretty cool that
we got to participate.

00:32:28.531 --> 00:32:29.115
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:29.115 --> 00:32:31.785
Thanks for a plug there.

00:32:31.785 --> 00:32:33.960
So you guys are
doing these events

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.870
on top of your
normal show schedule.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:37.890
Can you talk about--

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:43.032
you're doing eight shows some
weeks, two shows in a day?

00:32:43.032 --> 00:32:44.490
I mean, first of
all, it just seems

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.656
like it would be physically
and mentally exhausting.

00:32:46.656 --> 00:32:49.337
How do you get through
those kind of weeks?

00:32:49.337 --> 00:32:51.170
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
Solea, you want to start?

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:54.480
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Sure,
I'll take a swing.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.990
I think for all three of us--

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.900
this is the longest
show I've ever done.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.560
So every time that we do a show,
I beat my own personal record

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.440
for how many shows I have done.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.330
And it's a learning
curve, for sure.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.900
When your body is your job,
you have to be really careful.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.621
And it kind of just means
that there are certain things

00:33:12.621 --> 00:33:13.620
that we don't get to do.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.160
Like during the week, I don't
talk on the phone very often.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.950
I don't Skype my friends
or talk to my mom.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:22.110
I don't really
talk during the day

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:25.540
unless it's something
that I really want to do.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.880
And I don't go out.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:27.544
I don't drink.

00:33:27.544 --> 00:33:29.460
It's just like things
like that, that are just

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:33.450
like little sacrifices,
especially when your voice is

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.840
your job.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.745
I don't eat tomatoes
after 7:00, certain things

00:33:38.745 --> 00:33:42.270
that you just have to
learn about yourself.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:45.300
But it's a weird
thing to figure out,

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.929
because your lifestyle just
changes in such a huge way

00:33:47.929 --> 00:33:49.470
once you're part of
a show like this.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:51.053
Because eight shows
a week is serious,

00:33:51.053 --> 00:33:52.320
and you don't want to miss it.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.890
You don't want to not be
there for a million reasons.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:34:00.360
But our job is weird
that way, in that

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:04.710
if our body isn't feeling 100%,
we can't do our jobs very well.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:07.740
If we have a cold, it feels
like the end of the world,

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:08.830
and it sucks.

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:11.850
So a lot of vitamins,
a lot of B-12,

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:18.090
a lot of just eating lots of
veggies, and staying quiet.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:22.870
And so there are times when
our job is so exciting,

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:28.351
but a lot of it is just chilling
out as much as possible.

00:34:28.351 --> 00:34:28.850
Yeah.

00:34:32.077 --> 00:34:32.780
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.030
I have one more question,
but get your other questions

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:36.446
into the Dory and
then we're going

00:34:36.446 --> 00:34:37.940
to do live questions after this.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:41.634
So this one-- at Google,
representation and diversity--

00:34:41.634 --> 00:34:42.800
it's really important to us.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.000
And we talk about bring
your whole self to work.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.041
And I think this is
something that "Hamilton" has

00:34:47.041 --> 00:34:48.730
a lot of overlap with Google.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.210
And from its initial
casting, it's

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:52.520
been very racially diverse.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.320
I even was listening
to an interview

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.779
with Lin-Manuel
couple of days ago,

00:34:55.779 --> 00:34:58.236
where he talked about how it
wouldn't surprise if there was

00:34:58.236 --> 00:35:00.890
a woman cast as Alexander
Hamilton in the future, which

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:02.590
I think would be pretty cool.

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:07.100
So I was wondering what this
message that the show gives off

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.210
means to you guys personally?

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:12.980
And do you think that theater
has this special potential

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.920
to really drive this forward?

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:22.550
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: I
think that if the art is

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:23.930
willing to take that risk--

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:25.790
I mean, it's already
taking a risk

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:31.460
being art in the world where
so many things just die out,

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.100
or they get rejected, or
they're just not cool.

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.490
But if they take that risk
to be inclusive to everyone,

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:40.400
I think that's what makes
it special, especially

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.950
in a time like right now.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:45.500
And one of the first things
I noticed when you all

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.180
walked in the room is that
everyone is just so diverse.

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:53.270
And it's just like,
this is a "Hamilton."

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:55.070
This is the world
that we live in.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:58.770
And I think it's great that
"Hamilton" has given us

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:02.240
that platform to really show the
world that this is what America

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:08.310
looks like, and this is a
story, this is our history.

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:16.112
And being Latino, I think
that it's just exciting,

00:36:16.112 --> 00:36:20.660
I'm very excited to
be an actor today

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:26.300
with all the inclusive
art coming to life.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.840
I mean, there's awesome
shows on Netflix and Hulu,

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.680
and musicals with just people.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.030
I mean, we're just all people.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:42.710
So to see a show like "In
the Heights" seven years ago,

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:46.870
and to see Latinos on the
stage and dancing to salsa

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:52.290
and speaking Spanish, I'm
like that's me up there.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.830
And now to be in
a show where I get

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.870
to be with my brothers
and sisters of color,

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.730
I'm in heaven.

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:03.710
And I get to tell an awesome
story that applies to me

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:05.150
and everyone around me.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:06.100
So it's just an honor.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:11.030
And I see this trend
continuing as long

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.520
as people take the
risk, and as long

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.690
as people are open to listen
to what everyone has to say.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:21.380
I mean, the story
is important, yes.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:26.171
But I think the way the story
is told is more important.

00:37:26.171 --> 00:37:27.770
But yeah, I'm just excited.

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:31.797
I'm just blessed to be here.

00:37:31.797 --> 00:37:32.630
RYAN ALVARADO: Yeah.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:37.445
I mean, I actually heard
Lin addressing a crowd.

00:37:37.445 --> 00:37:39.440
I was doing the show,
I was doing "Heights,"

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.240
and he was speaking
to the crowd.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.550
And he was talking
about what made

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:48.190
him want to write at
all, let alone "Heights."

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:50.570
And it had something
to do with--

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.540
he had said, jokingly,
I don't dance.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.240
And I'm not a dancer, and I was
never going to play Bernardo.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.919
And then I also thought, I
don't know if I want to play--

00:37:59.919 --> 00:38:02.210
in terms of Puerto Ricans
being represented in theater,

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:03.880
it's your "West Side Stories."

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.780
We're gang members,
we're the bad guys.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:09.050
And that was just
not something he

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:11.780
saw doing once, or for a career,
or making a career out of.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:14.660
So he was wondering
where was his opportunity

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.280
to show his best self?

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.510
And he didn't see it.

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.900
He couldn't find it, so
he wrote it, he made it,

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.441
which is amazing.

00:38:22.441 --> 00:38:23.940
And then because
of that, similarly,

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.189
we've all had similar
experience in watching his work,

00:38:26.189 --> 00:38:28.160
or any work where
we-- you have to,

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.050
in order to set your
sights on something,

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:31.924
or say that's something
that I could achieve,

00:38:31.924 --> 00:38:35.360
sometimes it's helpful
to see it done first.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.980
For me to see a Lin
go up, or for you

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.920
to see yourself on stage,
and say hey, that's me.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.750
There's a home for me,
I see it, I want it,

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:43.900
I'm going to go
get it, you know?

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.400
And that's the coolest thing
about, I think, doing our show,

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.770
is that we are so diverse.

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:50.480
I think they always
say the casting

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:54.020
idea is supposed to look
like a New York City subway.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.990
And that's great,
because it's inclusive,

00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:59.199
and it allows these young
kids in these audience

00:38:59.199 --> 00:39:00.740
that we see as
they're being touched,

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.930
and we see them directly seeing
themselves through a Raven,

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:06.350
or through a Julia,
or through a Solea,

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:10.841
and that's the coolest thing,
is we see ourselves in them.

00:39:10.841 --> 00:39:13.340
And I think Solea said that
too, and that's the coolest part

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.240
about what we do.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.076
And it's the core of
it, really, to reach out

00:39:17.076 --> 00:39:18.950
to someone who might
not have known that they

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:21.240
can do anything, you know?

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.436
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Yeah.

00:39:22.436 --> 00:39:23.272
RYAN ALVARADO: Yeah.

00:39:23.272 --> 00:39:25.880
SOLEA PFEIFFER: I
can say there's,

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.215
I feel, different levels to
think about this question.

00:39:28.215 --> 00:39:31.380
And personally, this
show is the first time

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.250
that I didn't think about
my race when I auditioned.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.440
I'm a mixed-race person,
and I'm constantly

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.620
being asked what are
you, like, duh, duh, duh.

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:42.849
And of course, I know I'm a
confusing person to look at,

00:39:42.849 --> 00:39:45.140
and a lot of people, they're
like, well, are you Asian,

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:45.681
are you what?

00:39:45.681 --> 00:39:48.110
I'm like, does it
matter, really?

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:52.550
And this was literally the first
role where I wasn't worried,

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:54.260
am I going to be able
to pass for this?

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.160
Will the fact that I
am this ambiguous--

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.930
does my type matter?

00:39:57.930 --> 00:39:59.390
Does my skin tone matter?

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.060
It was the first time that I
was able to walk in and not

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.100
think about that.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.275
It was just about what
I brought to the table,

00:40:05.275 --> 00:40:07.700
and what I could do
with this material.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.500
And as an actor,
there is nothing

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.360
more freeing than that at all.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:19.040
And that felt like this huge
moment for me as an artist,

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.850
where I was like, there is
more to me than the way I look,

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:24.979
and I don't have to think
about that this time.

00:40:24.979 --> 00:40:27.020
All I have to think about
is how amazing this is,

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.290
and I can look at these
lyrics and think about that,

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:33.440
rather than do I look
white enough for this?

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.869
Will I pass as black?

00:40:34.869 --> 00:40:36.410
Will I pass as Asian,
duh, duh, duh--

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:39.200
these questions that are always
at the forefront of your mind

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.450
instead of the art.

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:45.770
And so I was able to put what
is actually important first,

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:47.560
and that felt amazing.

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:51.190
And I know when I saw this
show for the first time,

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:54.411
it was the first time that
I had seen myself on stage.

00:40:54.411 --> 00:40:56.660
And that was one of the most
striking things about it.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.706
I was just like, oh my god.

00:40:58.706 --> 00:41:00.080
There's someone
who looks like me

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.970
who is the love interest here.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:08.210
I was like, oh my god, there
are so many-- especially women

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.480
of color, I think, we
don't see ourselves as just

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.450
like the ingenue,
or the princess,

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:18.530
or the one to be coveted.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:21.500
It doesn't happen a lot,
and it's an amazing feeling

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.450
when you see yourself.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.100
And the idea--

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.740
I played Sandy once in "Grease."

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:27.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.590
And I remember thinking--
and I was brunette,

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:32.114
and it was a thing, kind of.

00:41:32.114 --> 00:41:34.280
And I was like, wow, I can't
believe people actually

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:34.988
think about this.

00:41:34.988 --> 00:41:38.330
But then taking that, and just
kind of-- when you really are

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:41.630
like, there's someone like me
in the audience who is seeing

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:46.320
themselves, maybe for the first
time, and seeing themselves,

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.200
that that is a
possibility for them--

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.600
that's so huge.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.866
And then kind of on the
more grander scale of this,

00:41:53.866 --> 00:41:54.740
there's this artist--

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.323
I hope I'm saying
his name correctly--

00:41:56.323 --> 00:41:58.870
Kehinde Wiley, if anyone
has heard of him before.

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:00.380
He's this amazing--
check him out.

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.010
He's this artist, who'll
take old Renaissance photos,

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:06.170
or photos of our
founding fathers,

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:09.360
and he will take a
modern person of color,

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.960
and put them in their
place in the paintings.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.710
And the idea is it's supposed to
challenge your idea of royalty,

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:16.340
challenge your idea
of intelligence,

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:21.830
and power in putting the person
of color in that position.

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:24.710
And it kind of
feels weird, and it

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:27.990
challenges your mind to think
differently about our history.

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:30.200
And I think that's exactly
what this show does.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:35.330
And at first, it might be
jarring to someone's mind

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:38.880
or eye to see a black man
playing George Washington.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.940
And I think people
at first, they

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:44.150
think it's maybe a bit of
a novelty or something.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:46.670
I think people think
that it's part of--

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:50.660
I don't know-- like, ooh, that's
the thing that "Hamilton" does.

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:53.660
But after two minutes
of just watching it,

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.221
your mind just accepts it.

00:42:55.221 --> 00:42:56.720
And you're like
yeah, you don't even

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.790
think twice that there's a black
man playing George Washington,

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:01.130
our first president.

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:02.910
And that is so huge.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:05.780
I can't think of
anything, especially now--

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.351
I mean, especially always.

00:43:07.351 --> 00:43:07.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:12.470
But as these things are really
at the forefront of our minds,

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:15.560
I just can't think of anything
more important, or anything

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.930
that can change the world
more than just people's core

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.430
values of how they
think about race,

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.830
and how they think about
power and intelligence.

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:23.750
And that we can
be a part of that

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:27.170
just by virtue of being
on stage and singing

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:31.280
these amazing songs, and
moving people, that we

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.025
can raise their consciousness.

00:43:33.025 --> 00:43:35.730
And just because Lin was just
like, yeah, people of color

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:38.570
will be playing these roles.

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:41.970
That decision, I think,
was huge and imperative,

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:46.850
and I think it-- it makes me
feel so emotional, really.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:51.570
Because it makes the world a
safer place and a better place.

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:54.770
And as we bring it
across the country,

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:57.230
I'm excited to see
how people continue

00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:01.910
to have their consciousnesses
raised-- is that a word?

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:03.410
RYAN ALVARADO: It
sounds good to me.

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:06.338
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Yeah.

00:44:06.338 --> 00:44:08.660
SPEAKER 1: Thanks so much,
guys, for sharing that.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.070
That was amazing.

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.750
So we're going to
transition to some

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:14.392
live Q&amp;A. We also have
some Dory questions.

00:44:14.392 --> 00:44:16.850
If you have a live question,
you can just put up your hand.

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:20.120
Brendan, are you
able to help with--

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.980
oh, we actually have
a microphone out there

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:24.086
that you can go up to.

00:44:24.086 --> 00:44:27.650
SOLEA PFEIFFER: I was thinking
about that yesterday, actually.

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:29.155
We have some breaks
onstage, where

00:44:29.155 --> 00:44:30.945
we're just sitting
on stage, and engage,

00:44:30.945 --> 00:44:32.360
but we're not doing anything.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:32.860
You'll see.

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.990
If you see the show, we're
around on stage a lot.

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:39.520
And I remember
thinking, the fact

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.920
that we are telling this
story through hip hop,

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.690
or rap or whatever,
the people who--

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:49.810
and a lot of the musical
themes that Lin used

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:52.590
are from Biggie songs, or
songs that already exist.

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:55.090
And a lot of people are going
to hear those, and be like, oh

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:56.307
my gosh, I know this song.

00:44:56.307 --> 00:44:58.390
And one interesting thing
that I've always thought

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:01.060
is a funny juxtaposition
about this show

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:04.030
is that the people
who love Biggie

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:07.720
might not be the people who
are paying $1,500 to get

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.410
to see "Hamilton."

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:10.690
And what I think--

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:14.860
the fact that it is
told through this--

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.440
I think the people
who are, who are

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:21.810
going for a night
at the theater,

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:23.920
they are seeing hip
hop and rap maybe

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.160
for the first time for
them as a really valid form

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.800
of expression.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:32.140
Because, for a lot of
people, they don't even

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.720
bother to listen to
this type of music,

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.980
or they have a certain
stigma attached to their mind

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.220
about what it means, and
what their message is.

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.572
It's always been a valid
form of expression.

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:43.780
But for a lot of people,
this might be the first time

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.667
that they're seeing a
story that they know,

00:45:46.667 --> 00:45:48.250
and it's told through
a different way,

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.000
and they're still moved,
and they're still affected,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.850
and they still
understand the story.

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:54.490
But they are being challenged
to actually see it and listen,

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:56.850
and have it be through
a form of expression

00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:59.170
and they may not have been
comfortable with before.

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:02.110
And I think that is just
as important as the casting

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:03.730
and everything else.

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:05.774
I don't know if this is
answering your question.

00:46:05.774 --> 00:46:07.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:11.140
But yeah, I think that is one
of the other important layers

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:15.430
of this, that this is not
necessarily a type of music.

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:17.110
And now, it's just
so mainstream.

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:19.750
People are having their
kids listen to it.

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:24.870
And I think that's a
new phenomenon, kind of.

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:26.271
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Yeah, yeah.

00:46:26.271 --> 00:46:28.090
SPEAKER 1: How is
your version different

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:30.210
from the original
Broadway version?

00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:32.649
And what additions,
changes, or new spins

00:46:32.649 --> 00:46:33.940
does your cast put on the show?

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:37.865
Do you guys have the liberties
to do stuff like that?

00:46:37.865 --> 00:46:40.490
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: You play Ham,
so you should talk about that.

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:42.510
You play Lin's character.

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:44.980
RYAN ALVARADO: In terms of the
show as a whole big picture,

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:47.200
it's "Hamilton."

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.750
That's what the goal is, to
bring you something that's

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:55.510
on Broadway, so that we can tour
it, and share this amazing show

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:57.500
with as many people as possible.

00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:00.670
But in terms of the direction
of it, and how we're taught it,

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:03.490
and how the information
is given to us,

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:04.990
there's many
parameters, as there

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:06.140
are with any Broadway show.

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:07.840
There's hit this mark.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.960
It all comes down to math,
and spacing, and gridding,

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.110
and you're on six by this green
box, and duh, duh, duh, duh.

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:15.400
And there's so much of that.

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.280
But they make sure,
especially with this piece,

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.850
to let you know where
you need to fill in,

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:24.380
where you need to
put yourself here.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.820
The direction is
to go through this.

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.460
There's a song-- if
we're all familiar--

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.932
"Quiet Uptown," where
we lose our son.

00:47:32.932 --> 00:47:34.090
And it's kind of like that.

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:38.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:42.260
But yeah, that, to
me, we don't get

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:46.970
noted a bunch on it, because
the main direction there

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:49.144
is to do your best
to live through that,

00:47:49.144 --> 00:47:51.560
to really try to fight through
that, and get through that,

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.450
and understand that,
and cope with it,

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:57.290
and communicate that to our
fellow castmates on stage,

00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:59.510
and as well, to get it to
jump off the stage to you.

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:03.042
So as long as that's
the parameter for it,

00:48:03.042 --> 00:48:05.000
is really do your best
to go all the way there.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.740
And Solea does it
every single night.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.720
And it's one of the
more difficult things

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.390
to do in the show.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:13.880
But that's what
that moment needs.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.100
So it's more about that
in terms of like giving

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.450
the moment what it needs.

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:20.990
And in order to do that, I might
need to do it a different way

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:22.260
than Lin went about it.

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:24.480
Or Ruben is going to have
to do it a different way

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:28.360
than Anthony Ramos
did it, you know?

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.674
And that's OK.

00:48:29.674 --> 00:48:31.340
And we're definitely
pushed in that way,

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:35.330
where we're invited to
explore, to investigate, to try

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:36.520
new things.

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.110
And we always have an
amazing team of directors,

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:42.080
of choreographers that live with
our company as well out here

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:42.856
in San Francisco.

00:48:42.856 --> 00:48:44.480
So we always have
someone to touch base

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.120
with that is probably more
connected to that original

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.820
production, or that
original vision than we are,

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.550
so that we can figure out how
we're going to go about this,

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:54.590
and be able to provide
whoever's watching it

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:56.240
with the best
"Hamilton" experience

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.200
that we can as people.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:01.030
Because we'll never be them.

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:02.400
And that's what's meant to be.

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:03.920
It's really supposed
to keep passing

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.586
on to the next group
and the next group,

00:49:05.586 --> 00:49:08.630
so we can hand this message
off to the next generation,

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:09.252
you know?

00:49:09.252 --> 00:49:10.400
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.055
Can we go to a live question?

00:49:12.055 --> 00:49:15.170
AUDIENCE: With seven
or eight shows a week,

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:17.530
kind of doing the same
thing over and over again

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:19.760
every night, how do
you keep it fresh?

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.501
How do you bring energy
every single night?

00:49:23.501 --> 00:49:26.000
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: I
think, at least for myself,

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.720
the first three months of
doing the show were just

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.830
like a whirlwind.

00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:34.370
I was still like, oh
my gosh, I'm nervous,

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:35.720
I've got to hit this mark.

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.870
So I was going through
that every single show.

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:42.530
And I think eventually, I
not only got comfortable

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:44.720
with the show, but also
just kind of told myself

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.900
that this is unique to me.

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:50.200
I don't really have to
pretend to be anybody else.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.807
I don't have to please--

00:49:51.807 --> 00:49:53.390
I mean, I have to
please my directors.

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:58.160
But I'm saying I don't
have to tailor my show,

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:02.450
because in doing that,
I'm damaging my process,

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:05.000
and getting in my head.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.940
But to answer your
question more specifically,

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:11.930
it's finding new
moments, and finding

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:13.370
where you can still build.

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:17.640
And so our jobs are
never done as actors.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.070
So just because
we've set the show

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:21.950
doesn't mean that we can
just glide through it.

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:24.410
I mean, there's still
that emotional connection

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:25.050
to the show.

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:27.240
And it's a show that I
care very deeply about,

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.530
so obviously, I'm
going to put everything

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:32.780
I have into the show.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:38.030
And it's a different show
every night, it really is.

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:39.120
Things go wrong.

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:44.640
Things don't happen how they're
supposed to, or things change.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:49.210
And it's part of our jobs
as actors to adapt to that.

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:51.530
And it's the jobs
of the creative team

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:55.700
that's here in San Francisco to
keep us on our toes about that.

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:59.060
So if I try something--
not necessarily new--

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:01.640
but try something
different, maybe my director

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.950
says, OK, that's
cool, work with that.

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:06.110
Or maybe don't do
that ever again.

00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:07.355
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:07.355 --> 00:51:12.290
But we're still--
it's a growing,

00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:14.760
it's a breathing thing.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.110
And so we're always
finding new ways

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:21.920
to approach the same moments.

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:29.870
And it also helps that
our company is very tight.

00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:33.230
And we always have new people
coming into the show that

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:34.340
are in the company.

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:37.460
So the swings will go on, or
the understudies will go on.

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.830
And those are some
of my favorite shows,

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:43.880
is just seeing how a new
person takes the role,

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:46.970
and how they put
themselves into that role.

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:51.930
So at times, it can
get sort of monotonous,

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:55.530
I guess, maybe for
lack of a better word.

00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:57.710
But it's still so much fun.

00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:00.060
I still wouldn't trade
this for anything.

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:01.400
It's just-- yeah.

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:02.440
SOLEA PFEIFFER: I can
speak to this a little.

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:03.200
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Yeah.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.366
SOLEA PFEIFFER: I know I
thought that it would start

00:52:05.366 --> 00:52:09.680
to feel really difficult to
do the exact same thing over

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.049
and over and over again.

00:52:11.049 --> 00:52:11.840
And I think it can.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:15.020
I have done shows where I
became incredibly bored of it

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.100
pretty quickly.

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:20.540
And to my shock, quite
frankly, this show,

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:22.520
I'm not even close
to satisfied with it.

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.960
And I don't think
I will ever be.

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.110
Oh god.

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:28.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:29.627
Oh no.

00:52:29.627 --> 00:52:31.418
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
We're brand ambassadors.

00:52:31.418 --> 00:52:32.334
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Right?

00:52:32.334 --> 00:52:33.560
Oh, god.

00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:38.530
But what I mean, this show
is such a gift to the actors.

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:40.942
There's something to be
mined from it every time.

00:52:40.942 --> 00:52:42.400
The relevance of
the show literally

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.400
changes with the news
of the world that day.

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.100
You will find new
relevance to something,

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:49.960
and find a new way
to connect with it,

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:51.790
depending on the
biggest headline,

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:53.500
or whatever happened
to you personally.

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:56.000
And I don't think there's a lot
of shows that are like that.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.550
And so Lin really
created a show that

00:52:57.550 --> 00:52:59.800
is such a gift to the actor
in that there is something

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.570
new to find every time.

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:03.970
And people always
tell us, we found out

00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:05.710
we got these tickets
a year ago, or these

00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:07.776
were my birthday present, or my
anniversary present, duh, duh,

00:53:07.776 --> 00:53:08.276
duh, duh.

00:53:08.276 --> 00:53:10.900
And so people have had this
date circled on their calendar

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:12.620
for a really long time.

00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:17.240
And it is our duty to make it
as perfect as an experience

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.090
as we can, if nothing else.

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:20.840
We work four hours a day.

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:25.090
So I should be able to put
my entire self into this,

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:28.840
because 2,300 people showed
up, and are so excited,

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.160
and are expected to be moved.

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.222
And damn right, they should be.

00:53:32.222 --> 00:53:33.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:35.700
So it's really our duty.

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:38.320
It's what I went to
college for, so I could

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.190
be as good at this as possible.

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:43.420
And so yeah, you
really assume, even

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.340
on days when you're
kind of feeling down,

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:47.830
or low, or whatever, as
soon as you step on stage

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:51.230
and he'll go, Alexander
Hamilton, I feel like, ahh!

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:54.850
And you're like,
OK, all right, yes.

00:53:54.850 --> 00:53:57.640
I love my job, and
I'm lucky to be here,

00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.740
and that moment, always, I'm
just like, OK, all right,

00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:02.659
here we go.

00:54:02.659 --> 00:54:03.520
Do you have any--

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.510
RYAN ALVARADO: Oh no.

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:05.950
SPEAKER 1: It's great to
hear that you guys are still

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:07.330
enjoying it, and not bored.

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:07.480
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Yes.

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:07.600
RYAN ALVARADO: Yeah.

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:08.300
SPEAKER 1: But if
you were bored,

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:09.799
this brings us to
our next question.

00:54:09.799 --> 00:54:10.366
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:10.366 --> 00:54:13.930
SPEAKER 1: From Sonny
F. Given the opportunity

00:54:13.930 --> 00:54:17.980
to play any other character
from the show other than the one

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:21.619
or ones that you currently
play, what would it be and why?

00:54:21.619 --> 00:54:22.660
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Peggy.

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:23.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:25.390
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Peggy?

00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:26.984
RYAN ALVARADO: Why not?

00:54:26.984 --> 00:54:28.400
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
Why not, right?

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.691
RYAN ALVARADO: Because why not?

00:54:29.691 --> 00:54:32.197
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: No, I
mean, I'm only half kidding.

00:54:32.197 --> 00:54:32.780
I mean, like--

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.024
It's so-- I mean--

00:54:35.024 --> 00:54:36.190
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Peggy's fun.

00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:36.870
Peggy's fun.

00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:37.430
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Peggy's cool.

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:38.888
SOLEA PFEIFFER:
It's totally valid.

00:54:38.888 --> 00:54:40.540
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: She's cool.

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:43.700
I would love to play
Hercules Mulligan.

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:46.890
That role is just so fun.

00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:48.500
Yeah, it just like--

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:51.286
all his lines are just
like, bro, bro, like,

00:54:51.286 --> 00:54:51.952
I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:51.952 --> 00:54:53.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:56.800
Like, I'm totally not that,
but that's being an actor.

00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.024
Like, I want to do
that one day maybe.

00:54:59.024 --> 00:55:00.560
SOLEA PFEIFFER:
Yeah, I have thought

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.004
about this in deep depths.

00:55:03.004 --> 00:55:04.670
I've really thought
about this question,

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:08.030
because I used to think
it was Burr, because Burr

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:09.375
has some fierce moments.

00:55:09.375 --> 00:55:10.250
RYAN ALVARADO: Right.

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:12.150
SOLEA PFEIFFER: And if you guys
have seen Joshua Henry do it,

00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:14.390
you understand why anyone
would want to play Burr.

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:17.480
So he's incredible, and
it's an amazing role.

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.160
But one thing-- at least
for women in theater--

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.820
I have never played a role
where almost every song I sang

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.650
was not about the
male protagonist.

00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:28.220
And female characters
usually start

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:31.037
to exist as soon as the male
character is like, hey, I would

00:55:31.037 --> 00:55:32.120
love to have a girlfriend.

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.310
And then she appears, and
they sing together, you know?

00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:34.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:37.340
And "Hamilton" is
kind of that way too.

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:42.500
Eliza-- I sing exclusively about
my man, and it's his story,

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.270
it's "Hamilton," you know.

00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:47.990
But that has been my experience
pretty much exclusively

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:52.190
as an actress, is the songs
that I sing are about the boy.

00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:54.400
And Burr is kind
of like that too.

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.540
Burr is kind of written
like a female character.

00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:58.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:58.190 --> 00:56:01.670
He is, and it's an amazing role,
but he talks about Hamilton

00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:03.168
the whole time too.

00:56:03.168 --> 00:56:04.189
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:04.189 --> 00:56:05.230
RYAN ALVARADO: He's mine.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:06.563
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Yeah, literally.

00:56:06.563 --> 00:56:08.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:11.130
And so when I really thought
about it-- oh my god,

00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:13.020
to be able to play
a character that

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:16.140
sings about their own thoughts
and feelings and wants in life,

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.290
and goals would be the
most amazing thing.

00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:20.331
And so if I ever got the
chance to play Hamilton,

00:56:20.331 --> 00:56:21.690
I would take that chance.

00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:23.656
I would love it.

00:56:23.656 --> 00:56:26.286
[CHEERING]

00:56:26.286 --> 00:56:27.970
RYAN ALVARADO:
And I would watch.

00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:30.280
She's great.

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:32.700
Me, I would say--

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.052
I cover a few roles.

00:56:35.052 --> 00:56:36.510
I cover Hamilton,
and I cover Burr,

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:39.513
so that's like memorizing
the dictionary on it itself.

00:56:39.513 --> 00:56:40.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:44.430
But for me, I actually wouldn't
mind doing Lafayette Jefferson,

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:47.430
just because I think it's
another thing where it's very

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:49.480
wordy, it's a very rappy role.

00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:53.349
But I would even put it
in terms of just the rap

00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:55.890
craft of that role is probably
the biggest challenge that you

00:56:55.890 --> 00:57:00.006
can take on, I think, in
terms of being a wordsmith.

00:57:00.006 --> 00:57:01.380
And I love
challenges, and I that

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:04.330
would be probably the next one.

00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:05.172
Yeah?

00:57:05.172 --> 00:57:07.067
SPEAKER 1: Can we go
for a live question?

00:57:07.067 --> 00:57:07.900
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.250
Thanks for coming today.

00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:11.340
I'm curious about the
journeys you each take

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:14.970
as actors from that moment
when as kids or teenagers,

00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:16.452
the theater bug
hit, you said, I've

00:57:16.452 --> 00:57:17.868
got to be in musical
theater, this

00:57:17.868 --> 00:57:21.430
is what I'm going to go for,
the educations you went through,

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:23.820
the training to be
able to get in the most

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:26.800
famous musical in ages.

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:29.640
For each of you, what were
some of the paths you took,

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.180
and what do you think were
some of the key factors that

00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:34.179
let you get to where you are?

00:57:34.179 --> 00:57:35.470
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Should I start?

00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:35.940
RYAN ALVARADO: Please.

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:38.060
SOLEA PFEIFFER: I was
a huge summer camp kid.

00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:43.950
I feel like I owe my
decision to choose

00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:45.960
this life to summer camp.

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:48.900
Because I played
violin very early on.

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.634
My parents were love the arts.

00:57:50.634 --> 00:57:52.050
They were always
super supportive,

00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:53.850
whatever I wanted to do.

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:56.435
But I remember when I went
to a theater summer camp

00:57:56.435 --> 00:57:58.310
for the first time, that
was when I was like,

00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:00.270
oh my god, these are my people.

00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:02.880
And this is what
makes me feel alive.

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:05.310
And I was young, but
that never stopped.

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:07.600
That bug really did catch
on pretty early for me.

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:08.766
I feel like was like, eight.

00:58:08.766 --> 00:58:10.380
I played Peter Pan
in a 15-minute skit

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:12.795
that we wrote at the
camp, but I loved it.

00:58:12.795 --> 00:58:13.545
I always loved it.

00:58:13.545 --> 00:58:16.200
I went back every year,
and I continued to do it.

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.790
I did it in middle
school, and then I

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:20.070
went to a really serious
high school, where they

00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:22.620
had an amazing drama program.

00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:26.370
And then when I found out that
I could do this in college,

00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:28.350
I was kind of like,
oh my god, if I

00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:31.710
could continue to study
this, there's nothing better.

00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:35.454
My parents were very much like,
you're going to go to college.

00:58:35.454 --> 00:58:36.870
My parents are
college professors,

00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:38.850
and they're like, that
is the next step for you.

00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:40.600
Study whatever you
want, but get a degree,

00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.460
because no one can take
that away from you.

00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:44.350
And that has carried me on.

00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:46.234
I'm really glad
that I went through.

00:58:46.234 --> 00:58:48.150
Some people leave school
early, this and that.

00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:52.590
But yeah, going to college
and studying it for four--

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:55.080
I went to the
University of Michigan.

00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:55.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:57.760
Yeah, hey, go Blue?

00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:58.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:58.260 --> 00:58:59.370
We're everywhere.

00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:00.900
I meet Wolverines everywhere.

00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:02.691
Yeah, I went to the
University of Michigan.

00:59:02.691 --> 00:59:04.440
I got a BFA in musical theater.

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:06.280
There's about 80 of us
in the whole program.

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:08.220
It's a small program
in a huge university.

00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.430
And there wasn't a
better program for me

00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:12.840
to go to, personally.

00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.752
I had the best time
there, and kind of

00:59:14.752 --> 00:59:16.710
figured out what kind of
artist I wanted to be,

00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:20.070
what kind of work
I wanted to do.

00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:21.570
Because I think a
lot of people have

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:24.270
an idea of what a musical
theater person is,

00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:25.865
and they're probably
pretty right.

00:59:25.865 --> 00:59:27.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:28.890
But in terms of
who I wanted to be,

00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:31.530
and what path I want
to forge for myself,

00:59:31.530 --> 00:59:34.877
I [INAUDIBLE] I studied
in London for four months,

00:59:34.877 --> 00:59:36.960
doing Shakespeare only,
not even touching anything

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:38.520
musical theater-related.

00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:42.240
And I think that changed
how I approach everything.

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.740
And I was actually
still in school

00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:46.140
when I sent in an audition
tape for this show.

00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:48.570
I had listened to
the soundtrack,

00:59:48.570 --> 00:59:50.670
and I was like,
oh my gosh, I have

00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:52.810
to be a part of this somehow.

00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:55.770
And so I sent an audition
tape maybe a month

00:59:55.770 --> 00:59:56.700
before I graduated.

00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:59.820
Then I came back, did a few more
auditions after I graduated.

00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:03.612
And it was actually the first
job that I got post school.

01:00:03.612 --> 01:00:04.540
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.997
And so it was--

01:00:05.997 --> 01:00:08.980
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.219
And it was one of
those ridiculous--

01:00:12.219 --> 01:00:14.010
where the stars just
aligned, and it really

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:15.795
was the perfect role.

01:00:15.795 --> 01:00:17.420
It was one of those
weird things, where

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:19.770
in school, everyone's like,
this would be perfect for you,

01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:20.978
and you're like, oh whatever.

01:00:20.978 --> 01:00:24.510
And then it happened,
and you're like, whoa.

01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:29.730
But yeah, I think an
important thing for any kids,

01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:32.460
or anyone who has kids who
might want to pursue this,

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:36.720
is really learning
about yourself a lot,

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.690
because nothing will inform
your craft more than knowing who

01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:40.750
you are.

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:44.100
And I'm really happy
that I took the time

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:46.650
to find out who I was, and
travel, and do things that

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:49.650
weren't focused specifically
on our industry,

01:00:49.650 --> 01:00:52.980
and just learning how to do a
triple pirouette or something,

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:53.755
or being fierce.

01:00:53.755 --> 01:00:55.380
Because there's a
lot of fierce people,

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:57.180
but there aren't a
lot of genuine people,

01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:58.690
I think, in what we do.

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:02.460
And I think nothing
reads more, and nothing

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:06.732
is more moving to an audience
than a genuine performance,

01:01:06.732 --> 01:01:08.440
or someone who really
knows who they are.

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.810
And that's something that you
can really feel and sense.

01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:14.580
And so University of Michigan
kind of allowed me to do that.

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:18.660
I was able to take classes on
witchcraft, and random things,

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:23.580
and figure out who I was, rather
than just like dance class,

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:26.000
dance class only, and you know.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.470
And yeah, nothing makes a better
artist than a well-read person,

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:33.090
I guess, if that
makes any sense.

01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:34.090
RYAN ALVARADO: For sure.

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:36.100
SOLEA PFEIFFER: So yeah,
I owe all my journey

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:39.090
to summer camp, and teachers,
and supportive parents,

01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:42.690
and kind of allowing
myself room to figure out

01:01:42.690 --> 01:01:46.560
who I was, and really
decide that I really

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.120
wanted to do this.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.440
This is kind of unrelated--

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.910
my senior year,
I found out I had

01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:53.167
a thyroid nodule on my throat.

01:01:53.167 --> 01:01:54.750
And I have a scar
right here, and I've

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:57.270
had surgery on my throat
my senior year of college.

01:01:57.270 --> 01:02:00.152
And I was like, oh my god,
of all the places on my body,

01:02:00.152 --> 01:02:01.110
the most important one?

01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:03.050
I was like, I wish this
could have been-- you know.

01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:04.590
And I was freaking out,
and it was this huge kind

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:06.870
of like come to Jesus
moment for me, because I

01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:09.460
realized that there's nothing
else that I want to do more.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:14.700
I was kind of like, if something
goes wrong, I don't know.

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:17.610
And when everything was OK, it
was kind of this moment of OK,

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:20.310
guard this with your life.

01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:21.175
Guard this future.

01:02:21.175 --> 01:02:22.675
I realized there's
nothing else that

01:02:22.675 --> 01:02:24.390
was going to make
me quite as happy,

01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:26.160
and it lit this
fire underneath me.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.940
And I was like, OK,
now you're going

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:30.610
to make this happen, because
you know this is what you want.

01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:32.280
And it was one of
those moments that

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.455
was horrible in the moment, but
I learned so much about myself.

01:02:35.455 --> 01:02:37.580
And I learned that this
was the life that I wanted.

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:38.704
And so I'm really grateful.

01:02:38.704 --> 01:02:40.630
But it was an important
part of my journey,

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:42.573
which is why I added it.

01:02:42.573 --> 01:02:44.730
But yeah, yeah.

01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:45.230
That's me.

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:46.255
RYAN ALVARADO: Oh yeah.

01:02:46.255 --> 01:02:47.070
No, amazing.

01:02:49.892 --> 01:02:52.350
I guess-- I don't know if I
consider myself a late bloomer,

01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:58.152
but I did it in middle school,
just did the school play

01:02:58.152 --> 01:02:58.860
in middle school.

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:01.240
But I also did the shows
in high school and stuff,

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.530
and that's when I got serious.

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:07.290
I started thinking about it
as a job, or a possible job.

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:10.440
Definitely something that I was
really taken by, and intrigued

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.319
by, so I got serious.

01:03:12.319 --> 01:03:14.610
In my own head, I just clicked
that light switch, where

01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:15.735
I think everyone does that.

01:03:15.735 --> 01:03:20.070
They just say, I'm this,
this is part of me now, yes.

01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:23.160
Because it's just
that kind of thing.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.930
It's an it's an artistic path.

01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:26.400
So I started that mentally.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.880
I went to school.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.370
I was actually cut
from my program.

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:31.450
I went to a small school.

01:03:31.450 --> 01:03:34.950
It was an acting program
just 30 minutes north

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:37.160
of the city, SUNY Purchase.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.180
It was a great little
acting program.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:48.600
And then this inner fire is kind
of what's propelled me forward,

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.290
and that's through rejection,
through all these things

01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:54.040
that I felt were in my way.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.220
I at least have been the
type of person, I think,

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.720
that I've always
wanted to overcome.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.220
I've always wanted
to surpass people

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.410
who might have tried
to put me in this box,

01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:03.500
or say maybe the no for this.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.560
If I say yes, it's yes.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.170
I can go do that, you know?

01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:12.630
So when I left
school, I didn't stop.

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:15.120
That was when I got literally,
like everything was just--

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.810
not them specifically,
but even your family,

01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:21.150
you'll find that you have
naysayers at a young age.

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:23.850
They'll be like no, they act
out, but that's impossible,

01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:27.000
that's the hardest career.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.400
It's so hard to do, and it is.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.980
I just knew I would
do it, I would try.

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:37.050
I would give my all, and I did.

01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:40.740
And after college, I
got my first company job

01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:42.040
at a year-round theater.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.040
They hired me out for a
couple of years of work,

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:47.790
and I treated that as kind of
like the complementary thing

01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:49.232
to my education.

01:04:49.232 --> 01:04:49.940
And I've done it.

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.530
And it also helped me build
who I was as a person,

01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:54.670
because I learned
in that experience,

01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:56.820
I decided that I would
finish school in my head

01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:59.207
by making everyone around
me my teacher, right?

01:04:59.207 --> 01:05:01.290
It's like, the star of the
show, or whoever it is,

01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:03.600
or the director, or anyone
who I valued something

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.920
that they had to gain.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:08.730
Because you learn in acting
too, like a great way to learn--

01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:11.220
it's not bad in the world
of acting-- but stealing,

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:12.040
you know?

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.460
Seeing something that, oh
wow, and I want to wear that,

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:15.835
or I want to put
it on, or I want

01:05:15.835 --> 01:05:18.352
to figure out how to also take
those skills and apply them.

01:05:18.352 --> 01:05:19.810
Maybe we all do
this, I don't know.

01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:22.830
But I just started doing that.

01:05:22.830 --> 01:05:27.990
I started compartmentalizing
who were my professors for what

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:30.240
I was going to take, or
by the end of this show,

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.220
I want to be able
to do that, or I

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:35.250
want to be able to dance
like that, or whatever it is.

01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:38.220
And I just started
going day by day,

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:40.630
trying to figure out till I
could graduate in my head.

01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:45.270
And then this theater that I
worked at was on Long Island.

01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:48.660
This place, where it was was
like an hour east of the city.

01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:52.051
I gathered as much as I
could, and then I packed up,

01:05:52.051 --> 01:05:53.550
I moved into the
city, and I started

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:54.549
gigging and auditioning.

01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:57.345
And I've never left that
mentality, though I do it now.

01:05:57.345 --> 01:05:59.220
Because you know this
is a great opportunity,

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:01.442
but they tell you
when you get here,

01:06:01.442 --> 01:06:03.150
obviously, it's always
eyes on the prize.

01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:03.650
What's next?

01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:05.130
What can we turn this into?

01:06:05.130 --> 01:06:08.420
And the only way
that I'll get there

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:10.610
is by learning
from everyone here,

01:06:10.610 --> 01:06:12.199
everyone that we
work with, everyone

01:06:12.199 --> 01:06:14.240
we've been blessed to meet
along on this journey.

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.790
You all, you know?

01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:20.600
It helped me figure out
how I wanted to work,

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:23.810
or what type of artist that
I wanted to be as well.

01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:26.450
And that was my journey.

01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:32.000
And I compartmentalize rejection
that way, and nos, and doubts.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.455
Instead of let them hinder me,
I tend I try to use them always,

01:06:35.455 --> 01:06:36.830
whether it's prove
someone wrong,

01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:37.871
the chip on the shoulder.

01:06:37.871 --> 01:06:39.940
Might not be the best
way, but you know.

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:40.650
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: It works.

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:42.649
RYAN ALVARADO: Yeah, it
worked for me, you know?

01:06:42.649 --> 01:06:43.391
But yeah.

01:06:43.391 --> 01:06:44.390
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Cool.

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:46.340
SPEAKER 1: Can we take
one last live question?

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:47.971
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Yeah.

01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:50.298
AUDIENCE: I feel like I'm
cutting off your journey.

01:06:50.298 --> 01:06:50.798
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:51.272
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Mine?

01:06:51.272 --> 01:06:51.746
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:06:51.746 --> 01:06:52.670
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Oh.

01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:54.930
I mean, I went to
school, graduated.

01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:57.980
I got a BFA in 2015.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.250
I owe it all to my mom.

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:01.766
She put me in theater
when I was a kid.

01:07:01.766 --> 01:07:03.765
I didn't want to do it,
but then she like kept--

01:07:03.765 --> 01:07:04.655
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:04.655 --> 01:07:07.650
She was like, hey,
do this, do that.

01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:09.890
And I did some TV
commercial stuff

01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:11.540
when I was a kid, so
I knew I liked it.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:15.830
Once I started to get into it,
I knew I really enjoyed it.

01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:18.870
But yeah, the flame
was lit in high school.

01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:22.190
And since then, I never stopped.

01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:24.037
I'm just like, go, go, go.

01:07:24.037 --> 01:07:25.870
And if somebody tells
me no, I'm like, well,

01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:28.402
I'm going to go around
that, and keep going.

01:07:28.402 --> 01:07:29.619
So yeah.

01:07:29.619 --> 01:07:31.160
AUDIENCE: So one of
the things that I

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.118
love about "Hamilton" in
that it's sung through

01:07:33.118 --> 01:07:34.960
is that the breadth
of songs is huge,

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.102
so you can kind of
discover different things.

01:07:38.102 --> 01:07:39.560
And when I first
started listening,

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.768
I gravitated towards the
biggies, like "Wait For It,"

01:07:41.768 --> 01:07:42.850
and "It's Quiet Uptown."

01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:44.630
But now for some
reason, I can't stop

01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:47.090
listening to "We Know" and
"The Reynolds Pamphlet" back

01:07:47.090 --> 01:07:48.720
to back, just over
and over again.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.990
So I was wondering
if there's songs

01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:54.200
that you guys love
that you don't sing,

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.200
that are not part of your
role, that in the first act

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:02.312
and second act that you just
gravitate towards right now?

01:08:02.312 --> 01:08:05.140
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Second
act, I can tell you that--

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:07.820
well, my favorite
song in "Hamilton"

01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:10.370
is "The Room Where it Happens."

01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:15.500
and I owe a lot of that to
Josh Henry, who plays Burr.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:19.430
I'm lucky enough to be
onstage while he's performing

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:23.720
that number, and I'm just
doing my little choreography

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:28.130
here while he's giving this
award-winning performance.

01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:34.069
But just to see his
transformation is so awesome.

01:08:34.069 --> 01:08:42.620
I mean, to see him how he is
before that song to after,

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.840
he turns into a monster.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.930
Like he just looks
taller, and looks meaner,

01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:51.324
and he's ready to
go kill someone.

01:08:51.324 --> 01:08:52.240
I mean, he does, but--

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.540
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:55.040
I just--

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.248
RYAN ALVARADO: Spoiler alert.

01:08:56.248 --> 01:08:57.380
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:01.010
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Just like
that song, just by itself,

01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:05.000
without the acting part of
it, just how it's written,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.290
it just gets me.

01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:07.420
It's just so good.

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:11.830
And yeah, I'm just lucky
enough to be on stage with him

01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:14.840
while he's doing that.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.250
I really like "Satisfied."

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:18.470
And I remember the first
time I saw "Satisfied--"

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:20.700
SOLEA PFEIFFER: (WHISPERING)
Oh, it's so good.

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:23.200
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
I liked every song.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.550
"Satisfied" wasn't my
favorite when I first

01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:28.279
listened to the recording.

01:09:28.279 --> 01:09:31.000
But when I saw it, and I
saw how they staged it,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.796
I was just like,
what is going on?

01:09:33.796 --> 01:09:35.796
Why are they playing with
my emotions like that?

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:37.069
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:37.069 --> 01:09:39.859
I was just so
happy and helpless,

01:09:39.859 --> 01:09:41.689
like, yeah, I'm helpless.

01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:42.606
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:42.606 --> 01:09:43.189
They're like--

01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.974
SPEAKER 1: Rewind.

01:09:43.974 --> 01:09:45.649
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL:
--kissing, and marriage,

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:47.940
and then all of a sudden,
you just get hit in the face,

01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:50.720
and you're like,
what, [SPUTTERING]

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:51.890
and then it was over.

01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:56.420
So yeah, those two are
probably my favorite songs

01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:59.100
that I don't sing in.

01:09:59.100 --> 01:09:59.865
But yeah.

01:09:59.865 --> 01:10:01.969
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Yeah.

01:10:01.969 --> 01:10:04.010
I guess like, singing it--
but I love "Non-stop."

01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:06.890
"Non-stop" has been my
favorite in act one, always,

01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:07.791
just from jump.

01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:09.290
Mostly because you
can just geek out

01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:13.580
at how the musical
themes that Lin

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:18.150
took, and devoted each character
to, when they come together,

01:10:18.150 --> 01:10:21.740
it's musical theory heaven.

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:24.410
You can just geek out so
hard over that moment, even

01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:27.560
just looking at the sheet music,
and realizing what they did

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:31.070
in terms of how they were
going to take one musical idea

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:33.980
and use it to tell
the story, and use

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:38.240
those little themes to define
who those characters are.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.746
And when they all come together,
it just is the coolest thing.

01:10:41.746 --> 01:10:43.620
So you're like, I
recognize that, I recognize

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:45.740
that, I recognize that.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.770
And I think the amazing
thing about music theory,

01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:53.759
and Alex Lacamoire being the
most amazing musical arranger--

01:10:53.759 --> 01:10:55.050
I don't know the exact wording.

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:55.630
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Orchestrator.

01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:57.046
SOLEA PFEIFFER:
Orchestrator, yes.

01:10:57.046 --> 01:10:57.620
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:01.430
When you have all these musical
geniuses all on the same page,

01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:07.150
working to just tell the
story so specifically and so

01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:11.170
perfectly, that song is
an amazing combination

01:11:11.170 --> 01:11:13.420
of all those things
coming together.

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:15.220
Because the musical--
I don't know.

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:18.300
I just love to geek out
on the music theory stuff.

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:19.630
And I love "Obedient Servant."

01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:21.060
I just think it's so good.

01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.410
I think it's so good.

01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:23.470
RYAN ALVARADO: It
is, it is a good jam.

01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:23.660
SOLEA PFEIFFER: It's so good.

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:24.740
You're just like, hey.

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:27.370
And I just get to listen
to that one backstage.

01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:30.140
I'm the only person
backstage during that part.

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:31.070
You too?

01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.940
Where are you?

01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:33.316
We got to hang out.

01:11:33.316 --> 01:11:34.000
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.050
I didn't know this.

01:11:35.050 --> 01:11:36.140
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: I'm
not right backstage.

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:36.910
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Where
have you been hiding?

01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:38.090
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: I'm
in my dressing room.

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:38.710
SOLEA PFEIFFER:
Oh my god, well, I

01:11:38.710 --> 01:11:40.780
can always see-- my boyfriend
is actually in the show.

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:42.910
We met in college, and now
we're both in "Hamilton."

01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:44.376
He's going to be Hamilton
tonight, actually.

01:11:44.376 --> 01:11:45.210
RUBEN J. CARBAJAL: Yeah.

01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:45.480
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:45.860
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Yeah.

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.443
We're going to be
opposite each other.

01:11:47.443 --> 01:11:49.000
But I always--
during that number,

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.520
because I have all this free
time, and he's right offstage,

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.920
I can always mess with him.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.067
I'm like, hey, boo.

01:11:54.067 --> 01:11:54.981
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:54.981 --> 01:11:59.010
I always try to make him
laugh, he never does.

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:01.510
I always get to mess with him
there, so that's another part.

01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:03.301
That's another reason
why it's my favorite.

01:12:03.301 --> 01:12:05.898
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:05.898 --> 01:12:07.360
RYAN ALVARADO: Yeah.

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.970
A song that I don't do--

01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:12.790
I can only think of "Burn."

01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:16.676
OK, so "Hamilton,"
it this huge show.

01:12:16.676 --> 01:12:17.800
I'm sure we've all seen it.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.050
There's so many moving pieces.

01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:22.220
We've got turntables going,
we've got so many lights.

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:25.000
We've got all these mic
cues, all these costumes,

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.200
all these changes.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.080
And it really is
an ginormous thing.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:33.880
But to me, it reminds you
of what brought you there,

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.470
what we're doing it
for, when you just

01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:37.960
see an actress, an amazing
one like Solea-- we have

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.910
many covers also,
that are all doing

01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:41.165
this in their different way.

01:12:41.165 --> 01:12:42.790
But it's that kind
of thing in our show

01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:44.710
where you're being hit
with so much stimulus,

01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:46.930
and then a song like
"Burn" comes on,

01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:49.300
and it's all taken away.

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:52.120
It's one person,
in one light cue,

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.017
and she's got one thing to say.

01:12:54.017 --> 01:12:55.600
And she's going to
use all this music,

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.070
and all this song to do it in.

01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:59.560
But I think it's one
of the hardest things

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.467
that anyone does in
our show, and they're

01:13:02.467 --> 01:13:03.550
doing it every single day.

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:06.670
And like we said earlier, every
show is that show for you.

01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:09.490
So I see her angle
into the song change.

01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:11.860
And when different people
do it, their entire approach

01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:15.400
may be different.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.240
I've seen her end in a
different-- or heard,

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.864
I have to hide in
the back during that.

01:13:18.864 --> 01:13:21.250
But I've heard it
end a different place

01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:22.360
than it might have.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.820
And the calibration of
that specific journey

01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:29.500
without a scene partner,
without all the things

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:32.170
that make "Hamilton"
"Hamilton" to me

01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:34.230
is one of the craziest
feats you can do.

01:13:34.230 --> 01:13:36.313
And I don't know how often
it happens in the show,

01:13:36.313 --> 01:13:39.400
but that's definitely the
biggest one, where it's just

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.100
go, you know?

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:44.080
Make them cry, or
whatever it is.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.170
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:48.790
And it's wildly impressive.

01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:50.560
I've told her many
a time, and all

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.440
the girls who do it, it's
one of the single most

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.750
difficult things,
I think, an actor

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:59.860
or actress who is doing in the
contemporary musical theater

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:02.020
in any show, you know?

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:05.350
So that impresses me without
fail every single show,

01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:08.380
every single day.

01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:10.340
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Awesome.

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:12.390
SPEAKER 1: Thank you guys
so much for joining us.

01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:14.723
Let's put our hands together
for the cast of "Hamilton."

01:14:14.723 --> 01:14:16.760
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:21.910
SOLEA PFEIFFER: Thanks, guys.
