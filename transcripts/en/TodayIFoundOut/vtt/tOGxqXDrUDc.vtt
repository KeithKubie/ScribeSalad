00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.690
The History of the Hollywood Sign

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:06.049
While today the famous Hollywood sign is considered
an icon of the town, originally it wasn’t

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.540
anything so special and had some significant
differences to the version we see today.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.820
Specifically, in the beginning it read “HOLLYWOODLAND”
and was lit with about 4,000, 20 watt light

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.910
bulbs, which would flash “HOLLY” then
“WOOD” then “LAND” then “HOLLYWOODLAND”

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.910
repeatedly.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.789
The sign was originally put up in 1923 to
promote a housing development.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.540
The owner of Crescent Sign Company, Thomas
Fisk Goff, designed the sign itself, making

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.180
the letters about 50 ft. tall by 30 ft. wide
and embedding the aforementioned 4,000, 20

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.120
watt light bulbs in the sign to light it up
and flash.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.350
The sign cost about $21,000 to make and put
up (about $265,000 today) and was expected

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.020
to last about a year to two years.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.930
The “LAND” portion of the sign was taken
off in the late 1940s when the Hollywood Chamber

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.840
of Commerce in conjunction with the L.A. Parks
Department began efforts to repair the seriously

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.200
deteriorated sign which had been abandoned
by the Hollywoodland real estate group in

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.930
the 1930s due to the Great Depression.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.460
With the “LAND” part gone, it would now
be a symbol for all of Hollywood, rather than

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.600
a housing development.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.980
The lights were removed in the renovation
as the Parks Department didn’t want to pay

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.090
for the electricity or replacement bulbs,
so stipulated that the Chamber of Commerce

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.360
would have to pay if they wanted to keep them.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.780
They opted not to.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.580
By the 1970s, the sign had further deteriorated
to the point where it read “HULLYWO D”.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.620
At that point, spurred on by a campaign by
Hugh Hefner, Alice Cooper, and Gene Autry,

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.200
nine total donors, each contributing $27,700,
paid to replace each of the original letters

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.670
with more permanent 45 ft. tall steel letters.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.600
These donors were:
• H: publisher Terrence Donnelly

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.829
• O: producer Giovanni Mazza
• L: Kelley Blue Book founder Les Kelley

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.750
• L: actor/singer Gene Autry
• Y: Hugh Hefner

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.290
• W: singer Andy Williams
• O: Alice Cooper, donating in the name

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.340
of Groucho Marx
• O: Warner Bros. Records

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.340
• D:

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.130
Thomas Pooley
The new sign was unveiled on November 14,

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.700
1978 and has stood to this day, though the
letters were repainted in 2005.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.300
Bonus Facts:
• The name “Hollywood”, for the town,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.580
was probably suggested by Daeida Wilcox, wife
of Harvey Wilcox.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.250
Depending on which story you want to believe,
Daeida either got the name from a Chicago

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.250
woman who she sat next to on a train or a
neighbor.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.510
According to the “train” story, the woman
had a summer home that she mentioned to Daeida

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.670
called “Hollywood”.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.620
In the “neighbor” story, the neighbor
had a home in Holly Canyon called Hollywood.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.260
Whatever the case, Daeida loved the name so
in turn named her and her husband’s new

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.450
ranch “Hollywood”.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.090
The two later planned out a town on their
property with Daeida landscaping the lots

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.860
to be sold and naming the streets and sidewalks.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.090
The first such sidewalk was just a short distance
from their house and is only a few meters

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.850
away from what is now the Hollywood Walk of
Fame.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.020
For her significant role in planning out the
original Hollywood town, Daeida is known as

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.460
the “Mother of Hollywood”.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.010
That said, an alternative story is that real
estate magnate Hobart Johnstone Whitley named

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.569
the town after scouting the land and meeting
an immigrant Chinese laborer who, after being

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.900
asked by Whitley what he was doing there so
early in the day, replied in broken English

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.980
“I’m hauling wood”, which supposedly
sounded like “Hollywood”.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.290
As someone who researches these types of “amazing”
anecdotes from history daily, I can say ones

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.000
along this vein invariably prove to be false
or have no real hard evidence behind them

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.430
(which seems to be the case for this one);
so I’m personally leaning towards the Daeida

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.180
Wilcox story as being the correct one as it
has more substantiated evidence backing it

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.180
up.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.800
(An alternate story is that Whitley and his
wife thought up the name while on their honeymoon

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.410
in 1886, one year before Wilcox supposedly
named it, but I was not able to find any substantial

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.540
evidence to back up this claim either, so
I’m still leaning towards the Daeida Wilcox

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.540
claim.)

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.890
• While he may or may not have come up with
the name “Hollywood”, H.J. Whitley is

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.240
known as the “Father of Hollywood” for
his part in developing the region.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.540
He also founded or was involved in the founding
of over 140 other towns across the United

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.819
States.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.800
• 24 year old actress Peg Entwistle committed
suicide by jumping from the H in the Hollywood

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.800
sign in 1932.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.790
Her body was found on September 18th of that
year and later identified by her uncle who

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.309
she had been staying with before disappearing
two days before her body was found.

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:24.840
She had a suicide note on her stating, “I
am afraid, I am a coward.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.009
I am sorry for everything.

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.219
If I had done this a long time ago, it would
have saved a lot of pain.

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:31.219
P.E.”

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:34.360
She had become increasingly disheartened by
her inability to become a star and her lack

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.590
of prospects.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.870
Sadly ironic was the fact that the day after
her body was found a letter arrived offering

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.179
her the lead role in a play about a woman
who was driven to suicide.

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:49.629
• Famed Hollywood sign prankster Daniel
Finegood once slightly modified the Hollywood

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.370
sign with coverings so that it read “HOLLYWEED”.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.580
This was for a school project on Jan. 1, 1976,
which he received an A on.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.080
Another modification he and his friends did
was to change it to “HOL YWOOD” during

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.949
Easter of 1977.

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.290
He also once attempted to change it to “OIL
WAR”, referencing the Gulf War, but park

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.139
rangers noticed the modification almost immediately
and before daylight hit removed the plastic

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.979
he and his friends had used to make the modification.

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.610
Today such attempts to vandalize or modify
the way the sign looks without permission

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.089
is not only illegal, but extremely difficult
to pull off due to cameras and motion sensors

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:29.850
which are now pointed at the sign 24 hours
a day and instantly alert the police if anything

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:41.430
or anyone is detected approaching restricted
sections around 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.389
the sign.
