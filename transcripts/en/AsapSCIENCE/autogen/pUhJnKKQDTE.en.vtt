is absorbed more slowly through your gut
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.950
is absorbed more slowly through your gut
but this high typically lasts forward to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
but this high typically lasts forward to
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.289
but this high typically lasts forward to
eight hours and most report feeling more

this is because when you eat edible weed

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
this is because when you eat edible weed
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.050
this is because when you eat edible weed
the THC is first metabolized by the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060
the THC is first metabolized by the
 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.580
the THC is first metabolized by the
liver before entering the bloodstream

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
liver before entering the bloodstream
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.600
liver before entering the bloodstream
and here Delta 9 THC also becomes 11 o

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
and here Delta 9 THC also becomes 11 o
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.940

HT HT which passes the brain barrier

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950
HT HT which passes the brain barrier
 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.950
HT HT which passes the brain barrier
more rapidly and is a more potent

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
more rapidly and is a more potent
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.050
more rapidly and is a more potent
chemical so using the same amount of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
chemical so using the same amount of
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.090
chemical so using the same amount of
marijuana you actually get more high

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
marijuana you actually get more high
 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.920
marijuana you actually get more high
with edibles because it ends up creating

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930
with edibles because it ends up creating
 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.490
with edibles because it ends up creating
both Delta 9 THC and 11 o h th G which

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
both Delta 9 THC and 11 o h th G which
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.800
both Delta 9 THC and 11 o h th G which
is a stronger compound and because there

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
is a stronger compound and because there
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.210
is a stronger compound and because there
are more psychotropic types of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
are more psychotropic types of
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.710
are more psychotropic types of
cannabinoids acting on your neurons

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
cannabinoids acting on your neurons
 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.230
cannabinoids acting on your neurons
you'll be high for longer of course you

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240
you'll be high for longer of course you
 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940
you'll be high for longer of course you
also get to skip out on the toxic

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950
also get to skip out on the toxic
 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.560
also get to skip out on the toxic
chemicals that smoking provides like

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
chemicals that smoking provides like
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.870
chemicals that smoking provides like
carbon monoxide bronchial irritants and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880
carbon monoxide bronchial irritants and
 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.480
carbon monoxide bronchial irritants and
tumor initiators smoking anything means

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
tumor initiators smoking anything means
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.130
tumor initiators smoking anything means
you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140
you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules
 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.200
you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules
so if you can get high without smoking

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
so if you can get high without smoking
 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.969
so if you can get high without smoking
it will be healthier for your lungs and

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
it will be healthier for your lungs and
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.280
it will be healthier for your lungs and
body the downside it's much harder to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290
body the downside it's much harder to
 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.230
body the downside it's much harder to
control the high oget because it can

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
control the high oget because it can
 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.999
control the high oget because it can
take up to one to two hours to feel the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
take up to one to two hours to feel the
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.859
take up to one to two hours to feel the
full effects and the dosage can vary

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
full effects and the dosage can vary
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.050
full effects and the dosage can vary
significantly modulating the effects or

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
significantly modulating the effects or
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.089
significantly modulating the effects or
titrating as it's called is much more

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
titrating as it's called is much more
 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.279
titrating as it's called is much more
difficult and as a result you can end up

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
difficult and as a result you can end up
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.480
difficult and as a result you can end up
a lot higher than

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490
a lot higher than
 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.580
