00:00:00.078 --> 00:00:00.947
(whooshing)

00:00:00.947 --> 00:00:05.252
(clicking)
(electronic tones)

00:00:05.252 --> 00:00:07.752
(piano music)

00:00:09.552 --> 00:00:12.497
- [Man] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.497 --> 00:00:14.980
Bipedal, naked,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.674
large brained,

00:00:17.674 --> 00:00:21.678
long the master of fire,
tools and language,

00:00:21.678 --> 00:00:25.095
but still trying to understand ourselves,

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:29.214
aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.214 --> 00:00:31.297
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.040
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.894 --> 00:00:37.484
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:39.567
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.864 --> 00:00:42.466
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.216
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.625
Carta brings together experts

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:50.341
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:53.139
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:54.806
and how we got here.

00:00:56.418 --> 00:00:58.235
An exploration made possible by

00:00:58.235 --> 00:01:01.068
the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.424 --> 00:01:18.507
(instrumental music)

00:01:20.757 --> 00:01:23.340
(upbeat music)

00:01:39.836 --> 00:01:43.263
- So, let me talk about what we can learn

00:01:43.263 --> 00:01:46.479
from congenital amusia.

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:47.909
First of all, I'd like to mention

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.246
that we are all born to
be musical and we all are.

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:55.111
That is musical engagement is ubiquitous

00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:57.278
and emerges early in life,

00:01:58.277 --> 00:02:00.739
and the best evidence
is really that newborns

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:03.335
respond to abstract
properties of musical pitch

00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:06.828
and time structure, like
changes in tonal key

00:02:06.828 --> 00:02:09.495
and disruptions of musical beat,

00:02:10.808 --> 00:02:12.339
before the age of one.

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:15.407
We also move spontaneously to music

00:02:15.407 --> 00:02:17.875
and when moved in symphony with music

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:21.314
they show enhanced pro-social behavior.

00:02:21.314 --> 00:02:23.450
So, musical engagement is not only

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.553
rooted in social interactions,

00:02:26.553 --> 00:02:30.220
but it also a highly
pleasurable experience,

00:02:31.073 --> 00:02:33.413
and now we demonstrated now with dance.

00:02:33.413 --> 00:02:36.294
This is not the prototypical
musical situation,

00:02:36.294 --> 00:02:39.483
but think of it, it's
really a musical activity,

00:02:39.483 --> 00:02:43.025
and I'd like you to pay
attention to the first row

00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:44.900
and the last one,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.801
and these are the two extremes
I am really interested in.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.468
(uptempo music)

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:07.528
And I'm sorry, but I will
turn first to the ones who

00:03:07.528 --> 00:03:08.590
don't have it.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.748
That is they represent
1.5% of the population

00:03:12.748 --> 00:03:16.915
and that is what I'm referring
to as congenital amusia.

00:03:18.313 --> 00:03:21.529
I call it congenital for the idea

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:23.723
that it is present from birth,

00:03:23.723 --> 00:03:26.460
defines a likely time period,

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.602
not the etiology.

00:03:28.602 --> 00:03:32.262
Although we have made a lot
of progress regarding this.

00:03:32.262 --> 00:03:35.228
What characterizing them,

00:03:35.228 --> 00:03:37.063
it's their inability to detect

00:03:37.063 --> 00:03:41.230
when someone sings out-of-tune
including themselves,

00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:45.407
to recognize and sing
familiar tune without

00:03:45.407 --> 00:03:49.969
the aid of the lyrics and
to maintain tunes in memory,

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.555
and what is really fascinating is that

00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:56.371
it emerges just in isolation

00:03:56.371 --> 00:03:58.262
from other disturbances

00:03:58.262 --> 00:04:01.713
such as speech delay,
intellectual deficiency,

00:04:01.713 --> 00:04:04.890
acquired brain damage or
even music deprivation.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.402
The eyes go to music like we all are,

00:04:07.402 --> 00:04:09.289
and they have normal understanding

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:12.215
of speech and prosody in everyday life.

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:16.687
It is also very similar to
other learning disorders

00:04:16.687 --> 00:04:20.049
that you are familiar with,
like dyslexia for example,

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.259
speech disorders like
the one we heard earlier,

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.509
dyscalculia, prosopagnosia.

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:30.726
Why are we so interested
by these conditions?

00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:34.586
It's because it is a natural experiment

00:04:34.586 --> 00:04:38.431
of the neurobiological origins of music

00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:41.170
because it is an accident of nature.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.558
We didn't create it

00:04:42.558 --> 00:04:46.725
and it is a rare chance to
link brain behavior and genes,

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:52.440
and also breakdown patterns,
reveal how the brain works

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.607
and I tried to illustrate each
of these points in a moment,

00:04:57.737 --> 00:05:00.904
but I have to tell you how we do that.

00:05:02.018 --> 00:05:05.359
So, we go from the behavior to,

00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:07.510
and I will illustrate it so that

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.964
you will have an idea of what it is,

00:05:08.964 --> 00:05:13.131
from a functional explanation
to the brain correlates

00:05:14.655 --> 00:05:18.985
what are the anomalies in
the brain to the etiology

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:22.884
from the genes to the
environmental factor,

00:05:22.884 --> 00:05:25.508
and I will illustrate it with someone

00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:28.271
who just wrote a book about his condition.

00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:29.637
(audience laughs)

00:05:29.637 --> 00:05:30.869
Tim Falconer.

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:33.782
He was 54 when he came to visit my lab

00:05:33.782 --> 00:05:37.034
and that's where he
discovered that he was amusic

00:05:37.034 --> 00:05:39.292
because he only had one complaint

00:05:39.292 --> 00:05:40.971
is to sing out-of-tune,

00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:43.678
and I really invite you to read his book

00:05:43.678 --> 00:05:46.310
which is a fascinating description

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.651
because he writes so beautifully as well

00:05:48.651 --> 00:05:50.681
and has a very good sense of humor.

00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:52.642
It just appeared last year,

00:05:52.642 --> 00:05:55.154
but let me illustrate with his condition,

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:58.707
because we filmed him several times.

00:05:58.707 --> 00:06:02.679
So, typically they fail
to detect pitch deviants.

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:05.054
Like here there are two melodies

00:06:05.054 --> 00:06:08.971
and we ask them if it is
the same or different.

00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:11.378
(beep)

00:06:11.378 --> 00:06:14.045
(piano playing)

00:06:30.754 --> 00:06:32.143
- I'm gonna say that was different.

00:06:32.143 --> 00:06:35.643
I think there was an extra pause in there.

00:06:40.098 --> 00:06:41.220
(beep)

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.303
(fast piano playing)

00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:54.827
Same.

00:06:54.827 --> 00:06:55.744
(audience laughs)

00:06:55.744 --> 00:06:57.271
- And you could see on the face that

00:06:57.271 --> 00:06:58.395
he couldn't tell.

00:06:58.395 --> 00:06:59.846
He couldn't detect them.

00:06:59.846 --> 00:07:01.483
Now, the best part.

00:07:01.483 --> 00:07:03.219
So, we played with the melodies

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:05.999
so that the melody's one semitone apart

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:07.804
from the accompaniment.

00:07:07.804 --> 00:07:11.201
This is really a disorder
related to pitch structure,

00:07:11.201 --> 00:07:15.516
and they are insensitive
to this kind of change

00:07:15.516 --> 00:07:18.662
while newborns are sensitive to this.

00:07:18.662 --> 00:07:20.505
They do perceive this change.

00:07:20.505 --> 00:07:23.571
So, let me play to you the first example,

00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:26.704
and of course, we don't ask non-musicians

00:07:26.704 --> 00:07:29.191
if it's dissonant or consonant.

00:07:29.191 --> 00:07:32.774
We just ask if it's
pleasant or unpleasant.

00:07:34.643 --> 00:07:38.560
(upbeat classical piano music)

00:07:42.385 --> 00:07:44.645
- So, like 10 is really pleasant?

00:07:44.645 --> 00:07:45.478
- [Woman] Yes.

00:07:45.478 --> 00:07:46.311
- Uh...

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.373
(classical piano music)

00:07:58.401 --> 00:07:59.791
Seven.

00:07:59.791 --> 00:08:02.624
(audience laughs)

00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:08.951
- And typically, we'd
say everybody laughs.

00:08:08.951 --> 00:08:10.868
I don't understand why,

00:08:12.201 --> 00:08:14.596
and this really the problem
with this condition.

00:08:14.596 --> 00:08:18.213
They are unaware of what's happening.

00:08:18.213 --> 00:08:19.848
They have no idea of what is wrong

00:08:19.848 --> 00:08:21.076
and what is correct,

00:08:21.076 --> 00:08:24.816
and they sing, most of
them sing out-of-tune

00:08:24.816 --> 00:08:26.102
and they are unaware of it.

00:08:26.102 --> 00:08:28.206
It's just because other people tell them

00:08:28.206 --> 00:08:32.248
that they are a little bit off, like Tim.

00:08:32.248 --> 00:08:35.683
He is not really off as you will see.

00:08:35.683 --> 00:08:38.979
♫ Happy birthday to you

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:42.545
♫ Happy birthday to you

00:08:42.545 --> 00:08:45.899
♫ Happy birthday dear Mehala

00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:49.853
♫ Happy birthday to you

00:08:49.853 --> 00:08:52.321
- But what is really
nice is when we ask him

00:08:52.321 --> 00:08:53.988
to sing on la la la.

00:08:55.093 --> 00:08:58.343
(Tim singing la la la)

00:08:59.905 --> 00:09:00.861
(Tim laughs)

00:09:00.861 --> 00:09:04.111
(Tim singing la la la)

00:09:06.948 --> 00:09:09.393
- [Tim] That wasn't even close (laughs).

00:09:09.393 --> 00:09:12.818
- He knows that he doesn't
know what the tune is,

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:16.298
but he's improvising as
well as the whole family.

00:09:16.298 --> 00:09:17.641
I'll give you an example later,

00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:21.684
but what is really
interesting is this fact.

00:09:21.684 --> 00:09:26.424
That in terms of, I mean
Tim must be average here.

00:09:26.424 --> 00:09:28.606
Here are the amusics,

00:09:28.606 --> 00:09:32.482
and we have a large pool of 38 amusics

00:09:32.482 --> 00:09:34.035
and here are the controls.

00:09:34.035 --> 00:09:37.420
So, each dot represents
the average of one subject.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.587
Each syllable is really
analyzed syllable by syllable,

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.024
and as you can see they
do sing less in tune

00:09:46.024 --> 00:09:47.788
than the controls.

00:09:47.788 --> 00:09:50.205
100 cents means one semitone.

00:09:51.307 --> 00:09:55.993
This is the building block
of the tonal western system.

00:09:55.993 --> 00:09:59.116
It is two adjacent keys on a keyboard,

00:09:59.116 --> 00:10:03.283
and as you can see they are
indeed deviant in those terms,

00:10:05.558 --> 00:10:08.453
but what is very fascinating is that maybe

00:10:08.453 --> 00:10:12.468
they're out-of-tune relative
to what they should sing,

00:10:12.468 --> 00:10:15.963
but they are in key, that is the intervals

00:10:15.963 --> 00:10:18.801
they are singing are really in the key,

00:10:18.801 --> 00:10:21.367
or at least as well as controlled.

00:10:21.367 --> 00:10:24.351
They don't make so many
errors in those terms,

00:10:24.351 --> 00:10:27.361
and what is very interesting in that

00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:29.926
when they improvise like Tim,

00:10:29.926 --> 00:10:32.426
they really made fewer errors.

00:10:34.075 --> 00:10:38.423
So, the idea is really we
should improvise a little more,

00:10:38.423 --> 00:10:40.351
and it is hereditary,

00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:42.758
and I'll play just the mother,

00:10:42.758 --> 00:10:45.755
but this is really a
signature of the whole family.

00:10:45.755 --> 00:10:49.588
I just don't want this
to be later on youtube.

00:10:50.897 --> 00:10:52.980
- [Elsie] Elsie Falconer.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:57.574
♫ Happy birthday to you

00:10:57.574 --> 00:11:00.937
♫ Happy birthday to you

00:11:00.937 --> 00:11:04.561
♫ Happy birthday dear friend

00:11:04.561 --> 00:11:08.642
♫ Happy birthday to you

00:11:08.642 --> 00:11:09.968
- Not everybody does.

00:11:09.968 --> 00:11:11.975
I mean that's fantastic about this family

00:11:11.975 --> 00:11:14.504
because most of them are affected.

00:11:14.504 --> 00:11:17.198
These are the black shapes.

00:11:17.198 --> 00:11:19.337
I mean most of them are.

00:11:19.337 --> 00:11:21.759
Of course, a few are spared

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:24.448
so we can say it's not
really in the environment.

00:11:24.448 --> 00:11:29.340
It is in their genes and we
knew it is really hereditary.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.425
So, if you have one
relative in your family

00:11:33.425 --> 00:11:38.061
or a close relative,
then they are 40% chance

00:11:38.061 --> 00:11:40.980
of 10 times at least more chance at that

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.719
you have a risk for amusia.

00:11:43.719 --> 00:11:45.478
So it is hereditable.

00:11:45.478 --> 00:11:49.101
So we try to identify what
are the genetic variants

00:11:49.101 --> 00:11:50.557
of this condition,

00:11:50.557 --> 00:11:53.988
because it has been so
successful for speech disorders

00:11:53.988 --> 00:11:57.905
and for the moment it
has been without success.

00:11:58.775 --> 00:12:00.543
The only thing I can say

00:12:00.543 --> 00:12:02.724
and still it is only getting finding

00:12:02.724 --> 00:12:06.557
is that we have no
evidence of FOXP2 mutation.

00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:11.472
So,
(audience laughs)

00:12:11.472 --> 00:12:13.856
it's like finding a needle in a haystack,

00:12:13.856 --> 00:12:17.856
but we will continue
because I really think that

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.160
this is worthwhile because it has been

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.860
found for speech disorders

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.677
and likewise I believe that it

00:12:25.677 --> 00:12:27.716
may provide new entry points

00:12:27.716 --> 00:12:31.841
to the neurobiology of
learning disorders in general,

00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:33.748
not just amusia,

00:12:33.748 --> 00:12:37.089
and to do so, what is very important

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:40.177
is to know what is happening in the brain

00:12:40.177 --> 00:12:42.885
and we do know a lot about

00:12:42.885 --> 00:12:46.114
the neural correlates of this disorder

00:12:46.114 --> 00:12:48.364
because it its a cortical disorder.

00:12:48.364 --> 00:12:52.531
Here, back to Tim, we measured
the arcuate fasciculus.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:56.283
This is a major fiber tract as illustrated

00:12:56.283 --> 00:12:59.406
on the right side of my brain that relates

00:12:59.406 --> 00:13:03.532
the auditory cortex to the
inferior frontal cortex

00:13:03.532 --> 00:13:05.212
on the right side of the brain,

00:13:05.212 --> 00:13:08.379
and as you can see Tim here is in read

00:13:09.527 --> 00:13:12.469
and it's much smaller than a control

00:13:12.469 --> 00:13:14.615
illustrated here in blue,

00:13:14.615 --> 00:13:17.993
but of course, you conclude
that across many different

00:13:17.993 --> 00:13:21.475
in music cases and you
compare that to controls

00:13:21.475 --> 00:13:25.042
and it has been found in
many different studies

00:13:25.042 --> 00:13:27.963
that they do have a connectivity issue.

00:13:27.963 --> 00:13:31.458
So, the main problem with their brain

00:13:31.458 --> 00:13:35.011
is a reduced connectivity
between these two regions,

00:13:35.011 --> 00:13:39.535
the auditory cortex and
the inferior frontal cortex

00:13:39.535 --> 00:13:43.274
and it is within terms
of functional anomalies

00:13:43.274 --> 00:13:45.403
as well as structural anomalies.

00:13:45.403 --> 00:13:48.836
We do find structural anomalies
in the auditory cortex

00:13:48.836 --> 00:13:52.517
and the inferior frontal cortex
by having more gray matter,

00:13:52.517 --> 00:13:54.350
but it doesn't seem to

00:13:55.274 --> 00:13:57.857
lead to deficits in functioning

00:13:59.447 --> 00:14:02.410
and so, a working hypothesis,

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.960
explanation of the
disorder now is in term,

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.813
at least it's mine, it is in
terms of recurrent processing

00:14:09.813 --> 00:14:13.379
between the auditory cortex
and the inferior frontal cortex

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:17.548
and the idea that they do
have intact representation

00:14:17.548 --> 00:14:20.388
of musical pitch in the auditory cortex,

00:14:20.388 --> 00:14:24.766
so the bottom-up information
is reaching really their brain,

00:14:24.766 --> 00:14:27.819
but they have poor feedback control

00:14:27.819 --> 00:14:30.011
between the right inferior frontal cortex

00:14:30.011 --> 00:14:33.918
and the auditory cortex,
so the top down aspects.

00:14:33.918 --> 00:14:36.778
This is illustrated here.

00:14:36.778 --> 00:14:38.518
So, the information is reaching

00:14:38.518 --> 00:14:40.750
the auditory cortex correctly,

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.205
but it is really this loop that

00:14:43.205 --> 00:14:45.628
might function in their case,

00:14:45.628 --> 00:14:48.792
so that the auditory cortex
is really encapsulated.

00:14:48.792 --> 00:14:51.486
It's not influenced by the way

00:14:51.486 --> 00:14:55.071
they are processing or wanting to process.

00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:58.747
So, let me just illustrate
that with the EG recordings.

00:14:58.747 --> 00:15:02.185
We did use different
neuroimaging techniques,

00:15:02.185 --> 00:15:06.352
but this one is really the
most revealing in this aspect.

00:15:07.692 --> 00:15:10.011
So, we presenting melodies like this

00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:13.233
and ask them if there's any incongruity.

00:15:13.233 --> 00:15:14.696
So, the first one.

00:15:14.696 --> 00:15:17.613
(keyboard playing)

00:15:19.765 --> 00:15:21.352
You should say that's fine.

00:15:21.352 --> 00:15:24.269
(keyboard playing)

00:15:25.651 --> 00:15:28.272
There is an incongruity
if you're not amusic.

00:15:28.272 --> 00:15:32.634
Otherwise, there is no
overlap in distribution.

00:15:32.634 --> 00:15:35.574
So, these are the amusics
and these are the controls.

00:15:35.574 --> 00:15:37.988
Each bar represents one subject,

00:15:37.988 --> 00:15:40.116
but what was really fascinating

00:15:40.116 --> 00:15:42.391
and it has been replicated later on

00:15:42.391 --> 00:15:46.026
is that we found a negative,
early negative response

00:15:46.026 --> 00:15:49.887
in the brain of amusics as
well as in controls here,

00:15:49.887 --> 00:15:53.970
and why we only found a P600.

00:15:55.392 --> 00:15:58.506
That means that they are
consciously detecting

00:15:58.506 --> 00:16:01.173
the deviance, the pitch deviance

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:06.963
accompanied by P600 only in
controls and never in amusics.

00:16:07.964 --> 00:16:10.519
So, we have a clear signature here

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:12.563
of what's going on in their brain.

00:16:12.563 --> 00:16:16.403
The auditory cortex which
is really responsible

00:16:16.403 --> 00:16:19.986
for the N200 is responding
to the deviance,

00:16:21.402 --> 00:16:24.567
but it's not integrated consciously

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:26.936
and it's not a problem of attention

00:16:26.936 --> 00:16:28.889
because we have designed the situation

00:16:28.889 --> 00:16:31.144
where we controlled for attention.

00:16:31.144 --> 00:16:34.927
In this case, it was a
click they had to detect.

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:37.029
We replicated the same findings.

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.779
So, this explains why

00:16:40.485 --> 00:16:45.002
I believe it is a question of
intact bottom-up information

00:16:45.002 --> 00:16:47.752
because the N200 also called ERAN

00:16:48.695 --> 00:16:53.367
or Mismatched Negativity
seems to be replicated

00:16:53.367 --> 00:16:57.270
and reflect this bottom-up processing.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:01.187
While the feedback revealed
by the P300 or P600

00:17:02.898 --> 00:17:05.973
reflects poor control between the

00:17:05.973 --> 00:17:10.121
right inferior frontal gyrus
and the auditory cortex,

00:17:10.121 --> 00:17:12.656
and it is really a
pitch awareness disorder

00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:15.750
because it's really so high level,

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.292
the pitch regularities of
tonal music are registered

00:17:19.292 --> 00:17:21.678
and predicted by the auditory cortex

00:17:21.678 --> 00:17:26.533
of the amusics without
leading to conscious report,

00:17:26.533 --> 00:17:28.269
and what is really missing is

00:17:28.269 --> 00:17:31.351
a normal feedback loop
to learn from errors,

00:17:31.351 --> 00:17:34.448
and it seemed that really error correction

00:17:34.448 --> 00:17:38.365
requires intention and/or awareness.

00:17:39.273 --> 00:17:41.668
So, to summarize what have we

00:17:41.668 --> 00:17:43.772
learned from congenital amusia.

00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:46.176
Here are only the things currently

00:17:46.176 --> 00:17:48.433
that I think are the most important.

00:17:48.433 --> 00:17:52.653
First of all, conscious
error correction is a really

00:17:52.653 --> 00:17:55.807
fundamental principle of
how the human brain learns

00:17:55.807 --> 00:17:57.656
and we are not always conscious

00:17:57.656 --> 00:18:00.149
of the way we correct ourselves.

00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:04.316
Of course, during learning
when we are very young.

00:18:05.553 --> 00:18:08.043
Also, function specialization can emerge

00:18:08.043 --> 00:18:10.835
from distributed brain networks.

00:18:10.835 --> 00:18:12.858
It's no longer the case
where you can think

00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:15.925
of the brain like a really
focal brain regions.

00:18:15.925 --> 00:18:20.036
It is a distributed neural
network as I have illustrated,

00:18:20.036 --> 00:18:22.523
and a developmental anomaly can disconnect

00:18:22.523 --> 00:18:25.686
the nodes of a network
and give rise to severe

00:18:25.686 --> 00:18:28.903
yet specific learning disorders,

00:18:28.903 --> 00:18:32.758
and finally, the right
fronto-temporal connectivity

00:18:32.758 --> 00:18:34.475
seems to be essential to develop

00:18:34.475 --> 00:18:37.360
a normal cognitive system for music,

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.912
but I'd like to finish,
to end on a positive note,

00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:45.802
because I'm interested in those ones, too.

00:18:45.802 --> 00:18:48.885
That are the ones that dance so well,

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.156
and this is really
something we are starting,

00:18:54.156 --> 00:18:57.516
studying what I believe
are the other extremes,

00:18:57.516 --> 00:18:59.395
the high end of the spectrum,

00:18:59.395 --> 00:19:01.338
those of the musical prodigies

00:19:01.338 --> 00:19:04.505
and I'd like just for you to listen to

00:19:05.383 --> 00:19:09.504
a young, an Indian prodigy

00:19:09.504 --> 00:19:11.537
like this one at the age of nine

00:19:11.537 --> 00:19:12.988
and I will decrease.

00:19:12.988 --> 00:19:16.238
(Indian music playing)

00:19:23.934 --> 00:19:26.858
And it goes on for five hours.

00:19:26.858 --> 00:19:28.736
(audience laughs)
It does, it does,

00:19:28.736 --> 00:19:30.089
and here at the age of four.

00:19:30.089 --> 00:19:32.515
(singing in a foreign language)

00:19:32.515 --> 00:19:35.098
(Indian music)

00:19:37.634 --> 00:19:41.476
And at one year, I mean before speaking.

00:19:41.476 --> 00:19:43.726
(drumming)

00:19:51.603 --> 00:19:53.081
He has support for sure,

00:19:53.081 --> 00:19:54.909
but I'd like to understand how is

00:19:54.909 --> 00:19:58.344
it possible to have this
kind of performance?

00:19:58.344 --> 00:20:02.656
So, I do consider them
as congenital anomalies,

00:20:02.656 --> 00:20:04.406
happy ones of course,

00:20:06.781 --> 00:20:09.717
because there are recent findings showing

00:20:09.717 --> 00:20:13.094
that really genetic
endowment is more predictive

00:20:13.094 --> 00:20:17.823
of musical achievement than the
number of hours of practice.

00:20:17.823 --> 00:20:20.543
That even the propensity to practice

00:20:20.543 --> 00:20:22.814
appears to be under genetic influence.

00:20:22.814 --> 00:20:24.432
(audience laughs)

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:27.320
You laugh, but this is a result

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.153
of a large sample of twins studied

00:20:31.755 --> 00:20:34.308
and the learning outcomes can be predicted

00:20:34.308 --> 00:20:39.228
by the preexisting structural
and functional brain features.

00:20:39.228 --> 00:20:41.550
So, I'm afraid if you are not a prodigy,

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.479
you may not have it.

00:20:43.479 --> 00:20:47.501
So, musical prodigies provide
really an ideal paradigm

00:20:47.501 --> 00:20:50.868
for investigating the
neurobiology of musicality

00:20:50.868 --> 00:20:54.479
and that to which I'm now
turning for the future.

00:20:54.479 --> 00:20:56.967
So, I hope in maybe in 10 years from now

00:20:56.967 --> 00:21:00.967
to give you a key or the code of something

00:21:00.967 --> 00:21:05.842
of access or entry points
to this special talent.

00:21:05.842 --> 00:21:08.074
So, thank you for your attention.

00:21:08.074 --> 00:21:10.324
(applause)

00:21:11.197 --> 00:21:14.114
- So, I'd like to tell you a bit about

00:21:14.114 --> 00:21:18.088
a young man who I've worked
with now for 32 years I think,

00:21:18.088 --> 00:21:20.472
Derek Paravicini.

00:21:20.472 --> 00:21:25.072
Here's a picture of Derek
at 26 weeks when he was born

00:21:25.072 --> 00:21:29.777
weighing a little over 700
grams, about 1 1/2 pounds.

00:21:29.777 --> 00:21:31.726
So, Derek could literally fit on the palm

00:21:31.726 --> 00:21:33.309
of an adult's hand,

00:21:34.258 --> 00:21:36.698
and he had a fierce fight for survival.

00:21:36.698 --> 00:21:38.367
This was 38 years ago.

00:21:38.367 --> 00:21:41.675
So, the kind of therapeutic treatments

00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:45.200
for very premature infants
were still quite primitive.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.722
For example, there was no way of measuring

00:21:47.722 --> 00:21:51.781
Derek's oxygen saturation
levels consistently.

00:21:51.781 --> 00:21:54.558
So, to measure oxygen, they
had to take a tiny drop

00:21:54.558 --> 00:21:56.726
of the blood from his finger,

00:21:56.726 --> 00:21:58.373
rush off to the machine to measure it.

00:21:58.373 --> 00:21:59.787
It took 1/2 an hour by which time

00:21:59.787 --> 00:22:03.174
of course the oxygen had fluctuated again.

00:22:03.174 --> 00:22:05.903
So, no surprising really
that Derek developed

00:22:05.903 --> 00:22:09.603
retinopathy of prematurity
which is when the blood vessel

00:22:09.603 --> 00:22:12.988
in the back of the eye
forces the retina forward

00:22:12.988 --> 00:22:16.939
and his early development
was also very delayed.

00:22:16.939 --> 00:22:21.066
He was later diagnosed with
severe learning difficulties

00:22:21.066 --> 00:22:24.705
with a verbal IQ of about 57 and autism.

00:22:24.705 --> 00:22:27.574
As a child his speech
was largely echolalic.

00:22:27.574 --> 00:22:29.766
So, he rather than sort of

00:22:29.766 --> 00:22:32.108
speak with semantic understanding,

00:22:32.108 --> 00:22:36.340
he tended to repeat back
whatever was said to him,

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.007
but the very good news
was he was brought up by

00:22:40.007 --> 00:22:42.509
a traditional British nanny

00:22:42.509 --> 00:22:44.617
and she was determined
that Derek was going

00:22:44.617 --> 00:22:47.517
to make the best of his life
whatever that was going to be,

00:22:47.517 --> 00:22:50.607
and she went up into the
attic one day despairing

00:22:50.607 --> 00:22:53.424
of finding something to entertain Derek,

00:22:53.424 --> 00:22:57.828
and she found this old
toy really, toy keyboard

00:22:57.828 --> 00:23:00.968
which she plugged in and gave to him,

00:23:00.968 --> 00:23:02.445
and not thinking anything of it.

00:23:02.445 --> 00:23:05.177
In fact Derek just seemed
to bash this thing for ages,

00:23:05.177 --> 00:23:07.304
and then suddenly they
realized that in fact

00:23:07.304 --> 00:23:09.187
he wasn't bashing around in there,

00:23:09.187 --> 00:23:12.041
he'd actually taught
himself to play chords

00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:16.208
and then tunes just through
a process of self-discovery.

00:23:17.376 --> 00:23:20.006
I met up with Derek when
he was four years old

00:23:20.006 --> 00:23:24.227
and he'd already built up a
large repertoire of pieces.

00:23:24.227 --> 00:23:28.092
Now, he no tuition, of
course he had no visual model

00:23:28.092 --> 00:23:30.950
to guide because Derek was totally blind.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:34.013
He had very small hands,
he was only four years old,

00:23:34.013 --> 00:23:38.383
and as a consequence he got
a very eccentric technique

00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:40.163
as you can see from the pictures.

00:23:40.163 --> 00:23:44.505
So, there was a lot of karate
chops and fists and knuckles

00:23:44.505 --> 00:23:46.308
and even the occasional nose went down

00:23:46.308 --> 00:23:49.225
to pick out notes he couldn't hear.

00:23:50.296 --> 00:23:52.500
By great good fortune, that same nanny

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.635
who was responsible for Derek's upbringing

00:23:55.635 --> 00:23:57.995
would press the button
on the tape recorder

00:23:57.995 --> 00:24:01.113
and just briefly and so
we've got a little fragment

00:24:01.113 --> 00:24:04.132
of what it was like to
hear Derek's playing

00:24:04.132 --> 00:24:05.853
when he was four years old.

00:24:05.853 --> 00:24:06.686
Here's a little bit.

00:24:06.686 --> 00:24:08.593
See if you recognize it.

00:24:08.593 --> 00:24:11.260
(piano playing)

00:24:42.225 --> 00:24:43.284
Any offers?

00:24:43.284 --> 00:24:44.313
(audience answering)

00:24:44.313 --> 00:24:45.511
Yes, Schubert.

00:24:45.511 --> 00:24:47.065
So, good old Derek.

00:24:47.065 --> 00:24:48.420
I mean it's just a miracle.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.402
Here's a boy who understood
virtually nothing

00:24:51.402 --> 00:24:54.867
about the world around him,
really no useful language,

00:24:54.867 --> 00:24:58.867
and yet without any
encouragement to start with,

00:24:59.956 --> 00:25:02.327
he taught himself to play the piano.

00:25:02.327 --> 00:25:05.322
One of the great human accomplishments.

00:25:05.322 --> 00:25:06.653
I think the important thing about that

00:25:06.653 --> 00:25:10.676
early recording though, it
shows a lot about the way

00:25:10.676 --> 00:25:14.459
that Derek's musical mind was working.

00:25:14.459 --> 00:25:17.103
For a start, he wasn't
just copying what he heard

00:25:17.103 --> 00:25:20.558
because the recording you
heard was a voice and piano

00:25:20.558 --> 00:25:24.167
so he had to rearrange that duet for

00:25:24.167 --> 00:25:26.667
a single instrument of course.

00:25:28.291 --> 00:25:29.910
Also, because he had such small hands,

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.389
he had to change the spacing of the chords

00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:34.425
in order to be able to play them

00:25:34.425 --> 00:25:37.263
and so, the result really
to me provides evidence

00:25:37.263 --> 00:25:38.936
of genuine musical intelligence

00:25:38.936 --> 00:25:41.837
and indeed the beginnings of creativity.

00:25:41.837 --> 00:25:45.446
We've heard that savants
are more than just mimics.

00:25:45.446 --> 00:25:48.302
I think Derek even in
that very early stage

00:25:48.302 --> 00:25:52.469
shows a genuinely creatively
musical mind at work.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:56.238
Just to show you a bit about Derek.

00:25:56.238 --> 00:25:58.422
Today, he's now aged 38.

00:25:58.422 --> 00:26:01.470
I think he's been to
California about six times now.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:05.320
So, he's very cross he's not
here today I can tell you

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.401
because he, although he doesn't
enjoy 12 hours on a plane,

00:26:08.401 --> 00:26:12.341
he does enjoy making music when he lands,

00:26:12.341 --> 00:26:15.674
but he now has his own jazz quartet,

00:26:15.674 --> 00:26:17.796
and I think music for him is so much

00:26:17.796 --> 00:26:20.620
more than just a technical exercise.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:25.365
It's genuinely a social and
emotionally fulfilling activity.

00:26:25.365 --> 00:26:29.694
It's incredibly important for
his identity and self esteem.

00:26:29.694 --> 00:26:31.079
If you ask Derek what he does,

00:26:31.079 --> 00:26:33.308
he says, "I'm a pianist."

00:26:33.308 --> 00:26:36.699
It's important for friendship,
for shared feelings

00:26:36.699 --> 00:26:38.282
and even for humor.

00:26:39.301 --> 00:26:42.003
So, here's Derek playing today.

00:26:42.003 --> 00:26:43.945
If I ask you to guess the piece initially,

00:26:43.945 --> 00:26:45.858
you might be wrong.

00:26:45.858 --> 00:26:46.908
So, there's a warning.

00:26:46.908 --> 00:26:48.934
This is Derek being witty.

00:26:48.934 --> 00:26:53.101
(tune of Beethoven's
Moonlight Sonata playing)

00:27:08.589 --> 00:27:11.256
♫ Night and day

00:27:14.564 --> 00:27:17.397
♫ You are the one

00:27:20.731 --> 00:27:24.398
♫ Only you beneath the moon

00:27:25.585 --> 00:27:28.585
♫ And under the sun

00:27:31.286 --> 00:27:32.319
- Now for later on in the track.

00:27:32.319 --> 00:27:36.486
(upbeat jazz tempo)
♫ Night and day

00:27:46.249 --> 00:27:48.268
- So, you can see how Derek's evolved

00:27:48.268 --> 00:27:52.004
hopefully in the intervening 32 years.

00:27:52.004 --> 00:27:55.964
So, what kick started
Derek's musical learning

00:27:55.964 --> 00:27:58.708
and how is it he can do what he does?

00:27:58.708 --> 00:28:01.050
Indeed with Leslie Lemke as well,

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:05.037
and it's the same unusual
skill as all musical savants

00:28:05.037 --> 00:28:07.364
and indeed all musical prodigies rely on

00:28:07.364 --> 00:28:10.559
which is universal absolute pitch.

00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:14.103
Now absolute pitch is
the ability to reproduce

00:28:14.103 --> 00:28:15.803
and to recognize pitches.

00:28:15.803 --> 00:28:20.067
Not only in music, but in
any environmental sound.

00:28:20.067 --> 00:28:21.218
It starts very early.

00:28:21.218 --> 00:28:24.301
It's generally in place by 24 months.

00:28:25.443 --> 00:28:29.154
It's interesting seeing
that young Indian drummer.

00:28:29.154 --> 00:28:32.292
I've certainly seen young
blind children, aged 12 months,

00:28:32.292 --> 00:28:33.282
start to play the piano.

00:28:33.282 --> 00:28:36.207
By 18 months absolute pitch is in place

00:28:36.207 --> 00:28:38.583
and they play pieces in the right key.

00:28:38.583 --> 00:28:40.355
So, if these abilities are going to start,

00:28:40.355 --> 00:28:43.562
they're going to start very early.

00:28:43.562 --> 00:28:45.295
So, absolute pitch is very rare in

00:28:45.295 --> 00:28:49.487
western populations as
a whole, about .01%.

00:28:49.487 --> 00:28:51.681
Doing that kind of meta
analysis of all the literature

00:28:51.681 --> 00:28:54.474
I can find plus all the blind
children I've worked with

00:28:54.474 --> 00:28:55.990
which is hundreds over the years.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.259
Something like 45% of
those who are born blind

00:28:59.259 --> 00:29:01.560
or who lose their sight early on,

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.286
they're one to develop absolute pitch.

00:29:03.286 --> 00:29:06.236
Among partially sighted
children it's around 11%

00:29:06.236 --> 00:29:09.532
and around those on the
autism spectrum around 8%.

00:29:09.532 --> 00:29:12.015
So, you can see there
something massively different

00:29:12.015 --> 00:29:15.396
going on with a fair
proportion of these children.

00:29:15.396 --> 00:29:16.229
It's interesting about whether

00:29:16.229 --> 00:29:18.432
it's genetic or environmental.

00:29:18.432 --> 00:29:19.902
I think one can debate,

00:29:19.902 --> 00:29:23.133
because it's nothing genetic
about Derek's musicality.

00:29:23.133 --> 00:29:25.292
I think it's the fact that
he was born blind that made

00:29:25.292 --> 00:29:28.509
the structural differences to
the way his brain developed.

00:29:28.509 --> 00:29:30.701
In fact, I think it's
larger to do with his

00:29:30.701 --> 00:29:35.165
exceptional early cognitive
environments that blindness

00:29:35.165 --> 00:29:38.250
or visual impairment and autism create.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.083
Presumably there must be
a genetic component, too,

00:29:41.083 --> 00:29:44.077
because not all blind children develop AP.

00:29:44.077 --> 00:29:47.805
What it is it's a focus on
absolute perceptual qualities of

00:29:47.805 --> 00:29:51.325
things for their own sake that
seems to make the difference.

00:29:51.325 --> 00:29:53.775
So, I'll play you, one
wonderful thing about Derek,

00:29:53.775 --> 00:29:56.987
is he loves psychological experiments.

00:29:56.987 --> 00:29:58.349
He never gets bored.

00:29:58.349 --> 00:29:59.322
(audience laughs)

00:29:59.322 --> 00:30:01.892
I do with this one particular experiment,

00:30:01.892 --> 00:30:04.243
I'm gonna play a bit of
it when I play him 120

00:30:04.243 --> 00:30:07.580
different chords which
would drive anyone crazy

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.333
and ask him to play them back.

00:30:09.333 --> 00:30:12.689
Most people freak out after
about 20 of these things,

00:30:12.689 --> 00:30:17.154
and after the end of a
hard day's of analyzing,

00:30:17.154 --> 00:30:19.095
taking data from Derek, he'd say,

00:30:19.095 --> 00:30:21.004
"Can we do the chords
again tomorrow Adam?"

00:30:21.004 --> 00:30:21.837
I said whoa Derek.

00:30:21.837 --> 00:30:23.107
(audience laughs)

00:30:23.107 --> 00:30:27.229
Right, so here's a sample

00:30:27.229 --> 00:30:29.726
of those 120 chords.

00:30:29.726 --> 00:30:32.215
If there's someone with
absolute pitch in the audience,

00:30:32.215 --> 00:30:34.132
you might be able to pick out the notes,

00:30:34.132 --> 00:30:37.263
but this is the only
information Derek got,

00:30:37.263 --> 00:30:38.845
and I guess most people wouldn't be able

00:30:38.845 --> 00:30:41.452
to tell you how many notes are in chord,

00:30:41.452 --> 00:30:43.846
let alone what notes were being played.

00:30:43.846 --> 00:30:45.752
Here's a sample of them.

00:30:45.752 --> 00:30:49.002
(piano chords playing)

00:31:02.344 --> 00:31:04.964
So, how many notes were in the last one?

00:31:04.964 --> 00:31:06.330
No, I wouldn't have a clue.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.124
There were nine in fact.

00:31:08.124 --> 00:31:09.662
(piano chords playing)
Here's the chords

00:31:09.662 --> 00:31:12.079
and here's Derek's responses.

00:31:13.231 --> 00:31:14.580
This is me.
(piano chords playing)

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:18.463
This is Derek.
(piano chords playing)

00:31:18.463 --> 00:31:20.213
This is me and Derek.

00:31:21.117 --> 00:31:22.330
We're on the second line.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.580
(piano chords playing)

00:31:37.325 --> 00:31:39.231
In fact, what Derek does
is you might pick up,

00:31:39.231 --> 00:31:41.746
he actually adds notes in typically.

00:31:41.746 --> 00:31:43.910
He very rarely misses them out.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:48.635
So, here are Derek's
stats from the 120 chords.

00:31:48.635 --> 00:31:50.883
There's four, five, six,

00:31:50.883 --> 00:31:52.794
seven, eight and nine notes.

00:31:52.794 --> 00:31:54.354
You can see he got all the four note

00:31:54.354 --> 00:31:55.554
chords absolutely right.

00:31:55.554 --> 00:31:58.690
He got about 96% of the five notes

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:02.326
and so I'm down to about
93% of the nine notes.

00:32:02.326 --> 00:32:04.305
In fact, some it was interesting

00:32:04.305 --> 00:32:05.933
seeing the bit from 60 Minutes

00:32:05.933 --> 00:32:09.951
because Leslie Style
interviewed Derek at some length

00:32:09.951 --> 00:32:11.922
and got him to play 10 note chords,

00:32:11.922 --> 00:32:14.551
and he was still about
92% which is amazing

00:32:14.551 --> 00:32:18.230
when you think the shear motor programming

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:20.738
to get 10 fingers over the right notes

00:32:20.738 --> 00:32:22.535
at the right time is extraordinary,

00:32:22.535 --> 00:32:25.253
but again interestingly,
it's not this sort of myth

00:32:25.253 --> 00:32:28.027
of savants as kind of super human beings

00:32:28.027 --> 00:32:30.592
that just don't conform to the rules

00:32:30.592 --> 00:32:32.065
that the rest of us play by.

00:32:32.065 --> 00:32:34.301
For example, Derek did much
better with tonal chords

00:32:34.301 --> 00:32:36.444
than what you might call non-tonal.

00:32:36.444 --> 00:32:40.308
In other words, standard western
tonality Derek's better at.

00:32:40.308 --> 00:32:41.716
He was also more successful from

00:32:41.716 --> 00:32:44.383
the bottom of the chords up.

00:32:44.383 --> 00:32:46.835
So in other words, he was
listening more structurally.

00:32:46.835 --> 00:32:49.174
Most of us when we listen to music

00:32:49.174 --> 00:32:50.945
we tend to here the melody line.

00:32:50.945 --> 00:32:53.521
Skillful musicians tend to
hear it from the baseline up

00:32:53.521 --> 00:32:55.684
because that's telling them structure.

00:32:55.684 --> 00:32:57.298
So, in other words, Derek was listening

00:32:57.298 --> 00:32:58.546
with musical intelligence.

00:32:58.546 --> 00:33:02.182
He wasn't just a perceptual
machine who had been copying,

00:33:02.182 --> 00:33:05.216
and in fact we look at how Derek

00:33:05.216 --> 00:33:07.385
did compared with other savants

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:09.792
and with experts, what you might call

00:33:09.792 --> 00:33:12.360
neurotypical musicians
with absolute pitch,

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.540
you can see in fact there's

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.678
a fairly continuous distribution.

00:33:15.678 --> 00:33:16.880
Derek's at the top,

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.963
the top blue line with s.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:22.103
The other savants are in solid lines,

00:33:22.103 --> 00:33:24.637
and then the neurotypical
musicians with absolute pitch

00:33:24.637 --> 00:33:26.012
are in the dotted lines,

00:33:26.012 --> 00:33:27.736
and I'm quite sure if
I find enough subjects,

00:33:27.736 --> 00:33:30.350
there'd be quite a
continuous distribution.

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:33.206
So, in other words, the
savants are using the same

00:33:33.206 --> 00:33:37.091
strategies as the skillful,
trained musicians.

00:33:37.091 --> 00:33:41.041
So, as I said, it suggests
that these people live,

00:33:41.041 --> 00:33:43.495
exist on a continuum

00:33:43.495 --> 00:33:46.080
and that both use the same structurally

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.321
based listening strategies.

00:33:48.321 --> 00:33:49.563
Right, another study now.

00:33:49.563 --> 00:33:52.568
Long term memories, a feature
of all musical savants

00:33:52.568 --> 00:33:55.629
as Darold said and sometimes this is said

00:33:55.629 --> 00:33:58.451
to be eidetic or photographic memory.

00:33:58.451 --> 00:34:00.201
Is that in fact true?

00:34:01.709 --> 00:34:03.999
Right, here's another
mean test that people

00:34:03.999 --> 00:34:05.912
think you must be mad doing this.

00:34:05.912 --> 00:34:08.694
So, I composed a special new piece

00:34:08.694 --> 00:34:10.627
of music for Derek to learn.

00:34:10.627 --> 00:34:12.810
You have to compose something
because if he's heard it,

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:15.477
then he's probably already remembered it,

00:34:15.477 --> 00:34:20.127
and all he did was to
hear it and play it back.

00:34:20.127 --> 00:34:22.270
So, imagine that you're
sitting down at the piano,

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:23.650
you haven't got the music in front of you

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:25.150
and you hear this:

00:34:27.451 --> 00:34:31.034
(Chromatic Blues playing)

00:35:16.856 --> 00:35:19.773
(applause)
Thanks.

00:35:21.587 --> 00:35:24.305
So, how much do you reckon
he'll be able to play?

00:35:24.305 --> 00:35:26.871
Well, I'll show you what
Derek did in a minute.

00:35:26.871 --> 00:35:28.951
Just to say this was
quite a long term study.

00:35:28.951 --> 00:35:31.391
Over four years, we did 26 sessions

00:35:31.391 --> 00:35:34.109
with increasingly long breaks in between,

00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:37.626
two days in the first case
and two years in the last one,

00:35:37.626 --> 00:35:39.403
and each session after the first,

00:35:39.403 --> 00:35:43.048
Derek tried to play
whatever he'd remember.

00:35:43.048 --> 00:35:45.385
He then listen to Chromatic Blues again,

00:35:45.385 --> 00:35:47.646
attempt to play it once more

00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:50.727
and the listened once
more to Chromatic Blues.

00:35:50.727 --> 00:35:52.764
So, his very first attempt
he'd just heard exactly what

00:35:52.764 --> 00:35:57.092
you've heard and in fact, he
got about 30% of it right.

00:35:57.092 --> 00:35:58.092
Here is his.

00:35:59.018 --> 00:36:03.018
(Derek playing Chromatic Blues)

00:36:36.683 --> 00:36:37.850
Not bad Derek.

00:36:39.616 --> 00:36:42.044
Of course, this shows you
know, one of the real dangers

00:36:42.044 --> 00:36:44.393
I think of a lot of savant studies,

00:36:44.393 --> 00:36:48.381
is that unless you do a
pretty systematic analysis

00:36:48.381 --> 00:36:49.790
it's terribly hard to know.

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:53.585
In other words, if I just
played that piece in a concert,

00:36:53.585 --> 00:36:56.026
this so often happens
people play Derek something

00:36:56.026 --> 00:36:58.881
in a live situation, he then plays it back

00:36:58.881 --> 00:37:01.203
and of course no one knows
if he's got it exactly right

00:37:01.203 --> 00:37:03.233
or not because we haven't got Derek's ear.

00:37:03.233 --> 00:37:05.478
So, I think a lot of
savant myths are built on

00:37:05.478 --> 00:37:08.811
slightly devious anecdotes shall we say.

00:37:09.678 --> 00:37:11.035
So, what did Derek do?

00:37:11.035 --> 00:37:12.068
What's he going on there?

00:37:12.068 --> 00:37:13.636
Well, it evidently beyond the

00:37:13.636 --> 00:37:15.341
capacity of his working memory,

00:37:15.341 --> 00:37:17.891
but he couldn't help but produce

00:37:17.891 --> 00:37:20.679
something that made musical sense.

00:37:20.679 --> 00:37:22.965
In other words, he's using
music like a natural language.

00:37:22.965 --> 00:37:25.279
In the same way if we record a story,

00:37:25.279 --> 00:37:27.439
we don't get every not right,

00:37:27.439 --> 00:37:29.064
but we get the overall structure right,

00:37:29.064 --> 00:37:30.468
we get the meaning right.

00:37:30.468 --> 00:37:31.575
That's what Derek did.

00:37:31.575 --> 00:37:33.048
He got the feel of the music right.

00:37:33.048 --> 00:37:34.408
He got the overall structure right

00:37:34.408 --> 00:37:36.177
and he got some of the detail right,

00:37:36.177 --> 00:37:37.861
but it wasn't completely right.

00:37:37.861 --> 00:37:40.922
So again, we see creativity coming in.

00:37:40.922 --> 00:37:43.205
Derek had to be musically creative

00:37:43.205 --> 00:37:45.325
in order to make ends meet.

00:37:45.325 --> 00:37:46.239
So, what did he do?

00:37:46.239 --> 00:37:50.500
Well he used the musical
fragments in a different order.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.631
In order to make them fit,

00:37:51.631 --> 00:37:53.636
he had to transform them in real time

00:37:53.636 --> 00:37:55.499
and he introduced stock phrases

00:37:55.499 --> 00:37:57.987
from sort of Rhythm and Blues style,

00:37:57.987 --> 00:38:01.044
from Count Bassie, from
Blues turnaround and so on.

00:38:01.044 --> 00:38:03.466
So, in other words, Derek's
functioning exactly like

00:38:03.466 --> 00:38:07.718
a skilled jazz musician would
function in that context.

00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:08.863
So, in fact he's anything but

00:38:08.863 --> 00:38:11.410
this kind of photographic memory.

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:14.637
It's a characteristic
of a neurotypical recall

00:38:14.637 --> 00:38:17.736
and in fact here's a comparison with Sacha

00:38:17.736 --> 00:38:20.925
who is an expert neurotypical jazz pianist

00:38:20.925 --> 00:38:23.800
with absolute pitch whom
we gave the same test to,

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.239
and you can see that Derek out performs

00:38:26.239 --> 00:38:28.726
him after the initial burst,

00:38:28.726 --> 00:38:32.864
but essentially Sacha's
doing not badly at all.

00:38:32.864 --> 00:38:35.078
Much better than most of us would do,

00:38:35.078 --> 00:38:36.914
and the analysis shows he was using

00:38:36.914 --> 00:38:39.846
very similar strategies to Derek.

00:38:39.846 --> 00:38:42.714
You can see that Sacha
gave up long before Derek.

00:38:42.714 --> 00:38:46.546
Derek carried out for another two years.

00:38:46.546 --> 00:38:47.879
In fact occasionally now he'll say,

00:38:47.879 --> 00:38:49.343
"Can I do Chromatic Blues Adam?"

00:38:49.343 --> 00:38:50.843
I say, no, no, no.

00:38:52.154 --> 00:38:53.902
Right, last of all,

00:38:53.902 --> 00:38:56.548
very often I get asked
and Derek gets asked

00:38:56.548 --> 00:38:58.252
what about modern music,

00:38:58.252 --> 00:39:01.037
this problem atonal music
it's sometimes called?

00:39:01.037 --> 00:39:05.152
Now, atonal music was
introduced by Schoenberg amongst

00:39:05.152 --> 00:39:08.355
others at the beginning of the first half

00:39:08.355 --> 00:39:09.809
of the 20th century I suppose,

00:39:09.809 --> 00:39:12.475
and it consciously avoids traditional

00:39:12.475 --> 00:39:15.603
musical grammar syntax and rules

00:39:15.603 --> 00:39:19.150
and most listeners report
finding atonal music discordant.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:22.190
In other words, it sounds
like there are mistakes in it

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:23.870
and it's very difficult to remember.

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:25.367
Schoenberg said all he
wanted was for people

00:39:25.367 --> 00:39:27.797
to whistle his tunes in the street,

00:39:27.797 --> 00:39:30.839
but not a gooder.
(audience laughs)

00:39:30.839 --> 00:39:32.747
In fact Tchaikovsky
annoyed him particularly

00:39:32.747 --> 00:39:36.420
because people would
whistle Tchaikovsky tunes.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.632
So, how did Derek get on?

00:39:37.632 --> 00:39:39.489
Well, I gave him a bit of Schoenberg's

00:39:39.489 --> 00:39:43.656
first atonal masterpiece
as called to try and play.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.257
So again, if you close
your eyes and just pretend

00:39:47.257 --> 00:39:49.996
to be Derek, this is what he heard.

00:39:49.996 --> 00:39:54.163
(Schoenberg Klavierstucke
Op. 11 No. 1 playing)

00:40:14.226 --> 00:40:15.891
How did he get on?

00:40:15.891 --> 00:40:18.281
How do you think he did?

00:40:18.281 --> 00:40:22.230
Well, here's a young man
who can hit nine note chords

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.147
with 93% accuracy.

00:40:25.004 --> 00:40:27.210
He couldn't do it.

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:28.410
He completely couldn't do it.

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:30.139
Here's the original first phrase,

00:40:30.139 --> 00:40:34.306
(Schoenberg Klavierstucke
Op. 11 No. 1 playing)

00:40:39.282 --> 00:40:40.838
and here's Derek.

00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:44.005
(Derek playing piano)

00:40:51.489 --> 00:40:54.341
So, you can see even his absolute pitch,

00:40:54.341 --> 00:40:56.802
his flawless absolute pitch was confused

00:40:56.802 --> 00:41:00.419
when there's a lack of
background syntax rules.

00:41:00.419 --> 00:41:01.547
I found it quite extraordinary.

00:41:01.547 --> 00:41:02.448
I thought I had to check the equipment.

00:41:02.448 --> 00:41:04.820
I thought Derek you got
the first note wrong.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.224
I've never heard him
make a mistake like that.

00:41:07.224 --> 00:41:11.160
So in other words, the atonal,
the music without rules

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.910
even confused Derek's perception.

00:41:14.938 --> 00:41:16.479
Just a time to play you a little bit

00:41:16.479 --> 00:41:17.703
of what happened a week later.

00:41:17.703 --> 00:41:19.496
I'd asked him to play it a week later,

00:41:19.496 --> 00:41:21.850
and the result he'd stepped
back from Schoenberg

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.168
into the world of Wagner.

00:41:23.168 --> 00:41:24.001
It's extraordinary.

00:41:24.001 --> 00:41:25.351
Here's a little bit of it.

00:41:25.351 --> 00:41:28.518
(Derek playing piano)

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:46.001
So, I noticed Derek had
corrected the wrong notes.

00:41:46.001 --> 00:41:48.278
(audience laughs)

00:41:48.278 --> 00:41:51.807
So, in conclusion,
Derek and other savants,

00:41:51.807 --> 00:41:53.906
I've had the great pleasure to have worked

00:41:53.906 --> 00:41:55.949
with about six prodigious savants,

00:41:55.949 --> 00:41:58.163
have an unusual degree of expertise,

00:41:58.163 --> 00:42:01.640
but his engagement appears
to be qualitatively similar

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.242
to neurotypical musicians
with absolute pitch.

00:42:04.242 --> 00:42:06.334
In other words, it seems
to be a matter of degree

00:42:06.334 --> 00:42:08.246
rather than a fundamental difference,

00:42:08.246 --> 00:42:11.333
and I'd like to thinking
that perhaps we'll gain more

00:42:11.333 --> 00:42:15.500
insights about neurotypicality
by looking as it were

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:17.845
the opposite way, right.

00:42:17.845 --> 00:42:20.354
We tend to view savants from
the view of neurotypical

00:42:20.354 --> 00:42:23.699
of sort of mean based psychological tests.

00:42:23.699 --> 00:42:26.526
Whereas in fact, if we look
at the world of the savants

00:42:26.526 --> 00:42:30.165
and see what lights can
they shed on all of us,

00:42:30.165 --> 00:42:32.326
we might be in a stronger
position in some ways.

00:42:32.326 --> 00:42:34.262
Ultimately, I think we're all a part

00:42:34.262 --> 00:42:38.290
of the same continuum
of human neurodiversity.

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:39.719
Thank you.

00:42:39.719 --> 00:42:42.127
(applause)

00:42:42.127 --> 00:42:45.169
- Darold Treffert could
not make it in person,

00:42:45.169 --> 00:42:48.586
but he did manage to video tape the talk.

00:42:51.457 --> 00:42:54.290
(mid tempo music)

00:42:57.022 --> 00:42:59.098
- [Narrator] The human
brain is the most mysterious

00:42:59.098 --> 00:43:00.870
piece of matter on Earth,

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:02.096
and the more we know about it,

00:43:02.096 --> 00:43:05.610
the more magical the
whole system seems to be.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:08.562
However, it is only
now in the 21st century

00:43:08.562 --> 00:43:10.981
with new techniques that scientists

00:43:10.981 --> 00:43:13.650
can for the first time
open up the secret chambers

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:16.044
in our heads and watch the complex system

00:43:16.044 --> 00:43:19.627
of hundreds of billions
of neurons at work.

00:43:21.158 --> 00:43:24.063
Among scientists most
fascinating subject of study

00:43:24.063 --> 00:43:26.252
are a small group of enigmatic talents.

00:43:26.252 --> 00:43:28.085
The so called savants.

00:43:28.975 --> 00:43:30.650
Then knowing ones.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.781
Savants can multiply five
digit numbers in their heads

00:43:33.781 --> 00:43:36.061
or know 12,000 books by heart

00:43:36.061 --> 00:43:39.818
or play a melody on the piano
after hearing it only once.

00:43:39.818 --> 00:43:41.938
Over half of savants are autistic.

00:43:41.938 --> 00:43:43.588
Others developed this super human

00:43:43.588 --> 00:43:45.797
talents only after a brain injury.

00:43:45.797 --> 00:43:49.624
Experts all over world are
now starting to ask themselves

00:43:49.624 --> 00:43:54.293
is it in fact a defect that
turns a person into a genius?

00:43:54.293 --> 00:43:57.793
Is there a hidden genius within all of us?

00:44:00.538 --> 00:44:01.783
- Until we can understand the savant,

00:44:01.783 --> 00:44:03.437
we can't understand ourselves

00:44:03.437 --> 00:44:05.832
and no model of brain
function is gonna be complete

00:44:05.832 --> 00:44:09.999
until it can fully account
for this incredible disparity.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:15.936
Hello from the Treffert Center
in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.

00:44:15.936 --> 00:44:18.445
A unit of Agnesian HealthCare dedicated

00:44:18.445 --> 00:44:20.584
to better understanding the human brain

00:44:20.584 --> 00:44:22.540
and human potential.

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.261
What I want to do today is to share

00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:27.342
some things that we do
know about savant syndrome.

00:44:27.342 --> 00:44:30.542
120 years later after J. Langdon Down

00:44:30.542 --> 00:44:32.571
first described savant syndrome.

00:44:32.571 --> 00:44:35.060
Savant syndrome is a
remarkable condition in which

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:38.610
persons with a developmental
disorder, including autism

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:41.614
or other central nervous
system disease or injury,

00:44:41.614 --> 00:44:44.216
have some astonishing islands of genius

00:44:44.216 --> 00:44:48.623
that stand in marked, jarring
contrast to overall handicap.

00:44:48.623 --> 00:44:51.844
Savant syndrome occurs in
approximately one in 10 persons

00:44:51.844 --> 00:44:55.003
with autism and in approximately
one in 1400 hundred persons

00:44:55.003 --> 00:44:57.076
with other development disabilities

00:44:57.076 --> 00:44:59.964
or other central nervous system disorders.

00:44:59.964 --> 00:45:02.299
Since these other developmental disability

00:45:02.299 --> 00:45:04.440
and central nervous system disorders

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.890
are more common than autism,

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:10.263
it turns out that approximately
75% of savants are autistic

00:45:10.263 --> 00:45:14.543
and 25% have other central
nervous system disabilities.

00:45:14.543 --> 00:45:16.776
Therefore, not all savants are autistic,

00:45:16.776 --> 00:45:19.207
and not all autistic persons are savants.

00:45:19.207 --> 00:45:21.606
Savant skills occur on a spectrum.

00:45:21.606 --> 00:45:23.230
First are splinter skills.

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:25.362
The second level are talented savants

00:45:25.362 --> 00:45:27.691
and the third level
are prodigious savants.

00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:30.363
Prodigious savants are
persons whose skills are so

00:45:30.363 --> 00:45:32.472
remarkable that they're called prodigy

00:45:32.472 --> 00:45:34.473
or genius if they were to occur in

00:45:34.473 --> 00:45:36.822
a person without disability.

00:45:36.822 --> 00:45:39.858
Savant syndrome I always
associated with a massive memory,

00:45:39.858 --> 00:45:41.886
a memory that is extraordinarily deep,

00:45:41.886 --> 00:45:44.061
but very narrow within its confines.

00:45:44.061 --> 00:45:46.364
Savant skills typically increase

00:45:46.364 --> 00:45:49.395
and persist rather than
diminish or disappear.

00:45:49.395 --> 00:45:51.062
Savant abilities are not frivolous.

00:45:51.062 --> 00:45:54.238
Instead they can act as a
conduit toward normalization

00:45:54.238 --> 00:45:56.286
with an increase in language abilities,

00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:58.915
social strengths and daily living skills.

00:45:58.915 --> 00:46:01.415
I met my first savant in 1962.

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:05.494
Now 55 years later, it's rather hard

00:46:05.494 --> 00:46:09.686
to summarize in 18 minutes
my journey with savants.

00:46:09.686 --> 00:46:12.587
So, what I want to do
instead is concentrate

00:46:12.587 --> 00:46:16.843
on the savant I know
best who's Leslie Lemke

00:46:16.843 --> 00:46:19.003
who demonstrates many
of the characteristics

00:46:19.003 --> 00:46:20.586
of savant syndrome.

00:46:21.734 --> 00:46:23.685
I have known Leslie Lemke for 30 years.

00:46:23.685 --> 00:46:26.066
He is a prodigious musical savant.

00:46:26.066 --> 00:46:28.853
Like all savants he knows
things he never learned.

00:46:28.853 --> 00:46:31.340
He instinctively knows the rules of music

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.444
put there by genetic memory.

00:46:33.444 --> 00:46:35.529
Genetic memory which congenital

00:46:35.529 --> 00:46:37.676
and acquired savants demonstrate is

00:46:37.676 --> 00:46:40.868
the genetic transmission
of knowledge equals nature

00:46:40.868 --> 00:46:45.324
and it can be expanded by
learning which equals nurture.

00:46:45.324 --> 00:46:48.538
♫ It's so nice to have you back

00:46:48.538 --> 00:46:51.455
♫ Where you belong

00:46:52.379 --> 00:46:54.039
- [Narrator] It's hard to
say what's more striking

00:46:54.039 --> 00:46:55.145
about Leslie Lemke.

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:58.985
His skills as a pianist
or his amazing life story.

00:46:58.985 --> 00:47:02.122
(slow tempo music)

00:47:02.122 --> 00:47:04.007
Leslie was born with cerebral palsy

00:47:04.007 --> 00:47:06.890
and a rare disease that
necessitated the removal

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:10.497
of his eyes when he was
only a few months old.

00:47:10.497 --> 00:47:12.546
Many might pity, but who could handle

00:47:12.546 --> 00:47:15.650
the challenge of raising such a child?

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:18.785
May and Joe Lemke of
Milwaukee, Wisconsin did.

00:47:18.785 --> 00:47:22.655
They adopted Leslie when
he was just six months old.

00:47:22.655 --> 00:47:25.284
Using patience and love
as their inspiration,

00:47:25.284 --> 00:47:28.020
May and Joe worked with
Leslie attempting to achieve

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.838
not the miraculous, but the mundane.

00:47:31.838 --> 00:47:33.814
Functions such as walking, swallowing

00:47:33.814 --> 00:47:36.441
and eventually swimming all took effort

00:47:36.441 --> 00:47:38.191
and endless practice.

00:47:40.164 --> 00:47:42.798
It seemed the only way Leslie
would ever even approach

00:47:42.798 --> 00:47:46.230
a normal life would be through a miracle.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:50.649
Late at night one evening,
a miracle did occur.

00:47:50.649 --> 00:47:51.687
- When he was about 14 years old,

00:47:51.687 --> 00:47:53.917
they watched a Sunday night movie

00:47:53.917 --> 00:47:55.902
which happened to be Sincerely Yours

00:47:55.902 --> 00:47:58.045
and the theme song is
Liberace's theme song

00:47:58.045 --> 00:48:00.458
which is Tchaikovsky's
first piano concerto.

00:48:00.458 --> 00:48:04.121
They watched and Leslie
listened because he's blind

00:48:04.121 --> 00:48:05.512
and they went to bed

00:48:05.512 --> 00:48:08.172
and then about two or
three in the morning,

00:48:08.172 --> 00:48:10.425
May woke and heard some music coming

00:48:10.425 --> 00:48:15.125
and she asked Joe, "Hubby
did leave the television on?"

00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:17.985
No, and so there was Leslie playing

00:48:17.985 --> 00:48:20.448
Tchaikovsky's first piano
concerto from beginning to end

00:48:20.448 --> 00:48:22.362
having heard it one time.

00:48:22.362 --> 00:48:24.779
- And I said to Joe, hey Joe,

00:48:25.978 --> 00:48:28.362
did you leave that television on?

00:48:28.362 --> 00:48:30.481
He said, "No, why?"

00:48:30.481 --> 00:48:34.648
I said listen, where's that
beautiful music coming from?

00:48:36.302 --> 00:48:40.302
And he said, so I got up,
went to the boy's room

00:48:41.832 --> 00:48:44.849
and I had got that
little piano in his room

00:48:44.849 --> 00:48:48.567
and the boy had suddenly

00:48:48.567 --> 00:48:51.500
slid over like this,

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:55.867
onto that chair, played
all the way through.

00:48:55.867 --> 00:48:58.367
(piano music)

00:49:10.617 --> 00:49:13.475
- Leslie is blind, has spastic diplegia

00:49:13.475 --> 00:49:16.001
and has never had a
piano lesson in his life.

00:49:16.001 --> 00:49:17.896
Leslie knows things he never learned.

00:49:17.896 --> 00:49:19.476
That is genetic memory.

00:49:19.476 --> 00:49:21.986
Leslie has a measured IQ of 68,

00:49:21.986 --> 00:49:24.772
but in this segment instead
of asking Leslie to play

00:49:24.772 --> 00:49:26.969
a piece after hearing
it for the first time,

00:49:26.969 --> 00:49:30.162
he is asked to play the
piece with the person.

00:49:30.162 --> 00:49:33.456
Leslie then plays with the
person receiving processing

00:49:33.456 --> 00:49:35.311
and outputting simultaneously.

00:49:35.311 --> 00:49:37.253
That's called parallel processing.

00:49:37.253 --> 00:49:40.149
That is not consistent with an IQ of 68.

00:49:40.149 --> 00:49:42.870
IQ testing in savants is not reliable.

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:47.037
Savants point in the direction
of multiple intelligences.

00:49:48.874 --> 00:49:52.041
(piano music playing)

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:52.229
Leslie has shown a transition from recall

00:50:52.229 --> 00:50:55.671
to improvisation to
creation as all savants do

00:50:55.671 --> 00:50:56.883
if followed long enough.

00:50:56.883 --> 00:50:58.266
Savants can be creative.

00:50:58.266 --> 00:50:59.656
In his concert now,

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:02.272
there is always an
audience request portion.

00:51:02.272 --> 00:51:05.606
In this 2015 concert, Mary, May's daughter

00:51:05.606 --> 00:51:08.574
asks Leslie to play audience requests.

00:51:08.574 --> 00:51:09.644
- All right, let's go.

00:51:09.644 --> 00:51:12.014
See how fast we can do this.

00:51:12.014 --> 00:51:13.969
Eternal, I don't know
if he knows these now.

00:51:13.969 --> 00:51:17.609
I'm just gonna play through
and like you know about Leslie,

00:51:17.609 --> 00:51:21.501
he will never deny he doesn't
know one of the songs.

00:51:21.501 --> 00:51:23.874
He's always gonna say
yes and he will play it

00:51:23.874 --> 00:51:26.799
and if he doesn't get
the one you've requested,

00:51:26.799 --> 00:51:28.156
he's making one up.

00:51:28.156 --> 00:51:30.468
(audience laughs)

00:51:30.468 --> 00:51:32.135
That's what he does.

00:51:34.053 --> 00:51:38.053
This one's called Eternal
Father, The Navy Hymn.

00:51:38.053 --> 00:51:39.464
He don't know it.

00:51:39.464 --> 00:51:42.214
(Leslie playing)

00:51:49.066 --> 00:51:50.652
I don't know if that's right.

00:51:50.652 --> 00:51:51.507
Is that right?

00:51:51.507 --> 00:51:52.394
- Yeah.

00:51:52.394 --> 00:51:55.227
- Okay.
(applause)

00:51:56.496 --> 00:51:58.996
(piano music)

00:52:07.986 --> 00:52:10.011
Those Endearing Young Charms,

00:52:10.011 --> 00:52:11.292
an old Irish song.

00:52:11.292 --> 00:52:13.488
I don't know think he knows this one.

00:52:13.488 --> 00:52:14.512
You know this one?

00:52:14.512 --> 00:52:15.345
- Yes, I know it.

00:52:15.345 --> 00:52:17.106
- Those Endearing Young Charms?

00:52:17.106 --> 00:52:21.617
♫ Those endearing young charms

00:52:21.617 --> 00:52:25.117
♫ Til the day that I knew

00:52:26.081 --> 00:52:27.748
- You making it up?
♫ I'll

00:52:27.748 --> 00:52:29.109
- Yes, I'm making it up.

00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.942
(audience laughs)

00:52:29.942 --> 00:52:31.860
♫ The God

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.990
♫ The rose
(applause)

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:38.740
(Leslie singing)

00:52:45.776 --> 00:52:49.528
♫ These endearing young charms

00:52:49.528 --> 00:52:52.611
♫ On the way

00:52:52.611 --> 00:52:54.270
(applause)

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:57.437
♫ I know wonder la la

00:52:58.713 --> 00:53:02.177
♫ For the dee dee dee

00:53:02.177 --> 00:53:03.788
- This a pretty good one, isn't it?

00:53:03.788 --> 00:53:05.493
(audience laughs)

00:53:05.493 --> 00:53:08.243
(Leslie singing)

00:53:14.572 --> 00:53:16.414
- Where'd you hear that one?

00:53:16.414 --> 00:53:17.747
- On television.

00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:21.907
- We don't watch television.

00:53:21.907 --> 00:53:23.227
- No, you don't?

00:53:23.227 --> 00:53:26.207
(Mary laughs)

00:53:26.207 --> 00:53:27.354
- No, we don't.
(Leslie singing)

00:53:27.354 --> 00:53:31.354
♫ These endearing young charms.

00:53:32.786 --> 00:53:35.453
(wild applause)

00:53:41.231 --> 00:53:45.237
- Leslie demonstrates that
savants can be creative.

00:53:45.237 --> 00:53:48.373
They are not mere tape
recorders or copy machines.

00:53:48.373 --> 00:53:51.419
If you follow savants long
enough there's a transition

00:53:51.419 --> 00:53:56.385
from massive recall to improvisation

00:53:56.385 --> 00:53:58.109
to creation.

00:53:58.109 --> 00:54:02.878
Savants can be creative and
Leslie demonstrates that.

00:54:02.878 --> 00:54:05.224
Supporting and loving
families are such a vital part

00:54:05.224 --> 00:54:07.855
of bringing savant
syndrome into full bloom.

00:54:07.855 --> 00:54:12.206
May Lemke, the woman who
willed a miracle, died in 1993.

00:54:12.206 --> 00:54:16.406
In her final years may had
developed Alzheimer's disease.

00:54:16.406 --> 00:54:20.640
Just before her death, Leslie
played for her one more time.

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.397
Just as she brought him to life,

00:54:22.397 --> 00:54:23.834
his music lifted may from her

00:54:23.834 --> 00:54:26.538
Alzheimer's disease for a brief time.

00:54:26.538 --> 00:54:31.135
A fitting payback of love
and the power of music.

00:54:31.135 --> 00:54:34.218
♫ Then sings my soul

00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:41.170
♫ My Savior, God, to Thee

00:54:49.297 --> 00:54:52.380
♫ How great thou art

00:54:58.063 --> 00:55:01.146
♫ How great thou art

00:55:07.041 --> 00:55:10.124
♫ Then sings my soul

00:55:14.543 --> 00:55:18.043
♫ My Savior, God, to Thee

00:55:27.018 --> 00:55:30.101
♫ How great Thou art

00:55:37.393 --> 00:55:40.476
♫ How great Thou art

00:56:02.398 --> 00:56:04.815
(soft music)

00:56:08.452 --> 00:56:11.419
- I think Daniel's ability
is at a prodigious level

00:56:11.419 --> 00:56:13.376
because it would be
spectacular if that were

00:56:13.376 --> 00:56:14.572
to be seen in any of us.

00:56:14.572 --> 00:56:16.572
It would be spectacular.

00:56:17.838 --> 00:56:20.006
- [Narrator] Equally though,
Daniel has been blessed

00:56:20.006 --> 00:56:23.812
with almost miraculous good fortune.

00:56:23.812 --> 00:56:26.479
The line between profound talent

00:56:28.413 --> 00:56:31.406
and profound disability seems really

00:56:31.406 --> 00:56:33.656
and surprisingly ephemeral.

00:56:34.995 --> 00:56:37.578
The way Daniel can
describe his inner world

00:56:37.578 --> 00:56:40.008
is giving scientists a
window into the brain

00:56:40.008 --> 00:56:41.925
that they've never had,

00:56:42.826 --> 00:56:45.016
but the truth is their journey of

00:56:45.016 --> 00:56:48.376
exploration is only just beginning.

00:56:48.376 --> 00:56:49.969
- The bigger question
is whether we all have

00:56:49.969 --> 00:56:52.062
some of those abilities within us

00:56:52.062 --> 00:56:54.950
and that is what I refer to as

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:58.601
the little Rainman within each of us.

00:56:58.601 --> 00:56:59.773
What I do it isn't,

00:56:59.773 --> 00:57:01.032
I don't thinks it super much.

00:57:01.032 --> 00:57:03.853
I don't think it's something
that can't be explained.

00:57:03.853 --> 00:57:05.366
Who knows there may be abilities here

00:57:05.366 --> 00:57:07.420
that everyone can perhaps tap into

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:09.574
in some way.

00:57:09.574 --> 00:57:11.215
- Savant syndrome is challenging us

00:57:11.215 --> 00:57:13.535
to think in new ways about intelligence

00:57:13.535 --> 00:57:15.293
and what intelligence is.

00:57:15.293 --> 00:57:17.710
(soft music)

00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:23.357
- Savant syndrome has
tremendous implications

00:57:23.357 --> 00:57:25.364
for better understanding both the brain

00:57:25.364 --> 00:57:27.031
and human potential.

00:57:28.078 --> 00:57:31.620
Savants are not mere copy
machines or tape recorders.

00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:36.033
They can be creative with a metamorphosis

00:57:36.033 --> 00:57:40.200
from recall to improvisation

00:57:41.079 --> 00:57:42.710
to creation.

00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:44.731

00:57:53.298 --> 00:57:55.276
Dedicated to preserving, sharing

00:57:55.276 --> 00:57:57.713
and expanding research
into savant syndrome,

00:57:57.713 --> 00:58:00.844
other forms of exceptional
brain performance

00:58:00.844 --> 00:58:02.461
and human potential.

00:58:02.461 --> 00:58:04.878
(soft music)

00:58:06.358 --> 00:58:08.941
