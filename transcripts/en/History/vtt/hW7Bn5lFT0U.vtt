00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.730
JESSE: I've eaten probably
a half a pound, if not more,

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.870
of pine bark in the
last three days.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.370
But since probably
day eight, I haven't

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.130
had to have a bowel movement.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.870
So wanted to make some
flour with my pine bark.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.930
The flour should be a
lot easier for my body

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.130
to digest than just straight
pine bark, so I have hopes

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.030
that it will help push
everything through.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.170
Going to have to use the rock.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.500
Crush, crush, crush, crush.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.600
This will be pretty good.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.230
Nice handle up here.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.130
I've never made flour before,
so, you know, here's--

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.700
here's to firsts.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.670
There is consistency of it.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.900
[bleep] stomach, man.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.730
[sniffing]

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.830
Uh, my lower abs
are tightening up.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:06.900
Or at least, like, the inside.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.800
Ah, OK.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.830
Ah-- yeah, that's--

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.270
that's come back a little bit.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.430
It's like I need to
fart, but I can't.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.370
Ah.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.530
Ah, go away.
Ah.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.530
[groaning]
Ah.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.500
Come on.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.400
[breathing heavily]

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.870
Ah.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.430
Ah.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.430
Ah.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.430
Ah, it's all--

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.400
[breathing heavily]

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.400
Lay down.
Lay down.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.870
Oh.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.870
Ah.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.100
Oh.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.470
Oh.
Oh.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.430
Ugh.
[groaning]

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.800
Shh.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.730
Shh.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.730
Ah.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.330
Oh.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.200
Ah.
[breathing heavily]

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.170
It's just a lot of pain.
Ah.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.700
[groaning]

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.000
It's like someone's pulling
barbwire out of my stomach.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.830
[breathing heavily]

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.730
[groaning]

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.570
I don't know what to do.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.100
Ow.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.700
[groaning]

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.330
All right.
This is-- this is too much.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.930
Tell my brothers and
my sister I'm sorry.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:27.570
I'm really sorry.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.430
[radio beeps]

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.530
This is Jessie.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.070
I'm-- I have to tap out.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.030
[music playing]

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.500
[engine approaching]

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.970
[groaning]

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.030
I resent having to
go out like this.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.200
The big, bad Green Beret gets
taken out by his stomach.
