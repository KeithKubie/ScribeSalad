1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,880
The gender I was going to experience. If
you could change anything in your life,

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,720
would you change anything? No, of course
I knew you'd say that. Now ask me,

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,470
what'd you change? Anything?
Everything. Every single fucking thing.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,860
Everything I got up. Do
you have any regrets? Yes.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,480
Someone said, well, if
you change everything, you
might not be where you want.

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,510
I go, yeah, I'll roll the dice. I could
be fucking better off. You never know.

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,240
You know? I mean, well, I
learned from all my mistakes.

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,390
All of I hated every fucking
one of them. I felt terrible.

9
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:35,000
Every fucking mistake I've ever made,
but it's made me a better person.

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,570
I'm still making mistakes,
brother Mike. I make a mistake.

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,490
It's just part of being a person,
man. I thought he makes mistakes.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,750
I tried to be a good person.

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,620
I always tried to be a good
person and [inaudible] sometimes.

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,503
How do you try?

15
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,260
The more fucking people misconstrued
a misunderstanding for sure.

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,960
That's what makes me want to
do bad things to people. Yeah,

17
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:04,010
like your neighbor, the guy who lost
the bra of the gravitron. I mean,

18
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:07,360
I wouldn't encourage you to say his name
on the show. No, I know that. I know.

19
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,980
But you know, you see how I
feel and I, and I'm a good,

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,610
I had told this guy he could cut
down trees to improve his view,

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,190
stuff like that. I was
nice. His parents loved me.

22
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:18,880
His parents said that Lenny's the
nicest guy. You won't believe me.

23
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,491
He's a little crazy.

24
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:21,920
But I used to let him come down
and eat the food off the trees,

25
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:22,754
everything they want. But

26
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,830
he's very wealthy and he's, he's very,
you know, he's born wealthy. Yeah.

27
00:01:30,831 --> 00:01:35,120
That's a terrible man. That's a
terrible place to be for a man. I mean,

28
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:35,811
if I had a son,

29
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:38,900
I'd fucking kick him out of the house
and make him go fend for himself.

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,190
I really would not.

31
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,030
Maybe if I did that to my kid and
ended up blowing sailors at Fleetwood,

32
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,770
don't daddy. I mean I went

33
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,480
without his own money. You
mentioned a pepper. Yeah. How many,

34
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,510
how many peppers did you have for
you? Oh my God. I had hundreds.

35
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,800
Hundreds on my route. I had three routes.
Yeah. A couple of hundred a piece.

36
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:04,130
I had the Herald for awhile, did my
main staple was the globe. Right.

37
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:06,650
I did the Harold and I did the New
York times for the whole globe,

38
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:08,360
New York times and it Cambridge, Quantico

39
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,790
and every now and then my father
felt bad for me. He goes, yeah,

40
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,190
you're not going to, you're
not going to be able to do it.

41
00:02:16,191 --> 00:02:19,430
You put up money and you can show get
in the car and he'd be whipping him out

42
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,540
the window. He showed me,

43
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,530
cause he worked for the Herald as a
little a type operator and he was proud of

44
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:27,620
me for working. But he goes for
three four but what are you nuts?

45
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,890
Do one paper like most of them, but you
can make real money if you did that.

46
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,540
Like I that state,

47
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:36,170
that saved me while I was doing
standup because it gave me money.

48
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:38,300
Like I didn't have to have a regular job.

49
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,230
Like I could get up in the morning
and I could deliver newspapers from,

50
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,471
you know,

51
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:47,471
5:00 AM to like 7:30 AM [inaudible]
worst job you ever had construction for

52
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:50,900
sure. Some of those
construction gigs were rough,

53
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,560
really rough and it depends
on the company you work for.

54
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:58,370
I worked with my buddy Jimmy lawless
and we built a wheelchair ramp for a

55
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:01,650
Knights of Columbus. Right.
And all fucking something.

56
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:04,840
I mean it wasn't even all summer. I mean
I think I quit after like three weeks,

57
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,870
but all that's about us
summer in the wary. Yeah,

58
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,040
carry cement and pressure treated
lumber. That's all I did every day.

59
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,450
Cement and pressure treated lumber out
in the sun and by the time five o'clock

60
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:20,290
would roll around or whatever it was when
we quit, I didn't have anything left.

61
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,800
I would just eat and fall asleep and
then I get up in the morning and do it

62
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,410
again. It, but it taught
me something like if you,

63
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,320
if you want to be a laborer for life,

64
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,800
this is what life is and this is this
a fucking tire you're going to be.

65
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:36,100
You better figure out what you want
to do with your life and get after it,

66
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:36,521
you know?

67
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:40,360
Because at the time I was probably like
18 or nine 10 and I'll never forget how

68
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:40,960
hard it was.

69
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,960
I 21 I went to the national
labors training center in
Hopkinton mass where they

70
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:51,730
teach you how to be a laborer, teach
you, teach you how to be a labor.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,580
And the same thing with the cement and
the pressure treated lumber that I forgot

72
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,380
on your skin and made y'all [inaudible].

73
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,190
And from there I'd leave and I'd go to
be a life God and an afterlife. God,

74
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,780
I was Jana and a couple of bones,

75
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,810
that's all at one at one time when my dad
gets sick and I was taking care of the

76
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:11,470
family. But then I was
a short truck operator,

77
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:16,090
which was a great job. You know, they
used to have a claw on the back of a big,

78
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,830
big giant pickup truck, you know,

79
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:22,750
I mean one of the stars and it's swing
it out and you'd pick up the top of the,

80
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,980
the sewer and then you put the claim
in and you open it up and you pick up.

81
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,860
And I went to every bottom
and Cambridge and said,

82
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,030
get a lot of complaints about this
thing coming out of you saw about that.

83
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,430
And they go, really? Yeah, I can take it
up really well, don't you have a beer?

84
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,770
You don't know how many sidewalks I
pulled up forgetting to close the clinic.

85
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,320
Eddie sitting the sidewalk people
down again. He got a cup of for me.

86
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,010
They need a drink too. We'd be shit faced.

87
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,890
But the Porter I pulled out was cafe on
mash up. Oh my God. The shied people.

88
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,650
What did you do? Like what'd you do
with the whole, but until you fixed it?

89
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,910
Well, we'd get it.

90
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,520
We'd get one of those moveable
shitters and we'd put that on one side

91
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,940
and then we get to college and I got,

92
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:11,380
but the guys would come and then they
could, if, if you had the right crew,

93
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,890
they could fix that sidewalk and a
couple of hours. Wow. Just smooth it out,

94
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,520
you know? But Oh fuck. You
know, Massachusetts always
has fucked up sidewalks.

95
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,660
I mean, or, or fucked up
concrete about the way you drive.

96
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,650
All the asphalt's fucked up in the winter.
The highways. I first, we're gonna,

97
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:29,710
we're going to do this mile
section and sagas I, that's good.

98
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:33,490
Now we're going up to Springfield.
Leave that right. That's not finished.

99
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,410
How about the big dig?

100
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,690
How much longer did that take
you to was supposed to change?

101
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,080
That's one of the biggest corruption
schemes in all of the history of

102
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,900
construction. I know the
big dig people went to jail.

103
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,960
The big dig was supposed to cost one
point $8 billion and be done in seven

104
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:50,584
years.

105
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,710
The big dig is still not finished
and it costs $28 billion.

106
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,020
That's $20 billion override.
That's like, go do a dry clean.

107
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,330
Is it how much you cleaned? My
pinch? $12 you go back the next week,

108
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,040
that'd be three grants. Oh, we ran into
some problems. Everyone made money.

109
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,110
I was living in [inaudible]

110
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,670
Malden. They were working on
it. Yeah. That was in 1988 yeah,

111
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,743
and they still

112
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,003
Joe,

113
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:20,030
they put up four ton tiles with Al
glue and they thought it was gonna.

114
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,570
That's what happened to questioning.
Oh yeah, look, 51 million do. Oh,

115
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,650
so originally 51 million. Oh my God.
It's still not done. It's still not that.

116
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,750
How was it not done? It says
this constructed 91 to 2007 yep.

117
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,200
Joe. Believe me, tell me. I
drive to all the time this pods,

118
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,400
but that's still on open date.

119
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,660
It took them 15 years to open up
the tunnel to the, to the airport.

120
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,970
It says it's on December 31st it's
official. Boston's big dig. We'll be done.

121
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:53,770
The Washington post in 2007 okay. But
it's just still fixed. [inaudible]

122
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:00,080
the centerpiece of the big day is the
Zicam bridge was named after a guy named

123
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,010
Lenny Secam. Do you know who he is? No.
Okay. Nice guy. Community organizer,

124
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,803
philanthropist. Wonderful person.

125
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,310
Joe and the people in Charlestown said
he's a Jew. What? Blow that poor job.

126
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:13,010
So I swear to God, right? Let me check.

127
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,930
I'm a nice guy and I'm a friend
to the Jews. I married a Jew.

128
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:18,020
I was in the tribe. I know you shake,
which the fuck would be, I'll explosion.

129
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:23,060
So I'm not like Hilo macular
Jews. I love the Jews.

130
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,880
Very good sex. Now what happens? They,

131
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:31,090
they had eight people from
Cambridge who were against the,

132
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:32,751
uh, Lenny's,

133
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:37,220
I can bridge being there because it
cast a shadow on the child's river,

134
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,520
preventing the fish from being in the
river to go out to the ocean and spawn

135
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,940
really, first of all, anything in that
river should not be allowed to recreate.

136
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,900
But secondly, all a
shadow is stopping a fish.

137
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,990
What the fuck do you think
fish do at night? Oh, come on.

138
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,690
It's who said that it
was doing that? The a,

139
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,450
was there a real life biologists were
saying, no. Some Bay Bay Bay, ugly women,

140
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,820
Cambridge that we hate. Yes.

141
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,790
Run for president. You can
walk across it on a good day.

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,120
It's gotten any better.
You know, you don't, y'all,

143
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:20,120
I gotta tell you it really has, it
has gotten better, but you can still,

144
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,400
you can still see so much when people
are rowing and they will do it. That's

145
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,570
bad. You know Dave? Uh, well I used to
live in Newton. I used to live in Newton.

146
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:30,690
Upper falls across the street from
like a section of the river and we see

147
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:32,600
carpet. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

148
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,600
And then one day I was out there walking
around and I saw some bubbling in the

149
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:40,410
water and I watched a condom bubble up
to the surface and I realized it was a

150
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:41,820
sewer pipe that was broken.

151
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,630
It was leaking raw sewage right into
the fucking river. That's where it goes.

152
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,920
Yeah. Do you know and family
pack when you were a kid?

153
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,050
The groundskeeper was Joe Moni and
Joe Moni was famous because nobody but

154
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,040
stepped

155
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,620
on that grass. No one even Yaki you'll
get up. It was like a crazy man.

156
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,630
And since then my friend David mellow,
he's one of my dad's friends cause I,

157
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,750
I wanted to learn all about grass cause
I smoked it and smoking is easy and and

158
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,080
growing it and growing it just and
growing. But he, when he took over,

159
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,170
when the sewers would back up in Boston,

160
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,450
they would flood Fenway park and when the
water receded there'd be actually fish

161
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,970
flapping in the infield
and we have pictures of it.

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,890
It's what you can pull that shit up. And
how did they come from? From the river.

163
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:32,880
From the Charles river and they'd back
up and whatever's in those shores would

164
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:37,260
come out, but through
what? Port grass area. Oh,

165
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,450
the water would rise from where the
water would drain out of the ballpark.

166
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,570
It would come back in fish and fish.

167
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,260
There's pictures of fish flapping
on the field. The Fenway park.

168
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:52,020
I don't know how you, yeah,
you can Google go the ladder.

169
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,820
Ticky ticky Yuma eliminate
Sherry. Ken. Well, Devin,

170
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,770
David Mellon has written like eight
books online and I went to him.

171
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,390
John had me invited me to come up and
sit with him on my birthday one night at

172
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:11,040
Fenway park. This is years ago, 10 12
years ago. And he said to me, he says, uh,

173
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,820
Lenny, you want to go sit in my seats?
I said, yeah. So when he bought Fenway,

174
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,140
he extended the infant
seats out two more rows.

175
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,240
So he has TVs. I mean, it's
right next to the ball.

176
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,500
So I'm sitting there with him. He goes,

177
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:25,260
if you could meet anybody in the
ballpark and the organization,

178
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,870
who would you like to meet him at
the groundskeeper? He goes, what?

179
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,270
You don't want to meet
Manny? Oh, big puppy. Oh no,

180
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,710
I want to meet the
groundskeeper. Why? I said,

181
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,400
you're just had a Jimmy buffet
out. If two nights in a row,

182
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,220
there's not a blade out of grass. Look
at that. Good depose. Beautiful glass.

183
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,310
Beautiful on the wall. He gets on the
phone. David, would you come down?

184
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,250
So you got Mr. Clark. I go, Oh, you know
me man. I've been dying to meet you.

185
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,350
So we go to his office. Yeah, I leave
John and I go to the ground. Yeah, right,

186
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:49,561
right.

187
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:53,220
So then I invite him and his wife and
kids down to my place and they come down

188
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:57,390
to the vineyard. Three weeks later they
send me Lenny clock, Fenway pot, grassy.

189
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:02,220
My lawn look like Fenway park. It was
the most amazing one. It's like shit now,

190
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:05,400
but you kind of see it as
it is. This [inaudible]

191
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,560
like big stock seat Joe. Wow. I'm going
to cut. They were going to carve of,

192
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,590
you know Lenny in my, I said no,

193
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,860
it was when I bought it,

194
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,400
when I bought this property it was all
overrun and one day I was out smoking a

195
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:29,220
joint and I was picking up paper, you
know, cause I'm a land barren, you know,

196
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,260
and I go, Holy shit. My, what's wrong?

197
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,910
There's a stone wall back in my house
is surrounded by stone walls that you

198
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:40,170
couldn't even see because the tickets
and the brush was all overgrown.

199
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,380
The next day she must had like
eight trucks in there and they,

200
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,430
I have stone walls surrounded my
entire estate and you just didn't know.

201
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,200
Didn't know. You couldn't even see him.
Wow. Yeah. And then I added to my lawn,

202
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:54,960
you know, I had like, I
had like maybe half an acre

203
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,360
lawn. I got like three acres, a lawn.
That's a lot. A lot. That's a lot of lawn.

204
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,720
Too much work, too much
water. Who Mo's all that shit

205
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,970
that, that is not good with
the lawnmower. I'm not good.

206
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:09,370
That'll let me use both tools
even though I'm Silva. No.

207
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:12,880
Pilot two is for Lenny fish. Make
good fertilizer, so if they did die,

208
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,680
you got some, not a good reference photo,

209
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:18,040
but this is a photo of a fish on Fenway.

210
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,720
It's Joe's story to go with
Joe. You first day of work,

211
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,940
the red Sox, January, 2001 at Fenway park.

212
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:28,300
I sat down with previous 30
year heads, ground keeper,

213
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:32,530
Mr. Joe Mooney to discuss the nuances
of Fenway. Joe said, David, if it rains,

214
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,190
it really rains hard. The dugouts flood
because the crown in the old field,

215
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,940
I wasn't surprised because I'd seen
that before. Milwaukee County stadium.

216
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,840
He then say if it really,
really rains hard,

217
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,830
the antiquated city storm drains will
back up and water will come out of the

218
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:52,000
Marine manhole covers and Fenway's
Concourse and then flood the Concourse.

219
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,820
If it really, really, really rains hard,

220
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,200
the first base camera pit will fill up
with water and the fish from the Charles

221
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:04,201
river a mile away will swim through
the city drain pipes and swim into the

222
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:09,370
camera pit and then swim out onto
the field. I said, wow, Mr. Mooney.

223
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:13,120
That's wild thinking. He was pulling
my leg. I went home and told my wife,

224
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:17,230
you won't believe the stories that Mr.
Mooney tells. Fast forward to April,

225
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,120
Friday night before the red
Sox home opener on Monday,

226
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,910
the overnight forecast was for
two to three inches of rain,

227
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:25,300
so we put the tarp on the infield. When
the rain stopped early Saturday morning,

228
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,310
we would receive almost
three inches of rain.

229
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,610
I walked behind the home plate towards
the red Sox dugout to check the

230
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:34,630
conditions of the warring warning
track and I couldn't believe my eyes.

231
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:37,900
When I looked at, I saw
fish laying on the grass.

232
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,290
I looked around for Joe thinking,
yet put a great prank on me,

233
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,870
pulled a great prank on me,
but I didn't see him anywhere.

234
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:46,930
I walked over to the camera pit and
sure enough it was full of water.

235
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,180
I turned around and looked
towards the infield.

236
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:54,181
I saw seven more fish between the camera
pit and second base in my rush to get

237
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,150
the tarp off.

238
00:13:55,150 --> 00:14:00,150
Now sunny skies and get ready
for my first red Sox opener.

239
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,180
I unfortunately threw all the fish
away. I have wished since then,

240
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,810
I could have saved the fish and had
them display from my office, my home,

241
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,350
and for Joe. But at least I
made time to take this photo.

242
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,090
And since then I've had it
hanging on my office wall. Joe,

243
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,930
one of my favorite words is
vindication. That's an indication.

244
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,250
Every question that you asked
me, which I couldn't, you know,

245
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,350
eloquently put Joe. You know, that's
why you laugh when people say, Oh,

246
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:33,010
that's, it makes the shit I'm, could
I make this shit up? That makes sense.

247
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,440
It makes sense though. It's so close
to the Charles river. It makes sense.

248
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,290
Like a mile away, right? Oh, unbelievable.

249
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,000
[inaudible].
