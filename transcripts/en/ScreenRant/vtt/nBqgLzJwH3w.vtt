00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.610
To most movie fans, the rating assigned before
it hits theaters is known months ahead of

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.770
time, usually from the first script.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.280
The truth is a lot more surprising, since
a shockingly small amount of sex, violence,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.220
or foul language can completely change a movie
in the eyes of those rating.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.420
Here are 10 Famous Movies Orignally Rated
R.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:31.289
The Wolverine/X-Men Origins
Deadpool may have blazed an R-Rated trail

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.660
for Fox's X-Men universe, but it was one that
the Wolverine was originally intended for

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.030
in his solo movie series.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.360
And not pulling punches, either: one of the
creators of Game of Thrones was hired to adapt

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.640
the Weapon X storyline into an R-Rated solo
film that did justice to the hero's roots

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.940
- and skills.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.240
But as Hugh Jackman later admitted, the studio
would need a very, very good reason to cut

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.680
out every Wolverine fan under the age of 18.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.739
And at the time, they didn't have it.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.260
Titanic
Nobody would call this historical fiction

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.110
gory, but a single scene almost sliced its
audience considerably -the now famous sketching

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.890
of Kate Winslet's 'Rose', drawn naked like
one of Jack's French girls.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.390
The MPAA issued the movie an R Rating for
the nudity, but when director James Cameron

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.510
appealed, saying there was actually nothing
sexual or vulgar about the scene, they agreed

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:27.009
- and the first billion dollar box office
followed.

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.590
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire
It's hard to imagine a story of kids being

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.460
forced to fight each other to the death ever
NOT getting an R Rating, but the Hunger Games

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.460
somehow pulled it off.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.460
They almost didn't for the sequel, either.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.790
But the change required is a pretty good case
of how weird the MPAA's demands can get.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:50.799
Instead of one Tribute taking a spear to the
face - R-Rated - he took it to the chest - PG-13.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.840
Raiders of the Lost Ark
Even classic adventure movies can test the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.200
ratings board, like the final scene of the
first Indiana Jones movie.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.729
Watching as a squadron of Nazis is killed
by supernatural energy may sound like pure

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.710
fantasy, it was the villain Belloq's head
exploding that went too far.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.200
A little fire did the trick, so let's all
think back to when THIS (head exploding) was

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.890
too realistic for kids to watch.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.750
Transformers
You can have all the violence you want when

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.170
it's gigantic transforming robots doing the
fighting, right?

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.170
Wrong, apparently.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.160
The first cut of Transformers submitted to
the MPAA for rating came back with an "R"

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.440
for its intense violence.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.860
Producer Steven Spielberg stepped in, presumably
telling them that it didn't ACTUALLY happen,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.980
and they went with PG-13 instead.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.980
Spider-Man
No comic fan will forget the first time they

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.790
saw Spider-Man the movie, since it helped
kick off the superhero craze we're living

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.790
in.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.540
Plenty doubted Tobey Maguire in the role,
but he earned his stripes by the final fight

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.620
- a knock down, drag out brawl against Green
Goblin.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.120
It was a little too graphic at first, including
razor-sharp pumpkin drones slicing Peter up

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.120
throughout the fight.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:09.190
They were cut, and the blood coming from Peter's
mouth was digitally removed, and all was well.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.680
Mean Girls
The cult hit didn't need too much sex to win

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.860
over audiences, but the original Mean Girls
went for a R-Rating at full speed.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.130
Plans to have Karen deliver her final weather
report topless, a sex scene between Regina

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.091
and Aaron, and references that had to be dubbed
over in the final cut helped it reach the

00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:29.360
PG level - and probably for the best.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.280
Twilight: Breaking Dawn
Some people might think of vampires as less

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.700
than human, but the ratings board definitely
doesn't.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.760
The massive fight sequence at the end of the
final Twilight movie saw dozens of vampires

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.590
being torn apart, beheaded, and otherwise
killed - enough for an R Rating.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.050
Knowing how much of the fan base that would
cut out of the box office, some kills were

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:56.630
left off-screen, and the sound effects were
softened, or removed completely.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.400
Galaxy Quest
In the world of cult hits, Galaxy Quest really

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.510
is in a league of its own, as basically the
most expensive Star Trek tribute movie ever

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.510
made.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.850
But the original plan for dropping TV actors
into actual space battles was even more adult:

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.020
not much violence, and maybe a bit of sexual
content - but it was the profanity that earned

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.410
the movie its original R Rating.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.569
As fun as it would have been to see the star-studded
cast swearing up a storm, some dubbed lines

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:25.660
made sure ti reached the biggest audience.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.830
The Avengers
We know what you're thinking: the story of

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.830
Earth's mightiest superheroes battling alien
weirdos was deemed too adult for the young

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.900
audiences being targeted?

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.580
It was actually just a single scene, a single
shot really, that got the R Rating: the death

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.889
of Agent Coulson.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.319
A little less blade and a little less blood
was all the rating board needed to approve

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.100
it for the whole family.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.169
The Avengers is one of the greatest examples
superheroes teaming up of all time, but there

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.430
are still lots of superhero collabs that fans
would love to see.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.940

Those are just a handful of the Hollywood
movies that almost embraced a more adult tone

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:11.590
with an R-Rating, but there are a lot more
where the came from.
