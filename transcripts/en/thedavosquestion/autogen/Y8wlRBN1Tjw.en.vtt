00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
&gt;&gt; My name is Steven Wasira.
I'm Minister for Agriculture, Food Security

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.959
and Cooperates from
Tanzania.

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:13.560
And one thing I would want to speak for a
few minutes is about

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.890
education.
And the role of education in impoverished

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.460
nations.
Actually, we from the developing countries,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.410
particularly in Africa, are
engaged mostly in dealing with the problems

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.929
of food security and also
poverty and education.

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.880
Because we believe that the world will be
safer with more food and with

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.350
less poverty.
So education is key for this.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.289
Educated communities can deal with the poverty
problems easily, and

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.440
they can also deal with the food security
problems easily than

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.890
uneducated populations.
So that's why we're giving a big priority

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:01.820
in education when it comes to
our budget in Tanzania, number one is given

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.810
to education because we
want an educated community.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.540
So this is one area that we concentrate or
put more money into primary

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.220
education.
Put money into secondary education, and we've

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.630
managed to have more
secondary schools than we used to have, and

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.979
more students into those
schools.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:34.262
But we're also trying to build up higher education.
And our fourth phase government have managed

00:01:34.262 --> 00:01:40.280
to put up a new university
in the center part of Tanzania called Dodoma,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.310
where when the university
is fully pledged, it will take about 40,000

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.939
students, various areas.
So this is a very important area.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.219
But education must serve people.
And because our people are poor, then education

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.779
must be key in solving
poverty problems and food issues.
