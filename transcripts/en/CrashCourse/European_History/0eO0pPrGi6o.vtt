00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.220
Hi I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
European History.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.630
And today it’s time to find out what else
besides money was behind the competition between

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.290
Spain and England as they fought it out on
the seas and across the globe after 1550.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.560
That’s right, today we get to talk about
religion.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.039
As you may know, the Internet is terrible
at engaging in nuanced and thoughtful conversations

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.080
about religion.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.380
But if you think like our contemporary religious
discourse is bad, just wait until you get

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.520
a load of 16th century Europe.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:42.770
INTRO
Okay, so over the centuries the Catholic church

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.739
had developed a powerful structure under the
papal monarchy.

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.149
Its courts, religious law, local priests,
and a huge bureaucracy of religious officials

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.770
enforced its domination.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.770
And Catholic ideas of the time backed up social
and political inequality: for example, Church

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.830
teachings described monarchs and noble people
as closer to God than ordinary people.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.310
It also had ideas about how the universe worked
and sought to repress those whose ideas were

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.810
different, as we’ll discuss further when
we turn our attention to the Scientific Revolution.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.450
But in general, Catholic domination of so
many aspects of life produced so much resistance

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.330
beginning in the early 16th century that European
Christianity eventually split into two, and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.780
then split into like 17,000 competing subgroups.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.500
It all starts with Martin Luther—a bright
young German man whose father wanted him to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.280
become a lawyer, as so many fathers do.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.310
So Martin Luther went to law school.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.470
But his real concern, even after getting his
law degree, was salvation, so he became a

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.750
devout monk.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.580
Still though, he was agitated, worried about
salvation generally and specifically about

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.570
Church teachings that faith and good works
were needed to achieve salvation.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.250
For Luther, doing good works seemed a bit
like bribery; like wasn’t full faith in

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.070
God the important thing?

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.500
This kind of thinking meant that Luther was
on his way to heresy—that is, beliefs that

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.370
went against the principles of the Catholic
faith.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.890
And the heresy of-for instance-denying the
pope’s authority could get you burned at

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.890
the stake, as John Hus was in 1415.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.810
Now many of Luther’s objections to Church
teachings were highly theological, concerning

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.960
beliefs about, say, whether the word repent
in the Bible can be said to refer to the sacrament

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.400
of penance.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.230
But one of Luther’s objections was not nearly
that obscure, and was much more relevant to

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.400
ordinary people.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.360
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.910
Okay so in Catholic doctrine there was a state
after death

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.780
called Purgatory, a kind of holding place
for souls that are not pure enough to ascend

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.200
to heaven but not bad enough to go to hell.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.590
Souls in purgatory can be purified by prayers
from the living, and also purified by tortuous

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.920
afterlife punishment.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.660
And in 1517, the pope issued a special indulgence
to raise money to continue building the splendid

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.550
St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.040
Purchasing one of these indulgences was said
to release a soul from purgatory--so if you

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.530
had a deceased friend or family member whose
sins might not have been totally cleansed

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.480
through their faith and good works,
you could buy an indulgence and get them a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.800
ticket to heaven.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.770
Now this may sound to you like a naked attempt
to use people’s worry and grief as a cash

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.770
grab.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.770
And Luther agreed.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.740
Like, one monk who sold indulgences literally
said, quote “Don’t you hear the voices

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.350
of your dead parents and other relatives crying
out,

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.790
‘Have mercy on us, for we suffer great punishment
and pain.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.420
From this, you could release us with a few
alms.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.940
… Why do you treat us so cruelly and leave
us to suffer in the flames, when it only takes

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.910
so little to save us?”

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.319
I’m not here to criticize any particular
religion but that is a smidge manipulative

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.740
It wasn’t only Luther who took offense to
this practice.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.459
Merchants and artisans also noted that it
seemed a lot like blackmail.

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.870
Many citydwellers objected to their hard-earned
money going to support the aristocratic children

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.320
of the wealthy who held high positions in
the clergy and lived in luxury without ever

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.810
having to, you know, earn money.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.850
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.690
So for Luther, salvation wasn’t something
you bought, either by good works or by purchasing

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.690
indulgences.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.930
Instead he believed in salvation by faith
alone and so one should seek to fortify one’s

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:40.930
faith.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.030
In 1517, Luther, then in his early thirties,
composed “Ninety-Five Theses” expressing

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.060
questions and differing opinions on these
and many other theological issues, perhaps

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.900
posting them to the door of the chapel of
Wittenberg.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.380
But in whatever form, his ideas spread.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.340
Soon, papal documents and books of canon law
were being burned by students during protests

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.900
as earnest young Christian humanists vented
their anger.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.460
And Luther’s initial questioning of the
Church rapidly became rejection: “For we

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.270
claim the papacy not to be the holy Church,”
Luther stated, “nor any part of it, and

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.970
we are unable to cooperate with it.”

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.910
This rejection of the Church as it operated
in the early sixteenth century came to be

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.770
called the Reformation.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.030
Luther began to take on the entire Church
establishment.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.620
In European Catholicism at the time, priests
were the authority; THEY read the Bible and

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.120
then told you what it said.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.080
But Luther argued that priests like all people
were themselves sinners, and that the only

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.730
true authority was the Bible; it was, he argued,
the word of God that provided the relationship

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.160
with God, not the word of priests.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.340
He believed that the hierarchy of priests,
and bishops, and cardinals, and the Pope was

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.530
inherently corrupt, and that such corrupt
individuals could hardly serve as intermediaries

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.389
with the divine.

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:09.360
Sola scriptura, only the Bible or scripture,
was his motto alongside the keys to salvation:

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.820
sola gratia and sola fide, only grace and
only faith.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.290
The idea of sola scriptura led to a wide-ranging
revolution, especially by boosting reading

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.110
and individual study.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.910
Because suddenly, it was important not just
for scholars to learn to read, but for everyone,

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.330
because the written word of God was the way
to God.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.121
Now at first, authorities didn’t see cause
for alarm, although early in 1521 the Pope

00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:36.770
did excommunicate Luther.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.310
Several months later, Luther was summoned
before representatives of the Holy Roman Empire

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.290
at the Diet of Worms, which is overwhelmingly
the easiest history term to remember because

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.449
they literally called it the diet of worms.

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:55.290
Leading the assembly in the town of Worms,
Germany was Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.290
Oh!

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.290
Did the globe open?

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.290
Weird.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.290
I don’t get it?

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.290
I don’t get it, it’s just a can of mixed
nuts what does this have to do with the diet

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.290
of worms?

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.290
Oh!

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.290
Stan.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.290
Gah.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.290
Very frightening.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.360
I have a diet...of worms.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.880
That’s good stuff, Stan.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.300
Right but back to Charles V.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:18.300
At the time, Charles was nineteen and ruler
of Spain, the Low Countries and Duchy of Burgundy.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.770
Also, the entire Habsburg Empire, Italy, and
all the Spanish possessions in the Western

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:28.650
Hemisphere and Southeast Asia, which--if you’ve
ever met or been a 19-year-old, you’ll know

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:34.300
is a lot of responsibility for someone who
can’t legally drink wine in America.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.930
Although on the otherhand he does look like
he is 50 in this stained glass window of the

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.130
Diet of Worms.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.420
Charles’ rulership of the Holy Roman Empire
was gained- through the votes of electors,

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.720
who had selected him from other royal or noble
contenders.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.580
Among them was the elector of Saxony, Frederick
the Wise, whom Charles had bribed for his

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.580
vote.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.850
Frederick was religious, but not a fan of
the papacy.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:02.620
And many aristocrats saw Charles as threatening
world domination because, you know, he was

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.490
dominating a lot of the world.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:10.710
So when called to account by such a massively
powerful ruler, everyone expected that an

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:16.820
insignificant monk like Martin Luther would
completely fold and admit his errors.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:22.780
But he did not: “I can do no other” he
supposedly said of maintaining his new beliefs.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.580
The Holy Roman Emperor declared him an outlaw
to be captured.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:32.789
But German princes took his side, and Frederick
the Wise hid and protected Luther.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:33.930
Why?

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:39.070
Well that remains one of the unanswered questions
of history--maybe it was because Frederick

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:45.050
was concerned about papal abuses, maybe because
Frederick felt Luther couldn’t get a fair

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:49.529
trial, and maybe because he felt that Luther
and the reform movements he was leading would

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.259
limit Charles’s power.

00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:55.089
Regardless, after Frederick’s death, his
brother and successor continued to protect

00:08:55.089 --> 00:09:01.199
Luther and his followers, helping in 1530
to organize the Schmalkaldic League of Protestant

00:09:01.199 --> 00:09:06.199
Princes to protect the Lutherans, which, I
mean, as names go is no Diet of Worms.

00:09:06.199 --> 00:09:09.749
On the other hand, if Marvel is looking for
a new superhero franchise how bout the Schmalkaldic

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:11.839
League of Protestant Princes?

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:16.649
Early in the 1520s, Luther wrote tracts outlining
his beliefs in greater detail.

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:21.480
He also translated the New Testament of the
Bible into German--that is, the local language

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.629
or vernacular instead of elite Latin.

00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:29.709
And thanks to the printing press, two hundred
thousand copies were printed in the 1520s

00:09:29.709 --> 00:09:34.110
and early 1530s and many more of his other
writings went into print.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:40.019
The Reformation went from being local to being
German to being a European-wide movement in

00:09:40.019 --> 00:09:42.509
large part thanks to the printing press.

00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:47.079
Meanwhile, many German princes took up the
“Lutheran” challenge to the Holy Roman

00:09:47.079 --> 00:09:48.079
Emperor.

00:09:48.079 --> 00:09:53.110
If Charles was against reform, many princes
would be for it as a way of restraining the

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.269
Holy Roman Emperor’s power.

00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:59.350
Luther summoned them to defend German values
against the corruption found in Rome.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:04.389
And because of that, Luther is sometimes called
the source or father of German nationalism.

00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:10.360
And then, in 1525, peasants and other village
folk across southern Germany began protesting--eventually

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:16.860
including an estimated 100,000 rioters who
sacked castles as well as religious centers.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.939
The princes and nobility crushed them--they
could get behind religious reform, but not

00:10:21.939 --> 00:10:23.730
mass soci al change.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:29.769
And Luther agreed, slamming the rioters in
Against the Rioting Peasants, soon reprinted

00:10:29.769 --> 00:10:35.319
with the new sensationalist title-- Against
the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants.

00:10:35.319 --> 00:10:41.339
So, you know, Luther favored some reform,
but not, like, equal rights for peasants reform.

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:46.009
All the while, the reform movement spread—and
as it did, it developed offspring.

00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:51.259
Already in 1519, Ulrich Zwingli, a Swiss priest,
began preaching reform in Zurich.

00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:56.470
He supported Luther’s main criticisms of
the papacy, but he disagreed on the Eucharist,

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:01.739
or communion, a ritual in which worshipers
eat bread and drink wine.

00:11:01.739 --> 00:11:02.739
Or don’t.

00:11:02.739 --> 00:11:03.829
Depending on your perspective.

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:08.350
Catholic doctrine held that through the miracle
of transubstantiation, the bread and wine

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:13.829
literally became the body and blood of Jesus
Christ; Luther argued for something called

00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:19.779
consubstantiation, in which the bread and
wine are still bread and wine, yet also the

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:21.630
body and blood of Christ.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:26.509
And Zwingli believed Communion only to be
a symbolic ritual, in which the bread and

00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:28.430
wine were just bread and wine.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:33.269
I know this will seem to many of you like
an extremely obscure theological argument

00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:38.759
that can’t possibly have been important,
but it was--these theological questions were

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:44.759
not just a matter of life and death; they
were a matter of eternal life and death.

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:49.239
Zwingli’s preachings eventually turned some
of his followers to a more radical interpretation

00:11:49.239 --> 00:11:50.499
of Christianity.

00:11:50.499 --> 00:11:55.429
These people were called Anabaptists, they
held that faith was a matter of individual

00:11:55.429 --> 00:11:57.529
thought and free will.

00:11:57.529 --> 00:12:03.110
So only a thinking adult could knowingly participate
in Christian faith enough to accept Jesus

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.470
as lord and savior.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:09.970
Sp they argued that baptism, a cleansing ritual
that had long been performed on infants, should

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:14.369
only be available to adults who’ve chosen
to accept Jesus as savior.

00:12:14.369 --> 00:12:18.879
[[TV: Luther Married]] And as reformers increased
in number and variety, Luther did something

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:25.199
else that was really shocking: in 1525, he
got married, even though Catholic clergy were

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:26.600
supposed to be celibate.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.889
Luther preached that God made two sexes to
procreate and that the clergy’s celibacy

00:12:30.889 --> 00:12:33.259
was against the divine plan.

00:12:33.259 --> 00:12:37.489
So he married Katharina von Bora, a literate
young woman who had been in a convent since

00:12:37.489 --> 00:12:42.459
the age of five, and this was controversial
even among his supporters.

00:12:42.459 --> 00:12:47.389
One of Luther’s best friends and admirers
lamented that by marrying, Luther “revels

00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:52.799
and compromises his good reputation precisely
at a time when Germany stands in need of his

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:54.420
spirit and authority.”

00:12:54.420 --> 00:13:00.059
But Luther wrote a lot about marriage, and
sermonized about it too for the princes, nobility,

00:13:00.059 --> 00:13:02.379
and his growing number of followers.

00:13:02.379 --> 00:13:06.920
One of these “lectures” refers to the
story of Adam and Eve as written about in

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:12.559
the book of Genesis in the Bible: “Moreover
this designation [woman] carries with it a

00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:18.389
wonderful and pleasing description of marriage,
in which, as the jurist says, the wife shines

00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:21.010
by reason of her husband’s rays.”

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:25.709
“Whatever the husband has, this the wife
has and possesses in its entirety.

00:13:25.709 --> 00:13:31.199
. . .the result is that the husband differs
from the wife in no respect than in sex...”

00:13:31.199 --> 00:13:35.559
This certainly wasn’t equality as we now
understand it, what with the wife shining

00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:41.619
by reason of her husband’s rays, but the
notion of equity of marital property was heresy

00:13:41.619 --> 00:13:44.540
piled on top of the heresy of clergy marrying.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.369
[[TV: An Appropriate Battle]] All of this
led to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V deciding

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:53.449
to put down the pesky Protestant princes of
the Schmalkaldic League once and for all in

00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:57.980
1546 and 1547 and he almost did so.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.661
He had vast resources at his disposal, including
tough soldiers from the Spanish armies, who

00:14:02.661 --> 00:14:06.569
defeated the League and captured some leading
Protestant princes.

00:14:06.569 --> 00:14:10.019
And Catholicism appeared to be making a comeback.

00:14:10.019 --> 00:14:15.959
But then in 1552, the League suddenly took
to the field again, roundly defeating the

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:17.149
imperial forces.

00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:22.549
[[TV: Peace of Augsburg]] In 1555, the Peace
of Augsburg decreed that whoever ruled would

00:14:22.549 --> 00:14:24.999
determine the religion of his territory.

00:14:24.999 --> 00:14:29.649
[[TV Window]] And so communities became Catholic
or Protestant based on the religion of their

00:14:29.649 --> 00:14:30.649
prince.

00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:31.649
Phew.

00:14:31.649 --> 00:14:34.119
We really dodged a religious war bullet--nope
no.

00:14:34.119 --> 00:14:36.230
The Reformation story was not over.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:41.859
Luther had called Church corruption a “horrid
abomination” and its defenders “excrements

00:14:41.859 --> 00:14:46.749
and vermin”; and those who now entered this
titanic religious struggle in other parts

00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:51.939
of Europe were just as vehement, even though
following different plots.

00:14:51.939 --> 00:14:57.209
The finer points of theology continued to
divide people, as did the politics of religion

00:14:57.209 --> 00:14:59.079
and overseas empire.

00:14:59.079 --> 00:15:02.499
In short, more bloodshed to follow.

00:15:02.499 --> 00:15:04.179
We’ll take that up next time.

00:15:04.179 --> 00:15:32.110
Thanks for watching.
