I mean she remembered me which was
 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.060
I mean she remembered me which was
pretty amazing because it was a long

this really lovely lunch about two years
 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.229
this really lovely lunch about two years
ago but I was doing experiments in the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239
ago but I was doing experiments in the
 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.740
ago but I was doing experiments in the
prep room of the biology department and

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
prep room of the biology department and
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.799
prep room of the biology department and
I was doing a series of experiments on

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809
I was doing a series of experiments on
 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.990
I was doing a series of experiments on
frogs and tadpoles in growth hormone and

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
frogs and tadpoles in growth hormone and
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.660
frogs and tadpoles in growth hormone and
so I had different tadpoles and watch

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670
so I had different tadpoles and watch
 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.209
so I had different tadpoles and watch
glasses watch glasses are open vessels

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219
glasses watch glasses are open vessels
 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.750
glasses watch glasses are open vessels
that are in sort of like dishes this is

that are in sort of like dishes this is
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.220
that are in sort of like dishes this is
the best way to describe them and they

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
the best way to describe them and they
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.660
the best way to describe them and they
had different experimental conditions

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670
had different experimental conditions
 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.570
had different experimental conditions
and they were all labeled and I was very

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580
and they were all labeled and I was very
 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.890

changes in each condition based on the
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.039
changes in each condition based on the
dose of growth hormone and what I was

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
dose of growth hormone and what I was
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.469
dose of growth hormone and what I was
doing was was showing or demonstrating

this was after several weeks and they've
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.289
this was after several weeks and they've
dumped all the watch glasses into a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299
dumped all the watch glasses into a
 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.800
dumped all the watch glasses into a
bucket to wash them for me so all of my

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810
bucket to wash them for me so all of my
 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.469
bucket to wash them for me so all of my
experimental conditions into the bucket

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
experimental conditions into the bucket

found me crying in the prep room so I
 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.399
found me crying in the prep room so I
don't know what else to do I was just

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409
don't know what else to do I was just
 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.649

can apply to college after three years
 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.809
can apply to college after three years
of high school if there's an academic

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819
of high school if there's an academic
 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.710
of high school if there's an academic
reason and you

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
reason and you
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.170
reason and you
have an academic reason so I I thought

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180
have an academic reason so I I thought
 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.270
have an academic reason so I I thought
about it and I went home and discussed

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
about it and I went home and discussed
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.560
about it and I went home and discussed
it with my parents particularly my

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570
it with my parents particularly my
 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.810
it with my parents particularly my
father and I really wanted to do it

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820
father and I really wanted to do it
 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.160
father and I really wanted to do it
partially for the academics and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170
partially for the academics and
 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.510
partially for the academics and
partially I think I was anxious to get

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520
partially I think I was anxious to get
 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.940
partially I think I was anxious to get
out from home into college and what I

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950
out from home into college and what I
 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.070
out from home into college and what I
saw as my own life but really because I

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080
saw as my own life but really because I
 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.220

I was very curious and I wanted to be in

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
I was very curious and I wanted to be in
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.570
I was very curious and I wanted to be in
a place where I could there were

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580
a place where I could there were
 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.190
a place where I could there were
laboratory resources that would support

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200
laboratory resources that would support
 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.320
laboratory resources that would support
that curiosity because it was clear to

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330
that curiosity because it was clear to
 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.720
that curiosity because it was clear to
me for me that the best way to explore

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730
me for me that the best way to explore
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.560
me for me that the best way to explore
that curiosity was in the lab to work in

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570
that curiosity was in the lab to work in
 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.990
that curiosity was in the lab to work in
in something that I could touch and see

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
in something that I could touch and see
 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.740
in something that I could touch and see
and feel and so I applied to college and

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750
and feel and so I applied to college and
 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.650
and feel and so I applied to college and
I was accepted to Wellesley with only

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660
I was accepted to Wellesley with only
 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.910
I was accepted to Wellesley with only
three years of high school for the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920
three years of high school for the
 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.230
three years of high school for the
reasons that that I explained and I was

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240

and you know Wellesley has an
 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.300
and you know Wellesley has an
association with MIT so I felt like I
