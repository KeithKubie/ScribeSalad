00:00:00.901 --> 00:00:01.767
One tip when writing
a GWT app

00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:04.000
is to remember that security

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.634
needs to happen
on the server

00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:07.200
and not just
on the client.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.667
If you have
different permissions

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:10.133
based on user roles,

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.934
you need to make sure
that those are incorporated

00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:13.701
into server-side requests

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:16.100
and that you don't send
the wrong data to the client,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.567
which could then accidentally
be exposed.
