00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.700
- [Voiceover] So this is Sal Khan here

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.204
with Emily Abrash, our
Biology Content Fellow.

00:00:06.204 --> 00:00:07.505
And you have a PhD in Biology,

00:00:07.505 --> 00:00:09.409
so you know what you're talking about.

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:10.608
- [Voiceover] You'd like to
think that, wouldn't you.

00:00:10.608 --> 00:00:12.251
(laughter)

00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:14.718
- [Voiceover] And so, Khan Academy has had

00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:16.947
biology content for a long time now.

00:00:16.947 --> 00:00:19.385
You know, back in the
day, I think in 2007, 2008

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:21.660
I had made a handful of biology videos.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.609
But what are we hoping to do now?

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.095
- [Voiceover] I mean, I
think here what we're really

00:00:26.095 --> 00:00:29.206
going for is having really
comprehensive coverage.

00:00:29.206 --> 00:00:31.598
Really making sure that
we look at all of the

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.409
different branches of biology

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:36.033
and have great material
that's going to be a resource

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:39.005
for someone who's looking
at any one of those.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.257
You know, not just certain
things that happen to be cool,

00:00:41.257 --> 00:00:44.043
but really digging into a
lot of different branches

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.668
of this subject.

00:00:45.668 --> 00:00:47.219
- [Voiceover] And so how
are you thinking about it.

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.964
I mean, you're out there,
trying to figure out

00:00:49.964 --> 00:00:51.891
what we should cover and
what we shouldn't cover.

00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:55.281
What is your hope for the next year?

00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:58.091
- [Voiceover] My hope is
really that we're going to have

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.877
material that will serve
pretty much anybody

00:01:00.877 --> 00:01:03.454
who's in, like, an
advanced high school level

00:01:03.454 --> 00:01:06.124
or an intro college level class.

00:01:06.124 --> 00:01:08.400
And I mean, there's a lot of
diversity in those classes,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.768
so it's not going to match every class.

00:01:10.768 --> 00:01:13.508
But the hope would be that
if you encounter a topic

00:01:13.508 --> 00:01:15.807
that you're confused
about or interested in

00:01:15.807 --> 00:01:17.084
in one of those classes,

00:01:17.084 --> 00:01:18.918
that you'd be able to come to us

00:01:18.918 --> 00:01:22.026
and really learn more about that.

00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:23.558
- [Voiceover] And the way
we've been working together

00:01:23.558 --> 00:01:25.857
is fun, it's fun to have
people to work with now.

00:01:25.857 --> 00:01:27.134
(laughter)

00:01:27.134 --> 00:01:29.642
They never fit into the walk-in
closet, but now we have...

00:01:29.642 --> 00:01:32.544
And you know, you've been
doing a pretty incredible job.

00:01:32.544 --> 00:01:35.168
You've been obviously
taking a high level view,

00:01:35.168 --> 00:01:37.188
thinking about the different
gaps, what we need to fill in,

00:01:37.188 --> 00:01:38.883
to really have exhaustive coverage for

00:01:38.883 --> 00:01:42.876
intro college biology class,
or an AP biology class.

00:01:42.876 --> 00:01:47.335
You've been writing articles
like this one right over here,

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:50.841
where you really get a hopefully
intuitive but thoughtful

00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:54.184
explanation and kind of deep explanation

00:01:54.184 --> 00:01:56.878
of what's going on.

00:01:56.878 --> 00:01:59.733
We're also working together
to produce more videos

00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:01.428
so that, once again, we don't just cover

00:02:01.428 --> 00:02:03.704
a lot of the main ideas in biology,

00:02:03.704 --> 00:02:06.165
we're covering all of the
things that you would see

00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:11.165
in an AP biology class or a college class.

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.803
So, what's next? What are
you working on right now?

00:02:14.803 --> 00:02:17.264
- [Voiceover] Right now I am just sort of

00:02:17.264 --> 00:02:19.307
in the middle of genetics.

00:02:19.307 --> 00:02:22.326
You've already got a lot of
great videos on genetics,

00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:24.787
so I'm kind of looking
at what we already have,

00:02:24.787 --> 00:02:27.411
as well as sort of some
extensions of that.

00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:30.011
Like the sort of chromosomal
basis of genetics

00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:31.892
and how that was discovered.

00:02:31.892 --> 00:02:34.748
So that's kind of what's
on my plate right now,

00:02:34.748 --> 00:02:37.952
but after that, it will
kind of be full steam ahead

00:02:37.952 --> 00:02:41.365
into molecular biology, DNA replication,

00:02:41.365 --> 00:02:43.478
transcription and translation.

00:02:43.478 --> 00:02:45.815
Which again, we've already
got some great content on,

00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:47.789
but there are places
where I think we can even

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:49.669
build it out some more.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.202
- [Voiceover] I'm excited,
I know I have a backlog

00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:53.385
of four or five videos
that you've been asking for

00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:55.288
for a few days, so they'll be coming soon.

00:02:55.288 --> 00:02:56.357
- [Voiceover] I'm excited for them!

00:02:56.357 --> 00:02:57.518
(laughter)

00:02:57.518 --> 00:02:59.509
- [Voiceover] Thank you.
