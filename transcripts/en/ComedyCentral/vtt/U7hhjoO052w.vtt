00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.903
Social media is really
a narcissistic place,

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:06.372
which is why it's so popular
with teens and Donald Trump,

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:08.875
so it's no surprise that
last week Facebook, Twitter,

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:11.411
and Instagram were flooded with
selfies warped by the FaceApp,

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.679
the software that can make you
look older, younger,

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:16.115
swap your gender, and you
can even make you smile.

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:17.850
Look at what @kept_simple did

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:20.887
with this image
from the Great Depression.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.856
(audience exclaiming)

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:28.561
What a...

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:32.365
What a, what a wonderfully
respectful thing to do.

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.567
"History doesn't have to be so
depressing," it wrote.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.369
Yeah. Nothing depressing
about a face-scanning app

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:37.804
that twists reality,
so, comedians,

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.739
I'm gonna show you a pic
that has been FaceApped,

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:42.708
and for 250 points I want you
to answer a question about it.

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:44.143
First up,

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:47.380
although President currently
looks like a jaundiced toe,

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:50.550
FaceApp shows us an alternate
future where he is a young stud.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.552
(laughter)

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.021
Oh, huh?

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:57.824
What's the name of hot Trump's
teen drama?

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.192
Mary Lynn.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.327
 Josie and the Grab 'Em
 by the Pussycats.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.962
Very well done!

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:04.430
Mary Lynn, points.

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:07.166
(cheering and applause)

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:08.634
Next, grouchy old man

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.536
and Patriots coach
Bill Belichick here

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:13.606
was turned back into
a little boy.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.608
(laughter)

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.276
Tell us a fact about--

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:19.078
I can't tell which one's which.

00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:22.448
Uh, tell us a fact
about baby Belichick.

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:23.783
Dave.

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:26.819
He's actually a 36-year-old
lesbian named Jan.

00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:28.554
HARDWICK:
All right, points.

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:29.856
Mary Lynn.

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:32.892
He calls what he does
in his diaper "the browns."

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:36.796
HARDWICK: Yes, points.
Very good, very good.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.332
(cheering and applause)

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.534
Next one, @lindsaygoldwert

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.437
tweeted what the GOP
would look like as women.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.640
And, uh-- but I think
our favorite selfie

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:51.611
was maybe Lady Steve Bannon
right there.

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.646
That's Lady Steve Bannon.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.615
What's her political platform?

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.016
Dave.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.919
Still a Nazi, only this time
with sensible shoes.

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:01.354
HARDWICK:
All right, points.

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:02.555
Mary Lynn.

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:04.624
Tax breaks for the wealthy

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:06.893
and anyone who can teach her
how Facebook works.

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.461
HARDWICK:
Ah, very good.

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:09.962
Very good, points.

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:11.931
(applause)

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:16.469
Next. Lady Liberty is giddy.

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:18.804
E...

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:21.040
Why is the Statue of Liberty
so pleased?

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:22.308
Hari.

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:23.743
She's excited that Donald Trump

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.878
is about to deport her home
to France.

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:27.513
HARDWICK:
Ah. Points.

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.615
Very good.

00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:31.184
Dave Hill.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:34.954
She's got, like, 80 guys in her
right now.

00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:38.124
-Who's... ?
-(laughter)

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:40.326
(cheering and applause)

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:41.961
HARDWICK:
Well done on that.

00:02:41.994 --> 00:02:44.630
All right, all right,
there you go.

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:45.932
Mary Lynn.

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:47.833
If there's a government
shutdown,

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:49.435
she'll finally get a vacation.

00:02:49.468 --> 00:02:51.103
-HARDWICK: Yeah, you guys.
-She's smiling,

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:52.805
-'cause she's having a good
vacation. -Where should we go?

00:02:52.838 --> 00:02:55.541
-HILL: That's good.
-A vacation with 80 guys

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:58.077
-up in her, am I right?
-HARDWICK: Yeah, Mary Lynn.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.646
-Yes, yeah.
-(whooping)

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.615
Crank it up.

00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:04.383
Okay. We're doing that
one more time there.

00:03:04.416 --> 00:03:06.786
Great. Yeah, pump it out,
pump it out, Mary Lynn.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.187
Oh, man.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.623
And, uh, finally,
I, of course, tried FaceApp,

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:14.493
and, uh, now I know
I'm a hot as (bleep) girl.

00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:18.130
-Like, I am so (bleep).
-(cheering and applause)

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:19.865
I mean...

00:03:19.898 --> 00:03:21.834
(cheering continues)

00:03:25.604 --> 00:03:28.874
You know you want some of that.

00:03:28.907 --> 00:03:30.676
You know you want
some of that.

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.312
-You're Kristin Bell?
-I'm Kristin Bell.

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:36.315
(laughter)

00:03:36.348 --> 00:03:38.951
Now I know what I'm gonna look
like when I get old, too.

00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:41.320
There's old me.

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:43.189
I'll still be hosting 30 shows.

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:45.057
So, comedians...

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.626
What is it--

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.396
"Welcome to
 Talking Almost Dead."

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:53.065
What's a show old Hardwick
will host? Mary Lynn.

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:54.600
 Shingled Out.

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:57.536
HARDWICK:
Hey! Very good, points.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.672
(cheering and applause)

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:03.175
Dave.

00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:05.845
 Talking Chris Not-So-Hardwick.

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:07.813
-Yeah, points.
-Who's... who's with me?

00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:09.782
It happens.

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:14.520
Uh, Hari.

00:04:14.553 --> 00:04:17.189
 -@4:00pm.
 -Yes, points.

00:04:17.222 --> 00:04:19.158
Very good.

00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:20.457
These are all true.
