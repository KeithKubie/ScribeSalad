00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.260
In the last lesson, lesson 4. We learned

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.390
that lactose intolerance is caused by the absence of

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.910
an enzyme called lactase. And this trait is

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.240
otherwise known as lactase non persistence. So, if you

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.180
show signs of lactose intolerance, it's because you

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.920
don't have enough lactase around to digest the lactose.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.910
Because you're lactase non persistent. You don't express

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.480
lactase anymore. But if you can digest lactose product,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.910
you're lactose tolerant because you still have lactase

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.470
around. You had lactase persistence. You still express

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.320
the lactase enzyme. Now there were 2 particular

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.770
alleles that we discussed at the link, and they

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.640
are both located about 13,000 base pair upstream

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.490
of the transcription initiation side at the lactase coding

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.620
region. A Cytosine or C, up here in

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.260
the enhancer region, correlates with lactase non persistence or

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.420
symptoms of lactose intolerance like Kate has, the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.900
other allele a Thymine or T in enhancer

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.320
region, correlates with lactase persistence, meaning that we

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.190
will have lactase around and we can digest

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.430
lactose so, we'll be lactose tolerant. So based

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.030
on this information, how many different allelic combinations

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.000
are even possible? And remember as a hint,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.240
every human has two alleles for the lactase gene.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.020
Go ahead and put the answer you think in this text box here.
