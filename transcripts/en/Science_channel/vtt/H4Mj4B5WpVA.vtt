00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:07.501
YOU KNOW, I'D SAY
MY FAVORITE ASPECT OF SCIENCE

00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:09.033
IS THE PROCESS.

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:11.934
YOU HAVE A HYPOTHESIS
ABOUT MAYBE HOW THE WORLD WORKS

00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:13.167
OR WHAT'S GOING ON

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:15.501
AND THEN YOU GO OUT,
AND YOU TEST IT.

00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:17.667
THE THING I LIKE MOST
ABOUT SCIENCE

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:19.634
IS THAT EVERY DAY,

00:00:19.634 --> 00:00:21.467
I START WITH
A CLEAN SHEET OF PAPER.

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:23.467
AND EVERY DAY,
I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:25.133
TO CREATE
A WHOLE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.634
THAT NEVER EXISTED BEFORE.

00:00:26.634 --> 00:00:30.501
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT SCIENCE
IS THAT IT FASCINATES ME

00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:33.701
THAT WE ARE ABLE
TO UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSE

00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:35.067
TO ANY DEGREE AT ALL.

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:37.367
WHY THE SKY IS BLUE,
WHAT MAKES RAINBOWS HAPPEN,

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:40.100
HOW EARTH SCIENCE WORKS,
WHAT DO VOLCANOES COME FROM --

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.968
IT'S AN AMAZING THING.
EVERYTHING IS IN THERE,

00:00:42.968 --> 00:00:44.501
AND WE'RE SURROUNDED BY IT.

00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:46.367
AND WE JUST HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO STUDY IT

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:47.567
SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND IT.

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:49.234
AND WE TRY TO USE THOSE ANSWERS

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:51.534
TO MAKE OUR LIFE A LOT EASIER.

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:53.334
I LOVE HOW SCIENCE
IS ABLE TO EXPLAIN

00:00:53.334 --> 00:00:55.000
THE MYSTERIES OF THE WORLD
TO ANYBODY.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.534
SCIENCE TALKS TO KIDS.
IT TALKS TO ADULTS.

00:00:57.534 --> 00:01:00.133
AND IT JUST EXPLAINS THIS
WONDERFUL PLACE WE LIVE IN.
