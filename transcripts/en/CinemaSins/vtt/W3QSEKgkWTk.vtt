00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.020
Okay, well first of all, I want to thank you
for being here today for this interview.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.090
Do you prefer Mr. The Grey or Mr. The White?

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:22.369
I have both set of robes, I go by both names.

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.100
You can call me either.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.100
Great.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.100
Well, welcome.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:33.390
I come back to you now, at the turn of the
tide.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.000
That's... great.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.239
Okay, so I'm sure that you've heard about
our YouTube channel, CinemaSins, and its great

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.920
success on YouTube.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.000
Many of those words have no meaning to me.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.040
Maybe Middle Earth is a little further behind
in technology than I thought.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.280
You know what?

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.039
It's not that big of a deal.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.039
It's really not.

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.340
Okay, let's just dive into the questions.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.340
Alright?

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.340
Okay.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.160
First of all, are you a homosexual?

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.160
Hmm.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.850
That is an oddly specific thing to ask.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.750
You don't want to start with something less
personal?

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.530
I'll ask the questions around here.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.530
Okay.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.680
So, are you gay?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.400
No I am not.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.080
I'm sad to say a powerful elf queen holds
the keys to my heart.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.060
Galadirel?

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.770
She's a total bitch.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.480
Ice queen is more like it.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.480
Indeed.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.330
But I still want to see what's underneath
those robes, don't you?

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.140
That is truly disgusting.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.700
Alright.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.580
So... you're sure you're not gay?

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.800
I am sure, yes.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.640
You never experimented in college or on any
of your many all-male quests?

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:03.170
Are all your questions going to be about my
sexuality?

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.130
Yes.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.590
Master human, may I inquire why you are so
fascinated on this subject?

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.569
Well, we—I wrote this song.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.989
And it's about you.

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.480
And I want to make a music video for it, so
I wanted to get you to be in it.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.670
But I need to be gay to be in it?

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.020
Well no you don't have to be.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.940
It'd probably make things a little easier.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.590
Have you thought about asking Ian McKellen.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.910
He played me in the Regular Earth movies and
he's actually gay.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.910
Yeah.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.540
Well, we wanted to use the real thing.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.900
But only if the real thing is actually gay.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.900
Well, no.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.900
I mean...

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.170
Listen, you don't have to be gay.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.670
You could just pretend to be gay.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.069
Or temporarily gay, like Anne Heche.

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.219
Let me ask you this: let's say there's nothing
but dudes left on Earth.

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.569
Middle Earth or Regular Earth?

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:06.569
Either.

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:07.569
Alright?

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:08.569
Okay.

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:09.569
All the chicks are dead.

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.790
Well, Galadriel can't die, she can only go
to the undying lands.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.959
Will you stop—then she's there, alright?

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.510
Will you stop nitpicking my scenario.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.590
The point is, you're horny, you got a boner,
nothing but dudes.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.580
Would you ever...

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.580
Hmm.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.580
Consider
No.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.580
Maybe.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.580
No.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.580
Nope.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.580
No?

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.580
No.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.170
Not even if you were in prison?

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.870
No prison can hold me.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:36.870
No prison can hold me.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.431
You have only broken out of prisons with the
help of eagles.

00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:41.549
You didn't do any of that on your own.

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:42.549
What?!

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.709
The only time I've known you to break out
of a prison is because the eagles are helping

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:46.709
you.

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.050
Well, that doesn't mean that you know everything.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.810
Do you want to be in the video, earn some
cash, or not?

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.860
If I say no will you still send me back to
Middle Earth?

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.170
Man, I'm not planning to send you back either
way.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.750
Then how am I supposed to get back?

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.799
F*ck if I know, dude.

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.030
You're the wizard.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.340
Isn't there a wardrobe you can go walk through
or something?

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.430
That's Narnia, sir, a completely different
fantasy series.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.430
Completely
It's not completely different.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.780
Okay similar.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.290
But I still—I don't need to go to Narnia.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.230
I need to go to Middle Earth.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.613
Maybe you can take the wardrobe to Narnia
and then catch a bus from there to Middle

00:04:25.613 --> 00:04:26.613
Earth.

00:04:26.613 --> 00:04:28.350
There's no bus from Narnia to Middle Earth,
alright?

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.853
Are you gonna tell me how to get home?

00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:32.950
How did you even get me here in the first
place?

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.950
Alright.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.610
Alright
How did you get me here?

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.340
How am I here?

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.510
If I knew that I would be the wizard.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.510
Hmm.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.610
Well, what am I supposed to do?

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.910
I would probably recommend getting a job.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:48.910
Job.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.060
You know, food, shelter, all that sh*t costs
money here in Regular Earth.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.090
I know of a job, actually.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.620
Co-star of a music video.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.410
I'm not going to be in your music video, confound
it.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.200
Now point me toward Middle Earth and I'll
be on my way.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.200
Hmm?

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.200
Now!

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:15.860
I cannot believe you made me hit him over
the head.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.130
Relax, he'll be fine.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.756
And what are you gonna do when he wakes up?

00:05:21.756 --> 00:05:24.310
He will eventually come to grips with the
fact that he's stuck here in our world.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.640
Then, he'll do the video just so he can have
the cash to pay for some food.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.560
I'm pretty sure this still counts as kidnapping.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.260
You can't kidnap a fictional character.
