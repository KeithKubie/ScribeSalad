00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.380
MALE SPEAKER: Hello
and welcome everyone.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.130
We have a very special
guest with us here today,

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.450
Hewitt Heiserman.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.300
He authored the book,
"It's Earnings That Count,"

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.100
and he is currently finishing
his second book, "The Checklist

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.306
Investor."

00:00:17.306 --> 00:00:19.190
The interesting thing
about today's talk

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.640
is that he is
going to be sharing

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.140
material which I am told
might become his third book.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.080
So you guys are the first
ones to get a look at it.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.670
Mr. Heiserman is a member of the
Boston Security Analyst Society

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.500
and CFA Institute.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.570
He's been quoted in various
publications including the Wall

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.700
Street Journal and Barron's.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.950
He has spoken to several
CFA groups as well as

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.840
Fidelity Management,
Franklin Templeton,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.090
and the American Association
of Individual Investors.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.360
He is, interestingly,
an Ironman finisher

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.850
and is active in open
land preservation.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.860
Lastly, and I guess
more importantly,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.980
he is a recipient of the
Kenyan College's faculty award

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.120
for distinguished achievement.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.100
And he will be speaking to
us wearing his teacher's hat.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.960
We are really glad
to have you here.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.460
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join me

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.420
in welcoming, Hewitt Heiserman.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.320
HEWITT HEISERMAN:
The title of my talk

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.480
is Ben Graham and
the Growth Investor.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.675
And if you know
anything about Ben,

00:01:28.675 --> 00:01:31.965
you know that famously
he was a value investor.

00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:34.600
He wanted to buy companies
that were cheap in relation

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.270
to their corporate net worth.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.390
And this may seem
like a paradox,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.162
but I will explain
everything shortly.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.590
I want to draw your
attention to a study that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.210
was done by Jeff Smart,
a PhD, a venture capital.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.080
And these VC firms, including
some here in this area

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.490
were profiled by their
personality type.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.210
And then their
performance in terms

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.160
of which companies
they were investing in.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.920
Again, these are early
stage pre-revenue companies,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.904
highly speculative,
maybe just a couple

00:02:08.904 --> 00:02:12.890
of people, no
assets to speak of.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.370
The personality type
that performed the best

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.150
were the airline captains.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.240
They averaged almost an 80%
IRR on their investments.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.860
The airline captain followed
a discipline repeatable

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.220
and explainable
process when they

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.370
were interviewing potential
candidates to finance.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.650
In other words they were
using a checklist approach.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.820
And this applies to what I'm
going to talk about today.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.000
This chart here shows that for
the last 30 years, just 25%

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.900
of the stocks created all
the stock market returns.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.870
And 75% of the stocks either
broke even or they lost money.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.220
And this chart shows that one
out of five is a big winner.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.170
40% lost money and one out
of five is a big loser.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.070
So if we can tilt the odds
of success in our favor,

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.680
that's a tremendous advantage.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.360
So we're going to be using
a checklist approach, which

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.910
is kind of like a race, where
there's a series of hurdles.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.940
And in our approach,
not every company

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.410
will reach the finish line.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.440
You probably know that
airline pilots use checklists.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.040
And even a company called
Google uses checklists.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.560
There's a great book by Atul
Gawande called, "The Checklist

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.520
Manifesto."

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.380
If you haven't read
it, there's a lot

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.650
of good information in there.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.110
So here's our checklist
for the growth investor.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.240
We're going to go
through these five items.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.230
We're going to spend
a little more time

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.730
on number one, earnings
quality and number five, sell.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.560
The three in the
middle, we're going

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.270
to go over a little bit faster.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.560
I want to acknowledge the
luminaries that have spoken

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.110
here in this series before me.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.580
I've tried to watch
every presentation.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.220
I've taken notes as I've
watched these other individual

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.290
speakers-- a lot of
excellent content.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.370
I want to acknowledge the people
that have helped me get here.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.900
My high school, the Haverford
School-- I refer to last year.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.060
It had the number one
ranked boys lacrosse team

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.500
in the United States.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.400
Kenyon College has
more NCAA championships

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.151
than any school in
the United States,

00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:39.150
with the exception of
three California schools--

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.960
USC, UCLA, and Stanford.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.700
Kenyon was named as having one
of the most beautiful campuses

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.770
in the world
according to Forbes.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.120
And Chuck Huggins, who
was the CEO of See's Candy

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.570
was a graduate.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.070
Charlie Monger, who is the vice
chairman at Berkshire Hathaway

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.710
said that

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.640
See's was their first
high quality company

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.900
that Berkshire bought
and that opened up

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.140
the door to Coca-Cola.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.350
They were able to realize
the value of pricing

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.490
power, competitive
advantage, and some

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.430
of these qualitative
things that they really

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.031
hadn't paid attention to
earlier in their partnership.

00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:24.490
And of course I
want to acknowledge

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.820
John Bogle, the founder and
former CEO of the Vanguard

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.320
Group.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.330
Mr. Bogle wrote the
forward to my book.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.320
If he were here today
he'd say three things.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.430
Number one, no
one knows nothing.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.930
That was the advice
he first learned

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.532
when he got in the
business in the early 50s.

00:05:40.532 --> 00:05:41.990
Second, most of us
should have most

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.160
of our money in index funds.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.820
And third, his life's
motto, press on regardless.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.760
When I visited Mr. Bogle
last April at the Vanguard

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.670
headquarters, interestingly
enough, Google's historian

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.280
was on their campus that day.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.770
And he had just left Mr. Bogle's
office as I was going in.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.550
After my book was published,
Barron's wrote this article

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:19.370
that I wrote about the
earnings power chart

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.686
which we're going to discuss.

00:06:23.595 --> 00:06:26.460
They also published a letter
to the editor that I wrote,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.720
in which I said-- this
is in December 2004.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.140
You had just gone public
in August of that year.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.660
I said that it was
unlikely that Google

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:44.870
would make $14 billion
dollars of earnings by 2014.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.960
Actually I said $10 billion.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.220
In fact you made $14.4 billion.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.613
So congratulations.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.960
I also mention this because
five years ago I bought

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.425
a company that went bankrupt.

00:07:00.425 --> 00:07:02.050
That was the first
time I'd ever bought

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.190
a company that went bankrupt.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.430
The point is that these are
my ideas, but it's your money.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.858
So I want you to test
everything that I say today.

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:17.290
I'm finishing a book called,
"The Checklist Manifesto,"

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.060
which Miles Thompson at Columbia
University Press will publish.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.944
That should be
available in a year.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.860
Just to help you get the
lay of the land here,

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.300
there are six broad reasons
why you might buy a company's

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.980
stock-- yield, growth, the
company's cheap in relation

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.680
to its net assets, people,
a special situation

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:46.925
like a spin-off, and then
other includes short-selling.

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:51.680
I'm going to address this second
column from the left, growth

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.210
investing.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.010
I think this is
the most intuitive

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.720
of the six approaches
or the most human.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.830
We plant a tree in our yard
and we watch the tree grow

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.870
and then it has
flowers or fruit.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.140
Or if we're a
parent we have kids

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.595
and we watch our kids grow up.

00:08:08.595 --> 00:08:13.490
I think we can all relate
to the growth approach.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.110
One of the great growth
stocks of the last 25 years

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.880
is Microsoft.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.960
If you or your parents were
lucky or prescient enough

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.930
to buy $10,000 in
1990, those shares

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:28.000
grew to a million dollars
by the end of 1999.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.195
Now you can see in
these blue bars here--

00:08:30.195 --> 00:08:31.950
that's earnings per share.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.750
And you can see how they
keep growing over time.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.970
And that's what
Wall Street loves.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.770
There are some advantages
on a growth company--

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.184
the chance to make a lot
of money, which gives you

00:08:46.184 --> 00:08:47.350
more control over your life.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:51.720
You may even be able to go
on and do something else,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.124
help other people.

00:08:53.124 --> 00:08:54.665
There's no exquisite
timing required.

00:08:54.665 --> 00:08:58.900
You can buy a [INAUDIBLE]
position today and then build

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.380
that position as you get
to know the company better.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.660
There's no capital gains tax
so your money compounds faster.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.144
And then there is the
psychological benefit--

00:09:08.144 --> 00:09:12.140
the pride of discovery, the joy
of ownership, sort of thing.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:17.730
But it's important to point out
that growth investing is very

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:25.410
difficult. Now it's not as
difficult as free climbing

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:34.400
at Yosemite or even
getting a job here.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.960
Just to introduce the
price earnings ratio,

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.580
Amazon's price is about $507.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.330
It's going to earn
about $4.46 this year.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.560
So its price to
earnings ratio is 114.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.580
If Amazon makes that same
level of earnings forever,

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:57.590
you'll wait 114 years to get
your stock price purchase back.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.850
Alphabet's about
20 times earnings.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.160
The market's about 21 times
earnings and then Apple

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.080
about 10 times earnings.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.790
I introduce the P/E
ratio because this chart

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.727
shows that on the left these
are your growth companies.

00:10:10.727 --> 00:10:12.560
These are the companies
that had the highest

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.400
price earnings ratio.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.960
And the companies
that we believe

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.460
are going to have the most
growth in front of them,

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.020
we tend to bid up their price.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.992
So they have the lowest
subsequent investment returns.

00:10:24.992 --> 00:10:26.950
And then the companies
over on the right, these

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.560
are your lowest P/E stocks.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.170
And the irony is that they
had the highest returns.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.630
There are three
reasons-- three obstacles

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.290
that confront the
growth investor.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:44.180
First of all we buy a company
that has poor earnings quality.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.980
Second, we buy a company just
as a its competitive advantage

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.510
wanes.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:55.110
And third, we overpay for
value that never materializes.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.700
So here's our checklist that
we're going to work with today.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.080
And we're going to start with
number one, earnings quality.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.960
And to do this I want
to introduce generally

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.960
accepted accounting
principals, or GAAP.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.990
GAAP is Robert's Rules
of Order for America.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.790
When you open up an
annual report or a 10-K

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.020
and you look at the
financial statements,

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.622
that's GAAP accounting.

00:11:15.622 --> 00:11:17.580
And we need GAAP accounting
just like motorists

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.120
need traffic lights.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.538
If we didn't have
them we'd have chaos.

00:11:21.538 --> 00:11:27.400
But net income and
earnings per share, we

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.750
think of them as hard
numbers or fixed numbers.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.060
But that's not the case
as I learned 30 years ago

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.980
when I read this landmark
book, "Quality of Earnings,"

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.760
by Thornton O'Glove.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.230
He points out in this book
that there are many accounting

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:45.060
decisions that a CFO can make
that influence just how much

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.770
or how little money
a company makes.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.920
Bill Ackman, a billionaire
hedge fund manager

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.370
describes, "Quality of
Earnings" on his short list

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.310
of recommended reading.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.872
Just as an aside, after
I finished my first book

00:12:02.872 --> 00:12:05.080
and I was looking for people
to write an endorsement,

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.950
the first person I
called was Mr. O'Glove.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.060
I didn't know him.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.530
And we talked and
he quickly said yes.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.330
And then I found that
after that conversation,

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.260
as I was asking for other
endorsements for my book,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.830
when I told them that I got the
green light from Mr. O'Glove,

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.940
the endorsements came
fast and furious.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.890
He wrote just a--
just as a side note,

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:32.800
he wrote an op-ed piece
for Barron's last fall.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.840
And he argues that
Berkshire Hathaway

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.880
should-- it's time for
Berkshire to deconglomerate.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.330
It's too big and that the pieces
are worth more than the sum.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.040
So this will be an
interesting trend.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.250
It's a non-consensus view.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.700
This will be something to watch
over the next several years.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.440
Anyway, other books
that I've read which

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.040
influenced by
thinking, the first,

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.550
"Cash Flow and
Security Analysis"

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.735
by Joshua Livnat and Ken Hackel.

00:13:01.735 --> 00:13:04.490
And they introduce what's
called a free cash flow income

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:05.200
statement.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.590
And their argument is that the
GAAP income statement which

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.670
we see here in the center,
it doesn't tell you

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.410
how much cash is coming
in and out of a company.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.230
And so a better
measure is one that

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.530
takes into account investment
in fixed and working capital.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:25.520
So let's look at that
Alphabet's results for 2015.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.120
These results were
just posted on Friday.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.205
I pulled them off
of your website.

00:13:31.205 --> 00:13:34.220
You made almost $75 billion.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.990
So I'm in the GAAP
column right now.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.650
You made $75 billion of revenue.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.120
You had $59 billion of expenses.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.080
Your net income
is $16.4 billion.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.080
And earnings per share
almost $22 a share.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.960
On a free cash flow basis, we're
going to expense investment

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.067
in fixed capital.

00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:56.150
Well, what does that mean?

00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:02.830
That means if you're going
out and you're buying rockets,

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:08.600
for example or other businesses,
or other machinery or equipment

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:13.260
that is above your depreciation,
that is a use of cash.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:18.460
And depreciation is just your
old capital spending that

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.610
gets written off over time.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.080
So in Alphabet's
case last year you

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.600
made an investment of
$8.5 billion dollars.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.870
So that's a $8.5 billion
of cash that's coming out

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.770
of your corporate
checking account

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.250
that does not appear in
the GAAP income statement.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.024
Another-- yes.

00:14:36.024 --> 00:14:36.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.110
HEWITT HEISERMAN: It's
above depreciation.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.318
That's an excellent question.

00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:45.310
Yes.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.560
What you do basically is
you take capital spending,

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.090
you go to the
statement of cash flow

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.390
and take capital spending
plus acquisitions

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.410
minus depreciation.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.380
And the reason I
include acquisitions

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.290
because many companies
buy other companies

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.390
because that's a faster
way of getting up

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.040
to speed than building
something de novo, where

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.230
you got to hire people,
you got to get--

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.850
so it's just a faster way.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.270
So $8.6 billion invested
in-- $8.5 billion

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.380
invested in fixed capital.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:20.530
Working capital investment
is more modest, $827 million.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:21.740
You have some receivables.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.630
You don't have any inventory.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.333
So in the big scheme of things,
that's just a rounding error.

00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:31.690
So on a cash basis, if you
will, Alphabet last year

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:35.455
made $5.96 billion.

00:15:35.455 --> 00:15:38.150
And one thing I like to
look at is I like to see,

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.820
what's the percentage
of free cash flow

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.050
earnings to GAAP earnings.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:49.730
And here we see
that ratio is 37%.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.246
So that idea is from
this book, "Cash Flow

00:15:52.246 --> 00:15:53.400
and Security Analysis."

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.590
I then read another book
called, "The Quest for Value,"

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.600
after reading about Coca-Cole.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:03.630
There was a cover story in
Fortune magazine, 1995, 1996,

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:08.920
and Roberto Goizueta who was
the CEO was lauding this EVA

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.110
approach to capital allocation.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:18.474
And Coke at that time had
a 10-year track record

00:16:18.474 --> 00:16:23.780
of creating some serious
amounts of stockholder wealth.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:28.300
This EVA income statement is
unique for its own two reasons.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.960
Now you'll notice that it
does not expense investment

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.330
in working capital, at
least not immediately.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.700
What it does expense directly
is intangibles like R&amp;D, money

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.516
that you spend on patents.

00:16:42.516 --> 00:16:44.570
These would be relevant
for your business.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:48.170
Other businesses,
it might be the cost

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.160
of buying subscription
lists or marketing efforts,

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.120
pre-store opening costs.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.460
So I want you to compare the
difference between the GAAP

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.720
expense for intangibles
and the EVA approach.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.750
There's about a $4
billion difference.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.839
The EVA approach
actually credits

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:07.990
you back about $4 billion
worth of expenses.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.740
Because the mindset
here is, we're

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.050
going to spread
those intangibles

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.710
over their expected useful life.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.560
So if you're investing in
your people, your processes,

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.099
or your intellectual
property today,

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:27.940
we don't expect you to derive
value from those outlays today.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:32.607
We think they'll occur in year
two, three, four, five, six.

00:17:32.607 --> 00:17:34.440
So we're going to try
to match current sales

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.880
with current expenses and future
sales with future expenses.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.520
The other income statement
here that's noteworthy

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.550
is the interest expense
or cost of capital

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.880
which is about $5.7 billion.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:53.870
In the EVA approach, not only
is debt treated as an expense

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:59.710
but so is stockholder's equity,
which you have a lot of.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:05.140
So in the EVA approach, if you
buy Alphabet stock or you buy

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.390
Coca-Cola stock--
Procter &amp; Gamble stock,

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.080
you have an expected
return mindset.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.570
You expect to get some
return on your stock.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.030
And so what the EVA
approach tries to do

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.200
is to capture that cost.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.050
Now if accounting's
not your thing,

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:24.520
the good news is, that's the
end of the accounting for today.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.570
So I was in a quandary.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.880
When do I use the free
cash flow income statement

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.334
and when do I use the
EVA income statement?

00:18:30.334 --> 00:18:32.900
And I built both of
these alternate income

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.385
statements in Excel on my
computer, and I had them

00:18:36.385 --> 00:18:38.010
and I just didn't
know which way to go.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:42.810
And then I read a passage from
one of Ben Graham's books.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:48.120
Now Ben is the
first great investor

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.310
teacher of the modern age.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.870
He came to the United States
with his family, graduated

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.390
from Columbia with
three offers to teach

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.070
at three different departments.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.345
His father just passed away.

00:18:58.345 --> 00:19:01.829
He needed to make some money for
his mother and two younger sons

00:19:01.829 --> 00:19:03.120
so he got a job on Wall Street.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.346
And he started making a
lot of money pretty quick.

00:19:05.346 --> 00:19:07.720
And then the depression came
along and he was speculating

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.480
and Ben got wiped out.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.810
So he re-jigged his
investment methodology

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.530
and he developed this margin
of safety principle, which

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.180
you're probably familiar with.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.720
And we all use margin
of safety in our lives.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.800
If you have to be at work
at-- what time do you

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.074
have to be at work here?

00:19:24.074 --> 00:19:25.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.080
AUDIENCE: Whenever.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:26.520
HEWITT HEISERMAN: Whenever.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.020
All right, if you have
to be here at whenever,

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.670
and you know it
takes a half hour,

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:35.380
you leave 45 minutes before,
just in case something happens.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.296
So that was his framework for
approaching stock selection.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.530
Warren Buffett explains
margin of safety this way.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:51.430
He says, "you build a bridge
that can carry a 30,000 pound

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:56.760
truck but then you have a
weight limit of 10,000 pounds."

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.010
Now, Alphabet has
a margin of safety.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.500
It's a redundancy.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:08.070
It is your data centers that
you have around the world.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.330
And I assume you have them.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.351
You had them as of last week.

00:20:12.351 --> 00:20:12.850
Right?

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:13.850
So it's the same idea.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:14.850
It's a margin of safety.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.970
If one data center
goes down, you've

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:21.057
got others that you can use.

00:20:21.057 --> 00:20:23.140
Anyway, Ben writes in the,
"Intelligent Investor,"

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.430
he says there are two types--
the defensive investor who

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.030
wants to avoid committing
[INAUDIBLE] mistakes,

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.760
and the enterprising
investor who

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.846
wants to own companies that
are more promising than most.

00:20:33.846 --> 00:20:34.970
So I'm thinking about this.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.050
I'm thinking, huh,
the defensive investor

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.950
is kind of like a
commercial banker.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:44.880
If it's raining, they want the
umbrella that they lent you.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.250
They want it back.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.430
And they think about
corporate profitability kind

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.590
of like a lemonade stand.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.710
Because the way that
they're going to make

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.270
money is if you can
repay that loan.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:58.310
And so they're going to focus
on how much cash you generate.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.930
Their not going to get
rich owning your business.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:06.140
So their mindset is very
pessimistic, hard money.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.130
And that's the way the free cash
flow income statement works.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.620
And then the other
personality type,

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.470
I think of it as like the
way a venture capitalist

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:15.530
looks at a business.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:23.370
Here at Alphabet, you have
two funding entities, right?

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:25.360
They're both early stage.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.620
This is according to what
I read in the papers.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.930
When they sit down and they
look at business opportunities,

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.730
they're creating a pro forma.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:39.330
So they're modeling out
revenue going out several years

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.380
and then they're
modeling out expenses.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.120
They're going to
depreciate or spread

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:49.280
over time intangibles
and capital spending.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.610
But also they want
to make a return.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.640
Because your stockholders
want to make a return.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.630
So they're going to have a
line in there for the financing

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.420
that they're providing
to this entity.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.827
So I want to make a proposal
that the GAAP income

00:22:01.827 --> 00:22:03.410
statement is too,
"venture capitalist"

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:07.890
for the defensive
investor and is too,

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:12.290
"commercial banker" for
the enterprising investor.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.049
And now we're going
to return to Alphabet

00:22:14.049 --> 00:22:15.590
and we're going to
look at five years

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.500
worth of your performance.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.920
Now the blue bar, that's
your GAAP net income.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.220
And that's in the
middle because it's

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:26.280
kind of in between these two
opposing viewpoints about what

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.970
is corporate profitability.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:34.599
We see a progression of
increased positive progression

00:22:34.599 --> 00:22:35.640
over the last five years.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.080
So that's impressive.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.570
We have our defensive
profits on the left.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:46.020
And you see that
beginning in 2013,

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:51.160
the gap between GAAP
net income has widened.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.600
And that's because you're making
tremendous investments in fixed

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.270
capital.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.960
Now if you had a
lot of debt, if you

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:03.400
had a history of write-offs,
if your ownership culture--

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.850
if I wasn't comfortable
with your ownership culture,

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:07.930
if I looked at
this dichotomy, it

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:11.140
would make me somewhat troubled.

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:14.130
In Alphabet's case,
there's nothing

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:18.490
to suggest that these
investments in the future

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:21.010
are anything to worry about.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:23.380
With the enterprise
income statement,

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.590
we can see that
there's a tighter

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:30.470
correlation between GAAP
profits and enterprise profits.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:32.830
So this gives me
comfort that you're

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:38.910
making pretty high
returns on your earnings.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:40.530
Most of what I'm
talking about today,

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.905
these are ideas that
I've collated and thought

00:23:42.905 --> 00:23:44.030
about from other investors.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:48.260
I guess my one little
contribution to this field,

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.399
such as it is, is what I call
the earnings power chart.

00:23:52.399 --> 00:23:53.940
And so in this
approach, we are going

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.700
to reject the GAAP
income statement,

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.197
because it's like
being half pregnant.

00:23:58.197 --> 00:24:00.530
We're going to focus on the
relationship between defense

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.570
and enterprise in profits.

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:07.030
And as you would think, the
best-- there are four boxes.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.520
And the best box to be is
in the upper right box.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.320
That means you have defensive
profits and enterprise profits.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:18.065
And that's where Alphabet
has resided for the last five

00:24:18.065 --> 00:24:18.565
years.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.200
We're now going to
step back 15 years

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.190
to a company called Enron.

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:33.230
Enron, in the late 1990s was one
of the best performing stocks.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.730
It was a stock to last a decade.

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:41.750
This is of the 2000s, according
to a business publication

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.810
that's prominent.

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.510
Its CFO Andy Fastow
was named best

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:51.280
CFO, chief financial officer.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.980
And a lot of people
were buying Enron

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.770
because they thought it
was a growth company.

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:59.050
Their thesis was based
on the income statement.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:02.170
But when we look at
their earnings quality

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.030
through these two
alternate metrics,

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.620
we see that they were in the
lower left box every year.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:11.680
So if you were thinking
of buying Enron

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.540
and you ran those numbers
through this model,

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.329
you'd have to
reject that thesis.

00:25:17.329 --> 00:25:19.620
There might have been other
reasons to buy the company,

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.640
but it wasn't because of their
quality of their earnings

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.730
growth.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:28.000
After I finished
looking at Enron,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.450
I wondered, did either of these
two alternate income statements

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.030
or maybe the earning pie
chart tell you in advance

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.520
that something was wrong with
all these other companies?

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.540
All these other
companies here, they all

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:43.258
ran into financial difficulty
and cost stockholders lots

00:25:43.258 --> 00:25:44.756
of money.

00:25:44.756 --> 00:25:46.380
And so I wanted to
be like a-- I wanted

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.730
to see if there is
something you could

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:53.280
have known before the carnage.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.140
And what I found is that often
the defensive income statement

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.520
told you that the company
had poor earnings quality

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.690
and you should go on high alert.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.710
And often it was the
enterprising income statement.

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.360
And then sometimes it was both
alternate income statements

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.072
as we see with Enron.

00:26:12.072 --> 00:26:12.988
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:15.525 --> 00:26:17.900
HEWITT HEISERMAN: I didn't do
an academic study for that.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:21.390
But what I did do
is, I just-- I would

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:25.960
say about probably 80%,
85% of the companies

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.567
that I looked at that ran
into financial difficulty, one

00:26:30.567 --> 00:26:32.400
or both of these alternate
income statements

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.400
told you something was wrong.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.620
And you made a case with
some of these companies that

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.850
go bankrupt-- you may not
expect that they go bankrupt,

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:43.170
but it gives you
a starting point

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.970
to say, OK, what's the
relationship between capital

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:48.201
spending and depreciation.

00:26:48.201 --> 00:26:50.769
Or if working capital
is a problem, why

00:26:50.769 --> 00:26:52.060
are their receivables going up?

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.780
Or why is their
inventory going up?

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:57.700
If their inventory is going
up, maybe consumer preferences

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.980
have changed, and
maybe consumers

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.090
are moving on to generation
five and they no longer

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.510
want generation
four which is all

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:10.800
that company may have to offer.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.606
So it's really a starting point
for further investigation.

00:27:13.606 --> 00:27:14.522
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.736
HEWITT HEISERMAN: Yep.

00:27:19.736 --> 00:27:20.652
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.940
HEWITT HEISERMAN: That's
a very good ratio to use,

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.240
and that's faster than
building an earnings power

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.720
chart, because that
information is available,

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.880
I think at Old School
Value, for example,

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.250
which is an excellent website
if you're a do it yourself

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:46.045
investor.

00:27:46.045 --> 00:27:49.420
To answer your
question, I did not

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:52.470
look at these companies in
terms of their Altman score

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.125
because I was trying to learn--

00:27:54.125 --> 00:27:55.041
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.270
HEWITT HEISERMAN: Right.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:13.310
Although the Z-score
may have picked up--

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:16.250
there's another ratio,
the accrual ratio.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.680
And the accrual ratio may have
picked up similar problems.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.070
But the reason why I like seeing
the three income statements

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:25.000
side by side, because you can
just go through each expense,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.886
and you look for something
that's out of the ordinary.

00:28:29.886 --> 00:28:31.510
And then you can take
that information,

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:33.135
you can take like
their investment rate

00:28:33.135 --> 00:28:35.050
in fixed capital and
you can compare it

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:36.920
to the industry average.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.630
So it's really like
a jumping off point

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:43.240
for to do further research if
you see something that's wrong.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.320
OK.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.220
Enough of failure.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:47.870
Let's look at success.

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.590
Here is Microsoft
during the 1990s.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:54.600
Remember, this company
turned a hypothetical $10,000

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.120
into a million dollars.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.830
This is what we call--
to use Peter Lynch's

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:02.790
description, a 100 bagger.

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:05.510
What we see here--
I see three things.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:09.240
Number one, the company
is in the upper right box,

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.630
so it has high quality earnings.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.920
Number two, it's moving
every year in an upper right

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.520
direction.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.840
So I call this an
earnings power staircase.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.640
This is a sign of
profitable growth.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.930
Not only is the company getting
bigger but it's getting better.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.670
And then third, a
couple of these years,

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:29.680
look at the rate of change
from one year-- look at '97

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.660
to '98 and then '98 to '99.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.810
It's just explosive growth.

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.004
And this is what
Wall Street loves.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:41.997
There is a great book Chris
Mayer called, "100 Baggers."

00:29:41.997 --> 00:29:44.330
If you want to learn more
about these kinds of companies

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:45.550
I highly recommend this book.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.630
It came out last fall.

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:53.890
We're now going to look at other
companies that had earnings

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:55.500
power staircase-like patterns.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.890
And we're just going to go
through this kind of fast.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.010
But I just want
you to appreciate

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:04.430
that positive trajectory
in high quality earnings.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:07.910
[INAUDIBLE] turned
$10,000 into $44,000.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:11.410
First Cash Financial,
$10,000 into $86,000.

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:14.170
Apollo Group, $10
grand into $78,000.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:17.640
Dell Computer, $10
grand into $1.3 million.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.982
Cisco Systems, $10
grand into $631,000.

00:30:20.982 --> 00:30:24.490
Paychex, $10,000 into $257,000.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.540
Quality systems,
$10,000 into of $70,000.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.650
Hansen Natural, $10,000
into $2.6 million.

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:34.880
Chico's FAS $10,000
into $73,000.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.620
Monster Beverage,
$10,000 into $61,000.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.520
Monster's interesting
because this

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.770
is the best performing
stock of the last 20 years.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:49.050
A hypothetical $10000
investment grew to $10 million.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:52.530
We're going to turn this
presentation into a book,

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:57.420
and I'll have much more to
say about Monster in the book.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:01.030
So if your thesis is growth,
if you're a growth investor,

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:03.970
I want you to focus on companies
that are in the upper right box

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.060
and that are moving in an upward
right direction every year,

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.040
forging what I call an
earnings power staircase.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.380
These are the companies
that have profitable growth.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:20.300
And the next step is,
in our checklist here

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.750
is competitive advantage.

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.980
If a company is
forging a staircase,

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.690
it probably has a
competitive advantage.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:28.440
There are five types.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.660
If you saw Pat
Dorsey's presentation

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.580
here about a year
ago-- Pat is the expert

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.490
on competitive advantage.

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:38.845
When he was with Morning
Star he and his staff teased

00:31:38.845 --> 00:31:40.220
out four competitive
advantages--

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.150
low cost, provider
high switching costs,

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:47.770
intangibles like brands and
patents and that sort of thing,

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:52.500
and then network effect,
the telephone, Facebook,

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.760
that sort of thing.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.170
And then I add to
that list, ecosystems.

00:31:57.170 --> 00:32:01.390
So if you make a
gadget, and the gadget

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:03.610
can talk to another
gadget that's

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.200
made by the same
company, then you

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.770
can transfer all that data go
as new versions of the gadget

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:10.475
come out.

00:32:10.475 --> 00:32:12.110
That to me is an ecosystem.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:13.960
With a network effect,
the more people

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.730
you have, the more
valuable the network.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:17.800
But in theory, in an
ecosystem, you really

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.150
only need one customer.

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:23.120
Warren Buffet describes
a competitive advantage

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.680
as a moat.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:30.510
And I bet that Larry
and Sergey and Eric

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:34.500
probably spend most of their
time thinking about this issue.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.310
The castle is
Alphabet, and the moat

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:42.200
is whatever you guys,
men and women can come up

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:46.280
with that prevents the
competition from taking

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.270
your business.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:51.062
Warren Buffett
says that if there

00:32:51.062 --> 00:32:53.020
are alligators in the
moat, that's even better.

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.680
We're not going to talk
about competitive advantage

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.320
except to say that if you
determine that a company has

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.440
a competitive advantage,
and it probably

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.870
does if it's
forging a staircase,

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:12.070
then you want to think
about the drivers that

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:15.730
affect intrinsic value.

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:18.670
Companies that have a
competitive advantage,

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:20.880
they're more valuable
than companies that don't

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.110
have a competitive advantage.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:25.480
If you sell a
commodity, you really

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.020
don't have any pricing power.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.310
People will go buy your
product from someone else

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:32.890
if they can get a better deal.

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:37.940
Intrinsic value
is our third step.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:42.480
That's what the fair
worth of the business is.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.850
Morningstar-- they do
a lot of great work

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:49.865
with estimating companies
intrinsic value.

00:33:49.865 --> 00:33:55.870
They project that the business--
Alphabet's worth $755 a share.

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:59.230
The stock price as of
last week was $682.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:03.070
So the price to
intrinsic value is 90%.

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:06.700
If you buy Alphabet stock
today, you're paying $0.90 cents

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.790
for a dollar's worth of value.

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:12.110
If you knew that,
for whatever reason,

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:16.710
the price intrinsic value
was going to go down to 75%,

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:18.460
then you would wait
because then you'd

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.441
get even more value
for your money.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:27.920
Professor [INAUDIBLE]
spoke to your group.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.530
And if you want to learn
more about valuation,

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:35.300
check out his presentation
which is excellent.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:39.909
It's getting harder to estimate
a company's intrinsic value

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:42.035
because if you have
to make assumptions

00:34:42.035 --> 00:34:43.909
about how long the
business is going to last.

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:48.550
And as this research shows,
in five years from today,

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:51.735
32% of US public companies
will be out of business.

00:34:51.735 --> 00:34:53.610
They'll be either acquired
by other companies

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:55.190
or they'll just go bankrupt.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:57.560
Versus 50 years
ago, it was only 5%.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.390
So the rate of change
is accelerating,

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:03.810
and for better or
for worse, Alphabet

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.145
is one of the prime disruptors.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.960
One item I want to point out
that is something to watch

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:21.750
is that your incremental
capital is trending down.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:25.690
You're making bets that are
outside your core business.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:27.600
Hopefully those bets
will pay off and then

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.890
that trend will reverse.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:30.780
This will be something to watch.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.870
To learn more about
intrinsic value

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.490
there's a great resource,
Valuentum Securities

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:38.090
which I subscribe to
and I highly recommend.

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:40.490
And I mentioned earlier,
Old School Value

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:41.790
which I also subscribe to.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:47.645
They give you 10 years worth
of financial statements.

00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:50.020
Just type in the symbol and
the information's right there

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.121
and they have a lot of
pre-programmed valuation

00:35:52.121 --> 00:35:52.620
models.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.200
So you don't have to build
the thing from scratch

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.180
and spend a couple
of weeks doing that.

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.557
All the information's
right at your fingertips.

00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:01.140
Now I mentioned that
Ben Graham-- yes.

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.515
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:03.515 --> 00:36:04.940
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, he will be.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:05.900
HEWITT HEISERMAN: Yep.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:12.150
I've mentioned that Ben was
affected by the depression.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:15.800
And so he took a hard money
approach to buying stocks.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.770
So his method was
what he called--

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:22.390
this is after he figured
out a new approach.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:24.610
He would buy companies
that were selling at 2/3

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:27.750
of their net working capital.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:36.306
So taking your balance sheet
from December 31, 2015.

00:36:36.306 --> 00:36:39.670
He gave 100% for your cash.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:41.580
He'd give you a 75%
for your receivables.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.750
You don't have any inventory.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:45.877
And then he'd subtract
all your liabilities.

00:36:45.877 --> 00:36:47.710
And then he'd take your
net working capital,

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:52.000
he'd multiply that
by 66% of that.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.060
And then that would
leave you $36 billion.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.425
He would pay $36 billion
for the business.

00:36:56.425 --> 00:37:01.580
You've got 745 million shares
outstanding, so he'd paid $45.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:05.040
Is that right? $48 for Google.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:05.540
All right.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.300
That's what he would buy it for.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:08.930
All right.

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:13.040
Now we're at step
four, position sizing.

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.200
Position sizing is
simply, what percentage

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.710
of your portfolio
or your capital

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:19.300
are you going to put
into any single position?

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.686
Now it stands to reason
that if you have an edge,

00:37:22.686 --> 00:37:23.810
then you should exploit it.

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:28.490
And this is what Warren Buffett
did after the famous salad oil

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.790
scandal in 1963.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:35.040
It knocked shares of
American Express down.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.090
Mr. Buffet determined that
American Express' franchise was

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:46.010
intact, and he put 40%
of the partnerships funds

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:49.056
into American Express and
it then went up five-fold

00:37:49.056 --> 00:37:51.640
in five years.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.860
You really have to be
honest with yourself

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.010
though in terms of whether
or not you have an edge.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:38:02.740
There are four types--
information, analytic,

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:07.430
behavioral, and structural.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:10.030
You also want to
ask yourself, what's

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:14.130
the consequence if I
am wrong, and can I

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:16.910
afford that consequence?

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:19.182
My advice is, if you
don't have an edge,

00:38:19.182 --> 00:38:21.390
you start small, especially
with these growth

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:26.300
companies because we see how
core the subsequent investment

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.440
returns are.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.097
And then build your
position over time

00:38:29.097 --> 00:38:30.680
as you get to know
the company better.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.335
You may get a better entry
point in terms of price

00:38:33.335 --> 00:38:36.000
to intrinsic value.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.030
And absolutely positively
have a sell strategy,

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:42.440
which is something we'll
cover here in a short moment.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.780
For men especially,
you've got to guard

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.410
against overconfidence.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:50.000
And there are people that have
gotten PhD's on this topic.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.020
I'm not going to talk
about it at length.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.450
You can look into
it if you want.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:56.860
But Curt Schilling--
we live in Boston.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.310
Curt Schilling of the
famous bloody sock,

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:04.430
retired, he was into games and
started a business, 38 Studios.

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:07.920
He put his entire $50 million
net worth into the business,

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.850
and then business went bankrupt.

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:14.300
Other examples of overconfidence
include the Hunt brothers

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:18.500
with silver in the 1970s
and then long-term capital

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.600
management.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.150
I had my own
overconfidence story.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:28.150
I invested in China
Media Express in 2011.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:33.460
It seemingly passed the
three checklist items

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.920
that we've just
discussed-- high quality

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.970
earnings, competitive
advantage, and it was cheap.

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:41.860
It was selling at eight times
earnings, had $200 million

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:47.856
of cash, no debt, audited
financials by Deloitte.

00:39:47.856 --> 00:39:50.630
Hank Greenberg,
who had built AIG

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:52.780
into one the preeminent
insurance companies,

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:56.630
he had put $80 million
into China Media Express.

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:59.500
And one of his colleagues
was on the board.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.730
But, alas, China Media
Express was a fraud.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:04.226
There was no $200 million.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:11.120
So after the grieving
process was over,

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.150
I determined that I was going
to turn lemons into lemonade.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:17.820
And I did a post-mortem
or in this case

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.120
an autopsy of what I
did wrong and identified

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:26.670
three errors, two of which
we're going to get to shortly.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.050
And I realized that I never
wanted to be in a position

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:32.410
where I was down
25% on a portfolio.

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:37.490
So this leads to position size.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:43.930
There is a study by Dr.
Van Tharp of people--

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:48.130
that they all get a
hypothetical $100,000.

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:50.115
They all get the same trades.

00:40:50.115 --> 00:40:52.950
The same number
of winning stocks,

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.470
the same number
of losing stocks,

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:58.720
both in terms of
frequency and magnitude.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.950
And yet, 50 simulated
trades later,

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:09.220
the ending balance of capital
ranges from completely

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.878
wipe out to $13 million.

00:41:11.878 --> 00:41:15.500
And Dr. Thorpe says the reason
for this is position sizing

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:19.355
and in psychology.

00:41:19.355 --> 00:41:21.480
So if you want to learn
more about position sizing,

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.900
I recommend this book.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.750
This brings us to
step five, sell.

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:30.030
What's your exit strategy?

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:34.590
Before China Media Express, my
exit strategy was qualitative.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:36.930
Position size gets
too big, maybe I

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:41.090
thought that the intrinsic value
of the company was declining,

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.317
maybe I thought I had a
better idea elsewhere.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.410
Since China Media Express,
I realize that I've

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:53.200
got behavioral limits.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:58.965
And so I wanted to introduce
some objective criteria

00:41:58.965 --> 00:42:03.610
so I never turned small
loss into a big loss.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:06.420
And so I'm going to go
through these items right now.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.070
The first thing
I want to mention

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:09.550
is that selling is hard.

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:13.330
You've probably heard
this famous quotation

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.940
by Vince Lombardi.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:18.080
Just put it into human
terms-- when you're a kid

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.370
and your mother was reading to
you when you were in your bed,

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:25.040
did your mom ever read to you
stories about great losers?

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.100
Or when you go into
the park, do you ever

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.060
see a statue of a great loser?

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:29.990
No.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:32.290
We weren't wired
to be great losers.

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:37.260
And yet, as investors,
that costs us money.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.250
So what I devised are
these safety switches.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:42.120
And a safety switch
is simply-- it's

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.770
a button that if you see
the machinery breaking down,

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:49.140
you just hit that button
and the machinery turns off.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.940
And this way you
stop the problem

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.500
before it gets even worse.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.790
So I'm going to go over
four safety switches.

00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:00.770
The first is a simple one.

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:04.240
Before you buy a
company, you determine,

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.120
what's the maximum
percentage decline

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.570
that you're willing to
let the stock go down?

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:10.320
Maybe it's 20%.

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.750
So if the stock then goes
down 21%, then you sell.

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.510
No ands ifs or buts.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.570
I can't tell you what
the correct percentage

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:20.560
decline is, because
that's like me telling you

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.000
who you should date.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.145
But, William O'Neil of
Investors Business Daily

00:43:26.145 --> 00:43:30.050
who's an outstanding
investor-- he's

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:32.300
also written several books.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:36.560
His rule of thumb is if a
position declines 7% to 8%

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.460
from its purchase
price, he sells.

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:43.150
If that's too rigorous, too
quick on the trigger for you,

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:46.750
maybe you something where
you sell 50% of your position

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:50.510
if it goes down 10%,
and the other 50% if it

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:53.080
the decline is 25%.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.500
But you've got to have
this in writing before you

00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:00.310
buy the stock because
once you own that stock,

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:02.840
you get all these
emotional bias kicking in.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.880
There's a study
about coffee mugs.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:11.910
A Nobel Prize was won by
Daniel Kahneman over the notion

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:15.980
that we'll pay $3
for a coffee mug

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:20.440
but we won't sell it unless
you offer us about $7.

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.710
That just doesn't make
any sense rationally.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:25.040
But it gives you an idea
of some of these challenges

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.880
that we have at selling.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.840
I want to point out
that sometimes you

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.550
may not be able to get a bid
if you're trying to sell.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:34.390
You may say, all right, I'm
going to sell at 7% to 8%

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:38.320
or I'm going to sell
50% if I'm down 10%.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:44.510
In this LinkedIn, in one
day last week it fell 35%.

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:47.310
You're not going to be
able to get in until you

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:50.520
get that 35% lower number.

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.590
So this is why position
sizing is important.

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:56.220
You've go to get that
position size correct,

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.529
even before you own the stock.

00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:00.570
Now, Warren Buffett has
said his favorite holding

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:01.620
period is forever.

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:07.140
And that is true if you buy
and hold the right company.

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.444
If you buy and hold
a Microsoft or some

00:45:09.444 --> 00:45:10.485
of these other companies.

00:45:10.485 --> 00:45:13.170
But if you buy and
hold the wrong company,

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:15.044
then you could get wiped out.

00:45:15.044 --> 00:45:17.210
I want to show you a chart
of a couple of companies.

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:20.000
Uranium Resources--
this company would've

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.315
turned a hypothetical
$10,000 into $17.

00:45:24.315 --> 00:45:28.400
That's a 99.84% decline.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:32.136
And Arch Coal, this would have
turned a hypothetical $10,000

00:45:32.136 --> 00:45:35.810
into $2.81.

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:38.280
If you don't have
a safety switch,

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.330
you could ride one of
these things to zero.

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:44.400
And you get into this
point where I'm 25%,

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.631
you may even double down.

00:45:45.631 --> 00:45:54.000
That is-- you can blow up
your portfolio quickly.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.970
The second safety switch
is what I call the 1% rule.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:01.510
So let's say you have a
hypothetical $100,000 portfolio

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:06.660
and you say, I willing to
lose a maximum of $1,000

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.350
on any position.

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:10.570
And so you can come up
with different scenarios

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:12.720
depending upon
how much you think

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.930
you might lose on
a percentage basis

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:18.280
before that stock then goes
up to its intrinsic value.

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.830
And the idea here is--
these are four scenarios.

00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:25.510
A utility has historically
been a low volatility stock.

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:28.070
And then the highest
volatility stocks

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:29.750
would be companies
that are pre-revenue.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:33.680
So you can use this approach to
think about what your position

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.145
sizing should be.

00:46:35.145 --> 00:46:36.770
And the great thing
about this approach

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:41.820
is if you use the 1% rule, you
can have 10 successive losers

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:44.710
and you still have
90% of your capital.

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:47.130
So that's a discipline
repeatable and explainable

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:49.410
process that will protect you.

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:53.090
The third safety switch is
what I call reward to risk.

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:56.900
So let's say that
the stock's $50

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:58.680
and you think it's worth $65.

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.950
So your upside-- you're
expected profit is $15.

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:05.090
Now the smart money
says, have a reward

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:07.120
to risk ratio of at least three.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.650
That's investing
probabilistically.

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:12.960
That means you're going
to bet $1 to make $3.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.525
You don't want to
bet a $1 to make $2

00:47:14.525 --> 00:47:16.830
or bet a $1 to make a $1.

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:18.920
That doesn't make sense.

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:26.860
So if then you buy the
stock and it goes up to $65,

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.880
you've made three
times your bet.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.710
So congratulations.

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:33.770
Let's say you hang on and
it keeps going up to $75.

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:35.290
Now you've made
five times your bet.

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:37.760
That's even better.

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:41.340
However, let's say the
stock goes down to $45.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.900
Well, you've bet
$5, you've lost $5.

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:46.150
So now you're minus one.

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:51.352
My recommendation is
this is where you sell.

00:47:51.352 --> 00:47:53.850
If you're going to have a
stock that's losing money,

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:55.710
you never want to lose
more than your bet.

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:59.000
So this is the demarcation.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.970
If however, you're too
stubborn and you're not

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:07.590
able to sell when the stock goes
down $10, now you're down two.

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:11.830
And then if you're hanging
on and it goes down to $25,

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:14.690
now you're at minus five.

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:16.090
So all I can say,
if you're going

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:19.210
to invest in a-- if
you have a stock that's

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:23.710
going down sell it a minus one.

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:26.160
Our fourth safety switch,
price-moving average-- now

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:31.180
this is an from Paul
Tudor Jones, billionaire

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:34.300
hedge fund manager and the
founder of the Robin Hood

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:38.680
Foundation which is created
to help children at risk.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:42.550
And he has managed money
since the late 80s.

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:44.820
And I think his
record is-- I think

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:48.510
every year he's made money.

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:50.400
My metric for
everything I look at it

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.430
is the 200-day moving
average at closing prices.

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:57.470
I assume too many things go to
zero-- stocks and commodities.

00:48:57.470 --> 00:49:00.170
This quotation is from Tony
Robbins' book [INAUDIBLE],

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:03.760
"Master the Game," which just
came out which is fantastic.

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:07.300
So we're going to start
looking at some companies using

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.300
this 200-day moving average.

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.272
Now, you don't even have to
use the earnings power chart

00:49:12.272 --> 00:49:13.480
or some of the other methods.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:15.800
You can just go to
StockCharts.com.

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:19.360
I think it's $15 dollars a
month for a subscription.

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.860
We'll start with
the bond market.

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:22.276
This is the corporate
bond market.

00:49:22.276 --> 00:49:24.490
So if you're buying
a company's debt--

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:28.390
you can see that an
index of corporate debt,

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:34.680
the red-black line, that's
daily closing prices.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.790
And that is $22.68.

00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:39.320
This is a Vanguard index fund.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:44.000
And then the average of the last
200 days of closing prices is

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.830
$22.50-- $22.60.

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:52.290
So on this basis,
Paul Tudor Jones--

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:53.930
I don't want to put
words in his mouth,

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:55.325
but my interpretation
is he would

00:49:55.325 --> 00:49:57.510
be bullish on corporate bonds.

00:49:57.510 --> 00:50:01.060
In contrast, we'll
look at stocks.

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:04.072
This is Vanguard's total
stock market index fund.

00:50:04.072 --> 00:50:07.980
The 200-day moving
average is $50.60.

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:12.925
And then Friday's
close was $45.92.

00:50:12.925 --> 00:50:15.790
So this means we're
in bear territory.

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:18.450
You never know how--
this is, you never

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:20.940
know how high a stock is
going to go or an index.

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:24.054
You never know how long
an index is going to go.

00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:25.970
So this is an important
background information

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:28.300
because if you're thinking
of buying a company's stock,

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.630
75% of stocks are going to
go in the same direction

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:33.320
as the overall market.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.080
So if you're thinking
about position sizing,

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:41.360
maybe you hold back that
position size in some way,

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:45.300
because we are in bear market
territory right now using

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:46.690
this approach.

00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:50.580
Here's Microsoft's stock price
versus 200-day moving average

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:52.260
during the 1990s.

00:50:52.260 --> 00:51:00.170
You can see that for
most of the time--

00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:02.620
most of the time the blue
line, the moving average

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.880
was like a support level.

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:09.230
There were a couple of
times when the price went

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:11.070
below the 200-day
moving average,

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:13.700
but by and large
the closing price

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:17.090
was always above the
200-day moving average.

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:21.880
So by and large this
is a bullish trend.

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:26.330
In the 2000s you probably
know that Microsoft

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:29.640
ran into-- got disoriented.

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:37.130
We can see that there was
a 50% decline in 2000.

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:39.470
This is a 50% decline
after Microsoft

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:42.190
went under its 200-day
moving average.

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:46.270
So if this approach to
investing appeals to you,

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:49.490
you would have gotten out
before that 50% decline

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:51.695
if you apply these
methods rigorously.

00:51:51.695 --> 00:51:55.480
And then in 2008 when we had
the global credit crisis.

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:58.740
Here again, Microsoft's
stock went down 50%

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:02.151
after the closing price went
below the 200-day moving

00:52:02.151 --> 00:52:02.650
average.

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:07.190
So you had time to get out
if you were paying attention.

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:09.260
You're probably asking,
what about Alphabet?

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:13.570
Well, you're 6% above the
200-day moving average.

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:18.800
So this is a positive sign if
you're using this approach.

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:21.790
Interactive Brokers
is a stock that I own,

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:24.002
but I sold after
I noticed that it

00:52:24.002 --> 00:52:25.770
went below its 200-day
moving average.

00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:30.770
And you can see that
it then fell 24%.

00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:33.930
Before China Media Express,
I would not have sold.

00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:36.825
And then I would be in this
quandary, where, what do I do?

00:52:36.825 --> 00:52:40.620
I never want to be in
that quandary again.

00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:43.070
Deutsche Bank is down 45%.

00:52:45.618 --> 00:52:48.330
It fell below its
200-day moving average.

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.270
And this an important
bank to watch

00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:55.204
because as Deutsche Bank goes,
I think Europe will go too.

00:52:55.204 --> 00:52:58.844
They've got $70
trillion of derivatives.

00:52:58.844 --> 00:53:03.660
And if you own the bank, this
would have been a sell signal.

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:07.830
You're probably aware that
oil prices have gone down.

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:12.900
Oil is now 70% below its
200-day moving average.

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:19.040
So you if you had sold in
August of 2014 at about $100,

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.620
congratulations.

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:23.440
The last price is about $31.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.740
So you don't know how low
these prices are going to go.

00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:30.470
But you just know that either
you reduce your position size

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:35.720
or you introduce a hedge element
or take other action that

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:39.360
protects your wealth.

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:45.390
Horsehead Holding is down
99.48% in less than one year.

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:48.752
Look how violently some of
these companies can collapse.

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:57.800
Linn Energy, down 99% since it
went below its 200-day moving

00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:58.930
average.

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:01.755
Now, probably some of
you are math majors.

00:54:01.755 --> 00:54:04.160
So check this out.

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:07.020
After Linn went below its
200-day moving average

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:09.910
it fell 50% to $14.

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:13.540
And you may think, it
fell 50%, now it's cheap.

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:17.280
Well then it fell
another 50% to $7.

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.230
Now it's really cheap.

00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:20.790
And then it fell to $3.50.

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:23.000
And now you're thinking,
where's the truck?

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.730
I'm going to back up the truck.

00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:28.600
And then it fell
another 50% to $1.75.

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:35.400
And then it fell
another 70% to $0.37.

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:40.871
The more you lose, the
harder it is to recover.

00:54:40.871 --> 00:54:44.050
If you're down 10%, you only
need 11% to get back up.

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:46.590
If you're down
25%, you need 33%.

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:49.120
You're down 50%,
now you need 100%.

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.550
So that's a one bagger.

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:55.293
Now check out how asymmetric
the math gets here.

00:54:55.293 --> 00:54:58.400
If you're down 75% you
need a 300% return.

00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.545
That's a three-bagger.

00:54:59.545 --> 00:55:03.125
Down 90%, you need
a 900% return.

00:55:03.125 --> 00:55:06.736
Down 99%, 9,900%.

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:10.190
Now in my case, I was down 100%.

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:14.360
So I get this number
sign division number.

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.300
And that just means,
you know, really bad.

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:24.070
So the key point I want to give
you is, if the ship is sinking

00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:26.470
you got to get off.

00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:29.110
And if you have trouble
selling, there's

00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:30.730
this great book
that just came out

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:33.420
called, "The Art of Execution,"
by Lee Freeman-Shor.

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:34.560
It came out last fall.

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.740
I read it in one night.

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:37.730
It's terrific.

00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:41.450
There are five personality
approaches he identifies.

00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:43.290
Read the book and see
what personality type

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:47.904
you are and maybe you can
improve your decision-making.

00:55:47.904 --> 00:55:48.780
All right.

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:53.410
Here at the Googleplex you
have at least 30 cafes,

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:54.910
including Cafe BADALL.

00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:58.090
So this is the sign that
we're about to wrap things up.

00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:02.480
So, what I suggest is that you
do a self-assessment of what

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.270
investment grade you are.

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:08.600
If you focus on the stock
price, then you are a beginner.

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:11.549
If you focus on an earnings
quality, which I hope you do.

00:56:11.549 --> 00:56:13.090
If you used the
earnings power chart,

00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:15.420
then you're an
intermediate investor.

00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.540
If you're focusing
on valuation-- price

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:21.480
to intrinsic value, value
drivers, competitive advantage,

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.620
then you're an
advanced investor.

00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:27.130
And if you're focusing things
only position size and reward

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:32.730
to risk, exit strategies, then
you're an expert investor.

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:35.760
So there are two actions
that I recommend.

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.390
You can do these today,
do these tonight.

00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:40.630
The first is, define
your strategy.

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:42.920
It should have three part.

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:45.590
What kind of companies
are you looking to buy?

00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:47.644
What things are you
going to think about

00:56:47.644 --> 00:56:48.810
while you own that business?

00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:50.180
In other words, how are
you going to keep up

00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:51.320
to date with the moves.

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:56.470
And then, what are the exit
strategies for you to sell?

00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:59.056
Put this in writing,
because if you

00:56:59.056 --> 00:57:00.680
don't put it in
writing then you really

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:02.630
don't have an exit strategy.

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:04.370
You don't have an
investment strategy.

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:06.590
The second thing
I mentioned to do

00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:07.960
is create an investment journal.

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.850
So if open up
Google Docs, Excel,

00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:12.480
and every time
you buy a stock, I

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:15.366
want you to put in the
company's name, the symbol,

00:57:15.366 --> 00:57:18.510
the number of shares you
buy and the purchase price.

00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:22.360
I want you put in your estimate
of the intrinsic value.

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:25.820
And then I want you put in-- you
can have a formula that tells

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:28.310
you the reward to risk ratio.

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:31.650
It should be at
least, what, three.

00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:32.340
OK.

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:36.632
Paul Tudor Jones, do you
know what he looks for?

00:57:36.632 --> 00:57:37.504
Five.

00:57:37.504 --> 00:57:41.900
So if you want be a
billionaire, look for fives.

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:46.420
And then when it comes to
time to sell your position,

00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:50.500
make a couple of
other data entries--

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:54.850
the sell price, the date,
what your thesis is.

00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:57.430
Maybe the company broke
the 200-day moving average.

00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:00.950
Maybe the thesis is not as
attractive as-- whatever

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:05.180
the reason is, just make a
note of that information.

00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:09.200
Then you can compare your
actual reward to risk ratio

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.155
to your expected reward ratio.

00:58:11.155 --> 00:58:16.700
And if you notice that there are
too many negative-- you know,

00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:21.630
minus 1.5, minus 1.2,
minus-- excuse me, minus one,

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:23.810
minus two, minus
threes, then you

00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:28.730
need to rethink your approach.

00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:30.780
If I had to sum up
everything, the one thing

00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:32.960
that I want you to remember--
you [INAUDIBLE] forget

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:38.050
everything else that I said
is, do not turn a small loss

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:39.890
into a big loss.

00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:44.810
And with that, I want
to thank you very much.

00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:47.237
It's been exciting to come
here and think about what

00:58:47.237 --> 00:58:48.320
I was going to say to you.

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:52.175
My father-in-law, Carl
Peterson is an engineer.

00:58:52.175 --> 00:58:55.710
He was a professor at MIT
of mechanical engineering.

00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:59.400
Probably most of you are
electrical engineers.

00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:04.475
This is my first presentation
to a non-finance group.

00:59:04.475 --> 00:59:08.950
So if you have any questions I'm
happy to take them, and if not,

00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:09.885
thanks again.

00:59:09.885 --> 00:59:11.865
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:59:11.865 --> 00:59:14.835
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:29.200
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so, I had
two questions actually.

00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.830
This is all very interesting.

00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:35.260
So the one question is if both
valuing approaches are so good,

00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:36.620
why don't you combine them?

00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:38.890
Have you tried looking
at them together?

00:59:38.890 --> 00:59:40.580
Subtracting all of
them-- that would

00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:43.650
lower even-- that would
increase the gap to gap.

00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:44.929
But maybe that's a good thing.

00:59:44.929 --> 00:59:46.220
And then a second question is--

00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:47.928
HEWITT HEISERMAN: Let
me take that first.

00:59:47.928 --> 00:59:49.830
And let me throw the
question back at you.

00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:52.364
Why didn't you think we want
one alternate income statement?

00:59:55.201 --> 00:59:56.576
And let's start
with investment--

00:59:56.576 --> 00:59:57.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:58.886
HEWITT HEISERMAN:
Well let's start

00:59:58.886 --> 01:00:01.820
with investment
in fixed capital.

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:03.940
And I always think
about this like you've

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:07.110
got a commercial banker
and a venture capitalist

01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:10.700
sitting across the
desk from each other.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:12.870
And they're arguing
each of these four

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:16.504
structural limitations the
GAAP income statement has.

01:00:16.504 --> 01:00:19.050
The commercial banker's
going to say, look,

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:21.775
there are studies that say
that more capital intensive

01:00:21.775 --> 01:00:25.775
the business, the more likely
it is that that company is going

01:00:25.775 --> 01:00:26.400
to go bankrupt.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.940
Now I excluded them
from this presentation

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:33.550
in the interests of time, but
the studies are out there.

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:38.130
So the reason that the
defensive investor wants to look

01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:43.230
at capital spending is
because-- especially if you know

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:45.580
the business, he
may want to say, OK,

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:49.750
why is Alphabet's-- what are
they spending their money on?

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:54.130
Is it to maintain-- you
get 100% of your profits

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:56.260
from search, right.

01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.700
From what I read, almost 100%.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.000
So I want to know, if I'm
an analyst, how much of that

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.110
capex is going to search.

01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:09.030
And then how much is
it going to your bets.

01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:12.450
I know that you know search.

01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:15.750
But I may not have the
same degree of confidence

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:21.200
that you know medicine
or space or some

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.770
of these other initiatives
that you're working on.

01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:29.120
So I may want to take a more
conservative approach when

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.410
I'm tracking your uses of cash.

01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:34.410
Now the venture capitalist,
he's going to say,

01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:36.180
they've got a
great track record.

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:37.840
I've worked with
them for 10 years.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:40.190
The owners own a large
slug of the business.

01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:43.290
I have total confidence in
how those investments are

01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:45.844
going to work out.

01:01:45.844 --> 01:01:47.260
When you're working
with companies

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:52.490
that are not of your caliber,
this is a very important item

01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:53.520
to look at.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:57.460
If you're dealing a retailer
for example, and they

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.010
make sweaters.

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:02.060
And you notice
that their inventor

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.144
is piling up at Christmas.

01:02:03.144 --> 01:02:05.226
Well you know they're going
to have a bad quarter,

01:02:05.226 --> 01:02:06.900
because if they can't
sell at Christmas,

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:08.900
they're not going to be
selling the first quart.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.846
Christmas is the selling season.

01:02:11.846 --> 01:02:17.640
So it's a way of diving into a
company's financial statements

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:23.128
with maybe a more informed
view of the business.

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:29.160
I'll give you one more--
stockholder's equity.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:34.590
A company is not obligated to
pay the stockholders any fixed

01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:35.730
rate of return.

01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:39.762
When you buy a company's stock,
you don't sign a contract

01:02:39.762 --> 01:02:41.450
with the business.

01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:43.770
However, when that company
borrows money from a bank,

01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:47.130
there is a contract saying
that the borrower is

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:51.565
going to pay live worth
plus 100 basis points.

01:02:51.565 --> 01:02:55.190
And the lender is going to
put a lien on the assets.

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:59.760
That doesn't happen in
the enterprising mindset.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.670
So there are two
different mindsets here.

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:04.445
And what I want to do is I
want to almost like hear it

01:03:04.445 --> 01:03:05.860
in stereo.

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:09.800
You know, that's just
better music than mono.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.431
You had another question?

01:03:12.431 --> 01:03:12.930
OK.

01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:13.880
We'll come back.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.800
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for the talk.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.060
HEWITT HEISERMAN: Thank you.

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.410
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about that the last part

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:19.870
on selling.

01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:22.230
In one of the older
letters, Buffett

01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:25.470
had give an example of
the Washington Post of how

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:30.050
the Washington Post
was worth $400 million

01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:33.890
and if it went down
50%, he would basically

01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:36.450
just buy more rather
than sell the stock

01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:40.230
because the intrinsic value of
the business has not changed.

01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:42.170
So obviously the
difference is in his case,

01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:45.710
he has an analytical edge, and
he understands the business

01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:47.890
and he knows that the
Washington Post is truly

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:50.990
worth $400 million
and he would not sell.

01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:54.060
In our case, I'm assuming,
what you're saying is,

01:03:54.060 --> 01:04:00.100
we have these kind
of objective rules,

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:02.830
because maybe our analytical
edge or understanding

01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:06.620
of the business is not as
strong as buffers Buffet's.

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:10.190
So my question is, why even
bother with picking stocks

01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:14.360
if our analytical edge is
not enough to protect us

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.500
from the volatility?

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:18.040
Why not just do
indexing and not bother?

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:22.280
Is there any
reason-- so, to me it

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.860
seems like it's
mutually exclusive.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.580
Either I understand the business
and I should be stock picking,

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.150
or I don't understand
the business

01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:31.020
and I should just be indexing.

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.670
Why do this half kind of a
thing where I don't quite

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:34.670
understand the business?

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:38.500
I have these rules and
yet be stock picking.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.000
HEWITT HEISERMAN:
Well to your point

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.530
about Mr. Buffett,
the Washington

01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:48.480
Post-- I think he said he
believed that the business was

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.300
worth about $400.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:54.350
And he was buying when
it was $80 million.

01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:55.300
Right.

01:04:55.300 --> 01:05:00.020
Now remember, he had an edge
because he owned Buffalo News.

01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:01.220
So he knew the business.

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.760
Plus I believe he
got a board seat.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.860
So not only did he have
information advantage

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:11.380
and behavioral damage
and analytic advantage,

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:15.000
but he could help influence
management's capital

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.530
allocation.

01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:20.305
Most of us don't have
that opportunity.

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:27.080
So to the question
about index funds,

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.090
that's what Mr.
[INAUDIBLE] would say.

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:32.350
He would say that you should
use low-cost index funds.

01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:34.990
But as he told me in a
conversation we had once,

01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:38.520
he said, most of us
have a little bit

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.940
of a gambling instinct.

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.400
If there's a company
that we like,

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:50.560
if we use their search function
25 times a day for 15 years,

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.360
we might think that
that business is

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.990
going to be around
for a while, and we

01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:56.850
want to participate
in the its success.

01:05:56.850 --> 01:05:58.370
But by the same
token, I'm not going

01:05:58.370 --> 01:06:01.470
to pretend that I know
the business intimately.

01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:10.600
So you want to just have
some protection in case

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.190
you misjudged the business.

01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:20.437
Now, those numbers that I gave
you, the 1% rule for example.

01:06:20.437 --> 01:06:21.520
That may not work for you.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:25.130
Maybe you want to use
2% or 3%, whatever

01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:26.800
it is, that's
something that you've

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.520
got to figure out for yourself.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.280
You may only want to buy
a couple of companies.

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:35.400
Most companies do not make
it the upper right box

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.190
in the earnings power chart.

01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:41.560
Very few forge that
earnings power staircase.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:44.870
AUDIENCE: And just a
clarifying question if you may.

01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:47.430
I guess my point
is, if we are not

01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:49.670
in the same position
as Buffett where

01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:53.970
we do have an analytical edge,
why even bother is my point?

01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:01.850
We are getting the benefit of
owning Alphabet by-- Alphabet

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:02.860
is part of the index.

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:04.234
And if it's going
to do well it's

01:07:04.234 --> 01:07:06.240
going to be a bigger
part of the index.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.130
So why bother anyway?

01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:10.980
HEWITT HEISERMAN: Well,
I find this business

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.950
to be the most interesting
business there is.

01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:15.660
There's something new every day.

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:20.325
You're thinking about, not only
things in a quantitative sense,

01:07:20.325 --> 01:07:24.720
in terms of earning quality,
but qualitative too--

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:27.710
competitive advantage,
landscape analysis, [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:29.090
five forces.

01:07:29.090 --> 01:07:32.240
To me it's a
intellectual challenge.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.340
And so I enjoy the process.

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:39.360
If someone doesn't
enjoy this type of work,

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.130
they should have their money
professionally managed.

01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:46.390
So if you have a business
that you drive by every day

01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:55.930
or that you deal with-- there's
a newspaper that you, whatever.

01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:58.550
You have some sort of
intimate personal relationship

01:07:58.550 --> 01:08:01.216
with a business and you think
you want to be an owner,

01:08:01.216 --> 01:08:02.590
I'm trying to give
you a strategy

01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:05.904
to help tilt the odds of
success in your favor.

01:08:09.808 --> 01:08:10.784
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:10.784 --> 01:08:12.740
HEWITT HEISERMAN: Thank you.

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:15.236
AUDIENCE: So my
question is-- it's

01:08:15.236 --> 01:08:17.069
going to look like it's
along the same lines

01:08:17.069 --> 01:08:19.950
but it's with a different focus.

01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:24.460
Buffett, when he was asked about
Berkshire and the price moving

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.979
up and down, I think in 2012
or '13 he said, you know,

01:08:26.979 --> 01:08:31.460
there are times when the price
to book varies from 1.2 to 4.

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.750
And he says-- I quote
him here, "unless you

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:36.890
can watch your stock
holdings decline by 50%

01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:38.640
without becoming
panic-stricken, you

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.500
should not be in
the stock market."

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.470
So it looks like it's
the same, but my question

01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:43.386
is actually different.

01:08:43.386 --> 01:08:45.500
Given the volatility
of stocks, if there's

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:50.747
anything like a 10% or 1% or
20% rule, does it make sense?

01:08:50.747 --> 01:08:52.830
Are you giving up the
opportunity of being fearful

01:08:52.830 --> 01:08:55.493
and others greedy and being
greedy when others are fearful?

01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:00.907
HEWITT HEISERMAN: Let's
go back to the 1%.

01:09:08.859 --> 01:09:12.029
Here are four scenarios.

01:09:12.029 --> 01:09:17.120
If you expect-- let's focus
on the micro-cap company.

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:24.200
In this scenario you're thinking
I can handle 35% decline.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:29.779
But then I think that it's
going to go up ten-fold

01:09:29.779 --> 01:09:34.750
because all your friends are
drinking the product, using

01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:35.710
the product.

01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:38.560
It's got its secular tailwind.

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:43.399
So you just figure out,
what's the most volatility

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:45.819
that I can live with.

01:09:45.819 --> 01:09:50.096
And then if you can think
about it in those terms,

01:09:50.096 --> 01:09:51.970
then you can figure out
your position sizing.

01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:56.020
So yeah, then the position
goes down 30%, no big deal

01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:59.780
because you still are
following your strategy.

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:05.540
Where if you want to
handle a 75% decline,

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:08.120
which sometimes
happens, then you've

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:11.490
got your position sizing
here so that you're covered.

01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:13.510
The point is that you
need a strategy in place

01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:15.017
before you buy the stock.

01:10:15.017 --> 01:10:16.600
Now, you mentioned
Berkshire Hathaway.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.270
And Berkshire lost 50%
of its market value

01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:25.230
four times since it went public.

01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:28.270
So even the bluest
of blue chips can

01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:30.690
suffer those kinds of decline.

01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:33.440
And the other thing
I want to point out

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.360
is, let's see you
misunderestimate

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.680
how far a company falls.

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:46.580
And you follow your strategy
and you sell your position.

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:49.240
You don't have to-- that
doesn't mean that you

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:51.150
can't buy that position back.

01:10:51.150 --> 01:10:54.966
What you could do is you say,
OK, I'll buy it back in--

01:10:54.966 --> 01:10:58.810
say I'll buy back
25% of my position

01:10:58.810 --> 01:11:01.774
after the next 10Q or
the next 10K is filed.

01:11:01.774 --> 01:11:03.315
And if there's a
smoking gun, if it's

01:11:03.315 --> 01:11:07.140
a company-specific
reason-- fraud,

01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:10.140
something else, some reason
that you don't know about,

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.030
but maybe leads
to your investors

01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:14.570
do and that's why the
price is declining,

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:17.020
well you wait until the
next SEC filing comes out

01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:19.830
and then you buy back your
position, starting say 25%

01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:21.940
a quarter for four
quarters, then

01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:24.240
you're back to your
original position.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:27.490
So you can have these
work-arounds and these apps

01:11:27.490 --> 01:11:30.110
to help you get back
into a position.

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:33.260
If you think you're
selling Microsoft in 1991

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.790
or Berkshire Hathaway in 1975.

01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:39.220
MALE SPEAKER: We have time
for one final question.

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.950
AUDIENCE: My question
is in a similar line,

01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:48.570
I want a clarification--
you say you

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:51.760
want to sell when it drops
below a certain percentage.

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.970
Nowadays the market even
fluctuates so much, right,

01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:55.410
based on given
news and something.

01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:56.826
A lot of people,
even pundits have

01:11:56.826 --> 01:11:59.217
said that certain good stocks,
if you have it-- example,

01:11:59.217 --> 01:12:00.800
Microsoft or [INAUDIBLE]
or something,

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.900
they could fluctuate
10% in a given week,

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:04.720
and you could be missing
out on 10 baggers

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:08.950
100 baggers if you act on
this volatility, right.

01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:14.542
So when you say you sell on
a certain percentage down,

01:12:14.542 --> 01:12:16.000
are you discounting
the volatility?

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.130
Or if your fund-- or if your
stock is 10% below the market,

01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:24.060
we just-- let's say, the
S&amp;P today has opened up 5%

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:26.280
and my stock went 10%.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:29.600
So I'm only down 5% or am I
really down 10% [INAUDIBLE]?

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:34.370
HEWITT HEISERMAN:
That's a great question.

01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:37.090
I didn't address it.

01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:38.610
That's something
for you to answer.

01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:40.085
Do you want to
sell your positions

01:12:40.085 --> 01:12:42.990
if they're falling at
the same rate of decline

01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:45.300
as the overall market?

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:52.250
Or are you looking for say
some decline that's above

01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:54.130
and beyond what the
market decline is?

01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:56.675
And I don't know the
answer to that for you

01:12:56.675 --> 01:12:59.870
because these are personal
decisions that have to make.

01:12:59.870 --> 01:13:04.380
What I'm trying to
say is, in my case,

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.835
I recognize one
of my limitations

01:13:05.835 --> 01:13:13.330
is that getting emotional about
a position that's down 25%,

01:13:13.330 --> 01:13:16.240
and I don't want to be
in that position again.

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.360
And so I created
some strategies so

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.070
that that's not going to occur.

01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:24.957
So you may decide that
you'll put up with the market

01:13:24.957 --> 01:13:26.540
volatility, you're
just going to focus

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.720
on the company-specific
volatility.

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:33.440
And that may be an
excellent approach.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.710
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you so
much for an engaging talk

01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:37.830
and provocative conversations.

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:38.730
Thanks.

01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:41.480
[APPLAUSE]
