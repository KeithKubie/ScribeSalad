00:00:00.521 --> 00:00:01.639
- [Narrator] In this and the next video

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:03.699
we're gonna learn how to
calculate opportunity cost

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:05.962
and determine who has
the comparative advantage

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:07.894
in the goods production using data

00:00:07.894 --> 00:00:11.493
from both an output
table and an input table.

00:00:11.493 --> 00:00:13.105
If we look at our PPC's in the graph

00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:14.934
on the left, we see the potential outputs

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:17.759
of two goods, shoes and basketballs

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:19.750
for two different countries, country A

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.337
in blue and country B in green.

00:00:22.337 --> 00:00:24.721
Notice that the data on this PPC

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:27.491
is also represented in
the table on the right.

00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:31.183
Country A can produce up to
six pairs of shoes per worker

00:00:31.183 --> 00:00:34.287
or up to eight basketballs per worker.

00:00:34.287 --> 00:00:35.689
Contrast that with country B which

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:37.301
can produce up to four pairs of shoes

00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:40.682
or four basketballs with a single worker.

00:00:40.682 --> 00:00:43.359
Notice that in this table, the variable,

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:44.845
the data that appears in the table

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:46.326
is the output.

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:48.686
This is the potential
output of the two goods

00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:49.928
that the country can produce with

00:00:49.928 --> 00:00:52.721
a fixed amount of inputs.

00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:56.554
Each worker in other
words, workers are input,

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.771
each worker can produce the numbers

00:00:59.771 --> 00:01:02.969
of basketballs and shoes
indicated in the table.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.638
To calculate the opportunity cost

00:01:04.638 --> 00:01:07.178
of shoes and basketballs
in these two countries,

00:01:07.178 --> 00:01:09.558
we can use the following method.

00:01:09.558 --> 00:01:12.135
We know that for every six pairs of shoes,

00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:15.136
I'll write six s, country A produces,

00:01:15.136 --> 00:01:17.636
it gives up eight basketballs.

00:01:18.527 --> 00:01:20.219
The resources needed to produce six shoes

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:22.656
could also produce eight basketballs.

00:01:22.656 --> 00:01:24.325
To find the opportunity cost of shoes

00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:26.461
all I have to do is divide both sides

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.442
of this equation by six and I can see

00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:32.109
that the opportunity
cost of one pair of shoes

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.276
is 8/6 or 4/3 of a basketball.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.263
Now I like to convert
these fractions to decimals

00:01:42.263 --> 00:01:44.113
because it's easier to compare decimals

00:01:44.113 --> 00:01:46.702
against one another than
it is to compare fractions

00:01:46.702 --> 00:01:49.356
which may possibly have
different denominators.

00:01:49.356 --> 00:01:52.900
I'm gonna go ahead and
convert this 4/3 to a decimal

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.152
and that gives me an opportunity cost

00:01:54.152 --> 00:01:57.235
of 1.33 basketballs per pair of shoes

00:01:58.788 --> 00:02:00.698
produced in country A.

00:02:00.698 --> 00:02:01.849
Let's now calculate the opportunity cost

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:04.029
of basketballs in terms of shoes.

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:06.146
Country A can produce
either eight basketballs

00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:07.229
or six shoes.

00:02:08.932 --> 00:02:11.118
To find the cost of
basketballs I just divide

00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:13.588
both sides by eight here.

00:02:13.588 --> 00:02:16.266
I get an opportunity cost of 3/4 of

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:19.293
a pair of shoes per basketball.

00:02:19.293 --> 00:02:21.296
Again I'm gonna convert this to a decimal

00:02:21.296 --> 00:02:23.238
to make it easier to
compare opportunity costs

00:02:23.238 --> 00:02:25.090
across countries.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.515
3/4 of a shoe comes out to 0.75 pairs

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.885
of shoes per basketball.

00:02:30.885 --> 00:02:32.611
I now have my opportunity costs

00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:35.588
of shoes and basketballs for country A.

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:36.486
It's gonna be a lot quicker to calculate

00:02:36.486 --> 00:02:38.452
these opportunity costs for country B

00:02:38.452 --> 00:02:40.855
because country B can
produce either four pairs

00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:42.915
of shoes or four basketballs,

00:02:42.915 --> 00:02:45.843
giving the country A
opportunity cost of shoes

00:02:45.843 --> 00:02:48.843
of one basketball per pair of shoes.

00:02:50.322 --> 00:02:52.748
Likewise for basketballs,
with the resources

00:02:52.748 --> 00:02:54.761
it takes to produce four basketballs,

00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:57.197
the country could have
produce four pairs of shoes.

00:02:57.197 --> 00:02:59.554
Divide both sides by four and I get

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:02.855
a cost of basketballs of one pair

00:03:02.855 --> 00:03:05.098
of shoes per basketball.

00:03:05.098 --> 00:03:06.822
Now I have all the information I need

00:03:06.822 --> 00:03:09.294
to determine who has the
comparative advantage

00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:11.010
in these two goods.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.195
With that information I know how

00:03:12.195 --> 00:03:14.088
the country's can specialize and trade

00:03:14.088 --> 00:03:15.783
with one another in a way that benefits

00:03:15.783 --> 00:03:17.839
both countries mutually.

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:19.311
Let's first look at shoes.

00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:22.048
We can see that country A can produce

00:03:22.048 --> 00:03:26.304
shoes at the opportunity cost
of 1.33 basketballs per shoe

00:03:26.304 --> 00:03:27.489
and country B can produce shoes

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.477
at the opportunity cost of one
basketball per pair of shoes.

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:33.988
Clearly country B can produce shoes

00:03:33.988 --> 00:03:35.894
at the lower opportunity cost.

00:03:35.894 --> 00:03:37.412
So country B should specialize

00:03:37.412 --> 00:03:39.415
in shoe production since that's what it

00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:41.611
has a comparative advantage in.

00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:43.841
For basketballs country
A can produce basketballs

00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:46.635
at an opportunity cost of 0.75 pairs

00:03:46.635 --> 00:03:48.922
of shoes per basketball, whereas country B

00:03:48.922 --> 00:03:51.652
must give up one pair
of shoes per basketball

00:03:51.652 --> 00:03:54.262
giving country A the comparative advantage

00:03:54.262 --> 00:03:55.684
due to its lower opportunity cost

00:03:55.684 --> 00:03:57.803
of basketball production.

00:03:57.803 --> 00:03:58.858
With this information we can come up

00:03:58.858 --> 00:04:01.330
with some conclusions.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.655
First, we know that country A

00:04:03.655 --> 00:04:07.238
should specialize in
basketball production,

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:10.878
because it can produce basketballs

00:04:10.878 --> 00:04:14.626
at a lower opportunity
cost than country B.

00:04:14.626 --> 00:04:18.376
Next we know that country
B should specialize

00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:23.011
in shoe production due to
its lower opportunity cost

00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:25.137
of one basketball per pair of shoes

00:04:25.137 --> 00:04:28.034
compared to 1.33 basketballs
per pair of shoes

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:29.439
in country A.

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:31.059
Let's go back over to our PPC on which

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:32.473
we'll indicate the points at which

00:04:32.473 --> 00:04:35.105
both country's A and B will produce

00:04:35.105 --> 00:04:38.018
based on the principle
of comparative advantage.

00:04:38.018 --> 00:04:40.214
Country A is gonna produce
nothing but basketballs

00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:42.517
due to its lower opportunity cost.

00:04:42.517 --> 00:04:45.678
Putting country A down
here, on its production

00:04:45.678 --> 00:04:48.439
possibilities curve,
country B will then produce

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.025
nothing but shoes due to
its lower opportunity cost

00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:53.960
putting country B at this point

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.959
on this production possibilities curve.

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:58.386
Now you may be wondering
how does country B

00:04:58.386 --> 00:05:00.078
get basketballs if it's not producing

00:05:00.078 --> 00:05:01.343
any domestically.

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:03.423
How does country A get
shoes if it's not producing

00:05:03.423 --> 00:05:04.916
any domestically?

00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:07.598
Of course the answer
to that lies in trade.

00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:10.494
By trading with one another both countries

00:05:10.494 --> 00:05:13.718
will be able to consume some combination

00:05:13.718 --> 00:05:16.968
of basketballs and shoes that is beyond

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:20.820
each country's domestic
production possibilities.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.205
So these dash lines that I'm drawing now

00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:23.927
represent what we could call

00:05:23.927 --> 00:05:26.828
the trading possibilities curves

00:05:26.828 --> 00:05:28.995
of both country's A and B.

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.460
Through specialization and trade,

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.025
a country can consume at a point beyond

00:05:35.025 --> 00:05:37.775
what would be possible if it were

00:05:38.668 --> 00:05:41.087
to produce everything for itself

00:05:41.087 --> 00:05:43.053
without trading with other countries.

00:05:43.053 --> 00:05:46.353
The two dots here that I'll label X and Y

00:05:46.353 --> 00:05:48.742
represent possible levels of consumption

00:05:48.742 --> 00:05:49.769
which lie beyond what the country

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:51.104
would have been able to achieve

00:05:51.104 --> 00:05:52.599
if they had chosen to try to produce

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.906
both shoes and basketballs for themselves.

00:05:54.906 --> 00:05:55.739
In the next video we're gonna look

00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:57.589
at a different type of situation

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:58.808
in which we're given not the number

00:05:58.808 --> 00:06:01.188
of outputs that a country can produce,

00:06:01.188 --> 00:06:02.740
rather the amount of inputs needed

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.594
to produce a single unit
of two different goods.
