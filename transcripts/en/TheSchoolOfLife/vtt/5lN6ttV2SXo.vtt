00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
Mutual desire is normally signalled by a pretty weird act;

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.080
two organs otherwise used for eating and speaking

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.760
are rubbed and pressed against one another with increasing force,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.340
accompanied by the secretion of saliva.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.960
A tongue normally precisely manipulated to articulate vowel sounds,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.800
or to push mashed potato or broccoli to the rear of the palate,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.500
now moves forward to meet its counterpart, whose tip it might touch in repeated staccato movements.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.600
One would have to carefully explain to an alien visitor from Kepler 9b what's going on.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.680
They are not about to bite chunks out of each other’s cheeks, or attempting to inflate one another.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.180
Why is kissing so significant and potentially so exciting?

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.880
Sexual excitement is psychological.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.920
It’s not so much what our bodies happen to be doing that is getting us so turned on.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.320
It’s what’s happening in our imaginations that matters.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.360
Partly the excitement of kissing is the result of social codes being breached.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.120
We could imagine a society where it was very forbidden, and yet very special,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.520
for two people to rub the gap between the index finger and thumb together.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.260
The first time you did it would be something you’d remember all your life.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.200
The huge meaning of kissing is something we’ve built up by social agreement and its fundamental definition is:

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.240
I accept you... enough to do something potentially quite revolting with you.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.040
The inside of a mouth is deeply private.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.120
Ordinarily it would be utterly nauseating to have a stranger poke their tongue into your face.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.280
To allow someone to do these things signals a fundamental level of acceptance.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.280
All of us suffer from strong feelings of shame; which another’s kiss starts to work on overcoming.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.460
Aside from our public identities, we all have lonelier private selves,

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.880
which is what we feel we're getting and giving access to, through a kiss.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.920
Our mouths become privileged arenas in which to surrender our defenses and gift ourselves to another.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.940
Physical pleasure aside, that's why it's so very exciting.
