00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.130
In the last video on the
nephron, we talked about the

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.690
different parts of the nephron
and what, I guess, molecules

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.750
are reabsorbed by the body
and the different parts.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.890
If you remember, in the proximal
convoluted tubule, we

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.250
talked about maybe glucose and
amino acids and sodium being

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.230
reabsorbed.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.500
We talked about the ascending
part of the loop of Henle.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.110
We talked about salts, so that
sodium, potassium, chlorine

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.460
being reabsorbed.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.300
In the distal convoluted
tubule, it was

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.220
calcium, other things.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.860
But at least in my mind, when I
first learned it, I said how

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.580
does that happen?

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.760
How do we actively pump out
these things, especially

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.370
against their own concentration
gradients?

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.170
What I want to do in this video
is get a little bit more

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.770
depth on exactly what's
happening on the borders of

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.000
these tubules to actually
allow these ions to be

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.520
selectively transported out of
the lumen or the inside of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.760
these tubes or to be

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.410
reabsorbed out of the filtrate.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.570
The mechanism's actually
reasonably similar in the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.500
different parts of the nephron,
but let's look at

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.930
each of the parts, because
they're each reabsorbing

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.170
different types of molecules.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.790
And I won't go through all of
the molecules, but I'll just

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.890
give you a sense of things.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.320
Let's start with the proximal
tubule right here.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.520
So let's say if we were to zoom
in right over on that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.260
part-- so let me draw the
inside of the nephron.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.780
The inside of the nephron
maybe looks

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.370
something like this.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.460
So this the inside.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.400
This is where our filtrate
is right here.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.680
Actually, let me draw
it a little bit

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.890
different than that.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.105
So the inside, I'm going to draw
it like this because the

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:49.840
proximal tubule has these little
things that stick out,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.340
sometimes referred to
as a brush border.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.300
So this inside right here,
this is our lumen.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.090
That is where the filtrate is.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.400
The glomerular filtrate is
coming in this direction.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.810
This is, you can imagine, the
inside of the nephron.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.280
And then the border of
the tubule is made up

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.330
by a bunch of cells.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.790
So maybe this is one cell right
here, this is another

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.750
cell right here, that's
another cell.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.866
Obviously, this is
a cross-section.

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.160
It would be actually
more of a cylinder.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.410
It would go around like that.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.870
This is to give an idea.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.410
That's another cell
right there.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.810
And maybe this is their basal
side right there.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.920
And when we say basal, we can
imagine that's kind of the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.110
base of the cell.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.910
Those are good words to
know, fancy words.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.960
So the side of the cells that
are facing the lumen, or kind

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.930
of facing the inside of our
tubule, this is called the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.180
apical side.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.420
And then this side is normally
referred to the basal lateral

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.620
side, or this membrane, if you
view this as a membrane, this

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.450
would be the basolateral
membrane.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.800
This is true regardless of what
part of the nephron we're

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.030
in, whether the proximal,
whether the loop of Henle, or

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.020
whether we're in the
distal part.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.040
What we have here, and on the
other sides of these cells,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.900
we'll have our peritubular
capillaries.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.850
That's another fancy word.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.630
So our peritubular capillaries
will look something like this.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.230
They're actually
cells as well.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.020
Actually, instead of drawing the
cells, I'll just draw it

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.350
as kind of the tube of-- I'll
just draw it like this.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.940
They're porous.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.740
So this is actually blood
flow right here.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.915
This is blood right here.

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:44.290
This is blood right here.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.870
I'm not going to do too much
detail on the actual cells of

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.930
the capillary walls.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.790
I really want to give you the
idea of how things are

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.400
transported out of the lumen,
how they're selectively

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.650
reabsorbed.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.450
So this is the peritubular
capillary.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.980
And once again, fancy
word, but peri means

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.460
around, like perimeter.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.940
So it's around the tubes.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.480
These capillaries go
around the tubes.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.430
If I were overlay it on this
picture, we have these

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.140
capillaries that are going
all around the tubes.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.810
So when things get secreted
or reabsorbed out of the

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.089
nephrons, they're going into
those capillaries.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:24.630
So this is our proximal
convoluted

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.970
membrane right here.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.540
Let's think about what happens
with the glucose.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.750
So what happens is we actually
have sodium-potassium pumps on

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.520
the basolateral side
of these cells.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.040
So this is sodium-potassium
pumps.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.370
I'll just draw one right here.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.730
You might want to watch
the video on

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.600
sodium-potassium pumps.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.250
I have a whole video on it.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.890
But the idea here is that
sodium, maybe I'll draw as

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.810
plus particles right there,
they'll attach on the inside

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.240
right here, ATP will
come along.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.150
When ATP attaches to the right
part of this protein, it'll

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.880
change its shape, its
conformation, and then the

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.310
protein will essentially close
on this side and open on that

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.680
side, and then when it's in that
conformation, the sodium

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.010
doesn't want to bond as much to
the protein and it will go

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.090
outside or it'll cross the
basolateral membrane and

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.140
eventually make its way
into the blood.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.360
And then on the other side, it's
a sodium-potassium pump.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.810
When it's in this kind of open
configuration-- I'll draw it

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.780
over here; I have a whole video
on this-- at that point,

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.320
potassium likes to bond to it.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.080
So potassium likes
to bond to it.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.710
Maybe it bonds to
it over here.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.580
This is a gross
oversimplification.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.000
That causes the protein to
change its conformation.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.600
It doesn't require ATP at that
point, and it goes back to

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.620
this conformation, and then the
potassium doesn't want to

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.870
bond anymore, and then it gets
released, because the protein

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.860
is now a different shape.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.860
So the general idea:
Sodium bonds.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.090
ATP bonds.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.490
The ATP gets its phosphate
popped off of it.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.830
That changes the shape of
the protein to this.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.910
Now the sodium wants to get
released, and now potassium

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:11.870
wants to join.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.380
When potassium joins, we get
to our original one.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.310
The end product of this is
we're having sodium being

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.580
pumped out of the cell and we're
having potassium being

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.100
pumped into the cell, and this
is active transport.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.200
Why is it active transport?

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.160
Because we're using ATP to
drive sodium against its

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.990
concentration gradient to keep
pumping the sodium out of the

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.030
cell, and then potassium kind of
comes in, you could almost

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.920
imagine, passively.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.950
It doesn't require ATP.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.850
And that's why this is often
called a sodium-potassium

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.630
ATPase, which means it's a
protein or an enzyme that

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.520
breaks ATP.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.080
But it breaks ATP, it uses
that energy to change its

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.320
shape to pump sodium out
and potassium in.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.520
Well, anyway, this is all a
review of what we learned in

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.560
those videos, but how does that
help us, for example, get

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.020
glucose out of our lumen?

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.370
Well, what we have over here
is we have other proteins.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.250
I'll just do the example
of glucose.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.760
Let's say we have
a protein here.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.280
There's a very general
term for this.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.620
It's a cotransporter
or a symporter.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.110
Symporter means it transfers two
types of molecules in the

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.790
same direction.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.580
Cotransporter means one molecule
wants to go through

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.850
because of its concentration
gradient and the other

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.710
molecule kind of goes
along for the ride.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.270
So you can imagine, we're
actively pumping out sodium.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.460
So if we're actively pumping
out sodium over here on the

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.890
basolateral side, then we're
going to have a low sodium

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.140
concentration here.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.925
The more we pump out, the lower
this is, and eventually

00:07:56.925 --> 00:07:58.490
it's going to be lower
than the sodium

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.130
concentration in the lumen.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.150
So the sodium concentration
gradient, if there was no

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.950
membrane here, sodium would want
to go across this to kind

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.600
of make up for all of the
lost sodiums over here.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.190
Sodium would want to cross that
if there was no barrier.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.990
These cells here take advantage
of sodium wanting to

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.430
move down its concentration
gradient, which is happening

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.990
because of this active transport
over here, but it

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.930
uses that energy of sodium going
down its concentration

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:30.560
gradient to actually also
transport, in this case, maybe

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.140
some glucose.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.059
So if you had to visualize it,
you could imagine a protein

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.160
that's on this apical
membrane right here.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.250
Maybe it looks something
like this.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.780
This is to get some type
of visualization.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:50.090
Maybe you have more sodium on
this side than you have on

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.350
this side, so sodium is more
likely to bond here.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.130
Maybe glucose will bond here.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.950
This is just a simplification,
but when they bond, this

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:05.220
protein is going to change its
shape to look something more

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.200
like this when they bond, and
now the sodium is going to be

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.620
here and the glucose is
going to be here.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.685
We're essentially on the inside
of the cell now, and in

00:09:15.685 --> 00:09:18.190
this conformation, they don't
want to bond as much to the

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.990
amino acids or whatever else
is in the protein, and then

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.020
they get released.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.360
And when they get released, then
the protein will change

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.190
its shape back to this right
here and we can do this cycle

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.970
over again.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.940
But this is all stipulated on
the idea that there's more

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.250
sodium over here to bump into
this point to make this

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.190
reaction happen.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.260
So sodium's going to go down in
its concentration gradient.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.670
It's taking glucose
for the ride.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.020
And so essentially glucose
concentration will go up high

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.500
here, and then if we make this
porous to glucose so glucose

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.310
can go through, then glucose
will eventually, if this gets

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.250
high enough, it'll just go
down its concentration

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.000
gradient eventually
into the blood.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.520
And this same exact process is
happening, maybe not exactly

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.240
with glucose, but throughout
the entire nephron.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.390
If we go to the loop of Henle,
if we go to the ascending part

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.180
right here, where we're trying
to get the salts out of the

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.875
picture, same idea.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.660
So let's say that that right
there is the lumen.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:22.510
This is a cell that makes up
the wall of the lumen.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:25.500
We're in the loop of Henle
now and you have a

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.330
sodium-potassium
pump out here.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.230
You have sodium being
pumped out.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.120
You have potassium gets pumped
in, but actually, potassium

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.900
channels are leaky, so potassium
can often make its

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.560
way back out in either
direction.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.840
So what's happening to

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.390
potassium isn't that important.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.730
But so sodium concentration
becomes low here.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:51.520
So what we have are symporters
over here, just like we had

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.210
with glucose, but in this case,
sodium wants to enter

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.240
just as the case with glucose,
but here we're trying to

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.950
transport chlorine and
potassium ions.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.680
So that's what we're
going to join.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.520
That's what's going to take
advantage of sodium's

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.790
concentration gradient.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.240
We're going to have potassium
and we're going to have

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.670
chlorine ions.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.930
And actually, this symporter
right here, it's called the

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:16.160
sodium-potassium-chlorine
cotransporter, and it's

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.020
actually the second variation
that you actually get in the

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.250
ascending loop of Henle.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.380
So eventually, you're going to
end up with a lot of chlorine

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.270
here-- actually, potassium from
both directions-- but as

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.410
long as this is porous
to chlorine, if this

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.300
concentration gets high enough,
the chlorine is going

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.590
to make its way out and help
make the medulla that much

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.460
saltier along with the sodium.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.240
Same thing in the distal
convoluted tubule.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.440
There, calcium.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.750
It's a little bit different.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:46.320
So if we're in the distal
convoluted tubule, these kind

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.690
of villi, these things that
stick out-- this is only in

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:53.590
the proximal convoluted tubule,
those brush borders.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.250
But over there-- and just so
you know, this idea where

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.910
we're using a concentration
gradient that's driven by some

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.120
type of active transport to
transport other things, this

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.220
is called secondary
active transport.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.190
That's nice to know.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.870
And then just finishing up at
the distal convoluted tubule.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.560
So this was the lumen.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.130
Let's say that this is the lumen
right here, so we have

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.860
cells on either side of that.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.340
I think you get the
general idea.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.330
The distal's a little bit
different so let's say this is

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.570
a cell, and let's say that
this is a peritubular

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:29.400
capillary right here.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.430
This is our blood.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.070
What we have here is
once again, we're

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:38.400
pumping sodium out.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:38.920
Sodium-potassium pumps.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.860
I have a whole video on that,
and that pumps potassium in,

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.880
so you end up with a lot
of sodiums over here.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.650
The apical membrane that
faces the lumen,

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.880
it's porous to calcium.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.340
Whatever the concentration
of calcium here,

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.590
it's going to be here.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.910
So maybe you have calcium.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:01.040
These are calcium ions just
like that floating around.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.020
And right here, what you
have is an antiporter.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.640
So our concentration in the
blood of sodium is going to be

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.150
higher because we keep
pumping it out.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.390
And so sodium, if you let it
go down its concentration

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.070
gradient, it would go back in.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:18.490
And so maybe right here you have
some sodium going down,

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.830
its concentration gradient going
back in, and then when

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.120
that goes in, that you can
almost imagine it's some type

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.540
of a rotating door, it makes
the calcium go out.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.760
You can try to visualize it
yourself how a protein would

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.250
actually do that.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.700
I kind of imagine a
revolving door.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.400
The sodium makes the
door revolve.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.960
The calcium is at the other
part of the door and

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.330
it gets spit out.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.110
So this is called an antiporter
because they're

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.850
going in different directions,
but once again, it's secondary

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.400
active transport, because the
only way that this could work

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.360
is if we have active transport
using ATP of the sodium out of

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.660
the basolateral membrane in
every one of these cases.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.590
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that useful.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.370
It's more detailed than you
normally get on how the

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:02.990
nephron is actually pumping
things out of the lumen into

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.940
the peritubular capillaries, but
for me, it made things a

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.020
lot more concrete.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.950
It helps me really kind of
internalize what the

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.200
nephron is up to.
