00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.480
Everyone knows that
ice is colder than water,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.889
but usually, you're not
going to freeze water

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:05.410
just by adding some ice cubes.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.910
Today, we're going to see
if we can supercool our ice

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.320
to the point where
it'll actually freeze water solid.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:19.200
[Music]

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.800
Today, we're doing a fun experiment
using liquid nitrogen, ice, and water.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.750
Three different levels
of temperature here,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.899
and we're going to see
if we can take some regular cubed ice,

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.259
put it in liquid nitrogen
until it's absurdly cold,

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.509
and then drop it into water.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.350
We're trying to see if we can
make the water hit sort of flashpoint,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.949
but in reverse.

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.429
Where it will just suddenly freeze,

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:40.760
because we've dropped
the temperature so much.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.320
Normally, if you
put ice into water,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.140
you're just going to get cold water.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.760
We want to see if we can
make the ice so much colder than water

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.280
that the water
will actually freeze

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.340
in the process of
trying to warm the ice up.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.480
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.940
We've got some liquid nitrogen.

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.410
We've got a bunch of
ice cubes and some water.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.590
We're going to dip
the ice into liquid nitrogen,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.100
cooling it down way more
than a normal freezer would,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.780
and then we'll see
if that supercooled ice

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.589
can steal enough heat
out of water for it to freeze.

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.000
We have a number of stemware cups,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.490
and we're using this type
because I think it might have

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.940
less glass in contact with
the water heating it back up.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.940
A lot of the time,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.700
a glass cup will have
a sort of thick bottom to it,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.030
and that seems like
it would just hold enough heat

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.760
that it would just keep
our water from freezing.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.030
So I'm hoping that the stemware
will have a little bit less of that.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.370
We'll see if it works.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.000
To start off as sort of control test,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.780
we're going to pour
some water into a cup,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.960
measure the temperature,
and then add a bunch of ice,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.790
and see what temperature
drops it down to.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.810
Guys, quick announcement.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.140
We have got some shirts
that are going on sale

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.140
in our store now.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.140
That's right, guys.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.140
So the next two weeks,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.880
the "I Tried it at Home"
and the "Look Mom, No Hands" shirts

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.860
are only $19.99.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.780
They're really soft,
so if you want one,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.700
click the link
in the description below.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.840
Nice.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.080
This water is chilled.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.520
I've had it in the fridge for a while,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.100
but I don't think
it's anywhere near freezing.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.200
It's a 9.2 - 8.9 degrees Celsius.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.780
Let's add some ice into our cup.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.240
See what change we get.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.340
[Music]

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.560
Getting some nice condensation
on the outside of the glass,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.720
always a good sign that things

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.560
are cooling down.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.220
[Music]

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.420
It's only been a minute or so,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.660
but let's see what temperature
were clocking in at.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.520
[Music]

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.300
We're already several degrees cooler
than where we were before.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.980
37 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.940
Dropping still a little bit.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.040
Let's give that another minute of
stirring and see where we get.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:44.920
[Music]

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.850
All right.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.780
Down to 34 Fahrenheit or 1.1 Celsius,

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.380
so that's pretty cold.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.700
That's getting very close to the temperature

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.200
of the phase shift between
liquid and solid water.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.260
[Music]

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.280
Mmm, chilly.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.560
Yeah, that was fairly cold,
at least in terms of food we eat,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.060
and temperatures we
regularly experience.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.900
But over here,
we've got liquid nitrogen,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.620
which of course is
a whole different beast,

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.980
and doesn't really even register
to us on just how cold it is.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.700
For instance, I'm not going to put the
thermometer in the liquid nitrogen.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.580
That's far too cold.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.988
I'm just going to put it in the vapors
between the surface of the liquid

00:03:24.988 --> 00:03:26.849
and the top of the container.

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.140
And we're below
zero Fahrenheit by a lot,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.000
and we're approaching
some of the coldest

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.160
temperatures ever experienced
by anyone on Earth,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.260
and at that point,
we have gotten so cold

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.320
that our thermometer
can no longer handle it.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.280
Somewhere around 60 degrees below zero fahrenheit.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.060
It's too cold, and like I said,
this is not in the liquid nitrogen.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.660
Liquid nitrogen is still
down there below a little bit.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.860
So now, we're going to take some ice,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.500
and we're going to super cool
it in our liquid nitrogen,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.020
and then see what happens
when we introduce it to our water.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.540
All right, we've stopped bubbling,

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.160
which means we probably have
our ice cube down to this temperature,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.430
or very close to the temperature
of the liquid nitrogen itself.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.440
Just gonna set this on the counter,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.400
try and put our temperature
probe in contact with it.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.660
Zero Fahrenheit.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.819
That's a negative 18 Celsius.

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:23.440
There were at a, we're about
50 degrees below Fahrenheit,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.710
and about 45 degrees below Celsius.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.419
I think it's actually far colder than that.

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.100
But because the probe
is just resting on it,

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.340
it's still getting exposure
to the air around us.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.219
It's not going to drop all the way
down to the temperature of the ice.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.420
But now, let's see what happens
if we take some water

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.200
and several supercooled ice cubes,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.700
and see what we can do to
the temperature of the water.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.600
That's about where our water is,
48 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.020
Layer of ice just forms
around the tongs so fast

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.760
because they're almost
as cold as liquid nitrogen itself.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.400
[Music]

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.280
Our single supercooled ice cube

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.080
has only reduced the temperature
of our cup of water by about 3 degrees.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.480
But let's try adding several of them.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.439
We had a handful before
when you tried normal ice.

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:11.900
I'm curious to see if we can get
a handful of supercooled ice cubes.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.539
[Music]

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.050
Liquid nitrogen is just boiling away.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.920
Our ice is so hot, it's causing
our liquid nitrogen to boil.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.300
Looks like we have frozen our ice cubes.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.960
Water is starting off at about
45 and 1/2 Fahrenheit.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:40.280
[Music]

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.040
Our super cold ice cubes,
they hit the water,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.480
and the water just forms
a frozen barrier around them,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.900
almost immediately,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.860
and that happened enough that all of
our ice cubes have now stuck together.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.349
Got the temperature down
to 35 and 1/2 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:57.680
I think what we're seeing now...

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.380
I was hoping that we could
sort of cool the water down

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.560
to where it was almost at a point
when just another little bit of cold

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.900
supercooled ice would drop in,
and that would sort of

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.500
cause the whole cup to freeze.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.460
Mostly, what we're having happen

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.160
is as I drop a piece of supercooled ice in,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.529
it forms a layer of ice around itself.

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:21.580
So just the water that's directly in contact
with it loses in a heat turn into ice.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.160
And then it doesn't spread
to the rest of the cup,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.480
it kind of just slowly grows.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.420
Like as this chunk of ice
has been sitting in the cup,

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.920
it's just been getting like a
thicker and thicker layer forming over it

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.720
that has just begun to
form a layer around itself.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.260
It's kind of like a pearl forming in an oyster.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.240
It just builds up
more and more around it.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.600
Going to leave this in here
and keep stirring it,

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.920
and hope that it keeps
stealing heat away from the water,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.580
cooling it down even more.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.160
But I've also got some new
ice cubes in the liquid nitrogen,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.640
and I'm going to take this
sort of blob cube out,

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.559
and put those new ones in,
and see if we can sort of keep going,

00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:01.720
because it is lowering
the temperature in the cup,

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.040
but I'm kind of wondering
if we keep doing this several times,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.700
if we keep adding
more even colder ice,

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.580
will we get to a point where the
whole cup is just like too cold,

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.509
and just all solidifies?

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:15.760
To really push this to a limit,
we've taken our cup,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.780
filled it up with our supercooled ice,
and then poured some cold water on top.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.360
And even with that,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.320
while we have a lot of ice
forming around our cubes,

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.140
I don't think we've managed
to freeze the whole cup.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.280
We had an experiment to see if we
could get a cup of water to flash freeze,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.220
and when we put our supercooled
ice cubes into the water,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.000
it just starts forming
an ice barrier around the cube,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.199
and it really doesn't do a good job of
cooling down all of the water together.

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:43.940
I've sort of moved to seeing if
I can do a different experiment,

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.599
because I was so fascinated
by how those layers of ice formed.

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:50.680
I'm gonna see if
I can take our cube of ice,

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.960
and make sort of
a rainbow shell around it.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.500
I've got six different colors of water,

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.440
and I'm going to try doing each color,

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.300
and then like a gap layer of regular ice,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.000
and see how well this is going to work.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.960
Here it goes.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:26.180
[Music]

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.259
All right, here is my magic egg of ice.

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:32.880
I don't know how to break
through this nice and cleanly,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.340
so I'm just going to kind of cut down,

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.040
and hope I get something of a clean edge.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.039
[Music]

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.920
A little bit of a clean edge, not great.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.600
Freezing so much, it has
sort of shattered into pieces,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.899
but that is really cool rainbow
look right there.

00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:50.259
That's seriously looks like
the inside of a jawbreaker.

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:52.640
All right, this turned out really cool,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.140
and you can see really clearly
how thick each layer was.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.869
Like you can count how many
times I dipped it in each color,

00:08:58.869 --> 00:09:01.880
where I just dipped into
the water to sort of separate it.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.460
But overall, this is really neat, and...

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.840
So unfortunately, we couldn't get
whole cups of ice to freeze solid.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.120
But this ice layering thing
worked out really nicely,

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.020
and it took a ton of food coloring
to get it to really pick up the color.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.080
But rainbow ice looks gorgeous.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.260
I'll try and get it like dip it in water.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:37.220
[Music]

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.020
Layered ice experiment worked
even better than I hoped it would.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.840
This turned into quite
the jawbreaker looking piece.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.320
It's fascinating.

00:09:45.329 --> 00:09:47.180
Like you can just clearly see all the layers.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.560
I think we got some good shots
where you can see the differentiation.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.120
Even now, you can see a little bit as
it separates from one into the next.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.880
Some people can taste food coloring.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.740
I'm not sure if I'm one of those people.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.340
[Music]

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.780
It just tastes like ice to me.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.260
So, whether or not you can get
water to reach sort of a flash point

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.600
by putting supercooled
ice cubes into it, I'm not sure.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.670
Maybe you can, but none of our
experiments got that to work.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.779
We tried pouring really cold water
over our supercool dice.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:16.260
We tried putting supercooled
ice cubes into the water over and over,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.860
and we just never got the
water to cool down more,

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.020
and I'm pretty sure it's because

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.800
any water that comes in contact
with the supercooled ice

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.320
just starts forming a layer of ice around it.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.940
We've done experiments
on the channel before

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.800
where we showed you
how you can put a water bottle

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.380
in the freezer for a
certain amount of time,

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.960
and then just by hitting the
bottle or tipping it out,

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.920
you can get all of it to
freeze at once.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.780
But that's not what we're going for here,

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.040
and I'm sure if we had one of those,

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.340
and dropped a supercooled
ice cube in it, it would freeze.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.280
But at that point, anything makes it freeze.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.000
We're seeing if we could use
our supercooled ice

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.840
to get the water down
to that temperature,

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.980
and that wasn't very successful.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.860
But I'm going to focus on the fact
that it was really successful

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.160
making our little rainbow
ice cube ball things here,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.430
and they were there a lot of fun.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.700
You got great variance of color.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.740
Guys, that's all for today,
but the fun does
not end here.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.180
That box at the top will take you
directly to our most recent video.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.339
You should go check that out.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.360
The other box will show you what YouTube
thinks you should be watching next.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.400
If you are not a subscriber,
hit this bomb to get in the club,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.220
and that way, you'll never
miss out on a video.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.680
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we will see you in the next one.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.360
Talk to you then.
