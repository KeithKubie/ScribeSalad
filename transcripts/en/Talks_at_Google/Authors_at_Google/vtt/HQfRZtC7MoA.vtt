00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.630
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Welcome to Authors at Google
at Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.790
Today we welcome author Larry Tye, who will
discuss this latest book Superman: The High

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.449
Flying History of America's Most Enduring
Hero.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.380
Larry runs the Boston based Health Coverage
Fellowship which is designed to help the media

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.280
do a better job covering critical health care
issues.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.920
Each year it trains ten medical journalists
and newspapers, radio stations and TV outlets

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.350
from across the country.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.890
On topics ranging from public health and mental
health to insuring the uninsured.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.390
From 1986 to 2001, Larry was a beat reporter
with the Boston Globe where his primary beat

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.489
was medicine.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.729
He also served at the Globe's environmental
reporter, roving national writer, investigative

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:52.889
reporter and sports writer.

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:57.190
And if you look at the Boston Globe archives
you'll see that his byline appeared on over

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.730
7,000 articles over 15 years, so I think he
probably doesn't have trouble disciplining

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.960
himself to research and writing.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.590
He's the author of five previous books, including
the 2009 New York Times bestseller Satchel:

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.740
The Life and Times [clears throat] of an American
Legend.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:22.340
Which is a biography of two American icons,
the great baseball pitcher Satchel Page, and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:32.909
Jim Crow, who was the characterization, personification
of the amalgam of racial laws in the south

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.299
that mandated the separation of races in all
public spaces.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.100
Without further ado, please give a warm welcome
to Larry Tye.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.000
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; Larry: So other than the camera back there

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
we should make this really informal.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.630
Small group, we can make this intimate and
the, and I want to tell you a little bit about

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.640
what I, why I wrote a book about Superman
and what I found and then we can talk about

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.159
it, or we can go enjoy a beautiful day or
do whatever you like.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.689
So where I want to actually start out is saying,
I don't know how much of you know what happens

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.890
when you kick off a book.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.650
When you always dream about something big
happening that the, that will lend an event

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.220
and some publicity and some oomph to getting
started with a book.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.480
And the, I went to a very strange place, has
anybody ever heard of a town called Metropolis?

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.970
There really is a Metropolis.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.240
Anybody know where Metropolis is?

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.600
It's in Illinois?

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.480
Anybody ever hear, nobody's ever heard of
Metropolis, Illinois.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.320
Well, it's a place so obscure and so unlike
the real Metropolis that we see in the comic

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.940
books that to get there from Boston, what
you have to do is take a plane to O'Hare and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.450
then take one of two planes everyday that
are like puddle jumpers that go from O'Hare

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.450
airport to Paducah, Kentucky.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.060
And then when you get to Paducah, Kentucky
you have to hope that somebody is there that

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.220
will take you the 13 miles across the Ohio
River to the part of Illinois that is more

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.730
like the south than anything else in Illinois.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.780
And the, I ended up there, so this is a town
you can get into and you see that not only

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.490
doesn't it have an airport or a train station,
it doesn't have a taxi cab or a rental car

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.560
company or anything that would give a sense
that it was really a metropolis.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.940
What it has is a big sign saying it is the
official home of Superman.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.690
[Laughter] And it has, on most weekends, when
you get there about 5,000 people.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.710
On the weekend that I went there, the reason
it was the perfect place to kick off my book

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.130
was not just because it declares itself the
official home of Superman, but because every

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:49.060
summer, in June, it, that happened to coincide
with the actual weekend my book planned to

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.060
come out.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.350
It is the home to the Superman festival, with
30,000 people come from across the world to

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.970
celebrate Superman.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.900
So it's like your dream kickoff party.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.300
30,000 [Laughter] of Superman's best friends
from everywhere are there along with all the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.220
crazy press that cares about comic books and
particularly Superman.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.920
And so I went there and I want to just tell
you about one thing that happened to me when

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.920
I was there.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.669
I was in a hall, about to give, be a part
of a panel giving a big talk.

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.020
And the, it was the biggest hall they had
in Metropolis, which probably seated 300 people.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.140
It was, I guess, a converted, some kind of
theater.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.810
And this hall was about a third full and I'm
there on the panel with two guys who have

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.720
played Superboy on TV series.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.690
And we were enough of a draw to fill up a
third of a room.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.690
We get five minutes into our talk and suddenly
this guy walks into the room, a white haired

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.940
guy with an ancient white haired lady on his
arm, looking like, if he'd let go of her,

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.900
she might tumble down.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.620
And she goes and takes a seat up front but
doesn't say a word.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.260
And within about five minutes between text
messages and cell phone calls, the hall that

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.160
was a third full became overflowing and it
was overflowing because this was the woman,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.440
anybody ever hear of somebody named Noel Neill?

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.440
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Yeah.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.560
&gt;&gt; Larry: Who was Noel Neill?

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.860
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: She played Lois Lane in
the '50s TV series.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.860
&gt;&gt; Larry: She did.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.350
For all but one year, for all but the first
year in the TV series she was Lois Lane.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.389
There was something even worse in terms of
production value before the TV series there

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.270
were, you're all much too young to remember
something called the movie serials.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.080
But the movie serials were these shorts that
lasted 15 minutes.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.680
And on a Saturday afternoon most of America,
every kid in America, wanted to go to the

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.680
movies.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.980
And their parents thought they were going
to the movies to see Pride and Prejudice.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.010
They were really going there to see the 15
minute Superman serial that preceded Pride

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.270
and Prejudice.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.560
And these were terrible things.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.620
If you've ever heard of the expression cliff
hanger?

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.560
Well, a cliffhanger came from these movie
serials because at the end of every serial,

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.470
the heroine would be on a railroad track with
the train about to run her over.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.060
[Laughter] And it would end with the train
coming right to her.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.590
And it was a cliffhanger because it wanted
you to come back the next week for the next

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.800
episode for a dozen episodes in the serial.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.071
And the best of all the serials was Superman
and Noel Niell was there.

00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:26.190
There were two people who made my day in Metropolis.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:33.590
One was Noel Niell and the other one was,
I brought you a little picture to show you

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:41.230
who my other favorite guy there was in Metropolis.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.450
And that's me and that is the biggest Superman
in the world.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:50.050
[Laughter] 15 feet high and it is made of
bronze and this, I don't know if anybody reads

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.210
ever the Boston Globe, but this picture, this
crazy picture was in the Globe travel section,

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:58.900
me describing in the Sunday's Globe, in yesterday's
Globe, my trip to Metropolis.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:05.080
And he is made of bronze for one reason, he
was initially, Metropolis decided in it's

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.870
three block long downtown that the only thing
the official home of Superman could have,

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.700
it had to have a big statue of Superman looking
down the street towards downtown.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.199
The problem with the original statue was that
he was made of fiberglass.

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:23.449
Now these are people in a town that is very
southern.

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:28.389
And when Superman is made of fiberglass everybody
in town who has a gun --which was everybody

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:31.320
in town-- had to see whether Superman was
in fact bulletproof.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.580
[laughter] And it turned out the fiberglass
Superman was not bullet proof.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:41.510
So that became a bulletproof riddled statue
of Superman and this is what we got instead.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.530
And this statue has got many attempts to shoot
at him but he is made of bronze and it just

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.150
bounces right off like it's supposed to.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.390
If you ever saw the original TV Superman series.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:57.020
Did you, anybody ever watch reruns that black
and white TV series?

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.449
There's something very strange that goes on
there.

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:04.270
And what is strange is Superman is bullet
proof and you watch people shooting at him

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.890
and the bullets bounce off.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:10.860
But when they get frustrated they throw their
gun at him and he ducks.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.900
[laughter] [inaudible] Superman.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:19.770
So what I want to do is take you for a minute
from Metropolis to my book.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:24.199
And the obvious question if you see a book
there and you see somebody who has spent their

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:29.930
life being a newspaper reporter and written
books about serious topics like racial segregation

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.329
is, why would you write a book about somebody
like Superman.

00:08:34.329 --> 00:08:37.560
And I wrote the book partly for a very serious
reason.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.909
I was fascinated, having written books, biographies
before on what I think of as American heroes

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:48.819
and being in the process now of writing a
new biography on my hero growing up, who was

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:50.389
a guy named Bobby Kennedy.

00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:55.749
I was intrigued why America embraced the heroes
we do.

00:08:55.749 --> 00:09:02.339
What is it that the hero tells us about them
and about ourselves that we think certain

00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:03.420
people are heroes?

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:10.670
Today, in today's world politicians last as
heroes for about 15 seconds.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:15.579
When Barack Obama ran for senator from Illinois,
he posed next to this Superman statue in what

00:09:15.579 --> 00:09:22.089
may be the most famous picture on the internet
of Barack Obama.

00:09:22.089 --> 00:09:24.319
If you Google, of course Google, the, if you
Google Barack Obama and Superman you will

00:09:24.319 --> 00:09:29.689
see a picture of him and the statue that became
widely circulated during his 2008 campaigning

00:09:29.689 --> 00:09:30.779
for president.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:37.870
But from Barack Obama to Michael Jordan to
whomever are our hero is today, they don't

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.170
seem to last long.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:46.130
And Superman has lasted for 74 years and so
I thought a good way to look at heroes was

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:53.759
to look at the guy who maybe the longest,
you see it there, OK great, look at the longest

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:56.480
lasting hero of the last century who is Superman.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.740
So that was a serious reason for writing this
book.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.070
The real reason, the other and maybe more
important reason was I wanted to be ten years

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.410
old again.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:10.860
And for the last year, for the last two years,
be able to call Superman my work, let me be

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.250
ten years old.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:18.420
What I want to do, anybody here grow up as
a Superman fan?

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.730
Sort of sort of, yeah, metza metz, no, nobody.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:28.709
Well the, so I also wanted to see what there
was to find out about Superman, the serious

00:10:28.709 --> 00:10:32.959
stuff about the hero part, but also whether
there were new things that I could find out

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:35.059
that even the most avid Superman fan wouldn't
know.

00:10:35.059 --> 00:10:38.559
And I just came back from a place called Comic-Con.

00:10:38.559 --> 00:10:40.740
Anybody know what Comic-Con is?

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:46.990
Comic-Con is from San Diego, where every year
150,000 very crazy people [laughter] go to

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.990
San Diego.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.519
And the only way I can describe to anybody
who hasn't been to Comic-Con what it's like

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:59.959
is, if you have ever been in Times Square
on New Years Eve and you see a million people

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:05.290
packed sort of cheek by jowl and yet they
all look like they're having fun.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.249
They, they for anybody who is claustrophobic,
you'd think it would be a nightmare, but people

00:11:09.249 --> 00:11:10.860
are having fun.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:16.610
150,000 fans at Comic-Con for an entire four
days look like they are having a blast.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:23.379
80% of them are dressed up in some crazy costume
and they are in a San Diego summer walking

00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:28.309
around with incredible stuff on them, must
make them feel like it's 200 degrees, but

00:11:28.309 --> 00:11:29.559
they are having a blast.

00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:30.559
And I wanted to be able to tell them, even
the craziest Superman fans, things that the

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:31.559
character that they didn't know.

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:38.559
And I want to just tell you a couple of those
things I found out about Superman.

00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:45.300
One is, his creator, do we know who created
Superman, who wrote the first Superman story?

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.500
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Siegel?

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.519
[inaudible]
&gt;&gt; Larry: Jerry Siegel, Jerry Siegel, so we've

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:52.870
speculated for 74 years what Jerry Siegel
was thinking.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:57.589
he would give short interviews but in the
process of writing this book I came across

00:11:57.589 --> 00:12:03.709
Jerry Siegel's unpublished hundred page memoir
where he told us precisely what he was thinking,

00:12:03.709 --> 00:12:05.670
why he created the character.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:10.739
And the reason he created the character is
because Jerry Siegel when he was growing up

00:12:10.739 --> 00:12:18.839
in a section of Cleveland, Ohio called Glenville,
a section that was very poor and 95% Jewish.

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:24.690
Jerry Siegel was a little bit too short and
little bit too round and wore glasses that

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.809
were a little bit too thick and everyday when
he would go to school, particularly when he

00:12:28.809 --> 00:12:34.089
would go out on the playground at recess time,
kids would taunt him.

00:12:34.089 --> 00:12:38.449
He was, in the classic sense, a kid who was
bullied.

00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:42.999
And they'd come up to him and they'd say "Siegel
Siegel, birds of an eagle."

00:12:42.999 --> 00:12:48.829
Now I have no idea what that means, other
than that if you are a 15 year old or a 12

00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:52.959
year old kid, you'd wish you could fly away,
because everybody's watching, particularly

00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:57.459
all the girls that were watching him and he
was incredibly embarrassed.

00:12:57.459 --> 00:13:03.540
And so every night when he would go to bed
he would take a pad of paper and a pencil

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:09.810
and he would draw a world and imagine a world
that would take him away from his real world

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:10.810
of being bullied.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:17.459
And he created a character to start with that
was called The Super hyphen Man.

00:13:17.459 --> 00:13:23.470
And this was a character who was a really
bad guy who wanted to take over the world

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:29.489
the way that Jerry wished that he could've
done and basically, you know, pummel all of

00:13:29.489 --> 00:13:33.679
his kids who were bullying him everyday and
that was sort of every kid's reaction, normal

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:38.269
reaction, that you want to be stronger than
everybody else and do them harm if that's

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:42.209
what it takes to sort of to get free of that
bullying.

00:13:42.209 --> 00:13:48.129
And that was the way the character looked
until at age 17, something traumatic happened

00:13:48.129 --> 00:13:49.149
to Jerry Siegel.

00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:55.879
His dad owned a used clothing store in a part
of Cleveland that was sort of a rough neighborhood.

00:13:55.879 --> 00:14:02.019
And one day three guys come into that clothing
store and they try on a suit and they walk

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:03.290
out without paying.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:11.170
And Michael Siegel starts to go after them
and, on the spot, he has a massive heart attack

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:13.259
and he basically drops dead.

00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:20.420
And at age 17 this kid, Jerry, who is the
youngest of six siblings of Lithuanian Jewish

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.699
immigrant parents, is suddenly bereft.

00:14:23.699 --> 00:14:27.119
He has lost his dad, he has lost his hero.

00:14:27.119 --> 00:14:32.199
And shortly after that, when he goes to bed
at night with his pad of paper and his pencil,

00:14:32.199 --> 00:14:34.699
the character Superman is transformed.

00:14:34.699 --> 00:14:41.870
He drops the 'the', he drops the hyphen and
he drops the bad guy act.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.910
And in this story that Jerry Siegel writes,
the first story he writes in this new Superman

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:52.439
character, he runs over the next morning after
finishing his story to his buddy and his neighbor

00:14:52.439 --> 00:14:54.320
Joe Shuster's home.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.800
And Joe Shuster is an artist teenage nerd.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:05.480
And Joe Shuster in his first rendition of
the Superman character draws a guy who is

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:12.970
speeding in to save a man who is being robbed
who looks suspiciously like Michael Siegel.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:18.029
So what Superman really is, from the very
beginning is a story of a little boy fighting

00:15:18.029 --> 00:15:21.739
back against a world that seems kind of cruel
to him.

00:15:21.739 --> 00:15:26.360
Only something magical happens that the moment
that Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster develop

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:32.639
their character, America is at a moment when
it needs a hero maybe more than it ever has

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:33.639
in its history.

00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:38.849
We are, in 1938 when the first Superman story
comes out, we're in the middle of what?

00:15:38.849 --> 00:15:39.849
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Depression.

00:15:39.849 --> 00:15:40.989
&gt;&gt; Larry: The Great Depression.

00:15:40.989 --> 00:15:47.089
We're now in the middle of a some other depression
but this was the Great Depression, the one

00:15:47.089 --> 00:15:48.889
that seemed to last forever.

00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:53.749
We're also on the eve of being dragged into
a war in Europe.

00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:57.549
And we're basically a country that's not quite
sure where we're going.

00:15:57.549 --> 00:16:04.290
And we need a hero and Jerry Shus, Joe Shuster
and Jerry Siegel give us a hero in a magical

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:10.529
moment that guarantees that starting from
that very first issue in June 1938, basically

00:16:10.529 --> 00:16:14.660
every time Superman's on the cover of DC comics
he sold out.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:21.029
And he sold out in numbers in hundreds of
thousands and close to a million numbers that

00:16:21.029 --> 00:16:25.309
comic books have never seen happen, they were
a new medium and this was unheard of.

00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:30.389
So the first story I wanted to tell you about
Superman is, that it all starts like everything

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:35.110
with really human scale story and in this
case a bullied boy named Jerry.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:38.540
The other story I want to tell you about Superman.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.350
Anybody have any idea what religion Superman
is?

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:46.170
Why would Superman have a religion?

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.059
How would we even know about his religion?

00:16:48.059 --> 00:16:52.339
Well, I want to tell you that every religion
out there has embraced Superman as theirs.

00:16:52.339 --> 00:16:55.399
Christians see Superman as the perfect Christ
story.

00:16:55.399 --> 00:17:00.930
God sends His only son to earth to show mankind
that it could better than it thought it could

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:06.930
be, and to raise the standards and to raise
the hope of mankind.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.589
Buddhists see Superman as the perfect Zen
character.

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:16.189
Who could be more Zen than Superman who knows
right from wrong and just doesn't even have

00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:18.549
to think about any of this?

00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:21.770
Atheists and agnostics see Superman as a secular
messiah.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.309
Who needs religion?

00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:26.150
Superman knows right from wrong and it's not
about religion.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:31.980
Well, I'm here to tell you what Superman's
real religion is and Superman is Jewish.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.909
And I want to tell you why I think Superman
is Jewish.

00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:38.080
Anybody know what Superman's name was when
he came down from Krypton?

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.620
&gt;&gt; Group: Kal-El
&gt;&gt; Larry: Kal-El.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.149
Anybody speak Hebrew here?

00:17:41.149 --> 00:17:42.149
Little bit.

00:17:42.149 --> 00:17:43.460
What does El mean?

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.520
Do you know what El means?

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.390
&gt;&gt; Male #3: God
&gt;&gt; Larry: El means God.

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:53.340
Kal means, Kal-El suggests the vessel or voice
of God.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.340
Accidental?

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.340
Maybe.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.550
I don't think anything is accidental.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:01.740
When you grow up in a world that's 95% Jewish
and all of this is part of what Jerry Siegel

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.820
told us in his memoir that he was doing which
is writing about what he knows.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:05.820
I don't think it's an accident.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:12.510
But if that was an accident, as much as Superman
might look like the Christ story, there's

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.410
a better story, there's an even more compelling
metaphor that I think Superman is playing

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.410
out.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:25.059
And this is a story of parents trying to save
their child by floating him out to space to

00:18:25.059 --> 00:18:29.669
a river [audience member chuckles] and he's
adopted by two of the most extraordinary gentiles

00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:34.470
that the world has ever seen which are John
and Martha Kent in the middle of Kansas.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:40.960
And they raise the child as their own and
suddenly discover this child is really somebody

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.960
exceptional.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.529
Now if that's not the story of Moses in Exodus
then I don't know what the story of Exodus

00:18:46.529 --> 00:18:47.529
is.

00:18:47.529 --> 00:18:51.130
There are in my book, I go through 20 other
pieces of little hints that Jerry and Joe

00:18:51.130 --> 00:19:00.211
left us, but to me the most fun is any name
that ends in the word 'm-a-n', man, is one

00:19:00.211 --> 00:19:05.539
of two things: it is either a super hero or
a Jew or in this case both.

00:19:05.539 --> 00:19:10.880
So it's not Superman, its Superman.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:17.039
So one more thing I really want to tell you
here now which is the question that I started

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:22.659
the whole book process with, which is what
is Superman, is there a serious story in Superman?

00:19:22.659 --> 00:19:28.080
Anybody who spends a year or two writing a
biography and any publisher who's going to

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.289
publish a biography, a serious publisher like
Random House, publishes it only if the book

00:19:33.289 --> 00:19:38.779
is a lens into something bigger than just
the story of a comic book character.

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:45.580
And to me I think there are two reasons that
we could learn as to why Superman has survived

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.409
for nearly 75 years.

00:19:47.409 --> 00:19:50.820
Next summer, you will be bombarded with Superman
stuff.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:56.400
There will be a movie out and there will be
a million celebrations of Superman's seventy

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.400
fifth birthday.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.919
And everybody will be asking, "How has he
managed to last for so long?

00:20:00.919 --> 00:20:03.399
When our heroes today disappear in 15 minutes?"

00:20:03.399 --> 00:20:08.082
And I think there are two reasons that he
has.

00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:13.710
One is that he has evolved more than the fruit
fly, that every generation has gotten a Superman

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:17.940
that is specific to what their particular
needs and aspirations are.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:25.360
In the 1930s, we were a country, in the 1930s,
we were a country, we were a country on the

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.130
eve of war in the middle of a depression and
we got a Superman who was the consummate New

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:31.890
Deal liberal.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:37.940
He was going out trying to chase down slum
lords and wife beaters and he never told us

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:43.100
how he voted but we all knew he voted for
Franklin Roosevelt and the whole idea of social

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.429
change in America.

00:20:44.429 --> 00:20:46.279
Because that was what we needed then.

00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:51.440
In the 1940s, when we were going to war, we
need a different kind of hero.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.980
And Superman took us to war in a very interesting
way.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.429
You remember, anybody remember whether Superman
ever actually went to war?

00:20:59.429 --> 00:21:01.950
Well, DC comics was really worried about.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:07.789
They were worried that if they sent Superman
off to war, that people would say "He could

00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:09.059
win the war in 15 minutes.

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:13.649
He'd just take over and he'd crush the Nazis
and he'd win the war."

00:21:13.649 --> 00:21:18.480
And that would be disparaging the efforts
of our real soldiers who were going over and

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.770
being wounded and killed overseas.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:26.139
So what they did in a brilliant comic book
was, they had Clark Kent go in and do his

00:21:26.139 --> 00:21:31.539
induction exam and we all know that every
induction exam, you have to read an eye chart.

00:21:31.539 --> 00:21:35.860
And he was looking at the eye chart, only
instead of reading that eye chart, he was

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:41.440
reading an eye chart two examining rooms in
because he had x-ray vision.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.880
[laughter] And he failed his eye test and
this was a particularly compelling explanation

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.500
for Joe Shuster who had terrible eye sight
and who was drawing Superman.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.380
He failed his eye test and that meant that
he had to stay home.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:57.380
And what he ended up doing with Superman throughout
the war years, was he ended up chasing down

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:02.600
saboteurs and protecting us on the home front
and for the government, anytime they did a

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:08.070
war bond drive or were trying to collect metals
or newspapers or anything precious to the

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:15.360
war effort, Superman was out there on their
posters as the centerpiece of their drive.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:21.139
Every ration kit that went overseas to one
of our troops included a comic book and most

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:23.279
of the time it was a Superman comic book.

00:22:23.279 --> 00:22:28.980
So he was out there making soldiers feel like
there was still a little escape from their

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:29.980
horrible world.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.539
And they could read about Superman, he was
making people at home feel patriotic in buying

00:22:34.539 --> 00:22:40.230
their war bonds and he was giving America
precisely the hero that we needed in the 1940s.

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.769
In the 1950s what was our preoccupation?

00:22:42.769 --> 00:22:44.149
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Communism.

00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:45.149
&gt;&gt; Larry: Communism.

00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:46.450
The red menace.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:49.259
Superman was out there chasing down the red
menace.

00:22:49.259 --> 00:22:57.159
In the 1960s, when we were exploring all kinds
of new avenues, Superman, for part of that

00:22:57.159 --> 00:22:59.640
time, was consciously divorced from that.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:05.130
There was guy named Mort Weisinger who in
the 1960s created what were known as imaginary

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:10.510
stories as if Superman in concept wasn't himself
an imaginary story.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:14.950
And Superman would get married, or he'd die,
or he'd do all these things and at the end

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:16.970
of the comic book, they would say "Oh, by
the way, this was an imaginary story."

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:17.970
And it probably didn't happen and next comic
book, he won't be married again.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:29.779
In the 1970s and 80s and 90s, he continued
to do that he continued to give us precisely

00:23:29.779 --> 00:23:30.810
what we needed for that era.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:38.669
So part of the reason I think he survived
forever, is that he evolved, he changed with

00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:39.669
our times.

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:40.669
The other reasons is precisely the opposite.

00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:46.480
Is that the most important core elements of
Superman maintained themselves around all

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.650
of this time, through all those changes.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:56.230
And that was most importantly the Dudley Do-Right
guy who knows exactly the difference between

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.990
right and wrong and never wavers in his choice.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:03.100
The world had lots of dark heroes like Batman.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:10.100
The world had lots of fraught and anxious
heroes like Spiderman, but there was one guy

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:15.340
who was always out there when we needed some
sense of right and wrong, Superman was out

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:22.600
there as clunky as that might have seemed
it also to kids and their parents and their

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:27.649
grandparents that seemed familiar enough,
that Superman was always there as the touchstone

00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:31.380
for a certain kind of righteous hero in America.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:37.120
And I think those two capacities put together
all but gave us a character that has survived

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:43.440
for nearly 75 years and if the lawyers and
the heirs to Superman who are doing battle

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.899
over his rights right now don't screw it up,
he'll be around for another 75 years.

00:24:47.899 --> 00:24:53.759
What I think I would like to do here is actually
stop and see if we wanted to questions, discussion

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:54.759
or anything?

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:55.759
Yeah?

00:24:55.759 --> 00:25:05.009
&gt;&gt; Male #5: So you mentioned that we're coming
up on the 75th anniversary, what was the timing

00:25:05.009 --> 00:25:11.520
of this book, why not wait a little longer
so you can really pick up on that [inaudible].

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.600
&gt;&gt; Larry: For me the timing of it.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.309
Oh it was two things.

00:25:15.309 --> 00:25:20.540
One is, I'll be candid with you that the timing
was partly the movie was due out this summer

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:30.000
and I thought it was really good timing to
have it just when the movie was coming out.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.580
Imagine if you had a history of Batman out
at this moment you would be there interviewed

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.580
by a million people.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:37.150
Well, in fact it turned out to be kind of
brilliant timing accidental that this is the

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:38.830
summer of the superhero in America.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:45.120
We had the Avengers, we had Batman, we had
Spiderman, and we even had an animated Superman

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.720
called Superman versus the Elite.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.690
So the timing has been great and your dream
as an author, there are certain touchstones

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:57.490
today and the world minus Oprah's book club,
there are the biggest thing that you can have

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:58.490
happen.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:01.750
It used to be that if you were on Oprah the
next day every bookstore in America would

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.490
sell out because she said "Buy the book."

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:10.500
In an Oprah-less world, what you want to do
is, New York Times is the touchstone in terms

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.230
of newspapers and this was the cover review
a few weeks ago [baby giggles]

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.590
&gt;&gt;male #6: sorry
&gt;&gt;Larry Tye: in the the New York Times and

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:41.000
I'm convinced it was partly due to with the
fact this was the summer of the super hero.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:27:03.879
And it was also to do with the fact that when
they look through all the reviews that they

00:27:03.879 --> 00:27:23.720
could put on a cover, who could be a more
compelling visual image than they had this

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:33.460
brilliant drawing of Superman, you know, flying
across the cover of the book review.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:46.350
So the timing was, turned out to be good for
lots of reasons.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:28:09.769
The other golden thing if you want to sell
a book, is there is one person, radio it turns

00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:14.909
out sells books better than any media.

00:28:14.909 --> 00:28:25.649
There is one person in radio, I don't know
if anybody is an NPR person, but Terry Gross

00:28:25.649 --> 00:28:29.050
is the closest thing to Oprah.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:36.940
And if you are, can I use the word Amazon
in here, with Google?

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:46.659
If you are number 20,000 on Amazon's best
seller list before Terry Gross airs your interview,

00:28:46.659 --> 00:28:55.400
we watched my book became one of what Amazon
called their ten movers and shakers, meaning

00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:12.890
in the course of a day it moved more numbers
up the list and it was just because of Terry

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:13.890
Gross.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:23.620
But the other thing that I realized is, if
the book had come out next summer on the 75th

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:30.029
anniversary, I guarantee you that there are
ten other books in the works on Superman timed

00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:40.350
for his 75th, so you actually want to be the
definitive one that we sell before and then

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:51.010
your paperback comes out a year later [laughter]
and the paperback will come out just in time

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:52.010
for that.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:30:00.710
But the, but I actually at the end of this
I have a question for all you Google experts

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:02.059
on books.

00:30:02.059 --> 00:30:07.470
Anything else on Superman?

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:26.419
&gt;&gt; Male #7: I'm curious if if Kavalier and
Clay was sort of loosely inspired by Siegel

00:30:26.419 --> 00:30:35.769
and Shuster, was something that was in here
[unintelligible], was like somebody that he

00:30:35.769 --> 00:30:41.370
talks to about
&gt;&gt; Larry: If you haven't, if you don't know

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:48.400
who Michael Schiavone is, there is only one
thing you should know about Michael Schiavone,

00:30:48.400 --> 00:31:01.179
there's only one book, he's written a lot
of good books, but there's only one book that

00:31:01.179 --> 00:31:11.970
rises above everything and that's Kavalier
and Clay.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.630
And that is a book about two fictional comic
book creators.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:29.080
That as you say is really Jerry Siegel and
Joe Shuster and it is a book that is so good

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:36.850
that the nicest thing I could ever say about
a book is when I got near the end, I would

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:44.510
ration myself a certain number of pages to
read every night because I didn't want the

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:48.340
book to end, it was really brilliant.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:32:03.730
And so my goal was to write a book a non-fiction
that drew on the same rich story he did in

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:23.570
fiction and while they call these things on
the back of the book blurbs and the guy who

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:30.140
was the executive producer of the big Batman
movies and taught the first course, ever,

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:42.950
on comic books, said a nice thing which is
not true, but a nice thing, he said, "If you

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:52.990
like reading the amazing adventures of Kavalier
and Clay, wait till you read Larry Tye's true

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:55.519
story behind it all."

00:32:55.519 --> 00:33:03.279
That's sort of the dream kind of thing that
you want somebody, because this was the book

00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:05.070
that was really brilliant.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:12.639
But the great thing that I found out was that
the only thing better than writing brilliant

00:33:12.639 --> 00:33:19.999
fiction is to find a non-fiction story that
reads like fiction and Jerry and Joe's story

00:33:19.999 --> 00:33:26.889
and Superman's story, if you can't write a
good non-fiction book about that then shame

00:33:26.889 --> 00:33:32.510
on you because the story is incredibly rich,
it has 75 years in it.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:40.610
&gt;&gt; Male #8: So were you a Superman fan [inaudible]
&gt;&gt; Larry: So I grew up as a, so there are

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:44.029
a million incarnations of Superman, there
are all the various incarnations in the comic

00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:48.950
books depending on who is writing it, or who
is drawing it.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:51.000
There are various TV shows.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.150
There are, you know, I didn't know until I
started writing this book, I'm embarrassed

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:04.700
to say about this whole generation that had
grown up with Smallville as their version

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.220
of who Superman was.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:19.860
And then the Superman coming of age story
that's made it through nine seasons of television.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:27.020
I grew up as a Superman fan starting with
the TV series and in the 1950s TV series,

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:39.300
if you could believe that this was a Superman
that was played by a guy named George Reeves,

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:44.000
who in his incarnation as Superman, looked
exactly like his incarnations of Clark Kent

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.920
minus the glasses.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:57.410
Who acted, who had no clue how to change his
persona, how to change his voice, his flying

00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:06.730
was jumping off a trampoline through a window
and then having a crane hold him up in the

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:18.310
air and it looked about as much like flying
as if somebody held me up in the air and you

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:26.120
whooshed by with a lot of fans blowing and
tried to make it look.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:33.320
And yet I believed he was Superman because
I wanted to believe, I wanted the character

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.190
to be real and I was ten years old.

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:46.070
And yes, I was a fan and I was a fan, I'm
saying, back in the days when Superman was

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:52.990
so crude that if you were willing to buy into
it all you had a pretty good story.

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:57.650
By the 1970s people who met with Christopher
Reeve in those Superman movies, by the 1970s

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:01.660
their motto, their marketing line when they
were marketing those four Christopher Reeve

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.590
movies was, "You will believe a man can fly."

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.070
And you did believe it.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:12.960
And by the time we get to the 2013 Man of
Steel story, in the short 30 second blurb

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:21.430
that we saw in the Batman movie, it looked
like he was flying to meet him, it was just

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:22.430
really now you can do a million things.

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:27.600
But in those early days it was the story that
kept us riveted because all the technology

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.600
looked so miserable.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:39.410
[Laughter] Yes, I grew up as a fan and I grew
up even more just fascinated by, the only

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:45.830
two symbols of American popular culture that
you can go anywhere in the world today and

00:36:45.830 --> 00:37:03.970
not have to tell people who they are, there
are only two of them and one is obviously

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:08.190
I think Superman the other one is
&gt;&gt; Group: McDonald's

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:09.790
&gt;&gt; Larry: Say again?

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:14.050
McDonalds no, that's good, McDonalds not popular
culture.

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:18.840
Those are, those are products, popular culture
is figures.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.500
Who else in popular culture?

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.750
&gt;&gt; Male #9: Mickey Mouse
&gt;&gt; Larry: Mickey Mouse exactly.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:27.880
Sadly it's Mickey Mouse.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:38.590
The I thought when I was out posting ads on
the Superman sites asking people when I started

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:47.420
the book to send me their Superman stories;
I thought I'd hear from people from across

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.420
America.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:59.030
I heard from people in Paris, in Buenos Aires
and across Asia and Africa and the, I didn't

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:09.250
realize until I started doing my research
that even in the earliest days he was translated

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:17.900
into more than 50 languages, you know by the
1940s and 50s and today the guy who made Superman

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:35.220
fly in the Christopher Reeve movies was 

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:44.230
a guy who grew up in Serbia reading comic
books, Superman comic books translated into

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:51.660
Serbian and that's how he became a fan and
came here and made Superman fly.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:55.510
It's such a compelling story that it works
everywhere.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:39:09.330
&gt;&gt; Male #9: So can you tell how Superman appears
in this series of superhero that characterize

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:13.320
comics, what was before and what happened
after?

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.920
&gt;&gt; Larry: Good question.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:28.750
Before was Superman was based on things that
go back as far as Hercules and Samson and

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:39.600
more immediately he was based on characters
that probably none of you have ever heard

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:47.430
of called Doc Savage, you ever heard of Doc
Savage.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:56.170
Well, so Doc Savage had everything from a
fortress of solitude that he escaped to, Doc

00:39:56.170 --> 00:40:04.590
Savage didn't like women, Doc Savage had a
nickname, called the Man of Bronze and Superman

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:07.790
was the Man of Steel.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:17.390
He came from a lot of characters that Jerry
was reading in those days.

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:24.370
Doc Savage was one, the Phantom was another,
the Shadow was another, these were early characters

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:39.240
that were not comic books because we didn't
have comic books then, they were comic strips.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:43.400
The big thing was newspaper comic strips and
that's what Jerry and Joe wrote Superman to

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:54.760
be, only they were just starting this new
medium of having original stories appear in

00:40:54.760 --> 00:41:06.070
a booklet form and he was it was on his back,
his muscle bound back, that comic books as

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:11.990
a medium and the whole superhero idea really
took off.

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:22.600
And today nobody reads, we just had a movie
that was modestly successful based on one

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:32.760
of the Superman models which was John Carter
of Mars, did anybody see that movie?

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:42.820
I mean, basically most of those other guys
aren't around today and there's something

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:56.460
magical about the fact that Superman still
is and that his brother in DC comics, Batman,

00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:16.320
who came out a year later and Jerry thought
was a clear rip off of the whole Superman

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:27.080
idea and Spiderman, who was the a guy, so
it was one of the other Jewish elements of

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:39.280
the Superman story is that all the early comic
book creators, from Jerry and Joe to the people

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:51.020
who created Batman to the Spiderman creator
were all Jews and they were all Jews for a

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:58.810
very simple reason, that in those days in
the 1930s and early 40s smart Jewish kids

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:05.430
who had thought about going into a world as
a writer, they couldn't get hired because

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:18.180
of antisemitism in the big magazines, they
couldn't get hired in the big ad agencies

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:31.330
and so what they did was, they went to work
doing the lowest grade and the lowest paying

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:38.010
to start with of all the medium which was
comic books.

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:51.460
And a guy named Stanley Lieber a smart Jewish
kid from New York, from the same high school

00:43:51.460 --> 00:44:00.681
that half of these kids came from, decided
that he was someday going to write the great

00:44:00.681 --> 00:44:06.670
American novel and he was going to write that
under his real name Stanley Lieber.

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:11.970
But in the meantime he had to earn a buck.

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:22.240
And so he would change his name to Stan Lee
and he would go out there and for a year or

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.290
two he'd write comic books.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:34.830
Well, he's still writing comic books 50 years
later and nobody knows that he's called Stanley

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:50.250
Lieber and he never wrote the great American
novel, but he wrote the perfect, I had two

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:55.830
funny interviews with Stan Lee.

00:44:55.830 --> 00:45:05.570
With him initially denying that that Spiderman
had anything to do with Superman and finally

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:09.390
admitting this was the anti-Superman.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:24.180
Superman was the guy who knew instinctively
right from wrong and Spiderman was the guy

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:37.090
who had to sit there and worry about what's
right and what's wrong.

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:43.150
Who do I come from, what's going on?

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:52.620
And unlike Batman or Spiderman or most of
our heroes, there's something about Superman

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:57.560
that in his basic story is incredibly different.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:08.060
And that is that the real character in Spiderman
is Peter Parker, the real character in Batman

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:11.140
is
&gt;&gt;Male #10: Bruce Wayne

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.000
&gt;&gt; Larry: Bruce Wayne.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:22.430
The real character in Superman is Superman
and his disguise is Clark Kent and what I

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:32.840
think that was all about was that the real
character came from Krypton and he had to

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.210
be Superman.

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:42.350
And that was who he was and that was what
he was comfortable as.

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:50.180
And he was trying to understand this new alien
world called mankind that he had dropped into.

00:46:50.180 --> 00:47:00.940
And his way of reaching out to mankind was
to take on the identity of a real person and

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:12.970
the identity that he picked, everybody's developed
a million explanations for why he used a reporter

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:22.380
and that was because he could be out there
when news was happening, where damsels needed

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.300
rescuing, where murder was.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:31.340
[audience chuckles] I think that's all garbage,
I think the real reason was Jerry Siegel had

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:37.400
dreamed about being a reporter in his earliest
days and it all goes back to that little boy

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.910
and what he wanted to do.

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:52.900
And he dreamed about it and so he made his
hero a reporter in the real world.

00:47:52.900 --> 00:48:06.690
And what he was doing is, Jerry and Joe both
said that when they were trying to envision

00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:16.340
what Superman looked like they would look
in front of a mirror and they believed that

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:21.400
for anybody who was smart enough if they looked
into them they wouldn't see the schlubby Clark

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.820
Kent exterior they would see into their soul
and see that they were really supermen in

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.170
disguise and that's something we could all
relate to.

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:36.120
I hope when you look at me up here, you don't
see the balding aging guy, you know with,

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.730
you look and see I'm a Superman.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:47.560
We all dream of that, and I think that's one
of the elemental reasons why Superman is still

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:49.970
going 74 years later.

00:48:49.970 --> 00:49:00.420
&gt;&gt; Male #11: So you hinted at that there,
I remember Tarantino, I think, had the whole

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:04.720
dialogue and that the whole monologue, which
was you know, Superman is Superman, Clark

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.880
Kent is Superman's comment on mankind.

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:14.270
But he goes a step further to say you know,
he, Clark Kent is weak, you know, he is a

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:19.260
coward, he is all these negative things and
kind of stuff.

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:25.810
I mean, do you see any of that in the, in
kind of Jerry's, can you kind of project from

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:26.810
that?

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:33.700
&gt;&gt; Larry: I would love, I love playing Kent
to Tarantino but I think that the and I think

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:44.010
that Jerry was clearly trying to give Superman
certain, I mean give Clark Kent certain obviously

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:55.780
weaknesses, but I also think the key was not
who Clark Kent was as an exterior.

00:49:55.780 --> 00:50:03.150
It was who he was inside and what Jerry was
telling us is that we had to be smarter than

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:05.380
Quentin Tarantino and look beyond that.

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:12.700
And so I spent endless time, probably crazy
wasted time but it was fun watching every

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:15.800
movie that Superman was ever mentioned in.

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:22.650
And watching ever episode of Seinfeld, because
Jerry Seinfeld was obsessed with Superman,

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:33.820
that was his, you know, ultimate hero and
the and I now know more about that trivia

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:36.760
and if I'm ever playing a Trivial Pursuits
game I'll win hands down, but that's about

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:37.820
all it's useful for.

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.040
But the, it really is interesting.

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:51.040
Everybody, I was really interested in why
Quentin Tarantino cared about Superman at

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.040
all.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:56.250
And so I tried to interview by many famous
people.

00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:59.780
I was also intrigued by, Superman was, over
time about the the most white bread comic

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:08.150
book character ever and we, he was the last
of the characters and his was the last of

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:13.660
the books to try to have any diversity in
his comic book.

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:23.560
And I was intrigued by talking to people like,
Henry Louis Gates, Skip Gates and Al Roker

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:29.150
and lots of prominent African Americans why
they grew up as passionate Superman people.

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:30.150
And it was intriguing.

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:34.250
Their answers were pretty consistently, number
one, most of the heroes when these guys were

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:39.650
growing up were pretty white bread and number
two is, they looked at him as not as this

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:46.890
white guy that I might've looked at him as,
they looked at him as an alien, an outsider

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:53.960
and somebody they could relate to in terms
of their feelings of belonging and not belonging.

00:51:53.960 --> 00:52:00.650
And people had come up with the smartest answers
and I wish that I could've written an entire

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:03.870
book just about interesting Superman fans,
interesting answers in why they were fans.

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:10.320
And some of them made me cry when I would
hear people you know talk about how a kid,

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:16.390
a Latino guy who grew up with as he said "No
male role model."

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:23.579
All the men had disappeared from his life
and trying to sort of A, survive and B, thrive

00:52:23.579 --> 00:52:26.850
in a ghetto that he grew up in.

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:30.380
And said Superman was his male role model.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:37.460
And it just, people have weird relationships
to their heroes and it's more than just sort

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:42.370
of a distraction for a lot of people.

00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:43.910
So I grew up really touched by it all.

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:46.080
What I should do is actually if you have any
more questions, it's not; we should probably

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.970
end this with my being able to ask all of
you a question.

00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:55.710
And my question is, so one of the things that
every author is perplexed by, one of the thing

00:52:55.710 --> 00:53:03.860
Jonathan and I were talking about, when you
sell a book these days, I don't know if any

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:04.860
of you know what it takes to sell a book to
a publisher.

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:06.040
But what it used to be when I started writing
books ten or twelve years ago you would go

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:07.073
to New York which is where most of the publishers
are and your agent would set up meetings and

00:53:07.073 --> 00:53:09.230
you'd sit in a room with you and a couple
of smart editors talking about the substance

00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:12.500
of the book and what would the book look like
and when could you deliver and all of this

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:13.500
stuff.

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:14.500
Today when you go and try and sell a book,
you sit in a room with ten or twelve people

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:18.970
and, at best, half of them and sometimes less
are actually the people who have anything

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:29.120
to do with the substance of the book and the
rest are who, who do you think the rest of

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:30.120
them are?

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.120
&gt;&gt; Male #12: Venture Capitalists?

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.120
&gt;&gt; Larry: Good guess!

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.120
They're the book publishing version of adventure
capitalist.

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.120
They're marketing people and they want to
see, not can you write a good a book, but

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.120
can you go out and sell it, can you talk on
Terry Gross and on Oprah and can you talk

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.120
to newspaper reporters to they can write up
and coming story.

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.120
They really want to see that you know how
to sell a book.

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.120
Well, that's interesting and that sort of
makes sense because most books don't even

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.070
earn back the advance you are paid in writing
it and so they want to see if they get a little

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:42.110
bit ahead of that curve.

00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:48.240
But the truth is they have no idea in publishing
houses how to sell books.

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.240
And they have now, at Random House, and my
publisher is the biggest trade press in America

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:52.970
random house all these lots of other presses
and you're owned by a big company called Bertelsmann

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:59.270
in Europe and they have a department now called
social media, social media's part of the marketing

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:00.270
department.

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:01.270
They have no clue what to do [inaudible].

00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:02.270
All they know is they'll ask if you have a
Twitter account and do you have, but they

00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:03.270
really have no idea, you can set up a website.

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:05.090
What I want to know is, I'm intrigued by,
so every night I get a, my Google alert on

00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:10.520
anywhere my book has been mentioned in the
24 hours since then and it will tell me all

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:14.800
these obscure websites that have said something
about it.

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:26.540
Is there, if you were me and my editor is
the smartest marketing person I've ever met

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:40.300
at a publishing house and what he says is,
"The way you sell a book, is you create buzz."

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:49.610
And he says, "None of us have any clue how
to create buzz so therefore you try everything."

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:52.910
You try old fashioned media like the New York
Times and you try radio, you try TV and you

00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:57.030
try a million crazy websites that are out
there talking perpetually about comic books

00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:58.030
and about Superman.

00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:59.750
But the thing that matters the most in any
of this is your Google world.

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:00.750
How would, is there something that you would
recommend to an author like me that you do

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:01.750
in terms of making Google somehow pay more
attention when anybody asks about Superman

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:02.750
to my Superman version.

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:06.490
Or what would you, what would you do if you
were all writing in your other life when you

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:09.770
leave here at whatever time you leave here
and you were writing your great American novel

00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:14.020
and you headed out there and you were trying
to sell it, what would you do in terms of

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:15.030
taking all the knowledge you have about how
this world of social media works and use it

00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:16.030
to try to get people to pay attention to your
little thing, your book?

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:17.030
&gt;&gt; Male #13: Could you get involved in some
crazy scandal?

00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:18.030
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Larry: That's brilliant.

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:19.030
That is brilliant.

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:20.030
My first book ever was a biography named Edward
L. Bernays.

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:21.030
And his moniker when he died and the New York
Times ran a full page a full page obituary

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:22.030
on him, nobody's probably ever heard of Edward
L. Bernays.

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:23.030
Well he was called the father of public relations.

00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:24.030
He was Sigmund Freud's double nephew, brother
and sister married brother and sister and

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:25.030
so, he took his favorite uncle's ideas on
why people behaved the way they do and used

00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:26.030
it on behalf of everybody from General Electric
and General Motors to presidential candidates

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:27.030
to lots of other people and he said, "It doesn't
matter what they say about you as long as

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:28.030
they spell your name right."

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:29.030
[laughter] He would try himself into a scandal
or into good news or whatever it was, but

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:30.030
short of creating a scandal you know, whether
they--.

00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:31.030
The Batman film producers were doing the million,
you know, 'we feel terribles' about the horrible

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:32.030
thing that happened in Colorado the weekend
that Batman came out.

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:33.030
And yet look a week later and you see it was
the second biggest selling movie in the history

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.030
of movies that weekend and being linked to
that scandal, which I felt could kill the

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:35.030
movie, in fact, everybody in America was talking
on the talk shows and everywhere else about

00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:36.030
Batman and everybody had to go see what the
talk was all about.

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:37.030
And I think one of the factors aside from
good marketing [inaudible] was being tied

00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:38.030
to a horrible tragedy.

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:39.030
But what would you do, seriously, [laughter]
you're around all these brilliant Google people.

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:40.030
&gt;&gt; Male #14: Seriously, I think probably none
of us actually work on the search work here,

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:41.030
but I from what I know about search, I think
the canonical answer is, you can't.

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:42.030
There's-
&gt;&gt; Male #15: That's not the canonical answer.

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:43.030
[inaudible]
&gt;&gt; Male #14: Because organics buzz right?

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:44.030
&gt;&gt; Larry: So you're saying how to get enough
links to your website or whatever.

00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:45.030
&gt;&gt; Male #15: That's how Google works.

00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:46.030
&gt;&gt; Larry: But what, I'm sorry, let me rephrase
my question.

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:47.030
Using, not just as you're Google hat, but
your being smart people who are out there

00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:48.030
in this new world of social media you should
all be telling Random House social media department

00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:49.030
what to do.

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:50.030
What would you do in terms of just generally
trying to get up some interest in Superman?

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:51.030
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Male #16: I'm actually in my free time

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:52.030
trying to write a book about angels and demons
battling and stuff.

00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:53.030
And my thought was it would be really cool,
and it would probably be relatively cheap

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:54.030
to have like I'm kind of going down the YouTube
route, like, if you had Superman fly in from

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:55.030
like the top of a building or something and
start handing out like discounts for books

00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:56.030
at the store, [laughter] there'd probably
be a lot of people like filming that with

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:57.030
their phone and like you could actually put
some press around it and the local news would

00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:58.030
probably pick it up.

00:55:58.030 --> 00:55:59.030
But that would be interesting like.

00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:00.030
&gt;&gt; Larry: So create something that's so compelling,
that's cool enough.

00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:01.030
[Inaudible]
&gt;&gt; Male #16: That it gets viral and like people

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:02.030
start talking about it.

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:03.030
But then you got to tie it into the book somehow,
like they and then maybe you get the local

00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:04.030
news interview or something like that.

00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:05.030
&gt;&gt; Larry: See now what if I was smart, I would've
taken that idea and done it in Metropolis,

00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:06.030
Illinois.

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:07.030
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Male #16: Some big bang though, something

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.030
that draws a lot of attention to Superman
and then they start hearing about the book.

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:09.030
&gt;&gt; Larry: Getting the 17 foot Superman.

00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:10.030
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Male #17: I think it's, well, I mean, I

00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:11.030
would go slightly simple route.

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:12.030
I would send a copy of your book to everyone
who writes a blog on Superman.

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:13.030
There are thousands.

00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:14.030
&gt;&gt; Larry: So one of the things my smart editor
who said create buzz, he said as many names

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:15.030
as I could give him, he would send the book
out to.

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:16.030
So everybody every blogger and every website
person who has got one already they've been

00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:17.030
extraordinarily helpful in doing it.

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:18.030
And we sent the day after we knew The New
York Times cover review was going to come

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:19.030
out and we knew that, the one thing that everybody
in old fashioned media like television does

00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:20.030
is they read the Sunday New York times, that's
sort of guaranteed.

00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:21.030
And so we had waiting on everybody from John
Stewart to Jay Leno and Letterman and everybody's

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:22.030
desk sort of the next day a copy that.

00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:23.030
We've done everything.

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:24.030
But but there are a million other things and
I don't know what those things are and nobody

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:25.030
seems to know how to make it work.

00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:26.030
&gt;&gt; Male #18: Sometimes I feel like there's
a common denominator the people who use social

00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:27.030
media really effectively is that they do stuff
that's intrinsically interesting.

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:28.030
I'll give you a bite.

00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:29.030
If I follow somebody on twitter and every
tweet is like "Buy my new book, buy my new

00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:30.030
book, buy my new book", I'll probably unfollow
them, even if they might be an author who

00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:31.030
I really like and respect, but if it's somebody
who actually creates a lot of interesting

00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:32.030
additional content.

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:33.030
There's an author Maureen Johnson who I think
Twitter is doing pretty well.

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:34.030
And I wind up buying her books largely because
I find her Twitter feeds so consistently entertaining,

00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:35.030
almost more entertaining than the books themselves.

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:36.030
&gt;&gt; Larry: Yes, that's a great idea and one
of the things that I'm doing is using a very

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:37.030
old fashioned form of media which is newspapers.

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:38.030
Somebody needed a room right there.

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:39.030
&gt;&gt; Male #19: We'll be a few more minutes.

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:40.030
&gt;&gt; Male #20: Alright, I'll wait.

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:41.030
&gt;&gt; Larry: So one of the things, if you're
ever, when you get your book done on angels

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:42.030
and demons, one of the things to realize,
old fashioned media can be exploited in a

00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:43.030
brilliant way today, which is, everybody what
the op-ed page is in the newspaper.

00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:44.030
Well, where all the columns are, and that
op-ed pages like most parts of newspapers

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:45.030
are actually being read today by more eyeballs
than ever in history.

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:46.030
They're just not being paid for because so
many people are reading it online.

00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:47.030
But because newspapers are doing terribly
in terms of their economics and therefore

00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:48.030
they can't most, op-ed pages can't afford
to pay for people to write for them anymore,

00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:49.030
everybody's writing for them these days so
people like authors who are trying to, they've

00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:50.030
got something there out there trying to promote.

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:51.030
So I've written every city I go to the publisher
sends me, I write an op-ed.

00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:52.030
The Boston Globe ran a Superman op-ed strip
across their page with a brilliant graphic

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:53.030
that ensured that if for no other reason than
this brilliant picture people going to be

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:54.030
reading it.

00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:55.030
And you're writing about everything that happens
in the world.

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:56.030
You're making hopefully a subtle link saying
that all these success of all these movies

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:57.030
this summer, Superman speaks to why those
why the Avengers was a big success.

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:58.030
You're trying to do all these things.

00:56:58.030 --> 00:56:59.030
And I want to make one comment to you by the
way, if you are writing that book and you

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:00.030
seriously want to it, hook up before the book
is done, is it going to be a non fiction or

00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:01.030
a fiction?

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:02.030
&gt;&gt; Male #16: Fiction
&gt;&gt; Larry: Fiction yes, show it to get an agent.

00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:03.030
Boston had a lot of great book agents, more
than any city in America beyond New York and

00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:04.030
maybe LA, Boston's a lot of them.

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:05.030
Before you get done with it you want to entice
an agent and a publisher into something so

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:06.030
that they think however much they're deceiving
themselves that they're part of shaping a

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:07.030
book, they love to think that.

00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:08.030
[laughter] Angels and demons is a hot topic,
so get, think beyond just what you're writing

00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:09.030
now to if you do want to sell this book someday.

00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:10.030
Do you want to sell the book someday?

00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:11.030
&gt;&gt; Male #16: Yeah [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Larry: Right well you'd like to get it

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:12.030
published.

00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:13.030
So just get somebody involved with it.

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:14.030
Angels and demons is hot, make them see that
you get this and you got 50 pages or 25 pages

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:15.030
&gt;&gt; Male #16: It's pretty much written, I'm
kind of editing.

00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:16.030
&gt;&gt; Larry: Then don't let them know that it's
all written.

00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:17.030
[laughter] Just show it to them and whether
or not they become part of shaping is psychological,

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:18.030
the seeing it before it's done is important.

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:19.030
And the, and you've got enough to show.

00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:20.030
Make the sure the pages that you show them,
somebody will only read, you have to write

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:21.030
the most brilliant five paragraph email that
you've ever done in your life to these agents

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:22.030
to get them interested enough to read the
first five or ten pages of the book.

00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:23.030
You want to sort of entice them and you all
understand, you understand the people will

00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:24.030
only read, you want to take them to each level.

00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:25.030
So add them, write a brilliant email to them
and then send them the best five or ten pages

00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:26.030
and then sit down and have lunch with them
and pick an agent that you think gets what

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:27.030
you are trying to do.

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:28.030
And do that soon.

00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:29.030
&gt;&gt; Male #16: Yeah
&gt;&gt; Larry: Sorry

00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:30.030
&gt;&gt; Male #21: If you have any chapters for
this book, you haven't put into this any one's

00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:31.030
that fell on the cutting room floor.

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:32.030
Put them on your website.

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:33.030
&gt;&gt; Larry: That's a great idea.

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:34.030
And there are always, when you go out and
do a book tour, so I did my first book talk

00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:35.030
on this book was at the Boston Public Library
and there was a guy who came into this book

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:36.030
talk, sitting in the back of the room and
the end when you are sort of done with questions,

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:37.030
he raises his hand and he says "Well, I have
a question, I've got a story I'd like to tell."

00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:38.030
And this guy tells this story that when he
was growing up in New Jersey, one day his

00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:39.030
dad was walking down the street in whatever
his home town was and Joe Shuster comes out

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:40.030
and taps the dad on the shoulder and says
"Excuse me, but you are my image of what Superman

00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:41.030
ought to look like."

00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:42.030
And this is twenty years after he wrote, drew
the first Superman, he said "Can I do a pencil

00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:43.030
drawing of you?"

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:44.030
So the guy then takes out of his knapsack
at the Boston Public Library, two pencil drawings

00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:45.030
that are the absolute spitting image of the
original Joe Shuster Superman and he says

00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:46.030
"This is the first time I've ever taken these
out of my house and I thought they might be

00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:47.030
interesting."

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:48.030
Well, those two pencil drawings, if you have
a copy, and I'm talking a copy of an issue

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:49.030
that 200,000 of which were the first Superman
comic book that is sold for more than a million

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:50.030
dollars.

00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:51.030
This guy's pencil drawings are easily worth
many millions of dollars and this guy bringing

00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:52.030
them out for the first time.

00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:53.030
So you say write a chapter, I'd love to tell
all these stories about what sort of happens

00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:54.030
to you as you are going along and those are
legitimate something and I got to find a blog

00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:55.030
or somewhere that will Sort of get them.

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:56.030
Look, you've been great, somebody else gets
this room.

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:57.030
Thank you very much for coming and if you
want the book signed we can do that.

00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.031
[Applause]
