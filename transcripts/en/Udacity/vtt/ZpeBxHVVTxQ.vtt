00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.710
So how do you validate the idea?

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.380
How do you not waste a lot
of time building something

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.580
that people don't need?

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.050
&gt;&gt; Well, I think that the thing you
need to do is just build something.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.050
I realize that sounds a little backwards
to the way you asked the question.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.270
But you can talk to as many
people as you want in life, and

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.709
you'll get some good answers and
some bad answers.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.580
Unless you know how to ask
the questions properly,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.410
you'll get a lot of bad answers.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.110
But really the best way to get people's
feedback is to build something.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.528
And it might not be the right thing, but
as long as it has sort of the minimal

00:00:35.528 --> 00:00:40.260
quantitive useable functionality.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.890
It gives people something
to interact with.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.210
And then you start learning how they
use it, what they really want, and

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.620
you can go from there.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.740
&gt;&gt; So,
if I'm an early stage startup, and

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.750
I want to do user research,
what do I do?

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.030
I just build it and
release it to the market?

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.970
&gt;&gt; Essentially, yeah.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.870
It really is you know, build something,
put it out there, see what happens.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.550
The way I would modify
that just a little and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.674
this is why it's useful to be
your own customer is that,

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:14.090
if you're your own customer and if
you're building this thing for yourself,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.740
as you start developing it, you can
actually figure out what you need and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.820
what you don't need before you release
it and see what other people need.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.110
If you're building something for someone
you don't understand and it's not you.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.450
The first piece of feedback you'll get
is when you toss it out into the world.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.560
And getting people to engage
with something is hard enough.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.530
Getting people to engage with
something they don't actually want or

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.350
need at all is basically impossible.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.910
So if you build something
that you need and

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.110
want, you can get it to the point
where it solves your problem.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.860
Then you release it and other people
will be able to give you feedback and

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.370
really interact with it and
then you'll just get better faster.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.410
You make your iterations faster.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.950
&gt;&gt; And how do you make sure that you get

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.480
the right feedback
from the right people?

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.900
How do you make sure that it's not
like showing it to your mother and

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.760
she's saying, hey that's a great idea.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.300
Well, mothers will usually tell you your
idea is very nice unless they actually

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.430
want you to go back to law school
which is what my mom keeps suggesting.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.880
Although she suggested I go get an MBA
the other day, I don't know why.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.050
You have to pick, right?

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.800
You have to be smart about it and

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.410
seek out the people who you think will
find what you're doing is useful.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.920
Now, some of that actually
is picking people by hand,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.400
looking at your network and saying,
hey, this person is the right demo.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.290
The right user type for
what I'm building, looks like me or

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.190
doesn't look like me, but I think
I can solve their problem anyway.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.330
Let me start with them.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.730
The other way is try to find
some sort of distribution early.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.540
And there's a bunch of
different ways to do that.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.910
If you're building a product,
Hacker News, is an amazing place to go.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.270
Because that's where a lot of people who
are interested in technology congregate.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.770
They go there.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.560
They see what's up.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.820
They look at interesting articles.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.020
We have something called Show HN, where
people just put up new products, and

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.890
they'll get a lot of feedback.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.640
A lot of customers,
potential customers, coming to them.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.790
You can use product hunt for
the same thing.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.940
There's a bunch of other things
like that that you can use.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.270
But really, it's about being relentless.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.550
There's a great story that
Ben from Pinterest tells.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.880
The founder of Pinterest.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.360
And when he was starting Pinterest,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.400
he didn't think anyone
would want to use it.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.300
And so
he literally went to coffee shops and

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.370
showed the prototypes of Pinterest
to moms that he saw at coffee shops.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.130
He said,
these are probably going to be my demo.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.090
Let me see what they think.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.010
And he had them, and
he just took notes at coffee shops.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.450
And it's that level of drive of

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.670
just finding people who want
to use what you're building.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.070
That's critical in getting
some sort of engagement.
