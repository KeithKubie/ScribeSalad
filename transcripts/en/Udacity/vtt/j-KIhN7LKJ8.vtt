00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, so here we are in the IDE.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I've made a simple class called Link

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that just has a few properties, ID, submitter ID--this was the user--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
submitted time--this was the date we were referring to before--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
votes, title, and URL.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And then I've got a Python list of these link objects, just a bunch of them.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And the first thing I'd like you to do is before we learn how to use databases,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
implement this function query for me.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And what I'd like query function to do is

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
return the number of votes that the link whose ID is 15 has.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So, all of these links have an ID parameter,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
an ID attribute that you can look at,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and I want you to return the number of votes for that particular link.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You need to find it out of this list and then return the number of votes.
