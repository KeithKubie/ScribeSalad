00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.500
Hey guys! Welcome back to another day

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.060
experimenting with hot vs cold.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.240
Now for months and months now,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.180
even before I was playing with liquid nitrogen and gasoline,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.500
I've had hundreds and hundreds of people asking me

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500
to mix gasoline with dry ice,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.280
to light dry ice on fire,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.500
and to drop dry ice into burning gasoline.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.500
So today we're going to be trying all three of those experiments

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.000
just to observe what happens.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.680
So today I picked a comment by Bonnie In The Box who  says "gasoline vs dry ice...make it happen!"

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.020
So we're doing this for you, Bonnie,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.100
and for everyone else who suggested the same thing.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.240
Okay, disclaimer

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.260
Gasoline is a very volatile substance

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.580
and can lead to a fire that gets out of control very, very quickly

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.210
recommend trying at home because if
something goes terribly wrong you may no

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.629
longer have a home all right for our
first experiment let's try drilling a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.660
hole into a block of ice then using some
gasoline to fill up that hole and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.460
observe how the two materials react

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.400
Ooh, look at that! We ended up making dry ice snow.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.400
So I just used a Forstner bit to

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.060
drill a hole right in the center of this
block of dry ice and it runs about 3/4

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.160
to 1 inch deep and over here I filled up
a measuring cup with 91 octane let's go

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.670
ahead and pour it in and see what
happens this is actually a little more

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.700
than I'm comfortable working with and we
pour some that out I'm going to start

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.980
off just putting a couple of small drops
in there

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.990
make the little humanoid
I blow the vapor away you can actually

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.840
see the liquid gas flame in there
irrelevant one

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.700
I wonder if the dryest can freeze it you
know ghastly and I believe starts to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.000
freeze around 40 degrees Fahrenheit and
the driest is around minus 109 settles

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.750
down mostly quickly
still seems pretty liquidy

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.490
all right so gasoline in dry ice doesn't
really seem to do much just kind of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.100
sitting there chilling I'm sure it's
getting colder but I don't see any

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.399
reaction with the carbon dioxide so
while we've got this cooling over here

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.430
I'm going to flip things over the other
way which is a lot of small piece of dry

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.989
ice and drop it into a glass full of gas
I've got a small piece of dry ice here

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.110
it's about the size of a quarter I'm
very comfortable working with that let's

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.830
drop it in see what happens contact
through a bitter soil

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.250
Oh God I keep thinking until that out of
the glass and it settles down

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.890
now what's happening here is the
gasoline is warming up the block of

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.520
drives and the dryest is sublimating and
releasing carbon oxide gas which means

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.690
we effectively have a barrier of carbon
dioxide right here which makes me wonder

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.470
if we lit up a match and tried to light
the gasoline at this point with the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.960
carbon dioxide put the match out or with
the gasoline thrown off we might have to

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.230
dry

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.239
someone's truth
oh you got a barrier that prevents the

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.440
gasoline from being lit without oxygen
our gasoline can't burn and now we've

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.500
got a protective layer preventing any
open flames getting down to it

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.550
interesting now thinking about this
let's try taking it to the next level do

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.060
you think we can actually use gasoline
to put out a match if we had a flaming

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.870
match and dump it down into liquid we do
it in such a way that the match goes out

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.230
and nothing catches fire I think if we
have a small barrier of carbon dioxide

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.030
on the top to prevent any oxygen from
getting in it just might be possible so

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.610
our driest is just starting to settle
down which means we should have a nice

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.690
layer of carbon dioxide in here so if we
strike a match theoretically we should

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.560
be able to drop it down in liquid and
have gasoline put the match out maybe

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.519
it'll work alright here we go
gasoline versus match in three two one

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.920
drop and it goes out that is beautiful
that is a beautiful thing we just use

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.700
gasoline to put out a fire at the mind
blow this really is gasoline guys and to

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.519
prove that we can blow off the carbon
dioxide layer and touch it off with a

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:00.049
match and it should light off it's like
that so you can see that by dipping our

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.260
match very quickly through a small layer
of carbon dioxide into the gas the

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.410
gasoline actually puts the match out now
to put out a gas fire like this we can

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.400
just take a damp rag very carefully
placed over top for one to two seconds

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.209
and just like magic it's gone out
alright so back to our gasoline in the

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.139
dry it's been sitting here for about 15
minutes and I can see the top layer is

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.229
starting to crust over a little bit so
it looks like over time our gasoline

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.060
will actually freeze but it takes an
extremely long time to do that since

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.460
we're still waiting for that I'm going
to drill a small hole in the block and

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.420
dry it so let up with a little bit more
gasoline and

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.720
that one

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:43.229
just going to take that snow and dump it
over here gasps give that's keeping the

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.800
reaction at all

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.770
cool let's light that off all right here
we go

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:03.980
oh I can't get life well let me blow out
some of that carbon dioxide layer first

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.720
I can work faster to update guys I've
tried about eight times and I cannot get

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.569
the gasoline in this small hole dries to
light off

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.259
let's chisel the frozen gasoline out of
the center hole fill it up and keep a

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:23.860
bigger hole makes a difference this
stuff right here is frozen gasoline we

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.270
know what that does right see

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:39.400
I'm not even that late gasoline versus
dry ice dry ass win all right that

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.150
spilled up completely to the top let's
go ahead and light it off with hot three

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:49.900
two one and it goes out every single
time it goes out I cannot get this stuff

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.690
to light off it's crazy
even if I blow off the carbon dioxide

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.800
vapor first the match still goes out I
cannot get gas when you light off and

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.090
drive alright guys so even with big
healthy flames so far I'm having zero

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.470
success letting gasoline and dry eyes
you can see little bits of gasoline

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.040
spurting up in the igniting once we get
it down to the liquid itself goes out

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.070
every time we know that this is because
the carbon dioxide is acting as a

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.370
barrier preventing any oxygen from
getting the gasoline and the liquid

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.820
gasoline itself isn't plowable so we can
state a mess right down inside it that

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.900
goes right out so the only way to get
any kind of flaming effect I think it's

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.350
the light a container of gasoline on
fire first and then throw some chunks of

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.670
dry ice into it next and this could get
extremely dangerous so for this last

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:39.060
experiment we're going outside all right
let's light it up

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:46.280
goes off no problem alright one chunk of
dry ice what's it going to do

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.540
it bubbles and spatters and she's guess
what

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:02.750
throw in a bigger chunk
oh wow we're gonna spread

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:11.650
I wonder if we threw a few tungsten
drives down into the plain old house

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.660
that's a lot of gas you know what's
going to happen is that clap is going to

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:24.090
break and gas thing is going to go
everywhere so look at the dry ice it's

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.270
starting to put out the flame it's on
fire but the flame can't keep up because

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:32.640
the dry ice and the carbon dioxide
putting it out I'm gonna go get some

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.910
more dry

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.780
look at the cup the cup actually went
out the flame went out

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:53.720
oh my gosh that's so cool so fire versus
dry ice dry ice win that was incredible

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.510
that was a fire that was starting to get
out of control and the dry ice just took

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.780
me down and now watch this if I try
lighting off another match and igniting

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:06.800
the gasoline it won't go off the match
just goes right out is that it actually

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.970
put out the flame

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:21.910
even on the ground if you that keep on
the ground the flame way out can't get

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:28.060
this cup to go off the gasoline down
here can even get that to light off the

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:35.740
matches just go out what about a whole
bundle of matches you all just go out

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.380
that is cool that is cool

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:51.350
oh I like that
that slowly starts bubbling and spitting

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.460
and now look because it's a bigger
container it's producing carbon dioxide

00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:02.920
inside the container and the flames are
having a hard time keeping up

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.759
to another face

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:24.460
or claim just went out so on the large
bowl by putting chumps and rice in there

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.580
very carefully it actually suppress the
flame and made it go out and at this

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.640
point I can't light it off I'm
relatively comfortable standing right

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.250
over top of it with an open match right
now and trying to light it because

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.730
nothing happens it just goes right out
so a lot of really interesting things

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.630
learned here today we start off this
experiment by pouring gasoline into a

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.260
hole that we made in a chunk of dry ice
now after the initial shock of the two

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.960
temperatures meeting the gasoline
settled down and nothing more really

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.110
seemed to happen so we set that to the
side for a minute and we flipped the

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.620
experiment by dropping small chunks of
dry ice into a cup full of gasoline to

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.410
see if we could produce any different
result we saw that the reaction of the

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.160
dry sublimating inside the gasoline
caused the gas to bubble up in foam at

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.180
the top and in some cases even spill
over the edge we also discovered that

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.480
the gasoline was covered by a thin
coating of carbon dioxide gas which

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.420
would prevent an open flame from
lighting it off so we tried an

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.420
experiment to see if we could use
gasoline to actually put out a fire and

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.530
it worked every time we went back to our
block of dry ice drilled a bigger hole

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:21.220
and tried to light off the gas with
absolutely no success so for our final

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.040
experiment we went outside with a
container of gasoline lit it on fire

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.690
first and dropped in chunks of drives
after in the first container the dryest

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.230
made the gasoline spew out into the open
air where it quickly accelerated into an

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:36.010
uncontrollable flame we tried taking
chunks of dry and setting them down into

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.970
the flame and in less than a minute our
gas fire has been completely smothered

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:43.750
but in the second round we used a larger
bowl with more surface area and slowly

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.500
slip the drive inside but even though
the liquid is burning with a healthy

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.640
flame as the carbon dioxide rose from
below it smothered the flame and put the

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.450
fire out so in conclusion I think that
we've seen when it comes to fire versus

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.300
dry ice dry
and a big thanks to Bonnie in the box
