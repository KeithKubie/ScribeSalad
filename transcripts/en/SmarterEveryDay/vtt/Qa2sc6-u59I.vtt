00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:01.340
Hey it's me Destin

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.792
welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.792 --> 00:00:03.985
This is my drill press.

00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:07.676
Out of all things that humans could send up to Mars

00:00:07.676 --> 00:00:09.105
on a nuclear powered robot,

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:12.593
a drill was one of the most important things we sent.

00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:13.658
And the reason we did this,

00:00:13.658 --> 00:00:14.506
well think about this.

00:00:14.506 --> 00:00:17.240
This is the board and you've seen tree rings right?

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.091
If we were to drill into this board,

00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:24.813
and then analyze the shavings that come out of that hole,

00:00:24.813 --> 00:00:27.921
because of the tree rings we could go back in time and understand

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:31.441
what was going on in this board when the tree was younger right?

00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:36.252
That's exactly why they sent a drill to Mars.

00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:38.444
We want to understand if there were organic molecules

00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:40.579
inside the rocks of Mars when they formed.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.363
But in order to do that you have to drill below the surface

00:00:43.363 --> 00:00:45.082
and then analyze the powder.

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:47.630
But every article I've ever read about the drill

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.208
and about how they analyze the powder

00:00:49.208 --> 00:00:51.243
doesn't really satisfy me.

00:00:51.243 --> 00:00:52.805
So today on Smarter Every Day

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:53.932
I'm at JPL.

00:00:53.932 --> 00:00:55.908
This is Mark Rober.. Crazy!

00:00:55.908 --> 00:00:58.264
He's gonna give me a tour of what?

00:00:59.504 --> 00:01:00.545
- Uh OK.

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:01.290
- You missed your cue.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.998
- Sorry. [laughs]

00:01:01.998 --> 00:01:03.171
- We've gotta start over, he missed his cue.

00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:04.357
- I just realized..

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:06.619
- This is my buddy Mark.

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.592
You remember all that fancy rocket business where we

00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:11.262
descended the curiosity rover down to the Martian surface

00:01:11.262 --> 00:01:13.047
with these fancy rocket cranes?

00:01:13.047 --> 00:01:14.541
Yeah he helped work on that.

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:17.392
But more importantly he owes me a ton of favors

00:01:17.392 --> 00:01:18.906
so I asked him if he could introduce me to the

00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:20.485
people behind the drill on the rover.

00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:23.460
I wanted to understand exactly how this thing works.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.562
- So we are going to the Mars yard,

00:01:25.562 --> 00:01:28.310
which basically is a simulation of the Martian surface.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.181
- Yeah look both ways before you cross the street and go to Mars.

00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:34.255
- Behold.. Mars!

00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:37.294
- So this is the Curiosity garage?

00:01:37.294 --> 00:01:39.909
- Yeah, so they'll bring it out here in the yard

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.112
You can see here's the tracks.

00:01:42.572 --> 00:01:44.538
But then when they're just working on something inside

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:45.889
they bring it back into the shack.

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:48.471
- Wow. Oh man so is this the only one?

00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:49.285
Is this one of a kind?

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:50.381
- It's one of a kind.

00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:51.970
The only one on planet Earth.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.838
- I guess it's two of a kind.

00:01:53.838 --> 00:01:55.161
I'm Destin, what's your name?

00:01:55.161 --> 00:01:56.196
- Megan.

00:01:56.196 --> 00:01:57.677
- Can I shake your hand from a long way away?

00:01:57.677 --> 00:01:59.107
Nice to meet you Megan.

00:01:59.107 --> 00:02:00.079
You're running the test?

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.720
- I'm running it right now, yeah.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.072
- That's pretty awesome.

00:02:03.072 --> 00:02:04.665
He hasn't let you talk at all,

00:02:04.665 --> 00:02:06.795
but I really want to talk to you but there's a rover in between us.

00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:10.127
This duplicate of the curiosity rover exists

00:02:10.127 --> 00:02:12.484
so scientists and engineers can test software

00:02:12.484 --> 00:02:14.712
and tricky manoeuvres without having to risk damage

00:02:14.712 --> 00:02:16.523
to actual flight hardware.

00:02:16.523 --> 00:02:18.435
OK we decided to quit messing around

00:02:18.435 --> 00:02:20.665
and Megan's actually gonna tell us what the tools are.

00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:21.794
You know all the tools right?

00:02:21.794 --> 00:02:24.995
- I know a lot about the drill and the Chimra since I tested them.

00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:25.742
- Yeah?

00:02:25.742 --> 00:02:28.660
- So this is kind of the butt end of the drill right here.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.775
- Can I walk over there?

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:31.035
- You can come over here.

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:32.672
- I will. So you're clipped in, right?

00:02:32.672 --> 00:02:33.808
- I am clipped in..

00:02:33.808 --> 00:02:35.619
- To the grounding point, OK.

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.039
- And so this what you see right here

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:38.881
we call Chimra,

00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:40.569
I have no idea what that acronym is..

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.920
- It's basically the tool belt right?

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.832
- This is the sample processing.

00:02:43.832 --> 00:02:46.903
- OK I really need to apologize right now,

00:02:46.903 --> 00:02:49.070
because I started geeking out so hard

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.904
because I was in the room with the rover,

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:53.103
that I forgot I was making a YouTube video.

00:02:53.103 --> 00:02:54.883
And I started asking questions and they were

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:57.859
awesome questions, and then they let me run a command

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.701
on the mast, and I moved it around.

00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:01.124
It was incredible.

00:03:01.124 --> 00:03:03.222
Anyway, I went back and I tried to summarize

00:03:03.222 --> 00:03:06.105
everything I learned while I was offline in this one take.

00:03:06.105 --> 00:03:07.001
I'm so sorry.

00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:09.881
So this is the main mast which is the RSM.

00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:11.104
Which stands for what?

00:03:11.104 --> 00:03:12.758
- Remote Sensing Mast.

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:14.957
- OK and there's two probes on the side here

00:03:14.957 --> 00:03:16.566
and these are both for weather.

00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:19.611
One of them on Mars actively doesn't work at this moment in time.

00:03:19.611 --> 00:03:22.038
Because it didn't work at landing right?

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:26.164
OK so this is the arm here that I'm using to gather

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:27.791
samples on Mars,

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.467
and it uses Megan's drill bit, right,

00:03:30.467 --> 00:03:32.117
- The official name.

00:03:32.117 --> 00:03:34.860
- The official name. So that's the drill bit,

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.439
and it should have enough life to meet our primary

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:41.675
objectives on Mars, and after that goes bad for whatever reason

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:43.763
if we want some icing on the cake then you've got

00:03:43.763 --> 00:03:45.643
two extra drill bits located down here that you can

00:03:45.643 --> 00:03:47.394
autonomously swap out.

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:47.970
- Correct.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.910
- And that'd be the first time that's ever been done on a different planet.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.975
And it's gonna happen cause you worked on it right?

00:03:51.975 --> 00:03:53.336
- I want it to happen.

00:03:53.336 --> 00:03:54.589
It would be really awesome to see.

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:55.990
- Excellent. So over here,

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.410
looking at the samples.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.422
So before we decide what samples we're gonna analyze by putting them in this little hole right here

00:04:02.422 --> 00:04:04.109
we can put the samples on the plate,

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.044
we can measure their size, both by the fiducials there on the checkerboard

00:04:09.044 --> 00:04:10.978
or by dropping it through that funnel right?

00:04:10.978 --> 00:04:11.536
- Right.

00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:12.664
- And then once we do that,

00:04:12.664 --> 00:04:15.416
we can then, if it meets the critera we can

00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:17.345
put it in this hole and analyze it.

00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:19.671
And after you analyze it you dump it overboard.

00:04:19.671 --> 00:04:20.373
- Yep.

00:04:20.373 --> 00:04:21.109
- Did I get it all right?

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:21.730
- Yep.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.576
- You're a good teacher.

00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:23.701
Clearly Megan's a genius,

00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:25.856
however there were still some questions that I had.

00:04:25.856 --> 00:04:28.405
I wanted to understand the exact interaction

00:04:28.405 --> 00:04:30.859
between drill bit and rock.

00:04:30.859 --> 00:04:32.672
Which is why I came to see Ryan.

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:33.619
What's your title?

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:35.104
- Drill systems engineer.

00:04:35.104 --> 00:04:36.394
- So what's this right here?

00:04:36.394 --> 00:04:37.064
What do you have?

00:04:37.064 --> 00:04:38.369
- This is a drill bit assembly.

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:39.174
- OK.

00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:42.082
- This is not only our drill bit,

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:45.079
which if you take a closer look this is a masonry bit,

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:47.992
it's not like the cutting bits that you have on

00:04:47.992 --> 00:04:50.485
your handheld carpentry drill.

00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:54.168
It's more of a chisel and it's designed for impact drilling.

00:04:54.168 --> 00:04:55.978
- OK. So how does it work?

00:04:55.978 --> 00:04:57.856
- So first we set our drill,

00:04:57.856 --> 00:05:00.501
preload our drill stabilizers against the rock

00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:03.348
to make sure that we have a nice stable configuration.

00:05:03.348 --> 00:05:05.771
Then we feed forward until we contact the rock.

00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:06.407
- OK.

00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:10.654
- We start our drilling operation with a process we call start hole.

00:05:10.654 --> 00:05:16.011
So if you can imagine, if we're on a rock and not perfectly aligned

00:05:16.011 --> 00:05:17.985
and there's all these surface features,

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:19.337
little divots on the rock,

00:05:19.337 --> 00:05:21.086
the bit's gonna want to walk around

00:05:21.086 --> 00:05:23.062
Imagine like if you're trying to cut metal

00:05:23.062 --> 00:05:26.103
you usually put a little pilot hole before you start drilling.

00:05:26.103 --> 00:05:27.934
- So you don't break the bit,

00:05:27.934 --> 00:05:29.939
Is that the same reason you do it here?

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:32.754
- Yeah, so we have a process we call start hole

00:05:32.754 --> 00:05:36.599
that starts the first 5mm of our hole

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:42.933
and basically what we're doing is chiselling little divots to carve out an asterisk shape.

00:05:42.933 --> 00:05:47.092
[hammer drill sound]

00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:51.615
Then we drill that out and we repeat that process

00:05:51.615 --> 00:05:54.752
as many times as it takes to get down to 5mm.

00:05:54.752 --> 00:05:57.665
Then we have a good starting point for the rest of our drilling.

00:05:58.336 --> 00:06:00.863
[hammer drill sound]

00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:03.190
It's not the rotation that's really cutting the rock

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.770
so much, it's really the hammering action.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.493
[hammer drill]

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.633
Like a jackhammer and then the rotation we do is mainly

00:06:13.633 --> 00:06:16.309
for drawing the powder up through the sheath.

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:19.637
We continuously drill until we bottom out the drill.

00:06:19.637 --> 00:06:22.518
Literally we're bumping up the front face of the

00:06:22.518 --> 00:06:24.225
drill bit assembly against the rock.

00:06:24.225 --> 00:06:27.912
Before we drill we do a triage,

00:06:27.912 --> 00:06:31.563
we drill a little bit so we can see what the powder is going to look like

00:06:31.563 --> 00:06:34.025
because we are worried about if it turns out

00:06:34.025 --> 00:06:37.929
that this material has, it's hydrated and it's

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:43.360
somewhat sticky then it could clog up our drill bit assembly.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.232
- Is it, on Mars?

00:06:44.232 --> 00:06:46.912
- It can be, and that's one of the interesting

00:06:46.912 --> 00:06:52.480
science findings recently is that there's a water cycle,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.770
an active water cycle near the surface of Mars

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.224
even at Gale Crater.

00:06:56.224 --> 00:06:59.202
- Do you have any of the drill bits that are outside of the drill head?

00:06:59.202 --> 00:07:02.526
- Not with me here but I can show you one at my desk

00:07:02.526 --> 00:07:05.424
if you're interested in seeing what that looks like.

00:07:05.424 --> 00:07:09.663
I have a 3D printed model of this where the bit itself is metal but the rest

00:07:09.663 --> 00:07:12.480
of the housing is clear plastic so you can see through.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.026
- No way, can we go do that?

00:07:14.026 --> 00:07:14.674
- Yeah.

00:07:14.674 --> 00:07:18.814
- So what you drill, you auger the material up into this right,

00:07:18.814 --> 00:07:19.594
this housing?

00:07:19.594 --> 00:07:23.206
- Exactly. Yeah into the first of our two chambers within the drill bit assembly.

00:07:23.206 --> 00:07:27.382
So we have two chambers in the drill bit assembly specifically

00:07:27.382 --> 00:07:31.196
so that it gives us some freedom to be able to move the

00:07:31.196 --> 00:07:34.971
robotic arm around without worrying about spilling

00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:38.144
material back out through the exit tube before we're ready

00:07:38.144 --> 00:07:39.208
to transfer it.

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:43.210
So once we draw it into the first chamber it's in that first chamber

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.935
until we transfer it through this little slot you can see here.

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:48.542
- Yeah.

00:07:48.542 --> 00:07:51.423
- So we transfer it through that slot.

00:07:51.423 --> 00:07:53.362
We use percussion to shake things up

00:07:53.362 --> 00:07:57.407
and we use gravity to control which direction the stuff is going.

00:07:57.407 --> 00:07:59.109
- So that's the mass flow you were talking about.

00:07:59.109 --> 00:07:59.627
- Yeah.

00:07:59.627 --> 00:08:01.424
- Can I pretend to be the robotic arm for a second?

00:08:01.424 --> 00:08:01.873
- Please.

00:08:01.873 --> 00:08:05.457
- Yeah OK so basically you've got that slot,

00:08:05.457 --> 00:08:08.009
and so you want to keep that slot down

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:10.047
so you want to go drill,

00:08:10.047 --> 00:08:12.208
and then you pick it up and as long as that slot's

00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:14.248
up top then you keep all your sample right?

00:08:14.248 --> 00:08:14.738
- That's right.

00:08:14.738 --> 00:08:16.252
- OK and so then at that point

00:08:16.252 --> 00:08:18.354
whenever you get it to where it needs to go you can then

00:08:18.354 --> 00:08:21.285
rotate it over and then dump it through that little slot right there

00:08:21.285 --> 00:08:22.546
into the next chamber?

00:08:22.546 --> 00:08:23.389
No wait back this way right?

00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:24.136
- That's right.

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:25.233
- OK so you kinda..

00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:26.461
- Through the slot to the second chamber.

00:08:26.461 --> 00:08:28.628
- Almost bumped, almost into your hand like this right?

00:08:28.628 --> 00:08:31.507
Nope, then you rotate again and it goes out that port.

00:08:31.507 --> 00:08:32.524
- That's right.

00:08:32.524 --> 00:08:39.574
[drill]

00:08:44.444 --> 00:08:47.344
- OK so we've drilled our rock and now we've got the powder

00:08:47.344 --> 00:08:48.601
on the inside of the rock.

00:08:48.601 --> 00:08:52.348
In a very specific circumstance if you find a special rock

00:08:52.348 --> 00:08:54.749
and you think you might actually have organic molecules

00:08:54.749 --> 00:08:57.490
on the inside of that rock, you've got to baseline your instruments.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.699
In order to do this, JPL got pretty clever.

00:08:59.699 --> 00:09:02.345
They put these cans on the front of the rover

00:09:02.345 --> 00:09:04.831
to be used only in certain circumstances.

00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:07.026
I'm gonna let Megan explain what they're for.

00:09:07.026 --> 00:09:09.708
So in these cans there's what's called OCM

00:09:09.708 --> 00:09:11.559
which is organic check material?

00:09:11.559 --> 00:09:12.424
- Yep that's right.

00:09:12.424 --> 00:09:15.143
- OK and so the idea is you have a known sample that you can test

00:09:15.143 --> 00:09:19.560
on Mars so that you can make sure that your sensors are operating correctly.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.529
- Right.

00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:24.209
- And so that's basically the same thing like the color pallete back there

00:09:24.209 --> 00:09:26.950
so that you can check that your cameras are working correctly,

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.636
this is the same thing for your sensors

00:09:28.636 --> 00:09:30.183
to see if you have life on Mars.

00:09:30.183 --> 00:09:33.254
- Right, for the instruments. For whatever science tool they want.

00:09:33.254 --> 00:09:34.482
- So you say that's organic,

00:09:34.482 --> 00:09:36.358
so that's pieces that were alive?

00:09:36.358 --> 00:09:38.332
- If you're looking for organics on Mars

00:09:38.332 --> 00:09:40.017
and you think you've found organics

00:09:40.017 --> 00:09:42.597
you want to send something that has no organics through

00:09:42.597 --> 00:09:44.669
and analyze it and make sure you don't see any,

00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:46.738
and then test the thing that has organics again.

00:09:46.738 --> 00:09:48.221
- Ohh. So what you're saying is,

00:09:48.221 --> 00:09:51.578
an organic check material is basically like

00:09:51.578 --> 00:09:54.236
eating a cracker that the fancy wine tasting guys do,

00:09:54.236 --> 00:09:55.620
- To clean out the..

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.978
- To clean the palate.

00:09:56.978 --> 00:09:59.602
Get on my level here. [laughs]

00:09:59.602 --> 00:10:01.084
So that's what that is.

00:10:01.084 --> 00:10:04.289
This is basically a bunch of crackers that you eat

00:10:04.289 --> 00:10:07.452
between your samples to make sure you know what's going on.

00:10:07.452 --> 00:10:08.087
Excellent.

00:10:08.087 --> 00:10:10.324
The next time you see a perfectly drilled hole

00:10:10.324 --> 00:10:11.387
in the surface of Mars,

00:10:11.387 --> 00:10:13.370
don't think about, you know, a drill press

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.589
or a percussion drill.

00:10:14.589 --> 00:10:17.535
Think about a precisely executed group of manoeuvres

00:10:17.535 --> 00:10:19.534
specifically designed to obtain dust.

00:10:19.534 --> 00:10:20.539
It works like this.

00:10:20.539 --> 00:10:22.704
You put the drill bit in,

00:10:22.704 --> 00:10:24.327
you take the drill bit out.

00:10:24.327 --> 00:10:26.259
You put the drill bit in,

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:28.357
and you auger the dust all out.

00:10:28.357 --> 00:10:31.844
You do the mass transfer by turning Chimra about,

00:10:31.844 --> 00:10:35.566
and that's how you dump the dust out.

00:10:35.566 --> 00:10:38.673
I just ruined the hokey pokey for the rest of your life.

00:10:38.673 --> 00:10:41.415
You are welcome, and I made that up and it's great.

00:10:41.415 --> 00:10:42.640
YES!

00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:44.658
I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day,

00:10:44.658 --> 00:10:46.492
it was brought to you by audible.com.

00:10:46.492 --> 00:10:48.846
Audible as you know is a really cool way

00:10:48.846 --> 00:10:51.238
where you can listen to audio books on your phone.

00:10:51.238 --> 00:10:53.371
Yeah you're smart people, you know where this is going.

00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:56.507
This is my audible.com library and right here at the top of the list,

00:10:56.507 --> 00:10:57.832
yep you guessed it,

00:10:57.832 --> 00:10:59.803
The Martian by Andy Weir.

00:10:59.803 --> 00:11:00.963
I know there's a movie out,

00:11:00.963 --> 00:11:02.639
but if you haven't experienced the book

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:04.133
you really need to do that.

00:11:04.133 --> 00:11:06.065
You can get any audio book you want for free

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:07.527
at audible.com/smarter.

00:11:07.527 --> 00:11:10.363
I recommend The Martian because there's way more science in the book

00:11:10.363 --> 00:11:12.431
than there was in the movie that you probably already watched.

00:11:12.431 --> 00:11:15.534
if you're sitting here watching a ten minute video about drilling on Mars.

00:11:15.534 --> 00:11:17.094
Anyway, I'm Destin.

00:11:17.094 --> 00:11:20.092
Thank you so much for even considering watching

00:11:20.092 --> 00:11:21.905
ten minutes worth of video on the Internet.

00:11:21.905 --> 00:11:23.002
I know that's a long time.

00:11:23.002 --> 00:11:25.712
Anyway, please consider subscribing if this added value to your life.

00:11:25.712 --> 00:11:27.458
Please consider supporting the sponsor.

00:11:27.458 --> 00:11:28.557
If not, no big deal.

00:11:28.557 --> 00:11:30.532
I appreciate you.

00:11:30.532 --> 00:11:31.280
I'm Destin,

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.412
you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:11:32.412 --> 00:11:34.181
Have a good one. Bye.

00:11:38.351 --> 00:11:42.662
Is it out of bounds.. [whispers] It's out of bounds.. Is it out of bounds to ask if I can high five the rover?

00:11:42.662 --> 00:11:46.148
- Umm.. you cannot do that because of ESD.

00:11:46.148 --> 00:11:47.962
- Can I.. OK you're grounded right?

00:11:47.962 --> 00:11:49.251
- So I'm grounded. We have..

00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:53.488
- Can I high five you, which is kind of like high fiving the rover

00:11:53.488 --> 00:11:55.129
cause you're at the same electric potential.

00:11:55.129 --> 00:11:56.070
Can we do this?

00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:59.232
No?

00:11:59.232 --> 00:12:01.174
- That's such a weird question.

00:12:01.174 --> 00:12:02.502
[laughs]

00:12:02.502 --> 00:12:03.979
- Yeah!

00:12:03.979 --> 00:12:08.695
[whispers] Megan we're like friends now. It took like 20 minutes. We're best friends.

00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:11.384
She's about to let me run a command.
