00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.340
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.960
It's a pleasure to see
everyone here in on

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.350
such an auspicious
holiday weekend.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.830
My name is Anya Creightney.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.890
I'm the programs
manager at the Poetry

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.290
and Literature Center
housed right here

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.310
in the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.980
The Poetry and Literature
Center is many things.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.040
In fact, we're the home
of the US Poet Laureate,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.890
who you may have even heard
of, Ms. Tracy K. Smith.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.770
But we're also a center devoted
to programing that engages

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.600
and promotes the intrinsic
value of literary arts.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.520
We're a place that believes
the imagination is one

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.640
of our most transformative
powers, building the way

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.590
for true and lasting enrichment.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.250
So, it's no surprise
we're elated

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.050
to celebrate todays panelist,
Bill Jones, Vess Quinlan,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.440
Dave Richmond, and Bruce Weigl.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.450
And we have another
last-minute attendee

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.610
who will special guest,
shortly thereafter.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.980
All poets who prove
what's possible

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.340
under poetry's big tent.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.150
Today, each poet
will share poems

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.390
from their favorite
World War I writers,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.260
as well as their own work.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.330
Afterward, we'll have
a short discussion

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.500
about the way poetry not only
relates to military experience,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.090
but enacts a full range
of creative expression.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.100
As you may have gathered by
now, throughout the course

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.750
of the day, this event
is being held in tandem

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.420
with the library's new and
major exhibition titled Echoes

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.780
of the Great War: American
Experiences of World War I.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.040
Last April, April
6th to be exact,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.890
marked the 100th anniversary
of the United States entry

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.940
into the war and this
exhibit tells the story

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.050
through correspondence, music,
film, recorded sound, diaries,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.770
posters, photographs,
scrapbooks, and so much more.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.230
If you haven't seen the
exhibit, you'll certainly want

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.250
to spend some time examining
the library's treasures.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.010
But of course, don't
rush out just yet.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.070
We've assembled this
talented group here today as

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.050
yet another way to honor
the World War I Centennial,

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.040
and of course to
celebrate Veterans Day.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.490
So, just how you have a sense
of how the program will run,

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.300
up first will be Bruce,
followed by the Cowboy Poets,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.530
and each poet will read
for approximately nine

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.830
to ten minutes followed

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.350
by a short discussion
and an audience Q&amp;A.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.260
I know our panelists
want to hear from you,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.050
so please be thinking of your
questions, and do wait for --

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.860
I'm told this has
to do with the wind,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.810
so if this happens throughout
the program it's not a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.690
jackhammer, it's wind.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.070
At any rate, I'm told our
panelists want to hear from you.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.170
So as the event goes on, please
be thinking of your questions

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.970
and do wait for someone
to bring you a microphone

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.330
so your question can be
captured for the video.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.380
Okay? So, with this all
in mind, let me dispense

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.000
with the formalities and
get to our bios here,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.110
and then we'll bring
on the poetry.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.260
Okay? Vess Quinlan began writing
after contracting polio in 1951.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.490
His grandma brought
him shoeboxes

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.450
of J. R. Williams cartoons
and cowboy poems cut

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.810
from years of livestock papers.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.080
Vess survived, one leg
shorter than the other,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.430
but never recovered from
the effect of those poems,

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.680
cartoons, and stories.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.560
The fourth generation to
raise livestock and feed,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.890
Vess became a working
partner on a rundown outfit

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.950
in Colorado's San Luis Valley,
where he raised alfalfa, cattle,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.480
kids, dogs, and sheep.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.750
He is an American Cowboy Poet,
widely considered to be one

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.340
of the most respected
poets of his genre.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.210
In fact, Vess attended the first
Cowboy gathering of Cowboy Poets

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.970
in 1985, known then,
as the Elko Gathering.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.590
And continues to
perform statewide.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.700
His writing is based on
his real-life experiences

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.660
as a rancher, which gives
his poetry a lifelike feel.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.420
His work has been published
in numerous books, magazines,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.480
as well as online
poetry publications.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.090
Bill Jones served
-- Bill Jones served

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.420
with the 3rd Marine Division

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.520
as an Artillery Forward
Observer in Vietnam.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.290
He went to boot camp
at Paris Island

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.890
and infantry training
and Camp Lejeune.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.680
"I ended up with the 105
Howitzer Battery is Vietnam,"

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.980
Jones said.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.120
"I had it better in Nam than
some, worse than the majority.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.410
One 10-day operation I saw
more combat than any time else.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.880
I remember praying
to live one more day

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.390
because it would have been
ridiculous a request even

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.790
of God to ask for a week."

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.130
Since returning from Vietnam,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.840
Bill Jones received a
Master's Degree in Psychology

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.640
and has held a variety of jobs
including railroad detective,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.190
which I want to know more about.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.390
He lives in Lander, Wyoming
and his business card reads,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.620
Bill Jones, Cowboy Poet.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.590
Dave Richmond came
from a military family

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.710
but had no desire to
pursue the military path.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.610
At 22 he was drafted to
the US Army where he served

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.800
with the 2nd Indianhead
Division in Korea.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.100
While performing a number

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.780
of different tasks during
rotation he enjoyed learning the

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.000
Korean language, which
enabled him as a squad leader

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.280
to communicate directly
with locals.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.980
He later served as
a mortar instructor.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.530
Upon returning from
his deployment,

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.370
Dave attended graduate
school under GI Bill,

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.670
where he earned a law degree

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.350
and became a Deputy
District Attorney.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.360
He was later appointed to
the municipal county position

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.440
as Assistant Presiding
Judge to the Superior Court

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.260
of Amador County in California.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.380
He's been a frequent visitor
of the Cowboy Poetry events.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.810
Bruce Weigl is the author
of more than a dozen books

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.580
of poetry, including <i>The
Abundance of Nothing </i>,

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.770
which was nominated
for the Pulitzer Prize.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.370
<i>The Unraveling Strangeness:
Archeology of the Circle</i>

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.310
<i>of New and Selected Poems </i>.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.520
And <i>Song of Napalm </i>, also
nominated for a Pulitzer.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.720
Bruce served in the Army
during the Vietnam War

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.900
and was subsequently
awarded the Bronze Star.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.750
So, without further ado,
I'm going to turn it

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.820
over to our distinguished panel.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.680
Bruce if going to kick it off.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.510
Thanks everyone.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:24.240
[ Applause ]

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.540
&gt;&gt; Bruce Weigl: Thank you.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.840
Can you hear me?

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.110
It's an honor to be here, and
especially to share the podium

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.950
with such distinguished guests.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.780
Four days ago, was
the 100th anniversary

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.330
of Wilfred Owens death, and
you know, that's significant

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.110
because he died on November 4th

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.610
and the Armistice was
signed on the 11th.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.550
The news just reached his
parents as the bells all

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.190
over England were ringing,
celebrating the end of the war.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.480
Wildred Owen's was only
25-years-old when he died.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.320
From a literary point of
view, I think of him a lot

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.150
like John Keats, who wrote
most of his great poems

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.640
that helped shape
English literature

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.140
for 250 years, died
when he was 26.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.520
It's difficult for me as
someone who has been a writer

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:26.930
and a teacher writing for
over 30 years to know exactly

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.800
where these poems come from.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.230
The depth of them.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.010
The depths of feeling.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:40.550
The remarkable insights
about the tiniest details.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.950
Usually don't come to writers

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.100
until they're in
their 30s or 40s.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.320
It takes a long time.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.970
And so, here's someone
in his 20s writing,

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.270
sometimes literally
in the trenches.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.440
It's almost a cliché
to talk about Owen's

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.860
that way, but it's true.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.300
So, I'm going to read my
favorite poem of Owen's.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.780
it's called <i>Dulce
et Decorum Est </i>,

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.840
which is a partial quote
from a Horace poem.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:15.950
And I don't think it
needs any introduction.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:21.020
"Bent double, like old beggars
under sacks, knock-kneed,

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.260
coughing like hags, we
cursed through sludge,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.780
till on the haunting
flares we turned our backs,

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.380
and towards our distant
rest began to trudge.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.400
Men marched asleep.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.040
Many had lost their boots,
but limped on, blood-shod.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.660
All went lame; all
blind; drunk with fatigue;

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:47.340
deaf even to the hoots
of tired outstripped 59s

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.030
that dropped behind."

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.900
That's artillery.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.200
"Gas! Gas!

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.500
Quick, boys!

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.900
An ecstasy of fumbling
fitting the clumsy helmets just

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.200
in time."

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.050
You know, like a 25-year-old
doesn't say 'an ecstasy

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.440
of fumbling'.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.440
There's a remarkable
image there.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.980
"An ecstasy of fumbling fitting
the clumsy helmets just in time,

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.010
but someone still was
yelling out and stumbling

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.340
and flound'ring like
a man in fire or lime.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.380
Dim through the misty panes
and thick green light,

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.640
as under a green sea,
I saw him drowning."

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.390
So, the green is the gas mask.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.590
He's looking through the
green glass in the gas mark.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.120
"In all my dreams
before my helpless sight,

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:36.230
he plunges at me,
guttering, choking, drowning.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.090
As if in some smothering dream,

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.220
you too could pace behind the
wagon that we flung him in,

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.820
and watch the white eyes
writhing in his face,

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:52.820
his hanging face, like a devil's
sick of sin; if you could hear,

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.810
at every jolt, the
blood come gargling

00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:00.090
from the froth-corrupted
lungs, obscene as cancer,

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.420
bitter as the cud of
vile, incurable sores

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:08.070
on innocent tongues, my
friend, you would not tell

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:13.840
with such high zest to children
ardent for some desperate glory,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.200
the old Lie: Dulce
et decorum est.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.930
Pro patria mori.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.970
When I first started trying
to think of myself as a poet,

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:37.680
I read the World War I poets.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.340
There wasn't a lot of
World War II poetry.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.310
There's some great World War
II poetry, but not a lot of it.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.300
And that's another discussion,

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.750
but the World War I
poems, they sang to me.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.980
As a Vietnam Veteran,
they sang to me

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.490
in a very personal
way for some reason.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.510
The kind of battles
that they're describing,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.890
the kind of warfare they're
describing rung a lot of bells.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:07.130
So, I really got next to
that whole handful of poets.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.320
Also, I wanted to say that if
you look at the body of work

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.500
that came out of -- just
really a half a dozen poets,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.250
they are among the very best
poems in our English language.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:22.830
So, this business about Veteran
poetry and soldier poetry,

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.800
that's one thing, but it's a
way to marginalize as well.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.570
And these poems are a part --

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.160
you know, when Yates put
together his Oxford anthology,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.430
he didn't include any
Wilfred Owen poems.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.140
And he said -- in response
to why he didn't, he said,

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.110
they are pitiful poems
about a pitiful war.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.190
Now, he's sort of
paraphrasing something

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:46.460
that Owen's had written in a
letter, and said, Owen's wrote,

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.920
'the poetry is in the pity'.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:54.180
And that's a very different
idea than what Yates' said.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.670
The poetry is in the pity.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:01.270
So, I got stuck on that
idea for a long time

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.380
as a writer myself began to
see -- began to understand --

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.900
began to really feel
just what that meant.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.670
Usually we would say
the pity is something

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.150
that we don't want in the poem.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.450
That we want to avoid that.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.840
That's too easy.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:24.770
But these people showed a
way to isolate those moments

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.840
and to bring that idea.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.100
You know, I have
one of these books

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:36.070
where when I close it the
poems move around inside.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:41.340
Do you have those kind
of -- so I can't find it.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.030
I'm going to read a poem of mine
that I wrote a long time ago.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.990
It's called <i>Song of Napalm </i>.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.920
Everyone here knows
what napalm is.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:07.120
Right? It's a gelatin
form of petroleum.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.410
So, imagine jelly that burns.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:11.880
So, when it's dropped, it sticks

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.680
on whatever its dropped
on and burned.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.290
So, I wanted to write a poem
about napalm because Mike O'Hara

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:23.360
in his great memoir said
that the quintessential sound

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.300
of the war was the whop, whop,
whop, whop of helicopters.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.020
Which I think he's right about.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.400
I try to think about what
the quintessential smell was.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.440
What was the smell -- I
remember these powerful smells,

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.270
and there's no smell to me
that's as powerful as napalm.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:47.910
Just imagine gasoline burning,
but then add a human body to it

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.040
and it becomes an
entirely different matter.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.710
So, the reason I
wanted to write a poem

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.080
about napalm was I thought

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.290
that people didn't really
know what was going on.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.610
That people didn't
really understand

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.420
that we were using
these kinds of weapons

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.300
on our fellow human beings.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.820
But I couldn't do it.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.360
I couldn't find a way
to make the horror

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.820
of it clear to non-combatants.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.690
As a gift, a friend of
mine sent me a framed copy

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.040
of a very famous <i>Newsweek
magazine </i>that has a little

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.460
Vietnamese girl running
from her village

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.950
which has just been bombed.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.520
Her name is Kim Phuc.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.500
And she did survive.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.540
And that cover I think
changed a lot of minds

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.260
in America about the war.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.780
Her little brother is running
behind her, and he lost an eye.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.920
So, I was working
on the napalm poem

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.110
and the magazine was on my desk.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.250
And then, suddenly I
realized, if I could bring her

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.920
into the poem then people would
see what I'm talking about.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.220
So that's what I tried to do.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.520
I probably never should
have said any of that,

00:14:52.520 --> 00:15:00.020
because now if it fails
then -- <i>Song of Napalm </i>.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.580
"After the storm, after
the rain stopped pounding,

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.840
we stood in the doorway
watching horses walk off lazily

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.960
across the pasture's hill.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.790
We stared through the black
screen, our vision altered

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:13.940
by the distance so I
thought I saw a mist kicked

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.600
up around their hooves
when they faded

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.170
like cut-out horses
away from us.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:25.190
The grass was never more blue
in that light, more scarlet;

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.990
beyond the pasture trees scraped
their voices into the wind,

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.300
branches crisscrossed
the sky like barbed wire

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.540
but you said they
were only branches.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.180
Okay. The storm stopped
pounding.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.210
I am trying to say
this straight:

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.090
for once I was sane
enough to pause

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.680
and breathe outside
my wild plans

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.420
and after the hard rain I turned
my back on the old curses.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.960
I believed they swung
finally away from me.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.200
But still the branches are wire

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.820
and thunder is the pounding
mortar, still I close my eyes

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.200
and see the girl running from
her village, napalm stuck

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.090
to her dress like jelly, her
hands reaching for the no one

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:11.530
who waits in waves
of heat before her.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:16.530
So, I can keep on living, so
I can stay here beside you,

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.050
I try to imagine she
runs down the road

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.650
and wings beat inside
her until she rises

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:26.590
above the stinking
jungle and her pain eases,

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.130
and your pain, and mine.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.640
But the lie swings back again.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.830
The lie works only as
long as it takes to speak

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.350
and the girl runs only as
far as the napalm allows

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:44.070
until her burning tendons and
crackling muscles draw her

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.270
up into that final position.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.720
Burning bodies so
perfectly assume.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:55.130
Nothing can change that;
she is burned behind my eyes

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:58.410
and not your good love
and not the rain-swept air

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:02.820
and not the jungle green
pasture unfolding before us can

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.370
deny it."

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:07.510
Thank you.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:31.100
[ Applause ]

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.640
&gt;&gt; Bill Jones: Well, it's
a pleasure to be here.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.900
You know, today is the
Marine Corps birthday.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:40.870
Do we have any Marine's
in the audience?

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.450
I know my friend Harvey.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.170
Happy birthday.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:46.990
Semper Fi sir.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:52.350
My friend Patrick Sullivan here
was a Navy Pilot during the

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:57.750
Vietnam War, in the Navy, and
of course the Marine's come

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.890
under the Department
of the Navy --

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.850
we're the men's department
[laughter].

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:06.770
Just kidding, just kidding Pat.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.220
But it's a pleasure to be here.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.750
And it's been really
a great trip.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:16.550
I picked a poem out I'm going
to do by E. E. Cummings.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.060
He's an American poet.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.800
And he's a poet that
writes in small case

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.630
and doesn't use any punctuation.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.010
So that kind of appeals to me.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:31.450
And he was an ambulance
driver in the first world war,

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.670
and he got in a little
trouble and sent home

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.290
because he made the statement,

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:41.250
"I'm having trouble
hating these Germans,"

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.780
and some people thought
that was treasonous.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:48.400
And he was a civilian ambulance
driver, and they sent him back

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.480
to the United States
where he got drafted.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.400
So, I guess -- I don't
know what you'd call that,

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.950
karma or something.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:01.680
But anyway, this poem by
E. E. Cummings is called,

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.580
<i>My Sweet Old Etcetera </i>.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:07.470
And I picked this out because
it's almost a cowboy poem.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:11.860
Almost. You'll see what
I mean a little later.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:16.710
"my sweet old etcetera, aunt
lucy during the recent war could

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:21.250
and what is more did tell you
just what everybody was fighting

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:27.360
for, my sister Isabel created
hundreds (and hundreds)

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:33.970
of socks not to mention shirts
fleaproof earwarmers etcetera

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:37.110
wristers etcetera,
my mother hoped

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:42.070
that I would die etcetera
bravely of course my father used

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:47.170
to become hoarse talking
about how it was a privilege

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:53.440
and if only he could meanwhile
my self etcetera lay quietly

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:59.420
in the deep mud et cetera
(dreaming, et cetera,

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:08.130
of your smile eyes knees
and of your etcetera)."

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.430
Some of you have a dirty mind.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.210
I can see that already
[laughter].

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.690
But I thought I'd talk a
little about Cowboy Poetry.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.160
A lot of folks don't --
haven't heard of Cowboy Poetry.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.910
It's a big thing out West,

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:23.490
and not many people have
heard of it back here.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:29.040
But Baxter Black, one of the
well-known Cowboy poets said

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.630
that Cowboy Poetry is
somewhere between good taste

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.640
and throwing up in your hat.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:43.740
Others have said that Cowboy
Poetry is an oxymoron,

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.370
a contradiction in terms.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:51.430
You know, kind of like military
intelligence, or rap music,

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.450
or postal service,

00:20:54.450 --> 00:21:00.230
or my all-time favorite
oxymoron, mobile home estates.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:08.920
Uh-huh. Anyway, my first -- my
first exposure to Cowboy Poetry,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.350
I was a police detective
for almost 20 years --

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:15.730
one of these cities
back east here,

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.210
I forget which one it was now.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.510
They're all the same.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.810
And I got busted up
and forced to retire.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:25.700
I've always loved
the cowboy thing.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.990
The mystique, and the
mystery, and the myth

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.290
of the American cowboy.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.590
I liked everything about it.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.470
The horses, the spurs,
everything.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:36.040
So, when I got healed up,
I packed up the family

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.230
and I moved to Wyoming.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:46.710
The first job I got was
a cook on a wagon train,

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:50.440
and we took people on
three and four wagon trips

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:56.590
on the original Oregon
Trail in period wagons.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:59.010
And it was a neat deal really.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.520
It was just like it was 1843,

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.620
except we had ice
and Coors Light.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.710
Other than that,
everything was the same.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:15.860
So, one night there at the
Oregon Trail a doctor friends

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.360
of mine, a cowboy doctor friend
of mine rode his horse out to --

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.770
in the middle of nowhere.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.860
Ten or 12 miles out in
the middle of nowhere.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.770
And he spent the night,
and round the fire

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:31.010
that night he recited
some poetry.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.730
And I still remember to this
day which poem he recited.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:38.790
It was Bruce Kiskaddon's <i>When
They Finishing Shipping Cattle</i>

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.160
<i>in the Fall </i>.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.320
It goes -- it starts out,
"Well, you're not exactly blue,

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.980
but you don't feel like you
used to do, in the summer

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.920
of the long hot summer
days, because your feelings

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.560
on the weather seem to go
together, and your quiet

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.140
in the dreamy autumn haze."

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.770
And it goes on from there,
a long melancholy poem

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:04.850
about a guy reflecting on
his life in the saddle.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:09.330
And as he was -- as he
was reading this poem,

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.080
I looked around the fire
there and we had some guys

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:17.150
that handled the mules -- hard
living, hard drinking guys --

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:20.200
and as this poem was being
recited, I looked at them,

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.650
at least two of them had tears
big as horse turds rolling

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.030
down their cheeks [laughter].

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.770
And I'm thinking, this
is some powerful stuff.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:31.420
And I'd like to be part of this.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:36.930
So, I wrote my first poem
called, <i>A Cooks Revenge </i>,

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:43.130
and I sent it to <i>Western
Horseman Magazine </i>and they

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.430
published it.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:45.730
First poem I ever wrote.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.030
I thought this is great.

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.330
A new career.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.080
I'm going to make a fortune now.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.080
And what I did -- I was
too dumb to realize,

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.820
this almost never happens.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.160
To get your first
poem published.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:01.370
So, I'll do the poem for you.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.080
"Cookin' ain't no easy
thing if anyone should ask.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.470
And cookin' for a cowboy crew's
a downright thankless task.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.160
The grub is cold,
the boys will say,

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.470
or else there's too much salt.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:16.770
Any blame to pass around, you
can bet it's all my fault.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:19.850
Well, the eggs get
broke, the biscuits burn,

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.610
the griddle won't get hot.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.880
Try to bake an apple
pie sometime

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.290
when apple's you ain't got.

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.900
One time I fixed
some French cuisine,

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.790
served fancy wine and such.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:35.400
The boys all moaned
and held their guts,

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.220
they didn't like it much.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:43.820
The boss, he held his tin
plate high like he'd fished it

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:48.210
from a sewer, and the boys
described my gourmet meal

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:52.060
with a word that means manure.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.550
They hurt my pride,
them cowboys did.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.130
I almost walked away.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:01.030
But then again, revenge
is sweet.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.850
There'd be another day.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:05.890
The answer finally came to
me in the middle of a drunk.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:10.680
I'd make the ignorant cowboys
pay, I'd feed them boys a skunk.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:15.750
So, I found an old dead
polecat, a layin' in the road,

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.940
boiled him up one afternoon,
threw in a horny toad.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.820
That night I piled their
tin plates high but much

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.870
to my surprise, those dad
burned heathens ate it all.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:27.920
I couldn't believe my eyes.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.640
I started once to tell them
that the whole thing was a joke,

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.870
but by now they'd
burped contently

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.480
and reared back for a smoke.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.800
Cookie they said gleefully,
you've finally learned to cook.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.100
Can we have the recipe?

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.940
Did you get it from a book?

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:48.140
Well, those cowboys had no
idea, and they ain't found out

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:52.340
yet that they was
feasting on some critters

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.130
that ought not to be ate.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.940
Yeah, cookin' in
a real tough job.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.680
It ain't no easy life.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.740
And well, if my food
you just can't eat,

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.690
be glad I ain't your wife."

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.050
So anyway, that's
kind of what --

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.510
that's kind of what
a Cowboy Poet is.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:14.260
[ Applause ]

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:21.630
But anyway, Cowboy poetry,
it's taken it a 150 years

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.150
to become an overnight success.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:29.180
And the recent research on some
Cowboy Poetry like Anya said,

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:33.800
happened in 1985 in Elko,
Nevada when Waddie Mitchel,

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.750
a Nevada buckaroo, and Hal
Cannon, a folklorist set

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:44.870
up a bunch of folding chairs
and invited some local cowboys

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.750
and ranchers to come and
share poems and stories.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:51.720
They were scared to death
that nobody was going to come.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.690
Well, they did come and
they've been coming ever

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.830
since by the thousands.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.350
I mean, the whole
town for a week turns

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:02.680
into cowboy music,
poetry, and whatnot.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.210
I didn't get there till
the number three Cowboy

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.510
Poetry Festival.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.500
The Gathering, it's called.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:13.580
And trying to think where I'm
trying to go with this thing.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:17.820
Anyway, it's just
a wonderful thing.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:22.960
People describe it as kind
of a big family reunion,

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.310
except that people like
one another [laughter].

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.930
So that's probably -- and I look
forward to going every year,

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.100
and I've made some
wonderful friends there.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.440
In fact, on the Board

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:39.560
of Trustees is my friend Pat
Sullivan, and Dave Richmond,

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.950
and Vess Quinlan, my
long-term friend Vess.

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.970
And I'm going to have to
start treating them all

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:49.430
with a little more
respect because, you know,

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.850
I knew them all when
they were nothing.

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:54.210
That's nothing.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:28:02.820
So anyway, about 1989 we
tried some war poetry.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:07.370
I think the first time Vess was
in Durango, Colorado, wasn't it?

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:09.590
Me and my late friend
Rod McQueary,

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:13.370
who was a wonderful Cowboy Poet,
wrote classic Cowboy Poetry --

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:17.360
it'll be around as long as
there's sagebrush on the plains.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.320
And he left us far too early.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:25.120
But we got together and about
1990 we published a book

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:29.780
of our -- he was another
Marine Vietnam Veteran --

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.990
and we published some poems
and it was published --

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:35.260
called <i>Blood Trails </i>.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:40.490
And it wasn't at least in
the Cowboy Poetry genre --

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.600
I wanted to use that
word, genre --

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.790
it wasn't very well
accepted at all.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:50.080
People said it had no
place in Cowboy Poetry.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.630
That we need to stick to
the poems about a bull

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:55.310
with a bugle stuck
up his behind.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.950
And they didn't like it.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:00.780
But it got some pretty
good reviews.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.170
<i>People Magazine </i>said it
was 'stunning and poignant'.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:06.470
I didn't know what
poignant meant.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:07.770
I had to look it up.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:09.600
Because I had no
idea what it was.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.940
And it's been -- some poems
in there have been published

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.440
in well, for the
last 30 years almost,

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.580
in a lot of different
anthologies.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.700
And I said all that to say,

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.740
nobody is more surprised
than me.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.640
I was very surprised.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.560
And it's just been -- in
fact, Pat's got a copy

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.860
of the book right now.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.160
You can still buy it on Amazon.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.460
It's out of print.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.930
You can't still buy it on
Amazon for, I don't know,

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.420
three bucks, something
like that.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:44.040
And anyway, here recently I just
published another book called

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.630
<i>The Body Burning
Detail </i>, based on a poem

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.150
in that book 30 years ago.

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.350
And it's kind of -- it's
a memoir of my Vietnam.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:56.060
I was drafted in the
Marine's in 1968.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:30:01.560
Sent to Vietnam, and
I spent 11 months,

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.710
25 days, and 13 hours there.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.040
Not that I was counting.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.410
But the book here --

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.770
and I didn't write this
book to make any money.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:17.110
And so far, that parts worked
out real good [laughter].

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:22.480
But if you have any interest
in it, give me your address

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.940
and I'll send you
one when I get home.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:29.060
I've already given all of them
out that I brought with me.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.220
You might like it.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.950
Anyway, that's my picture on
the front, and I didn't --

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:36.790
I didn't ask them to put
my picture on the front.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:41.970
That was 50 years
and a 100 pounds ago.

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:45.650
And Baxter Black, the
guy I mentioned at first,

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:50.280
told me that there's one group
of people worse than lawyers

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.580
and that's book publishers.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.250
And I think he's probably right,

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:56.170
because I've been
kind of disappointed.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.440
Of course, they paid -- I guess
they can do whatever they want

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.980
since they picked up the tab.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:06.740
So anyway, if I could --
do I have five minutes?

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.920
Yes. I thought I'd read a
short chapter from the book.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.440
And this book is called -- I
mean, this chapter is called,

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.930
A Live Dog and a Dead Lion.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:24.280
And it's -- I put a quote
before each chapter.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:29.440
And this particular quote
is from Johnny Paycheck,

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.290
and it says, "Take
this job and shove it.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:35.070
I ain't working here no more."

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:37.050
3rd Battalion 12th Marine's,

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:42.090
3rd Marine Division
Headquarters, September 1968.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:45.700
It is not the worst place one
could choose to spend a war.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.000
The battalion headquarters

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.560
at Quang Tri South
Vietnam has a mess hall

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.250
where the chow is semi-edible.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.970
Barracks are plywood hooch's

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.260
with some nearby
cold-water showers.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.980
At the enlisted men's club, a
world-class sound system pounds

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:07.010
out Janice Joplin
and Jimmy Hendrix.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:12.510
While listening to Procol Harum
wail <i>A Whiter Shade of Pale </i>,

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:17.400
it is sometimes possible to
forget you are even in Vietnam.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.010
The 15-cent beer also
helps quite a bit.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:24.480
In the rear with the
gear and the beer.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.440
Not a bad life.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:31.750
The proverbial flaw in this
otherwise somewhat pleasant mix

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.800
is my job.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:40.540
As a new guy or FNG, an acronym
that is easy to decipher,

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:44.320
my assignment is to
burn the shitters.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.240
Human waste does
not burn easily.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.630
It is necessary to pull
55-gallon drums, cut in half,

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:55.520
and placed strategically beneath
a three holer, dose the contents

00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.860
with diesel fuel, and set
the unholy mess ablaze.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.790
The top layer burns
easily enough,

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:08.490
but what remains must be stirred
like soup in a giant caldron.

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:12.410
The smoke and noxious
smells are inescapable.

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.630
Saturating clothes
and hair, and clinging

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:17.880
to the back of your throat.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.810
To say this unpleasant --

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:24.010
to say this task is
unpleasant is perhaps the mother

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.570
of all euphemisms.

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.450
A story making the rounds,
no doubt on the same level

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:34.700
as an urban myth, relates how
a newly arrived FNG is assigned

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.980
to this particular detail.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:41.150
Unfortunately, someone
fails in his responsibility

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:44.500
to issue proper instructions.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:48.940
An inferno at the
officer's facility ensues.

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.630
Rather than pull
the barrels out,

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.840
he sets the whole
building on fire.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.970
As flames leap skyward,
he patients explains

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:01.320
that his orders were
to burn the shitters.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.850
After about a week,
a young Private shows

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:07.320
up one morning to
be my assistant.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.880
Since I am a Private
First Class,

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.000
I take this as an opportunity

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.880
to showcase my leadership
potential.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.700
Apparently, this whole
assignment, shitty as it is,

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:23.430
is merely a test the
Marines have orchestrated

00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:27.310
to determine my suitability
for much bigger

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:30.170
and better responsibilities.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:34.280
I resolved to become the most
efficient shit burning Private

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:38.430
First Class in the history
of the Marine Corps.

00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:39.730
As fate would have it though,

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:43.220
my new charge knows
considerably more

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:45.860
about burning shit than I do.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:50.750
He is not an FNG, and this
assignment is not his first shit

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:52.880
burning rodeo.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:56.910
In country for over six
months, initially sent

00:34:56.910 --> 00:35:01.920
to an artillery battery
on the DMZ, wounded twice,

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.210
although by his own
admission, not very seriously,

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:09.260
he decides he has had enough.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:14.440
I am not going back he
informs the First Sergeant.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.180
Do whatever you want with me.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:22.210
Incidentally, this seems like
an act of bravery in of itself.

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:25.430
The First Sergeant
is a 30-year man

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:28.040
who picks his teeth with a nail.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:32.990
He looks like a weight
lifting bulldog with a crewcut.

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:35.990
My assistant, a young kid
not long out of high school

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.210
from somewhere in the Midwest,

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:41.410
explains his reason
to me thusly.

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:44.510
They are trying to
kill me, he says.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.580
Two chances is all they get.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.200
Who is trying to
kill you, I ask?

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.570
He looks at me like
-- he looks at me

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:59.780
like I have a foot-long
penis growing out of my ear.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.810
Maybe even both ears.

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:03.130
The Gooks he replies.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:04.430
Who do you think?

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:05.730
The Gooks.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:10.660
Strangely enough, this
pronouncement is a revelation.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:14.450
Even after boot camp,
infantry, and artillery school,

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:22.490
the idea that Gooks are trying
to kill us is still surprising.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:30.130
By us, I mean Marine's
and by extension, me.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:36.320
This rear area shit burning job
is looking better all the time.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.650
At the mess hall my assistant
and I have a table all

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:45.180
to ourselves, no doubt having to
do with our present occupation.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.380
We talk. My Private
has been busted

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.390
and threatened with the brig.

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.970
Even his present
job is an attempt

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:56.280
to shame him into submission.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.810
Nothing works.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:02.190
An appointment with a military
shrink does not go well.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:05.310
Especially when he tells
the psychiatrist officer

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:09.220
that if he felt that strongly
about returning to duty,

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:12.020
maybe he should get his
own fat ass up on the DMZ.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:16.490
It seemed somewhat of a stretch

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:21.560
to call someone twice wounded
a coward, but apparently those

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:27.160
in position of safety have
no qualms in doing so.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:32.610
Suspected cowardice
is embarrassing

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:35.080
to those in no danger.

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:40.040
Later, I find those in actual
combat are far more reluctant

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.920
to pass judgment.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:46.780
Everyone, they would usually
say, has a breaking point.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.970
One morning, we are
half-heartedly going

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:52.980
about our duties when my
reluctant warrior splashes some

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.830
diesel fuel on his legs.

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:59.750
Too close to the flames,
his clothes catch on fire.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.370
As he rolls around
on the ground,

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:04.920
we extinguish his
smoldering trousers

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.870
by beating them out
with our hands.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:11.360
One leg is already
starting to blister.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.080
It is not a minor burn.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.220
As he hobbles toward the
battalion aid station,

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.420
a bit of scripture
comes to mind.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:24.940
A live dog is better
than a dead lion.

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.450
But this is not really accurate.

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:30.720
The kid is not a dog or a lion.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:35.220
Just a skinny 18-year-old
who has seen war up close

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:39.570
and finally decides
that he has had enough.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:45.140
It briefly occurs to me that
I have never seen him smile.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.420
I never see him again."

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.510
Thank you very much.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:39:09.890
[ Applause ]

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:12.680
&gt;&gt; Dave Richmond: Boy, you
can't make Bill Jones up.

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:15.410
Bill and I share
something in common.

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:19.690
We've been going to the Cowboy
Poetry Gathering since 1988.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:23.740
At the Cowboy Poetry Gathering
we trade witticisms like,

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.880
'Don't squat with your spurs
on', 'Don't drink downstream

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.330
from the herd', and 'quit
yanking on the stump

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:33.890
when you can plow around it'.

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:38.240
The poetry gathering started
in 1985, as Bill Said.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:41.110
And was designed
in the wintertime

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:45.080
when cowboys had nothing
to do but repair gear,

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.840
be in a line shack and get
ready for the snow to melt.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:54.480
And it is a transformation
for me,

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.520
30 years now I think
it's going to be,

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.820
Bill and I's 31st, whatever.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:02.860
And it is something to behold.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.180
It's not just a poetry
gathering.

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:08.000
It's a cultural event.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.990
Writing workshops, copyright
workshops, cooking classes,

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:14.160
the whole community is involved.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:19.480
Elementary school kids,
junior high school kids,

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:25.430
with art contests, music,
and I very much encourage it.

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:30.030
Elko, Nevada is the daddy
of all cowboy gatherings.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.800
Every year, the end
of January to 1st

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.790
of February, Elko, Nevada.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:40.550
Bruce and I share a favorite
World War I poet, Wilfred Owen.

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:44.100
Wilfred Owen was a
remarkable poet and died,

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:49.650
as Bruce mentioned, not long
before the Armistice was signed.

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:53.360
He wrote a poem called the
<i>The Send-Off </i>, early in 1918,

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.950
which I think is --
all his poems are good.

00:40:56.950 --> 00:41:00.240
If you get a chance,
if you can find it,

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:04.990
Sir Richard Burton
reciting Wilfred Owen poems.

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:08.450
I had that album on vinyl,
and it burnt up in a fire.

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:10.400
Probably the most
powerful recitation

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:14.070
of Wilfred Owen's poems
you could ever imagine.

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:17.320
This is <i>The Send-Off </i>.

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.620
Down the close, darkening
lanes they sang their way

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:27.340
to the siding-shed and lined
the train with faces grimly gay.

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.380
Their breasts were stuck
all white with wreath

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:35.260
and spray as men are, dead.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:41.990
Dull porters watched them, and a
casual tramp stood staring hard,

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:45.570
sorry to miss them
from the upland camp.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:53.700
Then, unmoved, signals nodded,
and a lamp winked to the guard.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:59.050
So secretly, like wrongs
hushed-up, they went.

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:01.400
They were not ours:
We never heard

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.700
to which front they were sent.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:09.390
Nor there if they yet
mock what women meant

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:12.530
who gave them flowers.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:17.800
Shall they return to beatings of
great bells in wild trainloads?

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:25.670
A few, a few, too few for drums
and yells, may creep back,

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:31.450
silent, to still village
wells up half-known roads."

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:35.560
Wilfred Owen.

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.610
I'm not going to do any cowboy
poetry accept a couple Rod

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:43.280
McQueary's from the
perspective of cowboys

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.150
who come home after war.

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:49.940
But I am going to do a
poem called <i>Spider Man </i>.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.450
I was in the DMZ in South
Korea's patrol leader

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:55.470
in 1967, 1968.

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:58.330
Commander Bucher and the Pueblo
were captured in the Fall

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:02.520
of 1967, and little known
to most the American public,

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:09.730
because LBJ and McNamara didn't
really want the public to know.

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:13.100
There was a second Tet
offensive in South Korean.

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.200
Simultaneous Tet offensive.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.600
Thirty-one North Korean
commandos were tasked to go

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.800
to Seoul, assassinate Chung-hee
Park who was then the President

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.190
of South Korea, to --

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:27.660
as a prelude to an
invasion of the south.

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:34.410
So, what happened was a lot of
men who were wounded in Vietnam

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:37.220
that didn't rotate
home came to us.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:40.850
And we had guys from
101st Airborne,

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:43.370
4th Infantry Division,
you name it.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:48.770
And we had this one guy,
his name was Spider Man.

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:52.310
As you well know, I remember
one full name of anybody

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:53.980
that I met in the military.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.520
It was always a nickname.

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.480
Because -- I don't
know why, maybe it --

00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.800
they wouldn't be
there the next day.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.570
Who knows.

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:06.180
Well, this guy would not answer
to anything but Spider Man,

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:11.340
and that was his personality.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:18.250
And, he -- I always wondered
what happened to this young guy.

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:23.890
"Fingertips glue hooch wall,
leg cocked in flimsy anchor,

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:26.730
head jerks, a robotic doll.

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:29.980
Black eyes pierce
this is terror.

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:35.760
Teeth flash, warm white smiles,
guzzles his alcoholic pin.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:41.860
Drowns memories, reviles, in
torpid piss pant oblivion.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:49.000
Now ancient soul of 19, past
his 16-year enlistment lie.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.190
Earned three stripes at 17.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:56.660
Wes Moreland's Bronze Star, CIB.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:02.540
Third in country tour cut short
by bungee state trap laid.

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:05.770
Midst Nam Tet offensive
a thwart,

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:09.010
North Korean blue house raid.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:12.190
Quick recoup in Tachikawa,
Japan.

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:15.700
Flew to Korean demilitarized
zone.

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.140
Joined frozen, chosen,
marching men,

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:23.760
prowling Imjin river,
gravestones.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.710
In the bush, Spidey on the hunt.

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:30.860
Ascidian fastigiated,
eyes devoid.

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:33.920
Chills your soul with a grunt.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.870
Pitiless stalking arachnoid.

00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:43.350
His snare spins gossamer puke,
hangs trophies in its web.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:49.930
Splintered visions of Gooks
entombed in copper steel mesh.

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:56.610
Ambushes any clueless prey
like buff hunter on a stand.

00:45:56.610 --> 00:46:03.700
How will deadly aim parlay,
when all the game is canned?

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.820
[Inaudible], Spider Man."

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:12.050
Rod McQueary and Bill
Jones collaborated

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:15.720
in probably the best
collaboration of Vietnam poetry

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.060
that anybody could read, and I'm
going to plug it again for Bill.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.770
Rod McQueary, I did
not know Rod.

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:24.270
He was a very close
friend of Bill's.

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:28.190
But I met Rod and he
was a fine young guy.

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:30.950
Grew up in Northern
Nevada cowboying

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:34.100
and went into the Marine's.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:38.720
And many of us who
came home in that era,

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.730
we didn't get the
homecoming that you do now.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:46.400
We -- it was a terrible time.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:50.320
I remember -- I got
drafted at 22,

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:54.990
and I ran out of 2S deferment.

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:56.770
And I said, well what
am I going to do now?

00:46:56.770 --> 00:47:02.500
So, VISTA, Volunteers
in Service to America.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.880
Well, I got my acceptance
papers from VISTA the day

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.390
after I got my draft
notice [laughter].

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:12.230
And there was a lot
of us in that boat.

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:14.720
I remember going back, and
I was asked to come back --

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:19.060
a guy I knew, Greg Campbell,
he was a history professor

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:22.670
and he asked me to come in
uniform and speak to his class.

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:26.750
And I had sat in that same
classroom a year or so ago.

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:29.050
And when I walked in, half

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:32.780
of his students turned
their chairs to the wall.

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:38.110
That messes with your mind.

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:43.780
This is called <i>Yellow
Ribbons </i>by Rod McQueary.

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.180
"Albuquerque 1991, I wandered

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:51.150
out of the airport
restaurant, curious, cautious.

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:53.730
Stand by a purple pillar.

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:58.600
Watch the noisy crowd of
people grow and grow and grow.

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:02.810
Silver foil balloons, welcome
banners, eagles on t-shirts,

00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:07.320
lots of flags, yellow
ribbons, everywhere.

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.430
Passengers scurry
through this happy mob

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:14.840
as if embarrassed a
little, to clutter the path.

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:19.680
Finally, returning warriors
pierce the circle, are devoured

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:25.470
by laughing, sobbing women,
cheering, hugging men.

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:28.480
Fierce with joy.

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:32.960
I watch all this, ashamed
for my selfish thoughts.

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:37.400
This is now, the
past is gone forever.

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:44.580
Slowly, the happy mob moves left
towards the escalator to get

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:48.960
to the parties, parades,
vacations, lives.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.810
Mine's accepting it's over.

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:57.310
No one seems to see a
quiet cowboy standing

00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:02.260
by the purple pillar,
holding his hat in his hand."

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:07.350
This is another poem of Rod's.

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:11.410
And I think Rod wrote
this after he was able

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:15.240
to reconcile a lot of things.

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.000
You never reconcile them all.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.330
It's kind of like a cancer cell.

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:23.510
It's always there and
it goes into remission,

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:25.930
and then sometimes
it comes back,

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:29.740
and sometimes it multiplies
faster than you want it.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.050
If you can control it,

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:36.290
if you can sublimate
it, you might be okay.

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:40.500
And this is called <i>For Life </i>.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:44.480
" If life were just one
April day, and I should wake,

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.740
mid-afternoon, to feel
the sunshine on my shirt,

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:53.360
warm scattered raindrops
wet my cheek,

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:58.660
I'd marvel with my newborn eyes
at the beauty I had never seen.

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:03.280
If life should be one April day,
I'll not pine for a morning,

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:08.200
lost, nor mourn some
teenage innocence.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:12.130
But hand in hand, my love
and I will lift one cup

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:14.450
for fallen friends" --

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:31.270
Excuse me.

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:33.850
"Then, our business done,

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:37.240
we'll laugh till
wrinkles frame our eyes.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.630
And in these final
precious hours,

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:43.030
we'll celebrate the
evening time."

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:44.330
Rod McQueary.

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:46.130
Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Vess Quinlan: Thank
you all for coming.

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:15.740
I am the only one on this
stage that is not a Veteran.

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:22.640
And the honor of being up here
is more than I can really say.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:26.960
We're short on time so
I'm going to ask Patrick

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.930
to do a poem he wanted to do.

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:33.710
He sent me -- sent us all some
books from his collection.

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:36.820
He supported this thing
from the very beginning.

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.220
He sent me an email and he said,

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:45.900
"I pray that the World War
I poem session will end

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:49.650
with through the poem <i>Aftermath</i>
-- with the <i>Aftermath </i>poem.

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:52.110
I told him that I was not
qualified nor authorized

00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:54.920
to grant prayers, but
I'd do what I could,

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:58.410
and on his way back from Ireland
he said, he memorized the poem,

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:00.880
and Patrick would you do that?

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.330
And I'll end this with the
reason I'm last is I'm famous

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:05.940
for short poems.

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:07.370
I got a whole lot
of real short ones.

00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:08.670
They go fast.

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:09.970
And I collect them.

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:13.230
Poems like <i>The Ode to
the Jumper Cables </i>,

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:15.710
"Red's hot, black's not."

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:23.580
And somebody said, that's way
too long a poem [laughter].

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:26.720
I said, I know a shorter one.

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.970
It's called <i>The Ode to
the Flea </i>, Adam had 'em.

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:32.880
I thought, that'll do it.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:36.730
And then somebody said,
that's too long a poem.

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:38.660
It's got too many words.

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:42.510
<i>The Ode to the Miniature
Horse </i>, "Why?"

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:46.150

&gt;&gt; Patrick Sullivan: For
those who work with Veterans,

00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:12.680
I could not recommend
this book more.

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:59.440
And a particular poem in
there called <i>White Wall </i>.

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.300
You can probably figure
out what it's about.

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:04.900
But they're fairly easy to get.

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:10.950
I recommended a -- what,
I sent three or four books

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:20.690
with maybe 200 yellow stickies
stuck all through there

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:25.210
that [inaudible] and
eight-hour poetry session

00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:34.210
on just World War I poetry.

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:40.820
Starting at the beginning
of course with [inaudible]

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:46.040
and ending with this poem
by Siegfried Sassoon.

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.080
Wilfred Owen was such a
good poet [inaudible].

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:51.970
He got to spend months
in Craiglockhart

00:54:51.970 --> 00:55:05.670
with Siegfried Sassoon who
was quite a hero up until 1917

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:10.020
when he wrote a letter
to Parliament saying

00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:13.270
that he thought that the
war was desperate crime,

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:19.300
and that too many young men were
being killed for very little.

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:26.680
So, he was a war protester far
earlier than any of my friends.

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:30.780
Anyway, do I have it memorized?

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:33.550
Pretty close, but not exactly.

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:40.330
So, this is called <i>Aftermath </i>.

00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:46.730
It was written in March 1919,

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:50.430
just as the peace
conference was starting.

00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:57.550
Everybody was talking
about the Armistice.

00:55:57.550 --> 00:55:59.630
Great things going on.

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:07.490
All these great world
leaders getting together,

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:16.140
talking about the
future of the world.

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:24.030
He thought people
were being forgotten.

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:28.570
" Have you forgotten yet?

00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:36.670
The world's events have rumbled
on since those gagged days,

00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:44.620
like traffic checked at
the crossing of city ways:

00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:52.310
and the haunted gap in your
mind has filled with thoughts

00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:58.740
that flow like clouds in
the flit heavens of life;

00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:01.430
and you're a man reprieved to
go, taking your peaceful share

00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:03.620
of time, with joy to spare.

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:08.200
But the past is just the
same, and War's a bloody game.

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.500
Have you forgotten yet?

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:10.800
Swear by the slain of the
War that you'll never forget.

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.100
Do you remember the dark months
in the sector before Mametz?

00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:13.400
The nights you watched
and wired and dug

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:14.700
and piled sandbags on parapets?

00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:16.000
Do you remember the rats;
and the stench of the corpses

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.300
in front of the front-line
trench?

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:18.600
And dawn coming, dirty-white,
and chill, merciless rain?

00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:19.900
Did you ever stop and ask,
'Will it ever happen again?'

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:21.200
Do you remember the
din before the attack?

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.500
The anger, the blind compassion
that seized and shook you

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:23.800
as you look into the doomed
and haggard faces of your men?

00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:25.100
Do you remember the
stretcher-cases lurching back

00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:26.400
with dying eyes and
lolling heads?

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:27.700
And the grey ashen
masks of the lads

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:29.000
who were once keen, kind, gay?

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.300
Have you forgotten yet?

Look up, and by the
green of this Spring,

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.900
swear that you'll never forget."

00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:12.680
And it's been going on since
I think the beginning of time.

00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.400
I never was really a cowboy.

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.700
I was a ranch hand.

00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:17.490
My granddad was a cowboy.

00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:19.980
And we'd move -- I'd move to
ranches all over the country

00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:22.140
and work there for
a little while

00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:23.870
and then go to another one.

00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:29.080
And I got to thinking about how
difficult that was for my wife.

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:34.280
Little family moved way in the
middle of nowhere and living

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.740
in an adobe house some place.

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:39.790
And so, I decided I
would apologize to her.

00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:44.030
This poem is called
<i>The Apology </i>.

00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:46.450
And for some odd reason,
I got in a lot of trouble

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:48.820
for not getting my rhymes
at the end of the lines

00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:50.520
like they're supposed to.

00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.310
And this poem came that way.

00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:56.040
It's called <i>The Apology </i>.

00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.630
"Did you ever step
across a horse

00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:00.030
in the chill before the dawn

00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:03.460
and leave a woman wondering
how long you would be gone?

00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:06.970
She'd know you were home when
she heard you at the door.

00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:10.580
You'd not even say what
pasture you were headed for.

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:12.910
Gave no thought that
she might worry

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:15.000
when you stayed out way late.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.310
Maybe stay awake and listen,
trying to hear you at the gate.

00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:23.040
That she might think you hurt
from a cow wreck or a fall

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:27.710
and wonder where to look or
which neighbor she should call.

00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:31.110
You're grey as granite now,
no careless cowboy anymore.

00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:33.490
And decide to ask forgiveness

00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:35.610
for all the worry
you caused her.

00:59:35.610 --> 00:59:40.250
But through her puzzled laugh
you hear her say, 'I slept right

00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:43.990
through the goofy things you
do, because when we were 20,

00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:53.000
I was immortal, just like
you.'" The other short,

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.190
very short poem -- and
I'll end with this one --

00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:57.550
is called <i>The Barn Cats </i>.

00:59:57.550 --> 01:00:02.550
When we first started doing
the Cowboy Poetry Gathering,

01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:05.990
people would come up to
me, obviously successful,

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:08.820
professional people,
what they wanted to talk

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:13.540
about was the time they spent on
their uncle's ranch in Wyoming

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:16.040
or the time they spent
on their granddad's farm.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.350
And they'd go on and on and on

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:20.930
about this business,
what it was.

01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:23.990
And our friend Dave
Stamey made an observation.

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:27.390
He said, there's a lot
of doctors and lawyers

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:28.800
that would dress
up like cowboys,

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.430
but there's hardly cowboys
that dress up like doctors

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:33.730
and lawyers [laughter].

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.890
This is called <i>The Barn Cats </i>.

01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:41.000
"It's funny the things you
remember, like accepting

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.660
without question that it was
your solemn duty to study hard

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:51.110
and earn big money, because
parents suffered The Depression.

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:53.810
How on your 10th birthday
you walked to a milk

01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:57.970
with a staggering headache,
sat on the one-legged stool

01:00:57.970 --> 01:01:01.350
and pressed your head
against her silken flank.

01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:03.990
How you remember
dull ringing sounds

01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:06.530
as the first squirts hit bottom.

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:09.350
How the sound changed
to a quiet hiss

01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:12.840
as foaming milk filled
the shiny bucket.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:16.570
How the smell of fresh,
warm milk rose to mingle

01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:19.780
with the clean cow smell.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:23.570
How the barn cats sat half
circled mewing politely,

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:27.640
insisting there was enough
to fill their little pan.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:31.930
How the gentle cow responded
to strong brown hands

01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:34.200
and let down her milk.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.930
How calmness and
forbearance were transmitted

01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:39.450
through your skull.

01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:43.720
How your pain was drawn
into the patient cow.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:49.580
And now, years later, you look
out a city window and wonder

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.800
if big money is really
better than barn cats

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.510
and cow curd headaches."

01:01:55.510 --> 01:02:11.060
[ Applause ]

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.360
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: How about
another round of applause?

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.160
Please, come on.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:21.230
[ Applause ]

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:23.210
So, we're very short on time

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:25.320
and we do have a movie
that's screening,

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.220
that Monica may have
mentioned this morning.

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.730
So, I want to make sure that
everyone has enough ample time

01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:31.050
to get across the street.

01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:34.760
So just by a way of closing,
instead of a conversation,

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:37.430
because you covered so much,
you just didn't know it here.

01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:38.880
You covered it all for me.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.760
I want to ask if one of you
wouldn't mind closing us out?

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.500
And here we are, we've --

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.160
you all were here at the
panel earlier this morning.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.460
You heard a lot what
was covered.

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.760
We shared lunch together.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.050
I want to know if there's
one thing you want to share

01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:54.830
with our audiences here, we're
right before Veterans Day,

01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:57.000
is there something
that we've missed?

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.940
Is there something that
you feel needs to be said

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:03.040
to our audiences here?

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.340
Vess?

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.430
&gt;&gt; Vess Quinlan: I don't know.

01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:16.450
I'm pretty delighted with
the connection between --

01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:20.330
we use the Cowboy Poetry
Gathering because it was --

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:23.650
it was like a man bites
dog advertisement.

01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:24.950
[Inaudible].

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:26.390
Well, that doesn't
make any sense at all.

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:32.870
So, the folklorist gathered
the first of us together

01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:36.920
to recite the old-time
poems [inaudible].

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.640
They didn't know we
were still writing.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:44.420
And so, when we got
involved in this whole thing,

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:49.650
all of a sudden there
was this opportunity

01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:53.010
with these huge crowds
of people coming --

01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:54.830
thousands of people came
to listen [inaudible].

01:03:54.830 --> 01:04:02.280
They stayed a whole week in
Elko and would go from sessions

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:09.810
to session to session
and spend money

01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:12.860
on the night shows
to hear this stuff.

01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:16.520
And we're sitting
there thinking,

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.150
we wrote this [inaudible].

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:27.310
So, when I first got <i>The Body
Burning Detail </i>from Bill Jones

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:30.790
and later got [inaudible]
from Rod McQueary we thought,

01:04:30.790 --> 01:04:35.910
there's all these people here,

01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:45.190
why not add these
other poems in.

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:46.490
And it worked.

01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:52.120
So, I would say that
there's got to be a way

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.050
to get people to come listen.

01:04:54.050 --> 01:05:00.670
[Inaudible].

01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:02.000
That's what I would say.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.490
Figure out a way and
make it -- make it fun.

01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:05.790
[Inaudible].

01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:22.260
But in the writing that we
do, [inaudible] message at war

01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:24.890
with one another [inaudible].

01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:27.100
That's not us.

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:32.460
It starts with a story
and ends [inaudible].

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:33.970
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah,
that's so much what we think

01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:36.580
of in the Poetry and
Literature Center when we think

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:38.780
of poetry and commonality.

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:40.720
I like to think of
it as story anyway.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.250
And who doesn't like story hour?

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:43.800
Who can't relate to story hour?

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:47.580
So, I'm afraid we have to
shut it down, as sad as I am.

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.510
So please, give our guests
another round of applause.

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:55.910
