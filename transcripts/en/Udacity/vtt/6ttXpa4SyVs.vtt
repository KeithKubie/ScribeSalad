00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.375
Now, there are two distinct processes that control behavior. It's reinforcement

00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:08.730
and punishment. A reinforcement always results in an increase in the future

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.822
likelihood a behavior will occur under similar circumstances. Meaning, if Saki

00:00:14.822 --> 00:00:18.592
is always reinforced with fish or praise after giving a kiss, it's likely that

00:00:18.592 --> 00:00:22.014
next time she is asked to give a kiss during a demonstration, that she's

00:00:22.014 --> 00:00:27.840
going to do it. On the other hand, a punishment always results in the decreased

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.072
likelihood of a behavior occurring. So, for example, if Sake was punished every

00:00:33.072 --> 00:00:37.914
time she gave a kiss, she would be less likely to do that behavior again. Now

00:00:37.914 --> 00:00:40.639
let's go to an interview with Dr. Zeligs.
