based on the idea that then when you

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
based on the idea that then when you
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.600
based on the idea that then when you
have a shockwave you have convergence of

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610
have a shockwave you have convergence of
 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.819
have a shockwave you have convergence of
flows and if you go to the shock rest

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829
flows and if you go to the shock rest
 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.950
flows and if you go to the shock rest
frame you can see matter approaching you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
frame you can see matter approaching you
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.170
frame you can see matter approaching you
from both directions and so when a

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180
from both directions and so when a
 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.200
from both directions and so when a
particle bounces back and forth due to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210
particle bounces back and forth due to
 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.030
particle bounces back and forth due to
reflection by magnetic field

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040
reflection by magnetic field
 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.870
reflection by magnetic field
inhomogeneities it's as if you have a

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880
inhomogeneities it's as if you have a
 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.350
inhomogeneities it's as if you have a
tennis ball reflected from to

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360
tennis ball reflected from to
 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.990
tennis ball reflected from to
approaching racquets so when a tennis

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000
approaching racquets so when a tennis
 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.020
approaching racquets so when a tennis
ball is reflected bye-bye to approaching

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030

racquets it gains momentum every time it

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
racquets it gains momentum every time it
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.709
racquets it gains momentum every time it
bounces and so particles can just gained

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719
bounces and so particles can just gained
 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.149
bounces and so particles can just gained
momentum a small fraction of the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159
momentum a small fraction of the
 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.969
momentum a small fraction of the
particles have a probability of gaining

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979
particles have a probability of gaining
 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.800
particles have a probability of gaining
momentum and so you can calculate what

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810
momentum and so you can calculate what
 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.540
momentum and so you can calculate what
will be the end result of such a process

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550
will be the end result of such a process
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.980
will be the end result of such a process
and you find that

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990
and you find that
 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.720
and you find that
you end up with a power-law distribution

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730
you end up with a power-law distribution
 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.410
you end up with a power-law distribution
of relativistic particles and so the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420
of relativistic particles and so the
 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.450
of relativistic particles and so the
existence of sharks around Sagittarius a

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.550
star due to turbulence could also
accelerate electrons to high speeds and

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560
accelerate electrons to high speeds and
 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.950
accelerate electrons to high speeds and
the bottom line is we see the spectrum

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960
the bottom line is we see the spectrum
 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.810
the bottom line is we see the spectrum
of emission from Sagittarius a star and

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820
of emission from Sagittarius a star and
 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.250
of emission from Sagittarius a star and
we can describe it by a population power

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260
we can describe it by a population power
 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.030
we can describe it by a population power
low population of electrons together

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040
low population of electrons together
 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.520
low population of electrons together
with some strength for the magnetic

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530
with some strength for the magnetic
 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.450
with some strength for the magnetic
field and more the polarization gives us

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460
field and more the polarization gives us
 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.640

additional constraints on the geometry

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650
additional constraints on the geometry
 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.320
additional constraints on the geometry
of the magnetic field because if you

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330
of the magnetic field because if you
 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.520
of the magnetic field because if you
have magnetic field that is coherent

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530
have magnetic field that is coherent
 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.830
have magnetic field that is coherent
then you end up with a very strong

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840
then you end up with a very strong
 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.900
then you end up with a very strong
polarization when you let a beam of

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910
polarization when you let a beam of
 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.240
polarization when you let a beam of
electrons orbit around it you can get a

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250
electrons orbit around it you can get a
 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.520
electrons orbit around it you can get a
very high level of polarization

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530
very high level of polarization
 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.890
very high level of polarization
depending on the power low index of

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900
depending on the power low index of
 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.070
depending on the power low index of
their energy distribution however we

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080
their energy distribution however we
 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.810

don't know that the field is oriented in

don't know that the field is oriented in
 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.020
don't know that the field is oriented in
this way we can image the polarization

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030
this way we can image the polarization
 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.050
this way we can image the polarization

usually and then the magnetic field

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110
usually and then the magnetic field
 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.830

lines in the in the disk get wrapped

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840
lines in the in the disk get wrapped
 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.760
lines in the in the disk get wrapped
around the black hole as close to the

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770

inner most stable circular orbit and

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889
inner most stable circular orbit and
 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.390
inner most stable circular orbit and
then some of the material is going along

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400
then some of the material is going along
 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.760

and you see that in simulations and the

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729
and you see that in simulations and the
 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.960
and you see that in simulations and the
energy for the jet could come from two

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970

sources either from the spin of the

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580
sources either from the spin of the
 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.790
sources either from the spin of the
black hole and this is a mechanism

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800
black hole and this is a mechanism
 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.500

where you basically spin down the black

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260
where you basically spin down the black
 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.120
where you basically spin down the black
hole and give the energy to to the jet

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130
hole and give the energy to to the jet
 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.010
hole and give the energy to to the jet
another source of energy is the disc

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020
another source of energy is the disc
 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.270
another source of energy is the disc
itself because the disc has material

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280
itself because the disc has material
 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.469
itself because the disc has material
orbiting around the black hole and you

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479
orbiting around the black hole and you
 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.140
orbiting around the black hole and you
can tap this rotational energy from the

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150
can tap this rotational energy from the
 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.219
can tap this rotational energy from the
material to the outflow and there has

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229
material to the outflow and there has
 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.140
material to the outflow and there has
been a debate in the literature as to

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150
been a debate in the literature as to
 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.230
been a debate in the literature as to
what is the ultimate source of energy it

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240
what is the ultimate source of energy it
 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.080

the job quite nicely and you end up with

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340
the job quite nicely and you end up with
 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.070
