[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:09.710
So I'm John.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.899
I'm the engineering tech lead
for the Player Analytics team.

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:14.940
And to repeat some of what
Ben was saying earlier

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.882
in our keynote, the
Player Analytics package

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:18.090
will let you do three things.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.506
It will let you manage your
business against daily revenue

00:00:20.506 --> 00:00:23.010
targets, understand when and
where players are spending,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.770
getting stuck, and
churning in your game,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.290
and then meet your daily needs.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.250
So you get access
to this pretty much

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.159
for free by integrating
with Google Play game

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.159
services, which you might
have been doing before

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.080
for things like
achievements, Quests,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.297
saved games, things like that.

00:00:38.297 --> 00:00:40.130
But we're going to look
at Events right now.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.270
Events were the
backbone for Quests

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.200
and Events allow
us to monitor what

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.782
players are doing in your game.

00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:47.990
We're going to leverage that
so we can monitor things

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.900
like how they're
doing, things like

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.470
spending money in your game,
or buying premium currency.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.336
So let's look at how that works.

00:00:55.336 --> 00:00:56.710
So you go to the
console and then

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.690
you're going to select one of
the Events that you've created.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.760
And you can select
those Events and you

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.390
can set them to be either
premium currency sources

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.510
or premium currency syncs.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.160
And then after you annotate
the Events in the console,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.040
you go to your code.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.120
And in your code, just like
what you did with Events before,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.960
you'll tell us, with
these RPC calls,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.380
when players are actually
getting the premium currency

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.010
or spending a premium currency.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.410
This will allow us to analyze
how premium currencies exist

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.880
in your game and
to hopefully let

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.310
you understand that yourself.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.620
But premium currency
analysis is really

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.050
just one of the few things
that the Player Analytics

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.960
package does for you overall.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.370
So let's look at
some other examples

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.440
of how we can use this.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.540
So here we have
Darlene the developer.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.110
And Darlene is convinced that
the world needs another game

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.430
about killing zombies
and farming for corn.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.390
In fact, she wants
to make a game

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.670
in which you do both of these
things at the same time.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.020
So she programs up her game
and then she launches it.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.640
And she finds just
after her launch

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.760
that lots and lots
of people are playing

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.550
her new game, Zombie Farmer.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.980
And this is
fantastic, of course,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.712
because some of these people
are actually paying her money.

00:02:04.712 --> 00:02:06.170
But she does an
iterate on her game

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.460
and what she finds 30
days after she launches

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.719
is that not so many people
are playing her game.

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.840
Well, this kind of
freaks her out of course.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.256
And naturally,
she's going to have

00:02:14.256 --> 00:02:16.190
a lot of questions like,
do people like corn

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.410
farming as much as she does?

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.154
Do they like killing
zombies more?

00:02:19.154 --> 00:02:20.320
Should she add more zombies?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.940
Less zombies?

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.570
Is this game too
hard or too easy?

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.550
These are all great questions
but without any analytics,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.687
you can't answer them.

00:02:26.687 --> 00:02:29.020
So the way that we try to
answer these questions for her

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.260
is we build detailed
time series of what's

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.730
going on with every single user
that is connected to Google

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.760
Play game services in her game.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.330
We create this time series.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.359
In these time series,
we put everything

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.650
that we know about the players.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.460
So here's another
example of a time series

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.960
but the things that go in this
time series are things like all

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.626
of the achievements
that they've earned,

00:02:46.626 --> 00:02:48.420
all of the Events
that they've unlocked,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.139
every spend that they do,
whenever they hit retention,

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.430
whenever they abandon the game.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.429
Pretty much everything
we know about the players

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:56.036
we put into these time series.

00:02:56.036 --> 00:02:57.660
Once we have these
time series-- and we

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.534
could have millions of
times series of course

00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:01.940
for all the players
that are playing games--

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.670
we aggregate information about
these time series together.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.050
Spend statistics,
retention statistics,

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.410
progression statistics.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.880
In fact, let's look a little bit
more at progression statistics.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.360
What we do right here is
we're defining progressions

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.110
as the number of
achievements that someone

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.970
has unlocked during your game.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.660
And what Darlene finds
is that once people

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.500
get to Level Six of unlocking
achievements, only 50% of them

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.110
get to Level Seven.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.770
So Darlene decides
that she wants

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.360
to make a new
version of her game

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.497
in which she makes
Level Seven easier.

00:03:31.497 --> 00:03:33.080
After she does that,
she launches that

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.538
and she comes back
to our retention

00:03:34.538 --> 00:03:37.187
widget in which we've broken
down retention by cohort.

00:03:37.187 --> 00:03:38.770
And she finds that
people that started

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.550
playing her game before only had
20% percent two-day retention.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.219
And maybe afterwards
they have 50% retention.

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.760
So this right here is an example
of the business drivers page

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.557
that we have.

00:03:48.557 --> 00:03:50.140
And this is really
powerful because it

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.620
allows Darlene to compare
how her game is doing

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.920
to other games in her same genre
making roughly the same amount

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.340
of money as hers.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.580
All the boxes that
we have here in green

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.092
in this made-up example indicate
that her retention statistics

00:04:03.092 --> 00:04:05.050
are actually just fine
compared to other games.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.480
But her spend statistics,
in particular her ARPU,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.672
is much lower.

00:04:08.672 --> 00:04:10.797
So she puts on the ARPU
button and she gets a drill

00:04:10.797 --> 00:04:13.710
down piece of
information for ARPU.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.130
So here on the top we
have a graph that shows,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.519
broken down by day over the
last 28 days, what her ARPU was.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.040
But in addition to ARPU,
we also have ARPPU,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.090
we have conversion rate.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.490
We have basically all
of the spend statistics

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.470
that we could cram into a graph.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.946
The general idea that's
coming out from this

00:04:30.946 --> 00:04:32.570
is that once she has
launched her game,

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.250
she needs to continue
iterating on it

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.980
and we provide the
analytics package that

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.030
allows us to do that so she can
make her game better and better

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.389
and get more and more
players in her game.

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.930
The main thing to
take away from this

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.290
is that Player Analytics
allows you to do three things.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.065
And I think this is probably
the sixth time you've heard

00:04:47.065 --> 00:04:48.191
us say something like this.

00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:50.815
But it allows you to manage your
business against daily revenue

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:52.810
targets, understand
when and where players

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.680
are getting stuck or
churning in your game,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.630
and quickly identify the
business metrics that are

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.367
in most need of your attention.

00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:00.700
We'll be at the Code Labs today.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.890
Please feel free to drop in.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.939
We can talk about how to
get this into your game.
