1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.660
You are listening to radio lab radio from W.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.990
N y. S. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.430
So you're going to identify the Washington place cause I can't remember. Yeah,

4
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.020
yeah. Okay. Three, two, one. Ready?

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.420
I am ready but we should tell the audience that we're not gonna.

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.690
We're going to start this not in our usual studios spot. Not here.

7
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:23.670
Here where we're sitting down here.

8
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.010
<v 0>Just to explain, this is the Shakespeare theater in DC.</v>

10
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.370
Recently Robert and I were there in front of about 800 folks just trying out

11
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:33.540
some material for the show.

12
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.970
We're getting with this story which comes from Plato actually by way of

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.800
Aristophanes. It's a 2,400 year old story breaking news. In other words,

14
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.330
and it goes like this.

15
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.960
<v 2>Once upon a time he says people were not born separate from each other.</v>

16
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:56.160
They were born intertwined, kind of coupled with each other.

17
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.620
So they were boys attached to boys and they were girls attached to girls and of

18
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:05.610
course boys and girls together in a wonderfully intimate ball.

19
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:09.810
And back then we had eight limbs. They were four on top, four on the bottom.

20
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:13.350
And you didn't have to walk if he didn't want to. You could roll and roll.

21
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:18.270
We did. We rolled backwards and we rolled forwards achieving fantastic speeds.

22
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.640
That gave us a kind of courage.

23
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.950
And then the courage swelled to pride and the pride became arrogance.

24
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.580
And then we decided that we were greater than the gods and we tried to roll up

25
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.350
to heaven and take over and heaven and the gods alarms struck back.

26
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.830
And Zeus in his fury hurled down lightning bolts and struck everyone into,

27
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.190
into perfect halves. So all of a sudden,

28
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.190
couples who'd been warm and tight and wedged together,

29
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.760
we're now detached and alone and lost and desperate and losing the will to live.

30
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.480
And the God's seen what they'd done,

31
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.750
worried that humans might not survive or even multiply again.

32
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:03.960
And of course they needed humans to give sacrifices and pay attention to them.

33
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:06.420
So the gods decided on a few repairs.

34
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.120
Instead of heads facing backwards or out,

35
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:11.850
they would rotate our heads back to forward.

36
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.600
They pulled our skin taut and nodded it right here at the belly button.

37
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.620
Genitalia two were moved to the front. So if we wanted to, you know, we could,

38
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.730
and most important, they left us with a memory.

39
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.680
It was a longing for that original other half of ourselves,

40
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.860
the boy or the girl who used to make us whole.

41
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.660
And that longing is still so deep in all of us. Men for men, women for women,

42
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:37.950
men for women for each other,

43
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.510
that it has been the lot of humans ever since to travel the world looking for

44
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:46.740
our other half. And when says, Aristophanes, when one of us meets another,

45
00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:49.320
we recognize each other right away. We just know this.

46
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.880
We're lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy.

47
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.140
We won't get out of each other's sight even for a moment. These are people,

48
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:00.130
he says, who passed their whole

49
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.900
<v 0>lives together. And yet if you asked them,</v>

50
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.620
they could not explain what they desire of each other.

51
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.710
They just do.

52
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.910
Very nice. Can I get an amen?

53
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.060
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

54
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.930
<v 0>so here's the thing. That story got us started on a little journey.</v>

55
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.740
Truly began just thinking about wholeness and oneness and has looking for each

56
00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:31.240
other

57
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.650
<v 2>in all varieties of ways. Mirrors and shapes, relationships.</v>

58
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:38.380
Beauty, the birth of the universe, the nature of life.

59
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.410
All of these things either have a simple deep beauty or

60
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.393
<v 0>not.</v>

61
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.040
I'm Jad Abumrad I remember [inaudible] this is radio lab and today for this hour

62
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.233
we are

63
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.880
desperately seeking this symmetry. By the way.

64
00:03:57.881 --> 00:03:59.200
That was Zoe Keating on cello.

65
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.080
We'll hear more from earth throughout the hour cause she's awesome.

66
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.860
Every Bobby K [inaudible] I'm still thinking about her stuff and he's okay.

67
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.430
And uh, do you ever wonder, uh,

68
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
what actually happens when two people click, when the haves kind of meat,

69
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.090
meaning what, you know, you're going through your day, maybe you're at a party,

70
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.640
you meet people and you're like, hey, how are you? How are you?

71
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.130
And they say something and they try and be interesting and you try and be

72
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:25.900
interesting back. But in the end you're like,

73
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.470
I don't need to remember that name. Right? Of course. Yeah.

74
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.440
Gone and then comes along somebody,

75
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.430
every hundred times the stars align, the world falls away.

76
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:41.080
Things narrow and you just click. I knew that,

77
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.350
but do you ever wonder what actually happens in that moment?

78
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.730
<v 3>Like when you meet someone that you really get, I just,</v>

79
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.730
I don't think that there's anything that really feels better than that.

80
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.510
That's Lauren Silbert. She's a neuroscientist at Princeton. She wonders,

81
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.930
she's been wondering for a while when I was, I don't know,

82
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:01.780
maybe eight and I used to study with my dad,

83
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.790
we would go over things and I remember like I didn't understand this one like

84
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:11.791
math problem and he was explaining it to me and all of a sudden and I got it and

85
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:16.600
I started to cry and he got really nervous cause I was crying.

86
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.740
Why are you crying? Cause I was so excited that I like finally got it.

87
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.730
That's my first memory of really like d excited about the intensity of

88
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.693
understanding.

89
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.450
<v 0>So fast forward 20 years,</v>

90
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.990
Lauren is at Princeton and in the basement of our building here.

91
00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:33.950
Can you just tell me where we are?

92
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.390
We are in the FN rife facilities in Green Hall at Princeton University.

93
00:05:38.391 --> 00:05:42.620
They've got this giant brain scan, get magnets, looks like an airplane engine.

94
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.650
We're like a donut here can go donut. And as you know with the scanner,

95
00:05:45.651 --> 00:05:48.960
you can put people in it and have them do tasks. Think,

96
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.400
think a thought or things, sing a song or watch a movie. And uh,

97
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.610
then the researchers can see into their brain, you know,

98
00:05:55.611 --> 00:05:58.550
without having to cut in there. And Lauren got it into her head.

99
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.430
Could I use this big donut to investigate the clicking question?

100
00:06:02.431 --> 00:06:06.110
So is the question when things click, what clicks, what plagues?

101
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.140
And if we can know what clicks can we learn how to make it click more?

102
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.810
So one day last year Lauren got into the brain scanner,

103
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:20.870
I sort of like it in there and she told this story and you just tell me that

104
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:24.700
story. Well it's a 15 minute, come on. Okay.

105
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.630
So I told the story actually told you the whole thing without any sort of hersa

106
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.600
fully maybe for, well 25, 17 times something,

107
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.650
something under 30, under 30 times.

108
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.180
I'm going to tell it one more time for everybody else to play a lot.

109
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.280
So the story is about her prom.

110
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.330
So Lauren is in high school and this guy that she doesn't really like asked her

111
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.030
to go to the prom. It's pretty awkward. But she's like, oh, okay. You know,

112
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.830
didn't know what to say. Nope. Subsequent to being asked by the first guy,

113
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.250
she actually falls for real for a second guy,

114
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.310
guy number two we just liked each other click.

115
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.540
So now she has a situation cause she likes the second guy said yes to the first

116
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:08.240
guy and he still wants to be the day he wants to be. Oddly enough,

117
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:10.990
he still wants to go with them. So she ends up going with guy number one.

118
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.060
So we get to the problem and a guy number two,

119
00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:16.340
her boyfriend shows up drunk,

120
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.440
very drunk and punches fly. It gets messy. So she drags guy number two,

121
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.880
her boyfriend out to the parking lot.

122
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:27.881
But on the way to the car he trips and falls directly on his face right onto his

123
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:33.950
face, right onto his face on the concrete and he starts bleeding profusely.

124
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.730
So she's like, Oh, give me your keys. I'm going to drive. I'll drive your cart.

125
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.550
And if she doesn't have a license but he can't drive. Right.

126
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.190
So she drives them both out of the parking lot.

127
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.080
A couple minutes later they come upon an accident in the, in the street. Yeah,

128
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.230
it's right there. Some cars had gone into a thing, so they're rolling up to it.

129
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:56.290
I get distracted and she crashes into the accident that had already happened.

130
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.660
And it's just that the police were already there and they're like, watch this.

131
00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:04.910
So the officer walks up, sees her no license,

132
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.970
sees this dude who's all bloody and messy and was like, all right,

133
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.820
give me your registration. She thinks she's going to jail.

134
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.270
But here is where faith steps in as the officer is walking back to his car with

135
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:20.510
her registration, a wind, a lucky win. One of those kicks up,

136
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.720
blows the registration out of the officer's hands.

137
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:28.370
He can't find it and he has no choice but to let her go. So then I just left.

138
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.980
So that was the story that forms the basis. Okay.

139
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.700
That is the story that forms the basis as fresh. Okay,

140
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:37.970
so now let's rewind [inaudible]. So anyhow,

141
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:39.830
she told that story in the scanner.

142
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:44.450
All the while the scanner snap pictures of her brain moment to moment.

143
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.540
Then she got a bunch of other people put them in the scanner and had the scanner

144
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:52.280
snap pictures of their brain as they're listening to the story with me so far.

145
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.120
Yup. Next did she compared brains? Okay,

146
00:08:57.121 --> 00:08:58.930
so here I can show you a,

147
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.170
Lauren showed us brain scans where she divided each brain into thousands of tiny

148
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:08.390
little squares. So we call voxels thousands, thousands. Yeah.

149
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:13.530
So then what we can do is we can take one voxel in one brain and directly

150
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:18.330
compare it to the same exact voxel in the other brain. Shut up.

151
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.270
Wow. And we do this across the entire brain,

152
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.270
and this is where things get interesting when people really got her story,

153
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.870
because she had run them through all these tests to see if they could remember

154
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:33.030
the different chapters, the word she used.

155
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:35.400
So she was checking to see how well they listened. Yeah.

156
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:37.650
She would have them kind of recall the story. Okay.

157
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.040
Some were really good at recalling others, not so much. Now,

158
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:43.110
the people that did well like really well,

159
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.540
she found it as they were listening to her story,

160
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.290
their brain would literally begin to mirror hers.

161
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.790
All the little voxels in their head would start to sync up with all the little

162
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:58.230
voxels in her head. So they are, so they are just listening like anyone listens.

163
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.320
They just hearing what you're saying. Again, I get that. No, no,

164
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.980
let me put it to you a different way. You're right. I mean,

165
00:10:05.981 --> 00:10:09.490
right now you and I are voxels are mirroring each other. You know,

166
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.610
like we're both speaking English. Yeah. So we can assume,

167
00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:17.560
say 20% at least I would go 2124 let's say 24 okay.

168
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.630
But let's say you bump it up to 30 [inaudible] maybe bump it up to 35 no,

169
00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.530
let's get a little higher.

170
00:10:23.531 --> 00:10:28.531
(404) 024-0840 nine trusted you a at a 50% level.

171
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.850
But let's say we get to 50%,

172
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.580
even 60 there's a certain point at which something happens where it's no longer

173
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:37.980
me just describing an experience to you.

174
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:42.310
It's you actually having the experience, you know? Ah, yeah.

175
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.720
Like you know that the difference between x explanation and experience is like

176
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.990
the Grand Canyon, right? Well, she's found a way to quantify the gap.

177
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.370
So when I'm sitting there listening to Meryl Streep, I'm all Meryl inside,

178
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.470
outside and all around. Yeah,

179
00:10:59.471 --> 00:11:03.180
that's 100% Merrill [inaudible] that's a hundred percent male straight.

180
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.710
He is not listening to this. You were saying,

181
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.920
I'll give you an example of what I was just saying here. Let me show you.

182
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.090
So while I was in Lauren's office, she showed me a,

183
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.350
this particular slide of her results.

184
00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.440
So on this side we have this comprehension rank and what that means.

185
00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.300
Basically it was a graph and on one axis sheet she had how much they actually

186
00:11:22.301 --> 00:11:24.370
understood the story and could recall it.

187
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.570
And on the other axis she had how much their brain sinked up with hers,

188
00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:31.750
which is sort of like how much they experienced the story. What are these marks,

189
00:11:31.751 --> 00:11:36.650
by the way? Are these people? Sorry about the wait, these little exes. Oh,

190
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.050
these are individual subjects. I see. So if you take out this one outlier,

191
00:11:41.051 --> 00:11:44.770
actually she pointed to this one subject two is way on one side of the graph.

192
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.570
Did that person is just didn't get your story at all? No. This person actually,

193
00:11:49.571 --> 00:11:51.070
that person did understand her story,

194
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.980
scored really nice on comprehension but just didn't

195
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.020
<v 3>sync up with her brain at all.</v>

196
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:00.283
Um,

197
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:05.590
this person I t well so this is a little interesting.

198
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:13.170
Yeah, I know this person. You know this person. I know this person.

199
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.490
Yeah. To that person.

200
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.660
I'm almost positive is her fiance was,

201
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.700
there were some fights in gesture for real.

202
00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:28.020
I mean for real. I don't think he was actually paying attention.

203
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:34.040
Um, but this one up here, she pointed to another subject.

204
00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:39.070
Oh way on the other side of the graph who is a super brain coupling master was a

205
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:42.990
girl in Undergrad who I had never met before. Um,

206
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:48.490
and her brain coupled with my brain was twice as much as everybody else.

207
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.360
I mean really just like I contacted her after cause I wanted to like have lunch

208
00:12:56.541 --> 00:12:59.060
with her and just see if we're the same person or not.

209
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.090
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

210
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:08.000
<v 3>and you never got back to me. What I know isn't that really,</v>

211
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.280
it was sort of the end of their semester and I think she might've been away in

212
00:13:13.651 --> 00:13:15.120
the weeks after I spoke with Lauren.

213
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.490
We emailed a few times and I kept asking her. I was like,

214
00:13:17.491 --> 00:13:20.670
so what about that girl? The one who knew everything? Yeah.

215
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:25.230
Like how do you explain the connection? Is it a connection? Let's go meet her.

216
00:13:25.231 --> 00:13:27.960
C'Mon, c'mon, c'mon. He didn't want to. No, she did actually.

217
00:13:27.961 --> 00:13:30.390
And we started referring to the girl in email as a

218
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.440
<v 0>BD media, meaning what? Meaning?</v>

219
00:13:33.441 --> 00:13:38.090
Brain Double Bidi Bidi Bidi Bidi Bidi Bidi Bidi [inaudible] bring. Yeah.

220
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:42.200
Anyhow, eventually after two weeks of constant emailing and searching,

221
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.590
BD turns up and agrees to meet

222
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.301
the meeting.

223
00:13:49.301 --> 00:13:54.301
Took place on a sunny Tuesday afternoon at Princeton and I missed it because I

224
00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:59.170
was on the round train. When I finally get there, BD has come and gone.

225
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.840
So you never laid eyes on BD? I did not,

226
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.180
but I talked to Lauren right after she had,

227
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:10.150
it was weird really. We sat down on a bench and she gave me the good. Okay.

228
00:14:10.151 --> 00:14:14.710
You seem a little shaken. Yeah, it was a strange experience.

229
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:19.440
First thing she tells me is what the mystery girl's name is. Her name. Lauren.

230
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.500
My name is la. She was Lauren. And you were Lauren? Yes,

231
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.840
we're both named Lauren. Wow.

232
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.440
<v 3>I know. It's weird, but there's kind of some guns out there. I know, but still,</v>

233
00:14:29.441 --> 00:14:31.660
that's so weird. I've thought at this point I'm like,

234
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.220
I mean this is like an era stuff and he's whopper here folks. So I was thinking,

235
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:40.720
and that's what Lauren told me that she had been expecting too beforehand,

236
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.020
hating her to come in and just like

237
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:49.030
<v 0>the me. And when she showed up was she, you know,</v>

238
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.800
not at all. Yeah.

239
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.090
Earlier they admitted a coffee shop and since I missed the whole thing,

240
00:14:56.091 --> 00:15:00.080
I was very lucky that more number one had recorded the meeting on her laptop.

241
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.710
Okay. So I want to know, did you, where did you grow up?

242
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.940
I grew up in Vancouver. C in Vancouver. Yeah. Lauren.

243
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.570
One's theory was that they would have a common background or common,

244
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:14.360
something that would explain the symmetry between them.

245
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.880
But what you hear is Lauren one looking for points of connection and yourself.

246
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.290
Well listen. Okay. Do you have problem in Canada?

247
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.530
Is that a stupid question? Uh, well we do. I actually couldn't go to mine.

248
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.870
You didn't go to your prom? Yeah. Okay. I wish I could.

249
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.810
Did you, um,

250
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:40.640
did you have like significant relationships in high school? No.

251
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:44.510
No, not at all. I went to an all girls school. You went to an all girls school?

252
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:49.370
Yeah. Did you do a unicorn? Yeah. Was it like happen in the end?

253
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.910
There was not one thing they had in common, uh, except their names and

254
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.990
<v 2>Princeton. Do you thought that this was going to be, you know, something?</v>

255
00:15:57.991 --> 00:16:02.570
I Dunno. Is it, maybe your premise is wrong. What do you mean? Well, uh,

256
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.790
actually I each snuck up to Columbia University and I asked her neuroscientist

257
00:16:06.791 --> 00:16:09.880
about this actually. When did you do that while you were in Princeton?

258
00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:14.620
I was on the subway going up to see Joey hurt. [inaudible] nice to meet you.

259
00:16:14.621 --> 00:16:16.900
Went behind my back. What happened is I said to her, look,

260
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.890
we have this pretty great paper, and she agreed. It was a wonderful paper.

261
00:16:20.891 --> 00:16:24.070
I said, it shows these two women who has seemed to be in such lock step.

262
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.720
Wouldn't you suppose that the two of them, if they ever met,

263
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.600
would become friendly or have some connection? Yeah.

264
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.930
<v 4>I've come to the same conclusion.</v>

265
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.710
If yours and my heartbeats were exactly the same,

266
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.290
<v 2>depends on the circumstances.</v>

267
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.940
If it was a beautiful night at a sinking moon in Venice, maybe

268
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:52.050
<v 4>if you have elaborated the story beyond my question,</v>

269
00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.970
say your heartbeat is about 62 beats per minute.

270
00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.480
Say Mine was exactly 62 beats per minute.

271
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:05.040
Would you say that we were more in sync than if mine was 72 beats per minute

272
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.730
that you and I were more soulmates?

273
00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.630
<v 2>No, probably not. I'd want to, but I, I don't know if I, you see,</v>

274
00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:14.340
I would want to, don't you want to,

275
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.650
when you see synchrony between the individuals?

276
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.440
<v 4>Well, yes,</v>

277
00:17:18.441 --> 00:17:23.150
but I'm saying that I think that the conclusion doesn't follow from the data.

278
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:28.210
Joy says it's equally possible that Lauren too is just an extraordinarily good

279
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:29.773
listener.

280
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.100
<v 0>Hello? Hey. Hey. Can you hear me okay?</v>

281
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:33.400
<v 5>Yeah, I can hear you.</v>

282
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.650
<v 0>In fact, when I finally got Lauren to on the phone, uh,</v>

283
00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:41.320
she did tell me that she is one of those people that when she hears a story,

284
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.720
she just falls in

285
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:48.080
<v 5>to the point where somebody can be like, well, what?</v>

286
00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:53.420
And I don't hear it because I'm so focused on the book. Yeah. Um,

287
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:58.620
how do I explain it? So have you ever done any, any sports?

288
00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.060
<v 0>Yah. Soccer a little bit. Yeah.</v>

289
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.910
<v 5>Do you ever find that sometimes when you're playing soccer,</v>

290
00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:09.030
you are so into the game or you just reacting or whatever that you kind of lose

291
00:18:09.641 --> 00:18:11.890
track of yourself for a little bit?

292
00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.330
<v 0>Yeah. It's like a dream state almost.</v>

293
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.610
<v 5>Yeah. Like a dream state. I definitely have that happen when I'm doing sports,</v>

294
00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:20.820
but I also sometimes how that happened when I, and I read

295
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.730
<v 0>even. So do you think that you and Lauren one will become friends?</v>

296
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.180
<v 5>Um, I</v>

297
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.050
honestly probably,

298
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:32.900
<v 0>no, no, no.</v>

299
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.460
<v 3>Um, I, I mean, we're just, it's just, I just don't,</v>

300
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.170
I wouldn't just want it, but she's,

301
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.950
<v 0>oh, but not you. Don't you want to hang out with or don't you get to know her?</v>

302
00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.680
No. Okay. Jay, thank you very much.

303
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.810
Why don't you just sit down just for a second.

304
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.750
We're going to play a little nobody, but this morning, come on.

305
00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:59.380
I think we can just repair all the damage that was just occurred to your

306
00:18:59.381 --> 00:19:02.770
sensitive psyche. Just listen and we'll be right back.
