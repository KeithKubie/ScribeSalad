00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:08.370
We often think of the art world as separate from the real world. This is rarely the case.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.000
This video is called Art &amp; Society. A theme
we will explore using three works.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.000
It's 1934. The height of the Great Depression.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.300
Dorothea Lange was running a successful portrait studio

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.600
in Berkley, California. The photographs she
took of the social elite made her a good living.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.500
But when she looked out her window, she couldn't ignore that people were struggling.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.100
We can't escape what's happening around us.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.300
The theme of society allows you the opportunity to think more critically about

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.600
where something's coming from and what's
that point of view.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.100
Lange left the studio and took her camera on the road.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.000
Hired by a New Deal program, Lange travelled up and down California.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.530
She was documenting the lives of the state's newest residents: migrant workers.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.809
Lange was driving back to San Francisco after a long assignment. She saw a pea pickers camp

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.000
but kept driving.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Twenty miles down the road, something made her turn around.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
"I saw and approached the hungry and desperate mother as if drawn by a magnet."

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.780
The family had arrived at the camp only to learn that the crop had been destroyed by rain. They were stranded

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.500
along with 2,500 other migrants with no work
and no food.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.500
Lange took only six photos.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.119
She sent her negatives off to Washington and within days, supplies were rushed to the area.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.500
The story, along with one of her photos, was printed in the San Francisco News.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.800
The picture caught the public eye.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.950
Lange's final image did more
than tell the story of government aid.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.279
It connected with people. It was re-published, it was displayed at The Museum of Modern Art.

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:52.670
Here we are, decades and decades later, but
we really understand or can imagine what that

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:02.520
experience must have been like in a way that's really tangible and something that we can really relate to.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:14.110
It's 1967 and America's
involvement in Vietnam is escalating.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:30.849
Declared the Living Room War, there was no escaping Vietnam. Well, almost no escaping.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.709
Martha Rosler was dumb-founded. How could Americans be interested with the war one moment and

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:42.000
interested in a couch the next? So she combined them. To her, they were inseparable.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.610
She used magazines that came into the American household everyday and called the series: House Beautiful:

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.000
Bringing the War Home.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.400
"We need to constantly question become passive consumers of images,

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:59.500
to always look to the margins."

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.800
"What is it telling us not only by what's in the frame, but also, what is the frame and what's behind the frame?"

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.100
In 1991, New York was facing a different kind of conflict.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.500
The AIDS crisis was part of this political landscape that was very much in conflict.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.900
"Where does he get off taking our tax money to promote homosexuality?"

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.600
"Politics won't cure AIDS. Not doing anything but killing Americans."

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.500
So Felix Gonzalez-Torres hangs two clocks on the wall.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.200
"There is never such a thing as an apolitical or inert artwork."

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.000
People were fearful and angry.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.600
Gonzalez-Torres used simple imagery as a response to the era's uncertainty.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.000
He used lightbulbs. He used candy.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.500
He used clocks.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.900
Two clocks touching set to the same time that gradually go out of sync.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.329
And it could be circumstance or it could be

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:18.370
sickness or disease that suddenly
brings you out of sync with something or someone.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.210
It doesn't kind of hit you over the head right
away. It allows you to kind of linger there

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.000
for a minute. It's subtlety is its power.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Dorothea Lange's Migrant Mother,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.100
Martha Rosler's House Beautiful: Bringing the War Home

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.100
and Felix Gonzalez-Torres' Untitled (Perfect Lovers).
