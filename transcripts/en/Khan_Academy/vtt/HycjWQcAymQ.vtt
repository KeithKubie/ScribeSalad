00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the story
of a young man teaching

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.080
math to the world.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.280
NewsHour correspondent
Spencer Michels reports.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.260
SALMAN KHAN: So this is a
quadratic equation essentially.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.390
We're trying to find the 0s of--

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.150
SPENCER MICHELS: This
disembodied voice

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.950
is heard every day
by tens of thousands

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.510
of students struggling
with math both in the US

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.815
and around the world.

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:25.660
SALMAN KHAN: So what is
x squared plus 4x plus 4?

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.470
Well, it's x plus
2 times x plus 2.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.320
SPENCER MICHELS: 33-year-old
Salman Khan recently

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.790
quit his job as a
hedge fund analyst

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.780
to devote himself to
an unpaid job teaching

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.685
math on the internet.

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:44.520
SALMAN KHAN: Welcome to the
presentation on basic addition.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.439
These are cancers
or cancer cells.

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:49.480
The investors in the
mortgage-backed securities--

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.180
SPENCER MICHELS: He has
posted 1,200 lessons

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.250
on YouTube, which appear on
an electronic blackboard,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.100
and range in subject from basic
addition and advanced calculus,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.930
to science and finance.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:02.920
And they are free.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.790
SALMAN KHAN: Introduction
to Trigonometry,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.730
this is where I teach people
about the trig functions.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.870
This is one of the
more popular videos.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.110
This has 179,000 views.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.820
And this is just what sine,
cosine, and tangent are,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.740
SPENCER MICHELS: Khan lives
in California's Silicon Valley

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.130
with his wife, a rheumatologist
in training at Stanford,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.410
and their new baby.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.840
He got the idea for Khan
Academy four years ago

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.440
when he taught a
young cousin how

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.120
to convert kilograms to grams.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.650
Many American students
have trouble with math,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.300
and studies show they lag behind
their counterparts in Asia

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.930
and Europe in both
math and science.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.220
With Khan's help, his
cousin got good at math,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.480
and he eventually
had a new career

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.960
tapping into anxieties
around the world.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.010
Now he records his lessons
from a converted closet

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.880
in the back of his bedroom.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.160
He never goes on camera.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.870
SALMAN KHAN: It kind of feels
like the voice in their head.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.940
You're looking at
it, it kind of feels

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.100
like someone's over your
shoulder talking in your year

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.933
as opposed to someone
at a blackboard that's

00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:06.550
distant from you. [COUGH]
Sorry for starting

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.870
the presentation with a cough.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.494
But now I want to continue
with the 45-45-90 triangles.

00:02:11.494 --> 00:02:13.660
SPENCER MICHELS: Although
he is not the first person

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.810
to teach on the internet,
his simple operation

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.590
has attracted more eyeballs
than most university sites.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.180
And his fame has spread.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.260
The all-girl Castilleja
School in Palo Alto

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.020
invited Khan to speak,
and he immediately

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.664
connected to the student body.

00:02:29.664 --> 00:02:31.330
SALMAN KHAN: You tell
me that you really

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.310
don't know how, dividing
decimals is still

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.630
kind of this little gray
area, and if dividing decimals

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.880
actually is, you're not alone.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.110
Dividing decimals is
kind of the one thing

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.475
that no one wants to admit that
they kind of forgot how to do.

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:46.010
SPENCER MICHELS: He exuded
pride in his expanding

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.642
online audience.

00:02:47.642 --> 00:02:50.690
SALMAN KHAN: More and more
people kept watching it,

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.830
and now it's reaching
actually on the order

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.032
of 100,000 students now a month
and 40,000 video views a day.

00:02:58.032 --> 00:02:59.490
SPENCER MICHELS:
It was the concept

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.550
of short, repeatable
lessons that

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.500
attracted high
school senior Bridget

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.960
Meany who admitted she'd had
trouble with seventh grade

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.865
algebra.

00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:09.740
BRIDGET MEANY: I think
the teachers are good,

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.150
but they can't go at a pace
that's perfect for everyone.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.090
But I like the concept of
knowing something in class,

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.770
but then going back and
pressing pause or rewind,

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.420
and actually getting a
deeper understanding of it.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.160
SPENCER MICHELS: Shy students
who don't ask questions

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.580
in class may benefit the
most from Khan's videos,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.930
says Kimberly Knapp, who
teaches math at Castilleja.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.810
But his lessons aren't a
substitute for the classroom,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.560
KIMBERLY KNAPP: I don't
think that there's

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.780
a perfect replacement
for the work that we do

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.340
and just the kind
of conversations

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.970
that students and teachers
engage in together.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.310
SPENCER MICHELS: But Khan
thinks maybe lecture halls

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.750
and classrooms have
their limitations.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.080
Originally he kept
his lessons short

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.410
because of YouTube restrictions.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.552
Now he thinks short is better.

00:03:57.552 --> 00:03:59.510
SALMAN KHAN: I've gotten
researchers telling me

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.660
that you don't realize.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.260
10 minutes, we've
done studies, is

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.504
how long someone can have a
high level of concentration,

00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:07.420
and anything beyond that,
you kind of lose it.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.750
And I think we've all had that
experience sitting in college

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.850
where you can be with the
professor for about 10,

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.547
15 minutes.

00:04:12.547 --> 00:04:13.755
And then you kind of lose it.

00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:16.800
SPENCER MICHELS: A lot of math
students apparently agree.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.230
I talked via the internet
with Cody Woodward

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.506
in Anchorage, Alaska who uses
Khan's lessons at college.

00:04:23.506 --> 00:04:25.390
CODY WOODWARD: It has
helped me immensely

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.330
in the grades for
my math classes,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.525
and I've also learned a lot.

00:04:30.525 --> 00:04:32.160
SPENCER MICHELS:
Internet instruction,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.690
be it the Khan Academy or
taped university lectures,

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.220
could revolutionize education
in remote, Third World locations

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.580
where access to
high-quality instruction

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.800
is frequently unavailable.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.910
That's the hope of Neil
Radia, a young software

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.270
programmer at Cisco Systems.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.280
He and fellow volunteers
at World Possible,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.990
working on their vacations,
are bringing online teaching

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.740
to Africa and
India for starters.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.540
When Radia and Megha Jain
first traveled to Ethiopia,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.880
they found thousands
of brand new computers

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.240
sitting idle because
they couldn't connect

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.410
to the internet, and
therefore couldn't

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.915
get online instruction.

00:05:11.915 --> 00:05:13.290
NEIL RADIA: The
great thing to do

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.320
would to be putting a
lot of these resources

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.840
on a single local server that
we could bring to the colleges,

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.100
to the universities,
to community centers.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.780
We came across the Khan Academy.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.430
And we emailed him and asked
him if we could reproduce

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.980
some of his material
on our servers,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.865
and he was very
willing to help us out.

00:05:29.865 --> 00:05:32.570
MEGHA JAIN: You'd be surprised
how fast these kids learn

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.020
and take these things up.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.330
So it isn't strange to them.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.470
They've heard of this, and
they are excited to use it.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.300
SPENCER MICHELS: For
Khan, teaching math

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.270
and science and finance
is just the beginning.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.650
He's ready to expand
his YouTube site

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.899
to include whatever
strikes his fancy

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:50.440
SALMAN KHAN: I want
to do everything.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.180
I want to do history.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.055
I want to do grammar.

00:05:52.055 --> 00:05:53.730
I want to do literally
every subject.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.220
SPENCER MICHELS: So far,
except for a little advertising

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.650
revenue, he is donating
his time and equipment.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.800
It's a one-man
operation, but it's

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.640
gotten so big he expects
to start soliciting

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.680
outside support to keep
his academy growing.
