JANICE KAPLAN: Thank you.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.340
Thank you all for being here.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.780
I know you're all busy, and
I appreciate your being here.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.090
And it's exciting to get to
talk to you about gratitude

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.260
because you're all at Google, so
you are all grateful every day.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.600
Because the rest of
us who are not at

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.820
Google know that you work in the
best place in the entire world.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.760
You get free food.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.290
I took some on my way in.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.480
You get free coffee and tea.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.980
You get everything, right?

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.930
And so when you
go home at night,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.369
and maybe something didn't go
quite as perfectly that day

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.310
as you had hoped, maybe
somebody annoyed you, or maybe

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.270
something didn't work
out right, and you

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.130
tell your boyfriend or
girlfriend, or husband or wife,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.780
or mother or father, or whatever
stage of life you're at.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.770
You complain to
somebody, and they

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.330
say, oh, for heaven's
sakes, you work at Google.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.330
I don't want to hear it.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.871
You're lucky.

00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:51.700
Realize how lucky you are.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.690
So most of us are
pretty lucky, right?

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.410
And we know that we should
feel grateful all the time.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.570
But we don't.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.610
And let's just admit it.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.630
We don't.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.190
And I know how you feel-- if
there are those days that you

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.023
go home, and you're not
feeling so grateful,

00:01:06.023 --> 00:01:08.510
and everybody's telling
you that you should--

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.430
because it's how I felt too.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.470
As that nice introduction
said, I've had a great career.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.687
I was the editor-in-chief
of "Parade,"

00:01:16.687 --> 00:01:19.020
which was, at the time, the
biggest magazine in America.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.280
I've been a TV producer.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.290
I've had lots of
fun things to do.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.510
I have a lovely husband.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.260
I have two great kids.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.670
But for me, it started
on a New Year's Eve.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.590
And I was standing at a
party at a New Year's Eve.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.547
And I don't know how you
guys feel on New Year's Eve

00:01:34.547 --> 00:01:36.380
or how you felt on this
past New Year's Eve,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.170
but I'm always pretty
sure on New Year's Eve

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.540
that everybody in the world is
having a better time than I am.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.270
And we turned on the TV at this
party, and the ball in New York

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.820
was about to fall,
and I'm sure you

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.530
have the same experience with
whatever falls, or screams,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.290
or goes up in smoke in London.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.280
And I stood there, and
I thought, OK, it's

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.960
been a perfectly nice year.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.010
There's nothing bad
that's happened this year.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.460
I knew I had a
perfectly nice life.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.550
But what was going to happen in
the coming year that was really

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.930
going to excite me?

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.950
What was going to happen
in the coming year

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.450
so that I could be standing at
that same New Year's Eve a year

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.110
from now and thinking, wow,
what a fabulous year this was.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.930
And I went through
various things in my head,

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.310
and I realized, well,
I probably wasn't

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.800
going to win the lottery.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.820
But if I did win
the lottery, I'd

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.080
probably complain that
the taxes were too high.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.210
I probably wasn't going to
move to Hawaii, but if I did,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.190
I'd probably get a sunburn
and be unhappy about that.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.620
And basically, I
realized that whatever

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.250
happens in the course
of a year, it's

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.040
really not the
events that happen

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.200
that make you happy
or unhappy, but it's

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.320
your own attitude towards them.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.100
And so that's when I decided to
challenge myself for the coming

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.650
year to see if I could spend
a year living more gratefully

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.500
and see if that would
really make a difference.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.600
Now, if it sounds like I was
incredibly smart on that New

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.160
Year's Eve to know that it's
not events that make you happy,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.090
it's your attitude
towards them, I

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.147
had actually been working on
gratitude for a year or so.

00:03:14.147 --> 00:03:16.480
I had been asked by the John
Templeton Foundation, which

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.340
is a big, wonderful,
international foundation, to do

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.380
a survey for them on gratitude.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.260
And I had done it.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.830
It was just a project for them.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.250
But then the results
started coming in,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.280
and they were really,
really interesting.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.190
Where something like,
if you ask people,

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.670
does gratitude make you happier?

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.240
Are grateful people happier?

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.150
Something like 90% of
people say absolutely,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.650
gratitude makes you happier.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.440
And if you say, are you grateful
for your family and friends?

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.640
They say, sure.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.070
Again, 85%, 90%
say, of course, I'm

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.760
grateful for my
family and friends.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.209
And then you say, do
you express gratitude?

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.375
And then the number plunges.

00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:58.630
And then all of a sudden,
it's at, like, 40%.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.170
So I started calling
that the gratitude gap.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.330
And I'm a journalist.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.062
I went on TV.

00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:07.020
I was talking about it.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.530
I wrote articles about it.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.160
And it took till that
New Year's Eve though,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.360
for me to realize that I was
as guilty of that gratitude gap

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.770
as anybody else.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.360
And what I mean by
that gratitude gap

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.769
is that we know
there's something

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.420
that's going to make us
happier, but we don't do it.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.120
And what's holding us back?

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.580
Why don't we?

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.310
I think there are
lots of reasons,

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.550
and we'll get to some of those.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.650
What I found in the
course of that year,

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.010
let me just jump ahead
to the end of the year,

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.120
is that by being grateful, by
trying to turn things around

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.830
on a daily basis,
by trying to find

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.880
the positive in
any kind of event,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.960
I ended up, oddly enough,
with the best year of my life.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.380
And nothing special
happened that year.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.290
I can't tell you
any fabulous event

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.250
that happened in that year other
than that I wrote that book.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.990
And yet, it was such
a wonderful year.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.220
And it was because my
attitude towards things

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.060
made me so much happier.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.440
And I think that
that's what I'd like

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.850
to be able to share
with you is the ways

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.880
that you can start
to feel happier

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.870
by using gratitude in that way.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.780
So in the course of the year,
I dealt with relationships.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.315
I dealt with family.

00:05:17.315 --> 00:05:18.690
I dealt with all
sorts of things.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.750
But one of the things that
I dealt with was work.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.820
And since we're
all here at Google,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.580
and I know you all
work, I just thought

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.150
we could talk about gratitude
at work for a couple of minutes.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.510
And I think gratitude at
work has two sides to it.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.080
One is appreciating
the job that you have,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.380
and the other is being
appreciated at your job.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.830
So let's start with the first
one, which is appreciating

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.720
the job that you have.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.430
So all of you
remember, probably,

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.910
when you applied for
this job, and then

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.100
how thrilled you were
when you got it, right?

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.580
You got the job at Google.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.330
That was really great.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.610
And now, it's the
job that you have.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.350
So you probably don't wake
up every single morning,

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.670
grateful for the fact
that you have this job.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.320
Psychologists call
it habituation, which

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.000
means you get used to stuff.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.490
You want something,
and you want it.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.430
You want this job.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.690
You want a diamond ring.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.729
You want a Porsche.

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:18.520
You want something.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.820
And then you get
it, and it becomes

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.100
the background of your life.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.970
It just becomes the baseline.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.820
And once we're at
the baseline, what

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.560
do we want except
the next step, right?

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.220
So we stop noticing
where we are.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.910
We stop noticing what
we actually have.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.460
And that's true,
frankly, with a job.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.290
It's true with a
spouse, with a partner,

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.620
with all sorts of things.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.250
And at one point, I was
calling it the Porsche

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.670
in the garage syndrome.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.130
Because I know so
many people who

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.164
are desperate for a Porsche.

00:06:49.164 --> 00:06:51.330
And they just think it's
going to change their life.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.770
They're going to be so happy.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.020
And then they get the Porsche.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.872
And that first day, they're
driving through Los Angeles.

00:06:56.872 --> 00:06:57.830
And they're so excited.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.230
And they're showing it off.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.630
And then after a while,
the traffic is still lousy.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.190
And they got to change the oil.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.990
And it's just the car they
drive to work every day.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.600
So that becomes the
Porsche in the garage.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.370
And who's excited about the car
that they have in the garage?

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.690
So what do you do at that point?

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.950
Well, I guess you could
get a Lamborghini.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.430
You work at Google, maybe
you could get a Lamborghini.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.720
But you get the point, that
you can always up the ante.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.790
You can always try
to up the ante.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.680
But probably what's going to
happen is you up the ante,

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.510
and you end up feeling the
same as when you started.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.020
So if you realize that, that's
the point at which you go, OK,

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.440
so how do I stop and appreciate
where I am right now?

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.180
And again, I ask the question
before, why don't we do that?

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.710
And I think at work, one
of the reasons we don't

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.130
do that-- excuse
me-- is that we're

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.950
afraid that if we're
grateful for what we have,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.090
we're not going to get any more.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.820
We have this image that
you have to be miserable.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.690
You have to be a
little unhappy where

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.140
you are in order to want
to get to the next step.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.380
That somehow, we have
this sense of ambition

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.620
as being something
that means-- I'm just

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.780
going to grab that water-- that
means that I can't be satisfied

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.140
where I am right now.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.050
I have to keep wanting to
go on to something else.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.480
Well, one of the
things I discovered

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.440
is that gratitude
and ambition actually

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.630
play very nicely together.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.130
That when you're grateful
for what you have,

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.130
when you appreciate what
you have, you're happier.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.220
You're a lot more
fun to be around.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.110
People like to be with
positive people, right?

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.360
And you're much more likely to
be able to take that next step.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.290
And because you feel
good about yourself,

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.440
you're much more likely to be
able to take that next step.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.830
So I think that's so important
to realize that gratitude

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.380
isn't a pat on the back.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.320
And gratitude isn't
just a platitude.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.590
I'm from New York.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.710
I am neither soft nor sappy.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.500
And I knew that gratitude
feels really soft and sappy

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.690
to a lot of people.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.560
But I knew that if, at
the end of the year,

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.810
it was just that
pat on the back,

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.860
it was just my saying
to myself or to others,

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.190
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
everything was fine,

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.080
that wasn't going to be right.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.290
But much more
important is that we're

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.070
able to spin our
own lives, right?

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.870
We're able to spin
how something happens,

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.980
to look at the bright
side of it or to look

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.870
at the negative side of it.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.890
And we tend to be really good
at looking at the negative side.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.590
So if 10 good things
happen to you in a day,

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.710
and one bad thing
happens, what's

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.010
the one you remember when
you go home at night?

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.490
What's the one you tell your
significant other about over

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:46.590
dinner?

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.540
You're unlikely to go through
the nine fabulous things that

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.440
happened, but you're
probably going

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.680
to focus on the one negative
thing that happened.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.100
Now, again, there's
a reason for this.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.270
Some psychologists say
that it may be hardwired,

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.000
that we may be hardwired
to focus on the negative,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.890
and for a really good reason.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.920
That our ancestors
in the jungles,

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.720
they were picking berries.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.810
They really needed to know
which was the poisonous berry.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.170
Knowing which were the nine
tasty berries didn't matter

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.350
that much, but knowing which
was the one poisonous berry

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.040
was really important,
otherwise, they

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.070
did not become our ancestors.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.960
So we've moved
beyond that though.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.180
And yeah, it's important to know
where the poisonous berry is.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.660
It's important to know
where the problems are

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.030
because you want to be able
to do something about it.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.070
But just focusing
on those and not

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.640
knowing where the
nine tasty berries are

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.120
is probably not the best way
to have a happy life either.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.250
So how do you do that?

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.230
What are some of the
specifics that you can

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.400
do to make yourself appreciate?

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.340
Well, one of the
women that I spoke to

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:59.310
as I was writing the book runs
a very large profit in the US.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:00.740
And she has a couple of kids.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.140
And she was, as many of you
are, overwhelmed by work,

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.750
and busy at home, and never
felt like she was doing enough

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.760
for anybody.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.130
And she told me that she
came up with a solution.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.600
She had a 20-minute drive home.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.110
And that she decided
that for those 20 minutes

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.980
in the car on the
way home every day,

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.550
she was only going to go
over the good things that

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.110
had happened that day.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.600
She was only going
to let herself

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.580
think about the positive
things, the nice thing

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.150
that somebody had
said, the success

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.560
that she'd had at work, the
achievement that she'd had.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.987
And she wasn't going to
think about the problems.

00:11:36.987 --> 00:11:38.320
Now, there are problems at work.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.130
We have problems at work.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.770
Thinking about the positive
doesn't make them go away.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.630
It doesn't mean they
don't exist anymore.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.129
It doesn't mean you're not going
to have to still solve them

00:11:47.129 --> 00:11:47.671
the next day.

00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:50.004
And I think that's the other
thing that we forget about.

00:11:50.004 --> 00:11:52.620
We think, if I'm obsessing about
it, it's going to get better.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.578
It's not going to get
better if there's nothing

00:11:54.578 --> 00:11:56.500
you can do about it that night.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.180
So thinking about
the positive things

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.040
is possibly going to put you
in a better frame of mind

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.520
in order to be able to
do better the next day.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.000
Another simple thing
that you can do.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.900
People talk about keeping
a gratitude journal.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.500
That sounds kind
of onerous, right?

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.780
We all work really hard.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.280
You write.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.010
You're on your computer all day.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.301
Do you really want to have
to go home at night and keep

00:12:17.301 --> 00:12:18.970
a gratitude journal?

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.310
I think of it as keeping
a little piece of paper

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:24.540
next to your bed where
you scrawl down one thing.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.760
Scrawl down one thing
before you go to bed

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:32.270
at night that is about something
good that happened that day.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.910
And I know it sounds
really simple,

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.540
and it sounds really small,
but you would be so surprised

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.000
how knowing that
you're going to do that

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.260
changes your entire day.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.261
So give yourself a week.

00:12:43.261 --> 00:12:45.218
Tell yourself you're
going to do it for a week.

00:12:45.218 --> 00:12:46.830
Who can't do
something for a week?

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.190
And you're going to
wake up in the morning,

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:50.910
and you'll have
your cup of coffee,

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.695
and you'll go, oh, grateful for
my cup of coffee, that's it.

00:12:53.695 --> 00:12:56.070
I don't have to worry about
this for the rest of the day,

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.694
I've got what I'm
going to write about.

00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.264
OK, that's fine.

00:12:59.264 --> 00:13:00.930
You've also put
yourself in a little bit

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.170
of a positive framework at
9 o'clock in the morning,

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.630
and that's not a bad thing.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.000
Or maybe it gets to be 4
o'clock in the afternoon,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.620
and you go, oh, gosh, I haven't
been grateful for anything

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:14.200
today, and I'm going to have to
come up with something tonight.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.450
What should I be grateful for?

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.260
And maybe you go, you know what?

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.426
I'm going to be grateful
for that piece of chocolate

00:13:19.426 --> 00:13:22.430
that I have right
here, because why not?

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.355
And I'm actually going
to stop and appreciate

00:13:24.355 --> 00:13:25.980
this piece of chocolate,
and appreciate

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.230
that it's really tasty,
and that it was out there,

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.370
and that that's
kind of a cool thing

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.000
that I have this
piece of chocolate.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.020
And I'm going to appreciate it
in a slightly different way.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.200
Or maybe you just look out.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.590
And the sun is down now,
but when I walked in here,

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:42.000
the sun was just absolutely
beautiful on the buildings

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.240
across the way.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.320
And maybe you see it every
day, but maybe you actually

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.130
pause and think, I'm
going to be grateful

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.610
today that I get to see this
beautiful, beautiful sight.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.620
And again, it's
such a small thing.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.750
It's not interfering
with your day very much.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.070
It's not interfering
with your job very much.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.751
But it's putting you in a
slightly different frame

00:14:00.751 --> 00:14:01.250
of mind.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.990
It's such a small thing that
you can do for yourself.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.240
And as you start to
do it more and more,

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.000
you'll find how simple
it is to actually do

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.190
in circumstances that are
difficult or frustrating.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.300
I flew in from New
York the other night.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.360
It was a great flight.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.460
We got in.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.750
I got to customs or
passport control,

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:27.270
and there was an hour
and a half line there.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.460
There was really nothing
I could do about that.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.220
I said to my husband, do you
think I could have a fit,

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.719
and they would put
me through first?

00:14:32.719 --> 00:14:35.310
He said, no, I think they
would put you in jail.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.450
So we're standing in line,
and 30 minutes goes by.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.322
And you're tired at that point,
and you're a little bit grumpy.

00:14:42.322 --> 00:14:44.530
And I thought, no, I don't
want to start my trip here

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.180
being grumpy.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.390
I'm excited to be in London.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.750
So I said to my husband,
let's play the gratitude game.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.400
He's done this enough now.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.820
He goes, all right, Ms.
Gratitude, go ahead.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.000
And I said, I'm so excited
that we're in London.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.020
This is really cool.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:58.700
I'm so happy.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.908
I'm so happy that I'm going
to get to talk at Google.

00:15:00.908 --> 00:15:03.040
And it became a joke, of course.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.250
But it made us
laugh, and it made us

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.580
both say, what's the big deal?

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.240
We're standing in
line, you know?

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:09.740
OK.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.459
And there's nothing
we can do about it.

00:15:11.459 --> 00:15:13.250
Now that's the other
thing about gratitude.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.700
If there's something you can
do about the situation, do it.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.840
Gratitude is not meant
to turn you into a sap.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.460
Do anything that you can.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.940
But so often in life,
we're in situations where

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.810
we can't do something about it.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:31.710
And all we can do, all we can
control, is our attitudes.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:35.200
What's surprising,
I think, also,

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.610
about being grateful, about
knowing that you can do that,

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.696
is how it gives you a bit of
control back in your life.

00:15:41.696 --> 00:15:43.570
Because sometimes, when
you're in a situation

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:46.130
like you're standing in line,
or you're caught in traffic,

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.280
or the tube is late, or
whatever the problem is,

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.890
you just feel helpless.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.500
And that's part of
the frustration.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.630
There's nothing you can do.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.300
You just feel helpless about it.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.750
And if you allow yourself
that gratitude moment,

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.510
if you allow yourself
to say, I don't have

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.360
to make this
irritating, I don't have

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.370
to have this something
that frustrates me,

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.340
it gives you a bit
of control back.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:11.570
And that has a really, really
surprising effect on you.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.940
So I said at the
beginning that there are

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.560
two sides to gratitude at work.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.720
One is appreciating
your job, and the other

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.680
is being appreciated.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.570
And as I was doing the book,
and as I was talking to people,

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:32.070
I was stunned by how bad we are
at expressing thanks at work,

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:37.820
or having people say
thank you to us at work.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:42.080
And it's such a surprise because
every "Harvard Business Review"

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.000
article now, every
book, every psychologist

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.140
who writes about this
subject, talks about the fact

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.140
that most of us are
motivated-- of course,

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.660
we want to have a good
paycheck, that's the baseline.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.840
We understand that.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.150
But most of us are
really motivated

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.600
by feeling that the
work we do is important,

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.030
and feeling that the
work we do matters,

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.450
feeling that we're
doing something

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.560
that people will appreciate.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.150
And as I was writing
this book, and I

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.490
was talking to executives,
one after another

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.250
would tell me, no, no,
no, we say thank you here

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.730
with a paycheck.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.119
And it's an old line that
people have been using.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:20.630
If you know the
TV show "Mad Men,"

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.950
they use that line in the '60s.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.450
And I finally got
to the point where

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.020
I wanted to say, no, you don't
say thank you with a paycheck.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.685
You say thank you
with thank you.

00:17:29.685 --> 00:17:32.930
You say we're paying
you with a paycheck.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:38.420
And I know at Google, and I even
mentioned Google in the book,

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.100
one of the mantras
from the HR people

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.110
is we appreciate the
people who work here,

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.180
and we want people to be happy.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.100
And that's great.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:52.880
And I hope that that corporate
ethos does indeed exist,

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.990
and that you do feel it.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:57.759
But everybody's an individual.

00:17:57.759 --> 00:17:59.175
And there are
probably some of you

00:17:59.175 --> 00:18:00.680
who have people
who you report to

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:05.080
or who you deal with who
aren't quite as good at that,

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.740
and who have high expectations,
and who have the feeling

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.630
that, if I have
high expectations,

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.060
you'll work harder.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.600
They're wrong.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.680
That survey that I
did for the book,

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.280
we found that 81% of people
said that they would work harder

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.980
for a grateful boss.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:30.500
And 90% of people said that they
thought a grateful boss would

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.730
be more successful
because people

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.430
would rally around him or her.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.140
And really, nobody
succeeds, nobody

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.310
gets to the top on their own.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:43.260
So those are two really,
really important numbers to me.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.330
That people will work harder.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.600
If you're the boss, if there
are people who work for you

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.210
or report to you,
people will work harder

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.160
if you say thank you to them.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.350
And you're more likely
to be successful.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:03.230
So once we realize that, there's
pretty much no reason at all

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.870
that we wouldn't be grateful.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.110
And I had the experience.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.430
I was in New York a
couple of months ago,

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.990
and I was having dinner
with a friend of mine

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:18.170
who is a partner at a big,
big New York law firm.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.010
And he made a call
during dinner.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.130
And he was obviously
speaking to an associate.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.040
And he said to him, I need that
on my desk tomorrow morning

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.220
at 8 o'clock.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:26.930
And he hung up.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.450
And I said to my
friend, does that

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.090
mean that guy's going to
have to work all night?

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.810
And he said, yeah.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.630
And I said, well, are you going
to say thank you to him when

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.180
you go in tomorrow morning?

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:42.210
And he said, no, it's his job.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.030
Now, I'd written a
book on gratitude, OK?

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.640
He knew it.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.680
And I said, OK, here's an idea.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.840
Why don't you stop on
your way into the office,

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.850
and buy a cup of coffee,
and put it on his desk.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:57.660
And say, I appreciate that
you had to work all night.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.340
You don't even have
to say thank you.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.910
Just say, I appreciate that
you had to work all night.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.509
And my friend got
it, and he laughed.

00:20:03.509 --> 00:20:05.300
And he said, yeah, the
coffee's a good idea

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:10.330
because at least he'll stay
up for the rest of the day.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:15.990
So sometimes, it really
is those small things,

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.190
those small things
that remind us

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:20.640
that we're in an
environment where

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.560
we need to support each other.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.730
And there's a CEO.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.750
Actually, he was the
CEO of Campbell's Soup.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:29.780
His name is Doug Conant.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:34.080
And he was the CEO there
from 2001 for 10 years.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.410
So probably, he left
a few years ago.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:40.470
And when Doug got to
Campbell's, the company

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.400
was not doing that well.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.790
It's a Fortune 500 company
in the United States,

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.130
but it was not-- you know
what Campbell's is, right?

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:48.870
They make soups.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:51.050
It's international, isn't it?

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.150
And it was not doing well.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.510
And Doug's job was to come
in and turn it around.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.440
Now, he's a really
smart businessman.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.550
And I'm not taking away any of
the business side of things,

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:04.200
which I completely
don't understand,

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.830
but I'm sure he did brilliantly.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.030
But he also told me
that one of the things

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:11.220
he did there was that
every single day,

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.270
he wrote six handwritten
thank you notes

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.920
to somebody in the company.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.810
And it wasn't just to the
executives who worked for him.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:24.530
He would send it off to somebody
in a plant in some small town,

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:26.670
or to the guy who's on the
assembly line somewhere,

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.360
or to the guys who
were packing the boxes.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.920
And he actually had
somebody on his staff

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.370
whose whole job
was to find things

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.370
that people had done
good in the company

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.590
so that he could send
them the thank you notes.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.580
And you could multiply it out.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.250
I didn't, but he
told me writing six

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:47.310
thank you notes six days
a week for 10 years,

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:51.040
he figures he wrote about
30,000 thank you notes.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:57.390
And the twist on that story
is that one of the last years

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:00.380
that he was at the company, he
was in a terrible, terrible car

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.460
accident.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:06.140
And he was in the ICU,
the emergency unit,

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.290
for a couple of weeks.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.000
And they actually weren't sure
that he was going to survive.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.190
And he started getting notes
in from around the world.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.840
And his wife was
sitting on his bedside

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.030
and reading him the notes.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.980
And as you can imagine,
so many of them

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.540
were from people who
worked for him, from people

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:30.070
who were writing to him and
saying, you don't know me,

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.230
but six years ago, you
sent me a thank you note.

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.360
And my family was so proud, and
it's been on our refrigerator

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.520
ever since.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.060
And so I've always felt like
you're a member of the family.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.976
And now, my thoughts and
prayers are with you,

00:22:41.976 --> 00:22:43.360
and I hope you get well.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.700
And Doug was so
incredibly moved by that.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.410
And he hadn't
written his thank you

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.240
notes figuring that it was
all going to come back around,

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.470
but it does.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.540
And putting out those
expressions of gratitude,

00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:00.330
giving that gratitude really,
really makes a difference.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.300
If you don't have a
boss, or an executive,

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.902
or a CEO who's doing
it, what do you do?

00:23:05.902 --> 00:23:06.610
Well, guess what?

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.800
Gratitude can start anywhere.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.480
I think another
problem we have is

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.188
that we sometimes
think that we shouldn't

00:23:12.188 --> 00:23:13.780
be grateful to our colleagues.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.010
I said in that survey,
we only say thank you

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:18.205
to our colleagues
10% of the time.

00:23:18.205 --> 00:23:20.580
Because again, it goes back
to what we were talking about

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.610
before, that sense of ambition,
and we're all a little bit

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:24.320
competitive.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.030
And if we say she
did such a good job,

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.175
does it mean I didn't
do as good a job?

00:23:28.175 --> 00:23:31.130
It really doesn't.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:32.650
We all do so much
better-- and I'm

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.900
sure your corporate
structure here

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.810
supports that-- we all do
so much better when we're

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.290
supporting each other,
and when we're collegial,

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.500
and when we recognize what
other people have done.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.320
It just makes for a
better atmosphere.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.430
So if you're not
getting it from the top,

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.470
you can start it anywhere.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.760
And you can appreciate the
people who work with you.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.660
And yeah, I'm sure there'll
be a jerk somewhere who

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.180
tries to stab you in
the back with that.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.260
That's going to happen.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:59.470
But that's not
been my experience

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:03.090
that that's the general
way things work.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:08.420
People recognize people who are
genuinely appreciative of them,

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:14.500
and of what they're doing, and
who care about giving that way.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.830
Another way that gratitude
works really interestingly

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:22.000
is with a spouse, a partner,
a boyfriend or a girlfriend.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.330
I was talking about habituation
before, and the sense of people

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.960
slipping back into
the background

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.830
and becoming the baseline.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:33.090
And in that survey
that we did, again, we

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.800
found that people were more
likely to say thank you

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.870
to the barista at
the coffee shop

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.630
or the guy who delivers
the mail than they were

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.030
to their own spouse or partner.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.070
So what's up with that?

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:48.750
Well, I think the answer
is that you don't really

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.690
expect that much from the
barista at the coffee shop.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.530
And if he makes you a nice
cappuccino, that's worth

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.150
a thank you.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:00.410
Whereas for the person
that we are connected to,

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.490
we have pretty
high expectations.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:07.530
And most of us are
really good at knowing

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.880
how our partners could
be so much better if only

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.420
they would listen to us.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.330
And so we tend to focus on that.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.750
We tend to be very
good at reminding them

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.170
of all of the things that
they could do better.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.790
And the first month of
my year of gratitude,

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.620
I decided that I was
going to try to notice

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.387
my husband a little bit more.

00:25:29.387 --> 00:25:31.220
And that I was going
to try to say thank you

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:35.430
to him for the things that
he probably did all the time,

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.060
but that we'd been
married a long time,

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.810
and that I'd stopped noticing.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.360
So it started the first weekend.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.950
And we were driving up to--
we live in New York City.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.110
We have a house in
Connecticut also.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.940
And we were driving
up to our house

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.280
as we do most Friday nights.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:53.300
And we pulled in, and I
said, thank you for driving.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.830
And he said, I always drive.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:00.790
And I said, I know you
always drive, but you know,

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:01.940
I'm a lousy driver.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:02.725
It's snowing.

00:26:02.725 --> 00:26:03.350
It's miserable.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.970
It's dark.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:07.460
And I appreciate
that you got us here.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.620
And he didn't say anything.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.911
This was the very, very
beginning of my gratitude year,

00:26:10.911 --> 00:26:14.060
so he didn't quite know
what I was doing yet.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.930
And we spent the whole
weekend that way.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.890
And I thanked him for all
sorts of little things

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:23.310
that he did, or told
him he looked great,

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.910
or thanked him for
fixing something.

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:26.030
He's a fix it kind of guy.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.480
And he was just sort of taking
it in and kind of not sure

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.830
who he was living
with this weekend.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.890
And then it got to Sunday night.

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:38.590
And we had dinner, and he said,
thank you for making dinner.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:42.450
And I said, I
always make dinner.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:45.140
But the vibe had changed.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.930
All of a sudden, we
were noticing each other

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:52.780
and appreciating each
other in a different way.

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:57.240
And I was planning only to do
that for a month, may I say.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.370
But it was such
a dramatic change

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:04.650
that appreciating, and being
grateful, and saying thank you

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:08.185
to my spouse really, really
lasted in a very dramatic way

00:27:08.185 --> 00:27:11.230
and gave us a pretty
extraordinary year.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.876
And on that second New Year's--
my book is written from New

00:27:13.876 --> 00:27:14.750
Year's to New Year's.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:16.980
And on that second
New Year's, I told him

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:21.080
that I wanted the last
chapter of the book

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.630
to be New Year's Eve.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:26.540
And so he came up with all
sorts of things that we could do

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.770
to have a great New Year's.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:28.271
No pressure.

00:27:28.271 --> 00:27:30.186
It's going to be the
last chapter of the book.

00:27:30.186 --> 00:27:31.570
Give me a perfect
New Year's Eve.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:35.750
And I said, no, no, I really
just want to be at our house,

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.960
at our country house,
just with you, just a fire

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.790
and a bottle of champagne.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.612
And again, a little
bit of pressure.

00:27:41.612 --> 00:27:43.320
But then it got to be
a quarter of 12:00,

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.090
and we've had a wonderful night.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:49.020
And again, we turn on the TV as
the previous year and the ball

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.740
is about to drop in New York.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.287
And shamefully,
I started to cry.

00:27:54.287 --> 00:27:55.870
And my husband said,
oh, no, I thought

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:57.420
I did such a good job tonight.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.170
What's wrong?

00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.420
Why are you unhappy?

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.760
And I said, no, this has
just been such a great year,

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.245
and I don't want it to end.

00:28:04.245 --> 00:28:06.690
And he said-- I
don't actually admit

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.690
this in the book--
he said, you actually

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:10.470
could be nice next year too.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:19.940
But it really was
so powerful to me

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.470
of how we had
reconnected that year

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.510
and how good we felt
about each other.

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:29.490
And again, everybody's
at different stages

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.690
in relationships and
different stages in life,

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:36.030
but it's sort of like a job.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.640
If you can't find reasons
to be grateful to your job,

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.410
if you can't find one,
or two, or three things

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:43.940
that you can write down
right now about your job,

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:47.420
and put in your top drawer, and
hold on to them for those days

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.380
that you're feeling
lousy, then you probably

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.717
should leave your job.

00:28:51.717 --> 00:28:53.050
And it's the same with a spouse.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.633
If you can't find one reason,
or two reasons, or three reasons

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:59.400
to be grateful, then you're
probably with the wrong person.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.000
But for many of us who
are in relationships,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.340
we just forget to do that.

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.800
And the same with a job.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.680
Take that piece of
paper out tonight.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.340
Write down two or
three reasons why

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.520
you're excited, and grateful,
and happy that you're here.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.380
And have them there
as that little backup,

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.940
as a reminder on those lousy
days, that you can pull it out

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.690
and go, yep, reasons
to be grateful.

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:25.830
And add to it as
often as you can.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.550
And I think you'll be
surprised to discover what

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.310
a huge difference it can make.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:33.940
So I'm going to
stop talking and see

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.966
if there are any questions
I can take from you.

00:29:36.966 --> 00:29:38.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.356
Thank you.

00:29:43.405 --> 00:29:45.280
MALE SPEAKER: Does anyone
have any questions?

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.290
AUDIENCE: So I think
people naturally

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:54.250
have different levels of
gratefulness. [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.520
develop to be
grateful naturally.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:02.163
Did you find any patterns
between female and male,

00:30:02.163 --> 00:30:05.121
if some cultures were more
grateful than other cultures?

00:30:05.121 --> 00:30:08.227
Did you do any
analysis of this sort?

00:30:08.227 --> 00:30:10.060
JANICE KAPLAN: Yeah,
that's a great question

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.260
from a data person, clearly.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.460
We did.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:19.690
And in that survey, women tend
to be more grateful than men.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.200
And interestingly,
women are more

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.330
grateful in every
situation except at home.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:30.010
And at home, men tend to be more
grateful to their significant

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.340
other than women are.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.670
Now it may be that women
do so much more at home

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:37.160
that men should be
more grateful to them.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.090
I wouldn't draw that
conclusion because I'm

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.820
sure your data may
not support it.

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:47.230
But I worried, at
first, that gratitude

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:51.780
was too much of a women
subject because it is something

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.020
that women tend to think
about more, but really not.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:31:00.120
I think that for men,
particularly at work,

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.740
are starting to get the idea,
and starting to realize it,

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.320
and starting to realize that
there are ways that they

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.350
can make themselves happier.

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:12.780
Interestingly, also
in that survey,

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:17.770
millennials were
the least grateful.

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:23.730
And people actually younger than
you had probably the biggest

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:24.230
problems.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.021
Maybe some of you are
younger than I think.

00:31:26.021 --> 00:31:30.080
But people in the 18
to 24 range really

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.060
had a hard time with gratitude.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.500
And I think for a
lot of them, it's

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.614
because they really
want to be independent.

00:31:38.614 --> 00:31:41.030
They really want to be able
to do everything on their own,

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:42.480
and they can't yet.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.390
And so we did some
focus groups, and there

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:47.710
would be some kids who
had just graduated college

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:49.190
who would say,
well, my parents are

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.119
paying for my first
apartment, and my parents

00:31:51.119 --> 00:31:52.410
are doing this and that for me.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.420
And I feel really guilty
that I can't do it myself,

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.320
and the guilt outweighs
the gratitude.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.160
So I think there's
a point where it's

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.550
hard to be grateful sometimes,
in those circumstances,

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:06.280
because it makes you feel like
you're not as strong as you

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.680
want to be.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.160
And I understand that.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:15.910
But I think it's really
important at any age.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:20.530
And I think the other thing is
that you don't want gratitude

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:25.420
to be something that you only
see in the rear-view mirror.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.210
You don't want to be
looking back in 10 years

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:32.200
and say, why didn't
I appreciate that?

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.690
Why didn't I realize
how wonderful that was?

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:38.820
Why was I always so
busy running and doing

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.620
this and that that I
couldn't stop and pause

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:42.720
to appreciate it?

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.990
I think, sometimes, that's
a really good perspective.

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:48.040
When you're miserable
about something,

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.580
particularly at your
job, stop and think

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.020
how you're going to feel about
that in 10 years, in five

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.130
years, in two years.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.095
Think how you'd feel about it
if you didn't have the job.

00:32:58.095 --> 00:32:59.720
I often say that to
people when they're

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.930
complaining to me about
their work, their boss,

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.420
that they're working so hard.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:08.020
I say, put yourself in the
mindset of if you didn't have

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.490
that job, what would you miss?

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:11.950
Maybe you'd miss the free food.

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:15.900
Maybe you'd miss the chance
to do something important.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.080
Maybe you'd miss
your colleagues.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.570
And if you can remember that, if
you can think about the things

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.410
that you would really
want to have again, I

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:28.880
think that can really
help put you back

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.530
in the mindset
that's so helpful.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:34.846
Yes.

00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:36.800
AUDIENCE: I have a
really cranky grandma.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.690
JANICE KAPLAN: You have a what?

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:38.981
AUDIENCE: A cranky grandmother.

00:33:38.981 --> 00:33:41.660
She's 88, and she's
really bad at appreciating

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.060
all of the things that
she's done in her life,

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.626
and where she is now, and the
family she has around her.

00:33:46.626 --> 00:33:48.125
Do you think there's
any tactics you

00:33:48.125 --> 00:33:50.300
can do where you
could speak to someone

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.660
who's older to try and shift
them from being cranky?

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:53.860
JANICE KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:57.240
It's a great question,
and it's really hard.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.850
I had it with my mom, who
was not a grateful person.

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:06.940
And I would tell her
what I was doing,

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.960
and she would always
have another reason.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.184
I would say exactly that.

00:34:11.184 --> 00:34:12.100
Look at your children.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.080
Look at your grandchildren.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:13.955
Isn't this wonderful?

00:34:13.955 --> 00:34:17.619
And it would always
be a yes, but.

00:34:17.619 --> 00:34:19.000
And that's hard.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.610
And it's hard because
you see somebody

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:24.070
making themselves unhappy.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:28.280
And I guess you can try
it, and I think you should.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.080
And I think it's a
really kind thing

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.460
to do for the person to point
it out to them because nobody

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.539
wants to be unhappy.

00:34:34.539 --> 00:34:36.830
Your grandmother probably
doesn't wake up every morning

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.650
and say, I think I'd
like to be unhappy today.

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.135
But she doesn't
know how to do it.

00:34:41.135 --> 00:34:42.260
She doesn't have the tools.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.969
And so maybe it will
be helpful to her

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:47.060
for you to try to
do that and for you

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.070
to try to give her that advice.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:53.270
And even if it's not, it's going
to be really helpful for you

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:56.960
because it's going to
make you, in some ways,

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.250
more sympathetic
to her attitude.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.251
Because you're going
to see the other side,

00:35:01.251 --> 00:35:03.500
and you're not going to be
constantly irritated at it.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.262
You're going to see, hey.

00:35:05.262 --> 00:35:07.720
And you're also going to say,
I don't want to be like that.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:12.780
And sometimes, a negative
role model is OK too.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:16.680
And to see somebody who's-- and
I will warn you of one thing,

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.640
that once you start doing
this gratitude stuff,

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:23.080
you get so irritated at
people who don't get it.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.770
You become like--
I never smoked,

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.070
but what I imagine reformed
smokers must be like.

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:30.170
They want to rip cigarettes
away from everybody.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.030
You get like that.

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.010
And when people are
like your grandmother,

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:36.240
or I have a couple of friends
who would be always complaining

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:36.840
about things.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.860
And I would just stamp my foot
and go, would you stop that?

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.160
Yes, there's this
terrible, horrible commute

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.687
that you have to have of 20
minutes, but you go to a job

00:35:46.687 --> 00:35:48.770
that you love, and you're
in a beautiful building,

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:52.140
and you've had this
job for a long time.

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:59.240
I would just be so frustrated
by hearing complaints.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.570
But I think that's OK.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.700
And I think that a lot of
people start to come around also

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.630
once you start
pointing it out to them

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:08.510
and once you start
saying, let's just stop

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:11.380
and look at something from
a positive perspective.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.642
And it makes a difference.

00:36:14.642 --> 00:36:16.614
Anybody else?

00:36:16.614 --> 00:36:17.600
Yes.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.530
AUDIENCE: Does your research
look at the role of technology

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:24.995
in gratitude and happiness?

00:36:24.995 --> 00:36:26.859
And particularly
for social media,

00:36:26.859 --> 00:36:28.692
for me, I feel like
there's a big resurgence

00:36:28.692 --> 00:36:30.911
in people being
grateful and using

00:36:30.911 --> 00:36:32.390
the hashtag on social media.

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:34.362
But I'm really
interested in knowing,

00:36:34.362 --> 00:36:36.334
do you have any research
that looks into that?

00:36:36.334 --> 00:36:38.083
And perhaps on the
other side of the coin,

00:36:38.083 --> 00:36:41.790
how social media can make us
really unhappy and ungrateful.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:44.450
JANICE KAPLAN: Well, there
were a few big articles that

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.664
came out about social
media causing--

00:36:47.664 --> 00:36:50.330
and I forget what the phrase was
they were using-- but basically

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:52.163
saying that it makes
you unhappy because you

00:36:52.163 --> 00:36:55.320
see everybody else on Facebook
posting their wonderful lives.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.880
And you read their
wonderful lives

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.470
and say, why is my
life not that good?

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:02.540
And may I say I thought that
research was ridiculous.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.910
Because we're all
grownups here, right?

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:07.810
We're all reading Facebook
and know that our friends

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:09.690
are posting positive things.

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:13.790
And it made me say, well,
let's use social media to make

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:15.390
ourselves happier then.

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:18.540
Because it's actually a good
thing if you think about it.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:23.930
If you're posting on Facebook or
wherever you guys like to post,

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:26.361
you probably are putting up
the good picture on Instagram.

00:37:26.361 --> 00:37:28.610
You're not putting up the
picture where you're crying.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:30.190
You're putting up the
picture where you look happy.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:32.148
You're putting up the
picture where your arm is

00:37:32.148 --> 00:37:34.210
around your boyfriend.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:35.640
So what are you doing?

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.100
You're essentially finding
reasons to be grateful,

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.890
and you're putting it out there.

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.750
And I actually think
that's a wonderful thing.

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.609
And again, maybe
it's just a turn

00:37:44.609 --> 00:37:45.900
on how to look at social media.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.800
If you look at it
that way, that's

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.320
a really positive
use of social media.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:56.550
And in that way, I think
that we do it naturally

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:59.630
because we like to put out
the best look of ourselves

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:00.462
to other people.

00:38:00.462 --> 00:38:02.670
But we're also putting out
the best look of ourselves

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:03.650
to ourselves.

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:06.390
And I've actually suggested
to a lot of families

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:08.600
who are worried
about their kids,

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.200
and I've said, use
social media for good.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.510
So pick a day, make Tuesday
family gratitude day.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.757
And everybody in the family
takes a picture that day

00:38:17.757 --> 00:38:19.340
and posts it on
Instagram of something

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.610
that they're grateful for.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.139
And if you're embarrassed
about the #gratitude,

00:38:23.139 --> 00:38:24.930
you don't even have to
tell everybody else.

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:26.710
But everybody in the
family knows that,

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.460
and it becomes a
nice little bonding,

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:32.850
and it becomes a way that you
can use it in a positive way.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:36.600
But I think if we realize
that, in a funny way,

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.660
social media-- and
I agree with you.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.790
All the #gratitudes can
be a little bit much,

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:44.310
and we don't necessarily
want to read every day why

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:46.735
somebody else is grateful.

00:38:46.735 --> 00:38:48.110
Though I will tell
you that there

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:52.130
is one person who works
at my publishing company.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:55.230
And I can't tell you his name
because I don't know his name.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:58.400
I met him at a very dark
party when my book came out.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:05.560
And he told me that he
texts out every morning.

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.090
And he actually had been in
AA, in Alcoholics Anonymous,

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:09.720
which uses gratitude a lot.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.690
And that for the last year, he
had been texting every morning

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:15.340
to a bunch of
friends three reasons

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.940
why he was going to
be grateful that day.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.650
And I said, well,
I'd love to get that.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:22.080
That would be
really interesting.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.650
And this was last May, and I put
my phone number into his phone.

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:30.950
And I have now, every morning
since then, gotten these.

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:34.440
And it's actually
kind of wonderful

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.586
because I actually
don't know who he is.

00:39:36.586 --> 00:39:38.460
I would not know him if
he were sitting here.

00:39:41.805 --> 00:39:44.200
And I sometimes feel like
I'm cheating, like I'm not

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.350
writing my own gratitudes.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:46.740
I'm just getting his in.

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.414
But it actually starts
the day in a nice way.

00:39:49.414 --> 00:39:50.830
And he's actually
a lovely writer.

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:53.038
And he doesn't write those
silly things like grateful

00:39:53.038 --> 00:39:53.920
for coffee.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.880
He's thoughtful in
a much deeper level.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.540
And so I think
that there is a way

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:06.040
that we can share positive
feelings, positive viewpoints.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.830
He'll send out, "I'm
grateful because it's Monday,

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:11.190
and I get to start the
week with a fresh slate.

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:14.390
And I know that I get to control
today however I want it to be,

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:16.954
and I get to control this
week however I want it to be.

00:40:16.954 --> 00:40:19.370
And so I'm grateful that I
have the chance to be positive.

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:20.560
And I'm grateful that
I have the chance

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.620
to go forward and know
that I can do that."

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.580
And I'll go, yeah, you bet.

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.610
That's right.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:30.440
So I think that we can
use social media, whatever

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:36.566
formats that we like, in a
very positive way that way.

00:40:36.566 --> 00:40:39.410
MALE SPEAKER: Your question.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:41.420
AUDIENCE: So first
off, thank you.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.920
It's been fantastic.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.630
One of the things
you talked about,

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:48.615
you said gratitude can
start from anywhere.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.810
You didn't state it directly,
but are you also saying

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:59.040
that rather than expecting
other people to be grateful

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.900
or trying to encourage them to
be grateful, the act of being

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.025
grateful to them
yourself is a trigger

00:41:04.025 --> 00:41:05.846
and helps them to be grateful?

00:41:05.846 --> 00:41:07.660
Do you see that happening?

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.680
JANICE KAPLAN: I do think that's
the case, and at least in part

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.022
because you can't make
somebody else grateful, right?

00:41:13.022 --> 00:41:14.730
You can't make your
grandmother grateful.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:18.930
You can't ask somebody
to appreciate your work.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:22.970
But you can stop and
be grateful yourself.

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:25.100
And then maybe it becomes
a little less important

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.360
what somebody else's
says to you because

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.280
the outside circumstances,
the outside events,

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.820
become a little less important.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.300
And your gratitude
comes from within,

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.540
and your appreciation
comes from within.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.590
And I do think it is contagious.

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:43.000
I do think it's very hard
to appreciate somebody else,

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.990
say thank you to somebody
else, without it coming back.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:49.580
Try it at a store sometime.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.970
If you talk about cheating.

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:55.300
People who don't
normally get appreciated,

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:59.440
a store clerk, the cashier,
give them a big smile

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.810
and say, I really appreciate it.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:01.890
Thanks for your help.

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:05.670
And their attitude
will completely change.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:08.270
And the people who you
just naturally want to get

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:10.470
irritated at, like the
person at the bank who's

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:12.270
unbelievably slow,
and you want to go,

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:16.320
could you count that foreign
currency any slower for me?

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.814
And instead, you say,
thanks, it's been really busy

00:42:19.814 --> 00:42:20.730
here today, hasn't it?

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:22.560
And I appreciate you doing that.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.080
And again, your
attitude changes,

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.600
and their attitude changes.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.600
And I just think it's a
very simple, simple exchange

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.772
that you can do.

00:42:30.772 --> 00:42:32.740
MALE SPEAKER: We'll
take one more question.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:36.087
There's one-- was
one over there.

00:42:36.087 --> 00:42:37.670
Anyone wants to ask
one more question?

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.230
AUDIENCE: In your year
that you were gracious,

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:49.750
did you ever have circumstances
where you found someone

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:53.552
who was totally unhappy in their
life and took it out on you,

00:42:53.552 --> 00:42:56.490
and you didn't think they
deserved your gratitude?

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.006
How do you deal with that?

00:42:58.006 --> 00:42:59.589
JANICE KAPLAN: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:42:59.589 --> 00:43:04.400
Well, I'll tell you a story
that may answer the question.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.320
I live in New York.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:09.060
And it happened to
be a very snowy year

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.877
when I was writing that book.

00:43:10.877 --> 00:43:12.210
As I said, I started in January.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:15.850
So it was maybe March, and there
had been a horrible snowstorm.

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:19.720
And I'm trudging through
New York near my apartment.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.850
And somebody was shoveling snow.

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:25.460
And he takes a big
shovel full of snow,

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:29.190
and he throws it
back right onto me.

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:33.420
And I, of course, responded
in the gracious way

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.880
that you would expect me
to-- with a large number

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.780
of profanities, yelled at him
to please be careful and pay

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:41.560
more attention to what he was
doing, and how dare he do that.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.470
And I continued
through the storm,

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:45.250
storming down the street.

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:48.000
And then I paused, and
I thought, oh, it's

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.370
my year of gratitude.

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:51.070
I'm not allowed to do that.

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:52.730
And I literally stopped.

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:53.720
I literally stopped.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.890
And I had snow all over me.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:55.598
I brushed it off.

00:43:55.598 --> 00:43:59.200
And I thought, all right,
how could I possibly

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.620
be grateful in
this circumstance?

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:03.600
And I knew he hadn't seen me.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.680
And I thought, all right, I'm
grateful that this guy is out

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.650
shoveling, and I'm not.

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:12.390
And I'm grateful that
I live in a place

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:14.850
where people actually are
shoveling the sidewalk

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:16.420
and taking care of it.

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:19.850
And I'm grateful that I haven't
slipped yet on the sidewalk,

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:22.370
and this poor guy is
out there shoveling.

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:24.620
And it made me feel
so much better.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.250
Because when you are
angry at somebody,

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:29.460
when you do yell at somebody,
you feel bad, right?

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:33.150
And so I turned around, and I
walked back down the street.

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:35.702
And this poor man
now looks up at me.

00:44:35.702 --> 00:44:37.160
First, this lady
has yelled at him.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.220
Now, she's coming back.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.178
What's she going to do?

00:44:39.178 --> 00:44:42.130
And I just called out, and I
said, thank you for shoveling.

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:45.060
I really appreciate that
you're keeping the area clear.

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.430
And he must have thought
that I was a complete loon.

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:50.050
Who does this?

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:53.110
But I turned around
and continued on,

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:55.470
and I felt so much better.

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:57.460
And I don't know how
he felt. Maybe he

00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.720
was just baffled by this.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:03.470
Or maybe he did say, oh, that's
nice, she said thank you.

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:06.000
So I think you can
always find a reason.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.340
And I think it
goes back to what I

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.630
said before that
other people aren't

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:12.800
looking to be unhappy either.

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:15.810
And if you can help them
find a way to be happy,

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:18.590
and if you can find
something good that they did,

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:21.276
maybe it can turn things
around for both of you.

00:45:21.276 --> 00:45:23.900
MALE SPEAKER: Please join me in
a massive thank you for Janice.

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:26.867 --> 00:45:28.700
JANICE KAPLAN: Thank
you all for being here.

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.550
I appreciate it.
