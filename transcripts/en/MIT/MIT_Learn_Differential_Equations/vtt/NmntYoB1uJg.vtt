GILBERT STRANG: This is a
topic I think is interesting.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.220
I like this one.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.160
It's about stability or
instability of a steady state.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.610
So let me show you the
differential equation.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.240
It could be linear, but
might be non linear.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.270
dy dt is f of y.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.580
I'm going to-- I keep it that
right hand side not depending

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.940
on t, so just a function of y.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.290
And when do I have
a steady state?

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.400
There's a steady state
when the derivative is 0.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.120
So if the derivative is
0 when f of y equals 0,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.230
let me call those special
y's by a capital letter.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.520
So capital Y is a
number, a starting value,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.200
where the right hand side
of the equation is 0.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.790
And if the right hand
side of the equation is 0,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.900
the left side of the equation
is 0, and dy dt is 0,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.750
and we don't go anywhere.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.730
So the solution-- if
f or y is equal to 0,

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.630
then we have y stays at y.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.340
It's a constant for all
time, and my question

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:30.110
is, if we start near capital
Y, do we approach capital Y

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.240
as time goes on?

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.520
It's, in that case, I
would say, stable-- or does

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.180
the solution when we start
near y go far away from Y?

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.380
From capital Y?

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.570
Leave the steady state?

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.190
In that case, I would call
the steady state unstable.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.040
So stable or unstable,
and it's very important

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.700
to know which it is.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.620
And let me just
do some examples,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.310
and you'll see the whole point.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.545
So here is first starting
with a linear equation.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.130
So what is capital
Y in this case?

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.950
Well, this is f of y here.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.290
So if I set that to
0, the steady state

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.730
is capital Y-- capital--
equals 0 in this case.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.250
That is 0.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.840
So if I start at 0, I stay at 0.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.570
Here is a second example, the
logistic equation, where I've

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.120
taken the coefficients to be 1.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.760
What are the steady states
for the logistic equation?

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.220
Again, I set the
right hand side to 0.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.630
I find two possible
steady states--

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.760
capital Y equals 0 or 1.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.950
That right hand side
is 0 for both of those,

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.290
so in both cases, those are
both constant solutions,

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.610
steady states.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.050
If the solution starts
at 0, it stays there

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.080
because the derivative is 0.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.710
Has no reason to move.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.570
And finally, now I let y
minus y cubed equals 0.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.940
I solve y equals y cubed,
and I find three solutions,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.480
three steady states.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.760
Y could be 0 again.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.675
It could be 1 again,
or it could be minus 1.

00:03:34.675 --> 00:03:37.290
y equals y cubed.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.160
Then y can be any of
those three groups,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.840
and of course,
these are examples.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.840
The actual problem
could have sines,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.320
and cosines, and
exponentials, but these

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.940
are three clear cases, and
of course, the linear case

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.780
is always the good guide.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.030
So in the linear case, when
does a solution stay near 0?

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.710
If I start small, when do I
go to 0, and when do I leave?

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.690
So I'm ready for
the answer here.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.500
So, stable or not.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.330
In this example, y equals 0.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:37.670
That's stable if-- well,
do you see what's coming?

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.620
The solution is e to the at
if I start-- or constant times

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.080
e to the at.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.850
When does that go to 0?

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.400
When does it approach
the steady state?

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.590
I need a to be negative.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.750
That's going to be
the key to everything.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.640
That number a
should be negative.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.110
Now, over here, we
don't have an a.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.650
The key point will
be to see what

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.600
is that that should be
negative in these examples.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.440
And can I tell you the answer?

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.570
So the thing to look at,
negative or positive, stable

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.260
or unstable, is the derivative.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:34.980
Look at the derivative of
that right hand side at y

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.420
equals y at the steady state.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:50.840
And if the derivative df dy
is negative, then stable.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.340
That was correct in
this linear case.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:05.300
The derivative of
ay was just a, we

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.010
know that we get stable
when a is negative

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.964
because the solution
has an e to the at.

00:06:12.964 --> 00:06:14.510
a is negative.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.510
We go to 0.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.900
What about examples
two and three?

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.340
So with those two examples
you'll see the whole idea.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.490
So look at the second
example, y minus y squared.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.600
f is y minus y squared.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.640
We look at its derivative.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.240
Its derivative is 1 minus 2y.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.040
The derivative of-- so
I'm looking at 1 minus 2y.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.580
That's df dy.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.560
So what's the story on that?

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:54.370
If y is 0, then that derivative
is 1 plus 1 unstable.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:03.610
So y equals 0 is now unstable,
and the other possibility,

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:13.150
y equals 1, I think, will be
stable, because when y is 1,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:18.660
1 minus 2y-- that derivative
that we check-- 1 minus 2y

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.140
comes out minus 1
now-- negative--

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.170
and that's the
test for stability.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.720
So capital Y equals
1-- you remember

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.760
how those S curves went up and
approached the horizontal line,

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.270
the steady state
capital Y equals 1?

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:43.290
So OK with two different steady
states there-- one unstable

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:44.560
and one stable.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.510
And now here we have
three steady states,

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.140
and in other examples,
we could have many,

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.180
or they might be hard
to find, but here we

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.380
can see exactly
what's happening.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.730
Now, I look at the
derivative df dy.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.060
It's the derivative
of y minus y cubed.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.880
So that's 1 minus 3y squared.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:16.840
So again, y equals
0 is bad news.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:23.470
y equals 0 I get 1--
positive number, unstable.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.345
So y equals 0, unstable.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.169
Whereas y equals 1
or minus 1-- those

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:39.340
are the other two
steady states--

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.439
then 1 minus 3y squared.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.540
y squared will be
1 in those cases.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:53.210
So I have 1 minus 3 minus 2.
[INAUDIBLE] it's negative.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.130
So those are stable.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.010
Do you see how easy the test is?

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:10.160
Compute the derivative df
dy at the steady state,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.810
and just see is it stable
or is it not stable,

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.970
and that gives the-- see
whether is it negative

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.040
or is it positive.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.030
That decides stable or unstable.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:29.290
Now, I just want
to show why briefly

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:34.570
and then show you an example
by throwing the book,

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.200
and this would be an
example in three dimensions

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:45.710
that we will get to when we're
doing a system of equations.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.480
So for something flying
in three dimensions,

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.560
we'll need three differential
equations, and all

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:58.920
this discussion, which is coming
to the end of first order-- one

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.950
first order equation.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.790
So this stability is
one of the nice topics.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.310
Now, what's the
reasoning behind it?

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.000
Behind this test?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.350
Here's our test.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:19.670
If df dy is 0, that's our
test, and why is that our test?

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.210
Can I explain it here?

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:32.570
I want to look at the difference
between y and the steady state.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:42.020
And my question is, if that goes
to 0, I have something stable.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.520
If that blows up, if
y goes further away

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.730
from this steady
state, it's unstable.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.180
So dy dt is f of y.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:11:00.370
d capital Y dt-- well,
that's actually 0.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.260
Capital Y is that
constant steady state,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:11.720
and at the same
time, f of Y is 0.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.840
So I've just put a 0 on the left
side and a 0 on the right side,

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.310
remembering that capital
Y solves the equation

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.640
with no movement at all.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.750
It's just steady.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:28.920
Now I have f of y
minus f at capital Y.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.190
I'm going to use calculus.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.440
The difference between
the function at a point

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.880
and the function at a nearby
point is approximately--

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.840
and the mean value
theorem tells me

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:50.990
that it really is-- is
approximately the derivative df

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:58.379
dy times y minus 1.

00:11:58.379 --> 00:11:59.795
That's the whole
point of calculus

00:11:59.795 --> 00:12:05.460
actually-- to be able to
estimate the difference

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.180
between f at two points.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:12.150
This is delta f, if you
like, and this is delta Y.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:18.270
And delta f divided by delta
Y is approximately df dy,

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:22.150
and approximately means
more and more approximately,

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.895
closer and closer, as
these points-- as little y

00:12:26.895 --> 00:12:30.310
and capital Y come close.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:35.400
So in other words, what
I have is approximately

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.740
the linear equation-- the linear
equation where the test is this

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.330
is my a.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.830
Here is the a.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.680
Well, it's only
approximate because this

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.260
isn't a truly linear equation.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.820
We are allowing more
terms, but calculus

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.580
says it's better and
better when you're close,

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.140
and so our question
is, do we get closer

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.690
or do we not get close?

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:11.460
And the answer is that when
that a is negative, then

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.350
it's just like the
linear equation.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.330
The exponential of at goes to 0.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.540
y minus capital Y
goes to 0-- stable--

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:26.040
when this thing is
positive or maybe even 0.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.030
0 is kind of a marginal case.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.020
I don't know whether I
shoot off or go to 0,

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.970
so I'm only going to say if
that is negative, it's stable,

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:40.535
and if it's positive, then
my e to the at blows up.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.150
And that e to the at
is y minus capital Y.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.240
It gets bigger and
bigger-- unstable.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:57.120
So that's the reasoning
behind the beautiful, simple,

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.680
easy to apply test, which is,
if the derivative is negative,

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.240
then stable.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.877
That's good, and now
I'm ready to show you

00:14:08.877 --> 00:14:12.750
the example of a tumbling box.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.000
That is, I'm more or less ready.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.730
I'm going to take
a copy of the book,

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.270
and I'm going to
throw it in the air.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.610
Well, I have put
on a rubber band

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.810
to hold it together,
because the book is rather

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.130
precious to be throwing around.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:34.310
And let me say here I
learned about this experiment

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:39.410
from Professor Alar Toomre and
just today I've asked him would

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:45.022
he like to do the
experiment on a video?

00:14:45.022 --> 00:14:48.280
If yes, then he
will do it properly.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:57.790
If no, I will do more with it
when we get to three equations,

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.480
because we're in
three dimensions,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.990
but let me just
show you the point.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.580
So the point is I'm going
to throw this book up.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.570
Does it wobble all
over the place--

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:12.890
unstable-- or does it
turn nicely on its axis?

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:17.470
I'm going to throw it up
on the narrow axis here,

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:21.470
the thin axis,
half an inch or so.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.730
To me, that's stable.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.550
I'm not as good as Professor
Toomre at catching it,

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:31.880
but with a rubber
band on it I caught.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.680
Now, that's one
axis, but I'm in 3D.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.080
Here's another way to
throw it-- is this way.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.430
Now, you can try this
on somebody else's book.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.660
I'm going to throw
it now this way.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.090
I'm going to start it this
way, and the question is,

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.956
does it turn steadily
this way or not?

00:15:51.956 --> 00:15:53.330
No.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:54.760
Absolutely not.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.030
It went all over the place.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.580
Shall I do that one again?

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.595
You see how it tumbles?

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:03.890
Not so easy to catch.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:09.210
So that is unstable, and then
there is a third direction.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:09.710
Let's see.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.060
I've done the very narrow
one, the middle one.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.470
Probably the third
direction is this one,

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:18.110
and if I do it-- I'm
going to leave well enough

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.030
alone-- it will come out stable.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:26.190
So two directions-- stable, one
unstable-- for a tumbling box,

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:30.830
and the website and the
book have lots more details,

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.200
and we'll do more.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.810
One more thing I want to add
to this board for these three

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.990
examples-- can I do that?

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:42.270
One more thing.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:45.110
I want a picture that
shows-- so here's

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:53.160
a line off to plus infinity,
and this way to minus infinity.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:17:00.460
And if I took this example,
0 in example one, say,

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:05.359
for dy dt equals minus
y a negative is stable.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:06.099
It is stable.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:14.500
So the solutions here
are approaching 0.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.869
This is approaching--
so my first example

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:20.609
is dy dt equals minus y.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.250
I draw a line of y's.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:32.240
There's y equals 0, and the
solution, wherever it starts,

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.820
approaches 0.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:45.090
Now I'm ready to do
the logistic equation.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:51.990
dy dt equals y minus y squared.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:57.260
Now I have y equals
0 is unstable now.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.940
y equals 0 is now unstable.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.290
y doesn't approach 0 anymore.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:04.540
It goes away from 0.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.060
And what does it go to?

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.276
The other steady state, if
you remember, was y equals 1.

00:18:15.276 --> 00:18:17.760
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.970
The derivative is 0.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.180
That's a steady state.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.750
Let me put it in here-- 1-- and
that was a stable steady state.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.180
So that arrow is correct,
and it goes to 1,

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.590
and it's also going
to 1 from above.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.960
So there is the stability line.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:45.820
Let me call this the
stability line of y's that

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.550
shows in the simplest
possible picture

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:54.550
what direction what direction
the solution moves, which

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:59.270
is the same as showing
me the sine of dy dt.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:03.260
The sine of dy dt is positive,
and this y minus y squared

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:08.450
is positive for y
between 0 and 1.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:13.900
Between 0 and 1, 1/2 would
be a 1/2 minus 1/4 positive.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:18.530
So it increases,
but it approaches 1.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:26.000
And now finally can I add in--
can I create the stability line

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.060
for y minus y cubed?

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.920
This is still correct.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.472
y equals 1 is still
a stable point.

00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:36.050
0 is an unstable
point, but now I

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:42.950
have 0, 1, or that other
possibility, minus 1.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:46.280
So let me put that into
the picture-- minus 1.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.400
That is a stable one.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.050
So for the y minus
y cubed example,

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.120
I'm stable, unstable--
you see the arrow is

00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:01.030
going away and going
into 1 and minus 1,

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:04.585
and then they go
in from both sides.

00:20:07.215 --> 00:20:11.160
Isn't that a simple
picture to put together

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.130
what we discovered
from the derivatives

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:18.970
of this thing, the 1 minus 3y
squared at those three points?

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:21.190
At this point, the
derivative was negative.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.270
We go to it.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:25.190
At this point, the derivative,
one minus 3y squared,

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.180
was positive.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.310
We leave it.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:31.160
At this point, this
is another stable one.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.410
The derivative df dy
is negative there,

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.150
and the solution
approaches y equals 1.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.940
We didn't have any
formula for the solution.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.410
That's the nice thing.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.620
We're getting this
essential information

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.570
by just taking the derivative
of that simple function

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:54.020
and looking to see is
it negative or positive

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:59.220
and getting that picture
without a formula.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:03.950
So tumbling book,
stability, and instability,

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:08.580
and more to do in
higher dimensions.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.370
Thank you.
