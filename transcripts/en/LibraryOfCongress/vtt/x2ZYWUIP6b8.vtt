&gt;&gt; Alda Migoni: Thank you for
attending this great event,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.540
National Hispanic
Heritage Month.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.110
This is presented by the
Hispanic Cultural Society

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.410
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.710
For those of you
who are unaware,

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.620
the Hispanic Cultural Society's
mission is to empower staff,

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.880
retired and current, to
celebrate, honor the cultures

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.010
of Latin America and Hispanic
populations and Latino,

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.500
Latin X populations here in
the United States as well.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.320
We work for events, publications
such as folkloric dancing some

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.880
of you may have attended
last week, and, again,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.360
speaker series such as this.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.090
So thank you so much
for your attendance.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.880
And I will now turn it
over to the main event,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.650
what you've all been
waiting for, Chocolate.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.220
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: So,
again, thank you all

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.470
for coming here today.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.060
We are Harper Macaw
Chocolate Makers.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.990
We are based here
in Washington, DC.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.180
My name is Sam, Samuel, Sam.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.970
And this is Matt.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.600
And as you probably
have noticed my accent,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.540
I'm not American,
I'm from Brazil.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.370
And that's where we
source the beans from.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.980
So actually, I grew up in a
very traditional cocoa producing

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.980
region, it's called
etabune [phonetic].

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.820
And a part of myself now
sharing with you about the city,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.610
because nobody knows about it.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.670
And it's a very traditional
city.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.540
All the economy of cocoa based.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.030
And have you guys heard
about witches' broom?

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.530
I'm not going to go further
about it, but just want to know

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.040
if -- witches' broom,
it's a fungus

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.010
that will attack cacao trees.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.310
Just a little bit.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.840
In the '80s or something
like that, my grandfather,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.130
he had a big plantation
of cacao.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.740
And then witches' broom
came, which is a fungus,

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.430
and it attack the --
it's quite interesting

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.990
because they attack the
pods, they just turn it

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.730
into a weird color, then
turn into a black color,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.910
and then just disappear,
the pods.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.880
So this disease came to Brazil
probably like the late '80s,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.020
something like that, and
destroyed all the trees,

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.000
pretty much 70% of
the land in this area.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.060
Brazil was the first -- the
second actually back then --

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.390
largest producer, cocoa
producer, globally.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.770
So you can think about how
bad that was for the economy.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.190
And this came up along
with other problems,

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.220
especially inequality.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.590
You have a lot of social
issues there in this region,

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.620
because they destroy
the whole plantation.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.250
Now, I'm just sharing
that with you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.650
because that's how I
started my first contact

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.040
in the cocoa industry.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.930
And that's why I feel
so passionate about it.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.400
In Brazil, after this
event, after this happened,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.620
they tried to find solutions,
of course, to cure this disease.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.000
And one of them is come up
with disease-resistant trees,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.300
cacao trees.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.320
And one of them, it's
hybrid, seed's hybrid pods,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.100
and [inaudible], which is
kind of like a hybrid --

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.910
actually I think they found
these pods and they just noticed

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.580
that I it's disease-resistant.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.320
It's exactly what happened
to human beings, right.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.040
Sometimes disease like
come up and you say, oh,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.480
this person here has
disease-resistance

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.730
to this disease for some reason,

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.030
they don't know how
to explain it.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.720
But it just use better
technologies to replicate

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.890
and use in all the like trees.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.210
And now that's the kind of seeds
they use in this region to try

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.440
to restore this area,
this cacao area.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.520
And that's one solution
they came up with.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.570
There is another solution
that I want to talk about,

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.490
it's agroforestry,
agroforestry based, cacao.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.560
Which is you grow
cacao alongside

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.690
or inter-crop alongside all
the trees, native trees.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.960
So for example, you plant cacao,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.110
and with cacao you plant
banana and [inaudible].

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.490
Have you guys heard
about [inaudible] before?

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.730
Have you? Okay, she's
saying yeah.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.250
So I think it's originally from
Brazil, but maybe it's not,

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.610
but it's very popular in Brazil.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.910
It's delicious.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.740
And they grow alongside and
disease kind of like, of course,

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.170
like helping different station
of this land, this area.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.660
And that's what I used to say.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.260
That's exactly what
happens to us, people say.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.580
The more colorful your food
is, the healthier it is, right?

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.880
That's what people say.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.610
So if you have a bunch of stuff,
different stuff, there's going

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.930
to be more vitamins,
more nutrients.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.130
So that's exactly the
same principle kind of.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.230
So you have the cocoa and you
have [inaudible], you have acai,

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.900
banana, other fruits,
growing alongside the cacao.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.840
You're going to have these
nutrients just pulling like go

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.300
into the soil, providing
more nutrients.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.440
And this is going to keep the
cacao of course more resistant

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.310
against like diseases,
as like human beings,

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.120
exactly the same I think.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.540
And at the same time,
this is going to give --

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.460
that's what is very important
for us, that's what we try

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.880
to do the company, give a
very distinct flavor profile.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.930
So, of course, this
is going to change --

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.220
I also use to say people -- I
think it was, yeah, my uncle,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.550
he had it in the
backyard, a cacao tree.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.850
And he had like [inaudible]
and also had all the trees

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.100
and he was also like
planting cane sugar

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.030
and a lot of other stuff.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.670
And the cacao that
I first tasted

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.830
in this tree was
different than the cacao

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.420
that I tried in a farm.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.440
My father's friend, he
had like this big farm

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.440
and he was doing
monocropping, of course,

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.340
which means just growing
cocoa and nothing else.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.640
And they're just different.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.650
The cocoa in his backyard was
like more mellowx and fruity

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:03.590
and tasty and it's just
delicious and just like --

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.040
we have pictures of cocoa here?

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.340
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.740
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: We are going
to see what I'm talking about.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.370
Yeah, because the cacao,
the pulp actually that goes

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.890
like around the seed,
it's totally different.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.860
It doesn't taste like
chocolate at all,

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.160
it's completely different.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.460
But this is going
to be responsible

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.000
for the fermentation
process and everything else.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.090
But maybe we can
talk about it later.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.060
But that's what I want to
do here in the company.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.320
And that's what --
speaking about like Brazil

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.270
and Latin America, we are
kind of like the pioneers

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.130
in agroforestry based cacao.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.190
70% of cocoa comes
from West Africa.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.060
And basically all the
plantations there,

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.800
they are monocropping-based,
monocropping-based.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.800
And that's -- okay, this is
not good, this is not good.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.450
Of course, this is going to
be bring back deforestation.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.010
This is not good for diversity

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.230
of the environment,
everything else.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:05.660
But this is also is not going
to give a very rich flavor

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.490
to the chocolate, to
the actual chocolate,

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.500
in the end of the process.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.480
And why? We used to
say 75% of the flavor's

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.050
in the chocolate part, in
the fine chocolate part.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.360
Now our chocolate part,

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.400
they come from 25%
fermentation process,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.160
25% the genetic of the cacao.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.780
If you have a good genetic,

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.520
it's going to give a different
profile, flavor profile.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.330
And 25% is going to
be the environment.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.000
So in 25%, it's going to be

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.220
like our chocolate
making process here.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:47.580
So it's very important
for us for like

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.730
to give a very good flavor
profile in the chocolate part

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.590
that you know where
your beans come from,

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.140
where you're sourcing the beans.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.940
The way you're providing
your beans.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.670
What environment
those beans come from.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.630
And that's it.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.160
So we have like a
good expectation,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.770
a positive expectation,
for Latin America overall,

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:14.390
as opposed to monocropping,
especially in West Africa.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:20.840
Of course, they're helping
lots of family in West Africa,

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:28.770
but also some of those lands,
they use child labor and other

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.780
like slave labor
and things that we,

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.140
of course, don't support at all.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:41.780
So agroforestry based cacao,
as opposed this method

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.950
of plantation, is bringing
also this other concept,

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.360
which means fair trade.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.600
We want to make sure that
we don't use brokers.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.440
We don't use middleman.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.370
We'll buy the beans
directly from the farmers.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.220
So that means they're going

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:03.040
to give usually three times
more the commodity price cocoa.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.430
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon:
It's more like eight.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.730
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: Yeah.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.030
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon:
Eight times more.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.330
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: Yeah.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.360
Maybe now the dollar
as opposed to Real,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.200
which is the Brazilian
currency, it's like very high.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.750
But it's eight times more.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:20.350
So you pay more only
for the flavor itself

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:22.430
but because it's the
right thing to do.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.320
You know, you're just
trying to make sure

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.520
that [inaudible]
and everything else.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.190
So we have like a good scenario,

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.850
a positive expectation
for Latin America.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:39.370
In Brazil, for example,
they just approved --

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.840
it's the Brazilian forest code.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.930
And they are obligating
farms when they just clear,

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:51.400
using like specialty
[inaudible] and stuff like that.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.750
You'll clear the trees, you'll
clear the land, you're obligated

00:10:54.750 --> 00:11:00.720
by law to reforest a portion of
this area using native trees.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.620
So it's kind of like using the
agroforestry system, by law,

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.290
required by law, in
using your plantation.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.050
So it's not only --

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.020
it's becoming like something
institutionalized now,

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.320
this process.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.160
So hopefully this is
what's going to happen

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.090
in Latin America, this resource
the beans primarily from Brazil,

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.530
but it also like source the
beans from Dominican Republic,

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.820
and they also have very good
beans, also agroforestry based.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.010
We see like a very good
scenario in Brazil,

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:40.740
in Latin America overall
to use this kind of system.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.250
And we are 10 years, and
hopefully this is what's going

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.930
to happen like in
the near future.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:51.930
There's a gap in the
supply, in the cocoa supply,

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.190
that needs to be fulfilled,
especially for fine chocolate.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:12:02.070
People more like aware of the
benefits of a good chocolate.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.370
For example -- I
don't know if --

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.360
there is no one here works
for Hershey's, right?

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:12.850
But Hershey's has like
about 5-6% chocolate.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.040
Maybe less than that.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.970
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon:
The legal requirement

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.470
to call it chocolate is 10%.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.400
And Hershey's is like 10.1.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.300
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho:
So that's why --

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:29.370
actually, and people ask
me, do you like Hershey's?

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:30.760
Yes, but it's not chocolate,

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.600
it's candy with some
chocolate in it, you know.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.870
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: It's
wax with chocolate.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.170
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: Yes, right.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.940
Sometimes we like [inaudible],
you don't think about it.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.010
I should not say that.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:48.010
But like yeah, so there
is a gap in supply.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.200
There is also a growing
demand for fine chocolate.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.270
And that's the tendency
like saying

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.690
that the agroforestry
based plantations,

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.830
they're growing in Brazil.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.280
The new plantations in the
north of Brazil are growing

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.680
as well, which is new.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.340
Because traditionally,
as I said,

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.190
in my region -- which
is [inaudible].

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.020
Have you all heard about
[inaudible], Brazil?

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.190
Yeah, this region's
very like traditional.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.490
Okay, great.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:22.040
And like the north of
Brazil, they're starting now,

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:27.580
20 years ago, farming
cocoa, fine cocoa,

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.610
and agroforestry based as well.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:34.230
And pretty much all of
them is cooperatives.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.550
So the farmers, the workers,

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:42.980
they're also the
owners of this business.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.840
And that's it.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.640
You can like show some.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.940
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.360
So I'm going to like take over
from Sam, where Sam left off.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.660
My name is Matt.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.450
I'm the other owner
of Harper Macaw.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.890
A little bit of my history.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.020
I came to chocolate
just from growing

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.120
up with a passion
for food and candy.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.230
And I am a graduate of the
Culinary Institute of America.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:05.420
And chocolate and bread
were my two big passions,

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.750
so when I had the opportunity
to come here and work

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.140
for Harper Macaw and
eventually own the company,

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.010
it was just I couldn't
pass that up.

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.640
So that's kind of
how I ended up here.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.550
But part of what Sam covered
and touched on that we do

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.360
as a company is we are really
committed to kind of changing

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.460
that landscape, especially
in chocolate,

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:33.030
of not great farming practices
that have been really widespread

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.330
in the chocolate industry

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.290
and also not great
socioeconomic practices.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.680
Basically what Sam was
saying is chocolate

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.800
on the commodity market,
which is mainly what comes

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.170
from West Africa, is sold for
less than a dollar a kilo.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.310
Which means that the workers
in those places that grow

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.510
that chocolate and
is their livelihood,

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.020
they're getting paid
pennies a day, sometimes less

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.320
in some circumstances.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.970
So that's part of why we have
a commitment to direct trade

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.170
and to paying more
for our chocolate

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.960
and paying the farmers directly.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.900
When there's no middleman, when
you're avoiding all that stuff,

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.930
the farmers get the
money that they deserve

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.780
and there's no one along the
line taking money from them.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.930
Which is also really important.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.680
And one of the things that
we have a strong connection

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.330
to Brazil, not just
because Sam is from there,

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:26.110
but because Brazil, after
the witches broom blight,

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.390
it took about a decade
for Brazil to recover.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:32.690
And CCN 51, which Sam mentioned,

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:37.880
was a sort of life-saving
breed of cacao for Brazil.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.450
It however does not
have great taste.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:45.540
And in the scramble to
recover from the disease,

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:49.400
a lot of CCN 51 was just
indiscriminately planted

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.700
and bred into other
breeds of cacao.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.830
And Brazil, unfortunately,
got this terrible reputation

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.970
for having less than
high-quality cocoa.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:02.870
And most of its cocoa even to
this day is sold internally.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:06.330
Brazil has a huge
demand internally

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.660
for chocolate and for cocoa.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.010
And so very little
of it is exported.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:14.940
That's actually been one of our
biggest challenges is we have

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:19.540
to import it ourselves to
get it here from Brazil.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.400
And there's some
regions in South America

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.740
where they have larger
cooperatives and larger sort

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.150
of companies that are
doing the exportation

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.750
and you can get better
access to it here

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.260
in the States, but
not in Brazil.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.200
So one of the things that is
one of our focuses is going

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.390
to our farms and helping
them expand outside

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:45.260
of the Brazilian market, and
not only that but bringing back

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.310
from Brazil cocoa that
is really great quality

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.170
and has really nice flavor.

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.010
And trying to sort of show the
industry and show the world

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.350
that like, hey, Brazil
has amazing cocoa.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.570
It's not all CCN 51.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:02.240
CCN 51 saved the
industry, but now, you know,

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.690
those genetics are there
and there's all this fine

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.530
and heritage cocoa that's
coming back in Brazil.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.770
And that's sort of what we're
trying to do and we're trying

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.590
to do with our chocolate
and make sure

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:15.070
that we make it really good.

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:18.100
So that we can say like, hey,
everybody should take interest

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.680
in Brazil and kind of try and
revitalize this lost economy

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.800
that occurred by just a
terrible natural disaster there.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.170
And so I'm going to start
flipping through some pictures

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:34.030
that sort of talk
about our sourcing.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:38.090
This a picture of cacao
pods right before harvest.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.250
These have been cut
down from the tree.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:46.430
You can see, they're beautiful
after they are cut open.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.170
This is sort of talking
about what sort

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.470
of Sam also already covered,

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.950
what we look for
in our sourcing.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.250
We look for quality.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:58.880
We look for the environmental
practices of agroforestry.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.800
Part of what improves the
quality of cacao is growing it

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.100
in a diverse environment.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:09.160
Cacao needs a canopy of other
trees around it to survive.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.890
Cacao survives -- at different
stages of its life cycle,

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.370
it needs different
amounts of light.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.590
So when it's young ,it
needs a lot of shade.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:21.190
As it gets older and bigger, it
needs sort of some less shade,

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:22.730
but it still needs a canopy.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.120
It doesn't grow well
in full sun.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.730
And that's one of the problems
with monocropping and tearing

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.210
down all this land, like
Sam was talking about,

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.720
is the cacao just
doesn't grow as well.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.610
It doesn't survive
as well there.

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:38.340
You get a lot of
quantity but not quality

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.110
through those practices.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.410
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: And
you need to use chemicals

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.560
as well to make it grow.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.860
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.340
Because without the other
biodiversity around,

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:48.920
the soil is depleted.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.900
And the only way to
continue growing the cacao is

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.200
to fertilize it.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.750
And that's not a great
practice and it's expensive

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:59.490
for the farmers and they're
already struggling to survive.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:04.130
So helping build
agroforestry means

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.440
that it's a little more upkeep

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.080
because you're growing
biodiverse plants,

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.670
but it's less fertilizing.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:14.300
And after basically once the
system gets started and gets

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.380
in place and the life cycle
starts repeating itself,

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.680
it gets easier and
easier to care for,

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.740
because nature just
does it all on its own.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.260
And then, of course, the
socio and economic practices,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.390
which is making sure
that the laborer is fair,

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.920
the labor is good, people
aren't being mistreated

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.590
and everyone's getting
paid a living wage.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:38.220
So this is a close-up
of a cacao clone.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.350
This is right after it sprouted.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:44.620
This is at one of the farms we
work with in Brazil, in Bahia.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.630
This is Juliana, it's one

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:50.240
of our really most
intensely-flavored chocolates.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.910
It has a lot of really,
really nice citrus qualities.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.160
It's a beautiful, beautiful
bean that they grow there.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.530
And so basically those
clones are taken care

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:05.330
of until they reach a mature
stage and they're planted.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:09.280
This is kind of a view of the
workers in the clone facility.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.810
You can see, there's probably
hundreds of these clones

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.920
that they grow and
plant every year.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.760
This is more of harvest,
harvesting.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.250
Again, Juliana.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.330
You can see some of the
pods, they start sort

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.370
of that green color, that's
when they're very young.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.110
And they become more
yellow and turn to some

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.520
of the brighter vibrant colors

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.860
that you see as they
become ripe.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.490
There's some ripe
pods on the tree.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:41.580
This is more of the harvesting.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.430
And so here you can see that
when they come out of the pods,

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.750
they're covered in
this white pulp.

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:52.480
That pulp kind of tastes
like a sour fruit smoothie.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.700
It's a really wonderful
and interesting flavor.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.860
And part of the process of cocoa
which makes it so complicated

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.580
on both ends of producing
chocolate is once it's harvested

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.530
and pulled from those
pods, it has to be brought

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:10.220
to fermentation very
quickly or it rots.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.620
So we have some pictures.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.670
This is the Dominican Republic.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:19.670
This statue is in San
Francisco de Macoris.

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:24.380
It's one of the areas where a
lot of high cocoa production is

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.120
in the Dominican Republic.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:30.800
And just like Brazil, cocoa is
a major part of the economy.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:36.780
It was one of like the only like
staple crops in those regions

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.770
and everybody grows it.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:42.110
People are growing it, like Sam
mentioned, in their backyards.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.750
And a lot of how people
make money there is

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.050
through the cooperatives.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:49.110
So people that grow it in their
backyards, they harvest it,

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.430
they bring it to a cooperative,
that cooperative ferments it,

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:56.040
dries it, and then sells it
under the cooperative's name.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.570
And that's one of the
biggest challenges too

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.590
with improving the cocoa quality

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.290
and improving the working
environment, because sometimes

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.620
in a lot of these
regions there's not --

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.110
you can go to the direct
cooperative and work with them

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:10.410
and they work with
their farmers,

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.740
but there's not a direct way
to work with all the farmers

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.010
because the cooperative
doesn't necessarily control all

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:20.390
of their farms and all of where
they source their own cocoa.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:24.280
But this statue was built
basically as a representation

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.430
of how important the cocoa
is to the Dominican people

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:32.900
and how just part of their
history and culture it is.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.690
This is, again, we
work with another farm

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.740
in the Dominican
called [inaudible].

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:42.490
They're also a bird conservatory
and a land preserve there.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:47.600
And I wish I could remember
the name of this fruit.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.900
Say again.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.200
[inaudible] That
sounds familiar.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.500
It was really good.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.050
It was very delicious.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:54.840
But that was one of the crops

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.660
that was being grown amongst
the cacao there as part

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:01.540
of the biodiversity
and the agroforestry.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.960
There, this is more harvesting.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.420
Again, you see the white pulp.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.870
Everything is put
in these buckets

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.510
and then it's transported
by hand further

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:12.670
down to the fermenter.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:16.000
And I think, yeah,
there's a close-up shot.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.410
This is, you can see the
pulp, you can see the beans.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.880
They're kind of purple
on the inside.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.820
This is a fermentation center.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:28.260
So to cacao is fermented
in these large cedar boxes.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.190
Basically that takes
four days to a week.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:34.470
And throughout that process,
it is turned from box to box.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:38.220
It's moved over from box to
box to kind of aerate it,

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.820
to keep everything circulated

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.420
and to keep everything
well mixed together.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:45.770
If it's left in one box for
too long, it'll create layers

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.410
and it will ferment unevenly.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:50.720
And so that's another
-- as Sam was saying,

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.840
that's another huge part of
cacao quality and it's one

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.470
of the most difficult parts
and least understood part.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.290
Historically it was
fermented in heaps just piled

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:04.960
up on the ground and
covered with banana leaves

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.080
and then dried in the sun.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.190
Which if you're in a humid
tropical environment, is really,

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:14.100
really difficult, because
it doesn't dry and it molds

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.430
and you lose product,
you lose crop.

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:20.620
So that was, again, one of those
big innovations that's been

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:25.150
building for many, many, many
years is fermenting inside

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:28.510
of a building and
drying in a covered area

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:32.170
out of lower altitude
out of the mountains

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:37.720
where the cacao is grown
and in a drier climate.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.740
That's a close-up
of the fermentation.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.420
They're typically
covered in banana leaves

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.990
or burlap sacks to
keep the heat in.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:50.150
And this is outside of the farm.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:59.100
This is an abandoned cacao
drying bed that, again,

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.370
it shows you how important
cacao was to the people

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.140
and to the native economy.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.770
People did this in
their backyards.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.670
This was somebody's
home where they grew

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.780
and dried their own cacao
before bringing it to market.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:15.950
And these beds worked that
that roof is on a rail.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.550
So this is actually
when you slide

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:18.980
that back, it exposes the bed.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.540
And that was because of the rain
and the humidity in that area

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.150
up in the mountains, they had
to find a way to cover it.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.450
And basically once the
cooperatives got bigger

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:32.400
and bigger and started
taking that process away

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.820
from people having to do it at
home, it made it a lot easier

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:39.740
for people to bring the
cacao to the cooperatives

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.360
and get a better
price because they cut

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.660
down on their own labor.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.690
They didn't have to spend
all their time fermenting

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.390
and drying it themselves
and this process

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:51.400
and these beds were abandoned.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:56.500
And this is a modernized
drying facility.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.430
Again, this is all part
of Rosol [phonetic],

00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:59.770
which is in Duarte,
in Dominican.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:03.930
And that's the second phase
of the drying process.

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:07.570
It's dried initially on
those long raised beds,

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:08.870
which are perforated.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.610
They're open in the top and
the bottom so air circulates.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:14.770
And then the final drying,
they're spread out evenly

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.580
on just the cement
floor, and it is very hot

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.430
and it really finishes
the final dry.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:25.290
This is Rosol's hand-sorting
process.

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:28.830
Every single bean is pulled
off of that cement floor,

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:33.050
spread out on this table,
it's hand-sorted for hours

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:38.050
by their workers, and then
bagged and shipped to us.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.730
This is, again, another view
of the hand-sorting process

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:44.150
at their fermentation facility.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:47.510
This is getting bags
from the hand-sorting

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:49.820
to where it's actually
loaded for delivery.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:53.850
And it's commonly
carried like this.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:57.380
And then once we get it,
we make it into chocolate,

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:03.640
we mold it into bars, and
we package it here in DC.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.200
And that'll bring us
back to the beginning.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.510
I think we were going to
open up the discussion

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:14.020
for some questions if you
guys want to ask us anything

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:19.560
about cacao and about Brazil
or Dominican Republic and sort

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.000
of us and what else we do.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.450
&gt;&gt; At the beginning
of your slideshow,

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:31.900
it seemed like the
plants are being grown

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.990
under tree [inaudible] tents.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.740
Is that true?

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.160
Just like tobacco in the
Connecticut River Valley.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.980
So under [inaudible] tents
rather than shade tree?

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.810
The tents I guess
are more adaptable

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:49.460
because you can put them
there or take them away.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.760
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.430
And that's usually initially
done in the cloning process

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.780
so that the trees can reach a
certain maturity before they're

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:01.150
actually planted in the
normal growing environment.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:04.520
So that's a temporary
holdover and it's much --

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.820
exactly for the reasons
you said.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.120
It's much more mobile.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.880
It's much more easy to
construct that than it is to try

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.140
and plant a clone in a shaded
area and then pull it up

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:17.720
and replant it at the
main growing area.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.020
Yeah.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:23.080
&gt;&gt; So what's the
full life cycle?

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:28.070
So from clone to harvest,
like what is that time frame?

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.360
How long does that take?

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.200
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: So cacao has
two main harvests every year,

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.640
one in the like late
winter/early spring

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.520
and one in early fall.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.680
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho:
In the south, yeah.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.230
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: And
the whole life cycle,

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:54.820
it takes about five years to
actually receive a full harvest.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.560
Part of -- and I didn't
have any great pictures

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.860
of it in the slideshow.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.570
One of the many challenges of
growing cacao is the flower

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.410
that actually grows
the pod is very tiny.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.790
It's about this big.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:11.810
Some cacao is self-pollinating,
which is great,

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.240
but a lot of it isn't.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.960
And that's part of why the
biodiversity and the lack of use

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.480
of fertilizers and pesticide
chemicals is huge for it,

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.530
because it has to be
pollinated by a midge fly,

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:25.530
or hand-pollinated, which
is extremely difficult

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.850
because the flowers are so tiny.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:32.390
And so from pollination, it
takes about two to three months

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:36.520
for the pods to actually fully
enlarge, and then another month

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.150
or two for them to mature.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:41.310
And most farms sort
of harvest on a cycle.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:45.020
They kind of walk around the
farm when harvest season comes

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.010
around and they'll pull pods
down as they become ripe,

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.400
and then come back around
and get the next round

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.050
and so on and so forth.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:55.050
But it takes, yeah, it
takes five years for a clone

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:59.890
to reach enough maturity to
produce a full set of pods

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.530
and then fully developed pods.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:03.910
&gt;&gt; And then the other
things that are being grown

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.960
around them, those are
also being harvested

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.820
as well, or those are?

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.220
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho:
Sometimes they're harvested.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:15.230
But I think the main concern
actually about this system,

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.130
they just let it
fall in the soil.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:20.660
This is going to
provide a more rich.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.330
You have more nutrients
in the soil as well.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:25.440
There is not much
concern about it.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:30.860
So in terms of prediction wise,
they don't really [inaudible].

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:35.140
Also it depends on the system.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.050
We have so many different
systems.

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:41.610
So I didn't talk a lot about my
background, but I used to work

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.090
in Brazil, back in Brazil,
for non-profit organizations

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:46.670
and help a small
enterprise to grow.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:50.890
And maybe over 70% of
those companies is small

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.220
business actually.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.520
They were rural.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:59.400
So for example, people
there planting fruits

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.440
and they're trying to
find like different ways

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.320
to adding value to those fruits.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:10.570
So they make jelly and sell
like the juice, whatever.

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:14.520
So the reason I'm saying
that because most of these

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.210
like plantations, they
are agroforestry based.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:20.920
And some of them, even though
they're planting the same fruit,

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.220
they have different system.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.940
So some of them, they use
the fruits like in salad.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:28.250
For example, the
main fruit is acai,

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.830
but they have other
fruits like bananas.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.440
Sometimes they just
take home and eat it.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.980
Sometimes they're like in salad.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.090
And so it depends on the farm.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:39.390
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.580
A lot of the inter-cropping
is not cacao is the focus,

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:43.920
so the inter-cropping is not

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.860
at like a full sort
of production scale.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:50.240
So you see, just like Sam
said, you'll see a little bit

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.740
of it being sold if
there's enough of it around.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.670
And you'll see a lot
of it either being used

00:31:55.670 --> 00:32:00.030
as a natural fertilizer or
workers take it home and eat it

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.660
and that kind of stuff.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.510
At Rosol, there was
bananas, plantains,

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:07.890
and macadamia nuts growing
amongst the cacao there

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:09.190
in the Dominican.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.490
And those things were --

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:12.860
when they had good years for
the banana and plantains,

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.160
they would sell some of it.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:18.050
When they had, you know,
off years, they didn't.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:21.480
So it was varied even there.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.180
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: In
[inaudible] as well.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.140
Especially banana is very
important, because it helps

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.330
to keep nitrogen in the soil.

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.710
So that gives like a lot of
[inaudible] to the cacao,

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:32.940
provides like more
colorful cacao.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.050
You can definitely see
when it's monocropping.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.310
You can notice the difference.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:40.970
I think if you dig like through
like Google and stuff like that,

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:42.270
you can see the color.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.810
But you need to touch
it and feel it.

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:48.710
The taste is completely
different, yeah.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:54.190
&gt;&gt; I have two practical
questions.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:58.630
One is where you're located and
where you sell your chocolate?

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:03.990
And then the other is, if you
might just talk a little bit

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:07.800
about the health
benefits of eating.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.100
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon:
Chocolate, yes.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.400
&gt;&gt; Versus flavored wax.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.700
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon:
Yes, certainly.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.000
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho:
Great question.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.330
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: So our
factory was previously located

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:17.480
in Northeast DC on
Bladensburg Road.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.730
We're currently in the
process of moving our factory,

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:24.000
because that just wasn't
a great location for us.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.560
We want to be closer
to people and we want

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.900
to actually put our chocolate on
full display so people can come

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.090
in and really see how it's
made and spend time with us.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:36.650
So we're kind of in a
transitional phase right now.

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:39.510
But it looks like we're
potentially going to be

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:42.670
down in the Wharf in
Southeast -- Southwest.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:44.850
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: We
already there, we have a store

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:52.710
down in the Wharf, we want to
turn the store into a factory.

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:54.010
But yeah, [inaudible].

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:55.310
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: But that's

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:56.860
where you can find
our chocolate,

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.970
our retail booth
there in the Wharf.

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.680
We are also in Whole Foods,

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.800
and you can also buy
our chocolate online.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.480
And we ship year round.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.890
And if you get on our website,

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:09.780
you can order it directly
to your front door.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.120
And then the health
benefits are basically

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.620
that the ingredient list on our
chocolate is it's three things.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:19.150
It's cacao nibs, cacao
butter, and sugar.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:20.700
And cacao nibs and cacao
butter you can kind

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:22.000
of call the same ingredient.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.660
So it's maybe two ingredients.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:27.990
And that basically means that
we have full transparency.

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:30.320
When you guys buy a chocolate
bar from us, you know exactly

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.910
where we got our ingredients.

00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:33.830
You know everything
that's in it.

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:38.420
You know it didn't contribute
to anyone working themselves

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.560
to death and not getting
paid for their labor,

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.470
or any sort of poor
environmental practices.

00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:47.010
And then the health
benefits are basically

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:52.080
like we don't use soy lecithin,
which, of course, is soy.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.700
And a lot of soy intake
is not good for you.

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.000
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: Emulsifiers.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.300
&gt;&gt;

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.600
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah,

00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.900
emulsifiers are not
good for you.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.090
Basically Hershey's, all those
waxes and paraffin and that kind

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:06.500
of stuff is just is
a processed food.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.300
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: It's
high oxidant as well.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.600
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.470
So because our chocolate is
made with more actual cacao,

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.080
it's much higher
in antioxidants,

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.810
because cacao itself is
very high in antioxidants.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:20.790
It has natural caffeine
and theobromine in it,

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:26.210
which just like caffeine is
good for you in moderation.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:30.380
It's definitely it's
kind of a fine line

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:34.060
because it's still chocolate,
it still contains sugar,

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:37.190
so I definitely wouldn't
encourage anyone to, you know,

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:40.120
eat 20 pounds of it
a day or anything

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.710
like that, as tempting as it is.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.730
I struggle not eating
so much of it.

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:48.360
But, you know, in moderation
it is much better for you

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:53.860
than a artificially
chemical laden product.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.300
And the natural cacao
butter too,

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.270
because there's higher
quantities of that along

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:01.540
with the actual nib and like
the solid part of the chocolate.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:06.930
That fat is pretty high in
omega 6s and it's not --

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:09.670
you know, it's much better for
you than like artificial waxes

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.800
and fats that they put
in Hershey's to get

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.420
that same chocolate texture.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:14.750
When you're pulling
out all that cacao,

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.590
you have to put something
in to make it melt.

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.120
You have to put something
in to make it feel

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.600
like chocolate in your mouth.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.260
And all that stuff is
artificially produced

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.310
and it's not great.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:25.640
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: Yeah,

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.080
responding to like
first question.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.900
On our website, it's
going to say store locator

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.330
and you can see where
the different stores

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:37.820
in the country, even
in Canada now.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.630
So yes, you can find us there.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:46.350
And Matt mentioned cacao
nibs, and just so you know,

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:49.580
cacao nibs is the cacao
bean without the shell.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.910
So that's what you're going
to see inside the cacao beans.

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:55.150
We have a machine, it's
called a winover [phonetic],

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:59.200
and we separate the cacao
shells and the cacao nibs

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:04.110
and donate the cacao shells
for composting reasons.

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:06.310
And we also try to make sure

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:09.760
that our packages
are sustainable

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.810
and compostable and
everything else.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.380
And I remember, we had
a meeting the other day

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:21.460
with some people interested
in investing in the company.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:25.330
And Matt came with a
chocolate bar and I said,

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:28.080
want this chocolate
bar here at the table.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.560
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: It was
like a Hershey's bar, yeah.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.600
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: No,
it was a dark chocolate.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.820
That's what's interesting,
because it's a dark chocolate.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:35.650
And you say, oh,
that's dark chocolate.

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:38.490
And there's like a seal.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.630
And says fair trade and organic.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:44.500
It's kind of like a dark --

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:48.590
it's not very clear what
organic means today.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:50.720
So it's sometimes
really hard to explain.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.300
But you'll see the organic,
oh, let's do it, it's organic.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.660
So we see like those
chocolate bars

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.360
in a grocery store
and you can see it's.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.870
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah,
especially in Whole Foods,

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:03.170
you see a lot of that, yeah.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:05.240
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: And you'll
see those chocolate bars.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:09.550
And actually maybe they
do everything they say

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:13.850
and maybe they're organic
and their concept of organic,

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:16.040
they do fair trade or whatever.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:20.010
But when you see the
ingredients, you're going

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:24.460
to see it listed:
vanilla and soy.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:28.980
Which is okay but you need to
ask yourself, why do they use

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.120
that and we do not use that?

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.020
So what's the reason
why they use that?

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.750
So Matt went to the
Culinary Institute,

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.050
so he can give maybe
more in a second.

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:41.350
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah.

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:42.650
Well, it's an indication.

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:44.730
And that's one of the things
that we, without trying

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:49.840
to be too militant about
it, try to educate people

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.260
to definitely whenever
you're buying any product,

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.560
to read your labels.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:57.410
And if you see soy, if you
see soy lecithin or lecithin

00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:59.550
of any kind, it's an emulsifier.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:02.700
And if you see also
there's a wax

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.450
that I'm not remembering
the name

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:06.570
of that's commonly in there.

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:07.870
Yeah, yes.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:11.010
So those two things are an
indication that regardless

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:12.820
of whatever else
that package says,

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.090
it's probably being
mass-produced.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:18.290
It's probably not exactly
what it says it is.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:21.230
There's a lot of
green-washing in products today

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:23.880
because it's very popular
for things to be non-GMO

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.980
and gluten-free and
all this stuff.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.350
And so you see a lot of that.

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:31.230
You go into Whole Foods and you
look in the chocolate aisle,

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.980
you'll see walls and
walls and walls of stuff

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:35.900
that says it's fair
trade and gluten-free.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.410
And Chocolate's gluten-free
anyway,

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:40.800
why would there be
gluten in chocolate?

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.110
You know, [inaudible] yeah.

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:46.640
And they'll say it's stone
ground and hand-selected.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.160
And then you look
at the back of it

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.030
and it will generally the
ingredients list will be

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:51.750
something like chocolate
liquor --

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:53.110
which means they're
not using beans.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:55.750
Which means they're
probably not producing it.

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:58.460
Chocolate liquor is a
mass-produced chocolate product

00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.980
that usually comes
from other companies

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.960
that are buying bulk chocolate.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.260
And maybe it's fair trade

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.200
because they paid a
little bit more for that,

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.690
but that's not the
same as direct trade.

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:11.140
And then you'll see soy lecithin

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.440
and you'll see these
other things,

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:15.030
and that's a huge
indication that this is not --

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:16.740
the product's kind
of lying to you.

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:23.130
And then especially if
it costs less than $5,

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:26.350
that's probably another
huge indication

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:28.920
that something is wrong
in their supply chain.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.310
Somewhere along the line
someone, probably someone

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:34.230
who produced the cocoa,
is not getting paid,

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:37.170
or they're buying it already
made from somewhere else

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:39.720
with a lot of fillers
and, you know,

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.040
substrate ingredients
to cut the cost.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.960
Because right now it's
just it's not possible

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.010
to produce high-quality
chocolate

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:53.530
that you paid direct trade like
living wages to the farmers

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:58.420
without charging $7-$8
for the end product.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.470
Because just it's
very expensive,

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:03.050
and shipping logistics and
like everything that goes

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:06.760
into getting that product
here and then making it

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.420
and then going from there.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.810
So that's one of the things that
I always try and tell people,

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.680
if you see a chocolate
bar and it's $5 or less,

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.870
there's something wrong.

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:22.160
I encourage you not to buy that.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.970
&gt;&gt; I'm curious, from the time --

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:26.740
so a tree is producing
in five years.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.590
What's the longevity of a tree?

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.130
How long does it produce?

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:31.430
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: How
long does it produce for?

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:32.730
Yeah, man.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:34.940
&gt;&gt; In optimal conditions.

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:36.500
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah,
in optimal conditions,

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.400
I think you get 10 years.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:43.010
They'll produce sort of at --
they'll produce forever as long

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:45.870
as you maintain the tree
and nothing happens to it,

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.560
they don't get any diseases.

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:50.320
But after I believe
it's 10 years,

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.350
you start to see a
significant drop in the quantity

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:55.730
of pods the tree
is able to produce.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:58.790
And then also the quality
will start to falter

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:01.260
as the trees get older.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:04.010
And one of the things
that we saw at the farms

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:05.310
in the Dominican at least

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:07.450
that they were doing is
they started grafting.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:11.790
After the trees hit that like
sort of beyond maturity point,

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:13.160
they would start to graph them.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.860
And so they would take
one of those new clones

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.160
that you guys saw
on the pictures

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:21.100
and they would actually graft it
to the rootstock of an old tree.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.480
And then once that
clone reached maturity

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.690
on the older trees rootstock,
they'd cut the older tree down

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:28.160
and allow it to keep
growing that way.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:34.900
And I think I was told that that
could only be done I think twice

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.700
or maybe three times before the
rootstock would also get too

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:43.490
worn out to maintain
the new growth.

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:46.130
So yeah, it's definitely
a difficult rotation

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.610
for those farms once the
trees start maturing as well.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:51.970
But one of the things happening
right now is those farms are

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:55.560
planting so many new clones
and there's so much new growth,

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.040
they'll be sustainable

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.790
for a good long time before
they start encountering

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:01.580
those problem.

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:02.880
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho:
There is also

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.390
like a misconception sometimes
people say that chocolate has

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:08.910
to be -- dark chocolate
is bitter.

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:12.610
And it doesn't have
to be bitter.

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:15.550
That's, again, I'm
talking about the soy

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:21.430
and like all those
ingredients in chocolate.

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:25.490
Because cacao beans itself
is just -- a raw cacao bean,

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:28.810
if you crack it, if you just
chew it, it doesn't taste good.

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:30.910
It's kind of -- it's really bad.

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:33.050
I had someone try
to do it before,

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:35.160
and the pulp is very good.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:38.730
But inside, it's not
pleasant, it's not enjoyable.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:42.670
But you have the chocolate, you
know, so that's why you need

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:45.170
to have a very good
fermentation process,

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:46.470
all these processes
that you saw here.

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:50.530
It has to be like in
shape so you're going

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:52.220
to have much more quality,

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:55.150
much better flavors
and everything else.

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:56.450
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah.

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:59.320
And that's sort of our
responsibility to take that --

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.680
take all that hard work and
beautiful work that the farmers

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:06.410
and the people did and make
sure that we're honoring that

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:11.210
and we're displaying like the
full effort and like the full,

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:13.730
you know, beauty of the
thing that they did.

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:17.780
Yeah. And that's what's the
challenge that's kind of fun

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.290
and exciting on our end is
to get that in and say, okay,

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:23.920
this has a lot of lemon flavor
and kind of some raisin flavor,

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.220
how do we bring that out?

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:26.690
How do we keep it from
getting really bitter

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:29.650
and make this pleasant and
bring out those flavors?

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:31.600
Yeah, and that's
one of the things

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.900
that we work really hard to do.

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.200
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: And even

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.350
if you get a really bad
cacao beans, of course,

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:40.660
you have the whole process,
you try to make the chocolate

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:45.640
and I guess the best
as possible.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.070
But sometimes when you get
a really bad cacao beans

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:52.590
and you get a lot of samples
from like all over and we try

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:55.710
and try to change
the [inaudible]

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:58.510
or change the roast
method, whatever you do,

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:00.480
the quality is not
going to be good.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.670
So, okay, but it has
to pleasant for people,

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:05.350
otherwise nobody's
going to buy this.

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:06.650
So what are we going to do?

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:08.660
Okay, let's put some soy in
it and vanilla, you know.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:11.480
So that's why --
it's much easier,

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.040
but it's much more unpleasant.

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:15.870
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: And that's
probably why it's important

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:18.090
for us and other
chocolate makers

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:20.730
to have a relationship
with our farmers.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:23.340
Because we can go back to
them and we can say, hey,

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:26.990
you sent us this really
great sample, there is a lot

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:30.590
of potential here, but we
think your fermentation needs

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:31.890
your work.

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:34.380
And we can kind of help
facilitate them getting in touch

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:37.410
with someone that can help
them improve their processes

00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:40.560
so that they can continue
to sell their market --

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:44.200
their cocoa to a market
like ours and get more money

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:47.050
for it and, you know,
build their product

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:50.270
and their own economy.

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:53.720
Again, that's why, you know,
we try to sort of encourage,

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.760
like look for craft
chocolate, look for people

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.470
that are transparent,
look for, you know --

00:45:57.470 --> 00:46:00.160
there's other makers not
just us in the country

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.370
that are doing these things and
are committed to these things.

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:06.220
Because that's really what's
going to make chocolate last

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.780
and what's really going to,
you know, improve the lives

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:14.160
of the people in the
regions that it comes from.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.460
&gt;&gt; Just one more question.

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:17.330
When I was in Ecuador, I
went into the supermarket

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:19.250
and I bought chocolate
made in Ecuador

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:22.500
to bring back as some gifts.

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:26.820
How would I know if it's
really good Chocolate or not?

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:31.030
I can assume it is because
it said it was made there.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.440
But I mean, how do I know?

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.590
I'm a product of Cadbury.

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:37.440
That's what I grew up on.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.360
And I'm sure they have
diminished now, their content

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.610
for chocolate is probably a
lot less than it used to be.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:51.140
And that happens with
a lot of manufacturers.

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:55.940
So how can I know if I'm
going to another country

00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:58.140
if I'm buying good chocolate?

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.960
And did you bring
any samples for us?

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.200
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: No, that
was our one mistake today.

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.110
We didn't bring any samples.

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:07.240
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: [Inaudible]
process, it's just crazy.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.540
[Inaudible] and came
straight here.

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:09.840
So, sorry.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.250
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: But
yeah, in another country.

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:13.230
&gt;&gt; Was better chocolate
in Ecuador.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:14.530
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah.

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:18.660
And that's what's interesting
about chocolate in countries

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:22.020
where cacao is grown,
is typically --

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:26.820
there's not a huge demand
for actual chocolate there.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:32.960
The cocoa itself is used
-- it's sold primarily.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.550
And when it is used in the
home, it's mostly made --

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:41.970
the pulp is made into drinks or
it's made into other products

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:43.620
and not exactly chocolate.

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:47.490
And so what you had
was probably made there

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:48.910
and it was probably authentic

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:50.910
and there's probably
nothing wrong with buying it,

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:52.640
but it probably wasn't
very good.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.910
Because whoever made it
probably doesn't like chocolate

00:47:55.910 --> 00:48:00.300
and was making it as
something to sell to visitors,

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.870
but didn't -- you
know, they don't --

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:05.980
and it's really funny because
we'll bring chocolate back

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:10.100
to the farms and we'll hand
it out to people and say like,

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:14.130
look, this is your
product, this is your beans.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:19.360
And people don't like it,
and it's really funny.

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:23.310
But yeah, I think if you're
in a cocoa-producing region,

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:27.060
I would say, you know,
you're probably safe,

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:31.920
it just might not be what
we would expect it to taste

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.270
like with our own palettes and
our own sort of taste coming

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:38.090
from Cadbury and Hershey's
and things that we've grown

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:39.710
up recognizing as chocolate.

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:44.490
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: They might
have a very good cacao bean,

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:46.430
but we have all the process

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:49.730
to make this much
more like enjoyable.

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:54.710
So, for example, just
very briefly our process.

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:57.270
We classify the beans
when we get it,

00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:59.390
is how the beans enter
the fermentation process,

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:01.020
dry fermented.

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:04.160
We classify just try to
make sure there is no rocks

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.410
or heavy metals or
something like that

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:09.720
on the production line.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.980
And then we just get
all the beans roasted

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:14.420
and then just reduce
the moisture pretty much

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:15.720
in the roasting process.

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.380
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: And the
roasting process develops the

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:20.580
actual flavors of chocolate,
like Sam was saying earlier.

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:24.120
So yeah. So when we
get the beans in,

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.400
there's all this potential
in this neat little package.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:30.980
And we as a chocolate
maker have to figure

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:32.280
out how we're going to roast it.

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.940
Because the roast profile
distinctly changes the flavors.

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.890
It drives off all kinds of
volatile compounds and sort

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:40.290
of develops the chocolate
flavor.

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:41.960
And just like in coffee,

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:46.300
you'll find lighter roasts can
be more acidic and more intense

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.680
and sometimes bitter
and not pleasant.

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.260
Darker roasts, you start
getting into the more just

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.970
like pure chocolate-y flavors
and you'll start to lose some

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.700
of those more subtle fruit
flavors and that kind of stuff.

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.890
And if you roast too far,
you start getting burnt

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:02.170
or you start getting like
roasty bitter like burnt toast.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:03.470
Where you have really
dark toast,

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:04.770
you get that kind of bitterness.

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:08.430
So that's one of
the first challenges

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:11.280
for us making chocolate
is roasting.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.660
And we get a bean in and
we sample it and we kind

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.880
of will do experimental roasts
and we'll kind of play with it

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:20.240
until we get a flavor
profile that we like.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.370
And then from there it's
actually grinding the chocolate,

00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:25.610
which incorporates
air, is a question

00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:27.230
of how much sugar
we're going to add,

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.890
what kind of sugar
we're going to add.

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:30.750
Because that contributes
to the flavoring.

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:34.290
If you use like a
white like plane

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:36.940
like fully extracted
sugar, if you something more

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:39.840
like a raw sugar that
has a lot of the molasses

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.780
and like cane flavor
still in it.

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:44.930
There is a really
interesting maker in Wisconsin

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:47.780
that was using rice
sugar in his chocolate,

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:51.980
which had a really unique
flavor, really interesting.

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:54.350
But there's so much
with chocolate.

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:58.190
And that's one of the things
that we try to do is we try

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:01.840
and balance that act between
like making chocolate that's

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.040
really interesting flavor to
making chocolate that's pleasant

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:10.000
and enjoyable for everyone.

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:17.680
&gt;&gt; Where is your
cacao mostly from?

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.540
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Brazil,
primarily, and a little bit

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:21.050
from the Dominican Republic.

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:27.690
&gt;&gt; So it's mostly from Brazil?

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:30.300
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho:
Primarily from Brazil, yes.

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:31.600
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah.

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.420
We just did a sourcing trip this
year to the Dominican Republic,

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:36.540
so those were the most recent
photos we have of some farms

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:39.200
that we just visited
and that kind of stuff.

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.500
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho:
The first pictures,

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.180
actually they were from Brazil.

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:44.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the first
pictures were.

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:48.620
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: Was
Dominican Republic, yeah.

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:49.920
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.850
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: We haven't
done a blend of the Dominican

00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:55.070
and the Brazilian
chocolate together.

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:57.360
Yeah, that's a great idea.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:01.550
We kind of right now we've made
them as like single origins.

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:06.610
And we do a blend of two of our
Brazilian cocoas that we use

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:08.000
to make our milk chocolate,

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.940
and we make a 70% that's
kind of our like flagship.

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:13.980
Those are our two sort of
like flagship chocolates,

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.450
those are our blend
of Brazilian cocoas.

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:22.520
But we haven't blended the
Dominican and the Brazilian, no.

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.930
[inaudible] Harper Macaw?

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:25.820
It's two rain forest birds.

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:30.340
So it's the harpy eagle and the
macaw, and we kind of chopped it

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.000
up and used it to make our name.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.780
And that's the logo
too is the bird.

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.390
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: Those are
two birds actually in danger

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:40.710
of extinction in
the rain forest,

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:44.350
in Brazilian rain forests, yeah.

00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:45.650
So that's why [inaudible].

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:50.080
&gt;&gt; You mentioned your
commitment to the environment

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:54.260
and to people willing to pay
fair wages and direct trade.

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:57.570
And obviously it's very
pervasive in the industry

00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:01.540
to see the sort of exploitation

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:03.750
of socioeconomic
factors and people.

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:05.430
So what standards
within the industry

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:09.440
or what measures are being taken
to mitigate the harm being done

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.700
to people and to the population
and to the environment?

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:13.000
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah, yeah.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.300
So in the industry
wide, there is a --

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:19.430
I can tell you about
one institute

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:21.230
that you guys should
actually check out.

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:24.260
They're called the Fine Cocoa
and Chocolate Institute.

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:29.650
And they are setting up
a standard of basically

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:33.200
like assessment for
preventing those things.

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.210
And we follow that standard.

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:37.160
So we visit our farms.

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.780
We talk to our people.

00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:43.610
And we go down and we make
sure that what we pay directly

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:45.450
to the farm is actually
getting passed

00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:47.680
down in wages to the workers.

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.880
We tour the farms
and we make sure

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:54.130
that those agroforestry
principles are actually being

00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:57.210
followed and that they're
meeting all of those standards.

00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:01.860
And we also talk to other
industry professionals

00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:03.390
who are monitoring those things.

00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:06.190
And that's what's
interesting right now

00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:09.250
about the chocolate industry,
is all of that is growing.

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:12.790
It's very much at its
infancy, those changes

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:15.190
and people putting together
groups and organizations

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:17.320
to help enforce those changes.

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.650
So it's all very new.

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:23.160
And basically how we do
it is we've set standards

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.700
for ourselves and we've set
standards for who we will work

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:29.220
with and who we won't
work with, and we just try

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:32.720
to follow those guidelines
as best we can,

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.910
and try to be adaptable
and partner

00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:36.280
with those other companies

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.230
that are setting those
rules and standards.

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:40.680
Yeah, thank you.

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.980
That's a great question.

00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:44.770
&gt;&gt; We have time for
one more question.

00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:50.500
&gt;&gt; You guys kind of talked about
this already, but in America,

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:56.160
I know there's two
different types of chocolate,

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.460
there's just milk and dark.

00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:02.080
But you said cacao beans can
be very different flavored.

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.280
I'm guessing it's
affected by [inaudible].

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:11.030
But do you offer any
unique flavors, for example,

00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:16.430
compared to what we'll
find in the supermarket?

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:18.510
Or is it based more
on what people prefer?

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:19.810
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah.

00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:21.110
Let me pull up our website.

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:22.410
And our chocolate
basically, we don't --

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:24.890
so we have a few things that we
do flavor directly that we add

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:30.060
like nuts and candy and
like other stuff we make

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:33.140
in-house too.

00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:35.580
But for the most part.

00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:38.480
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: We do
have milk chocolate as well.

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:44.720
And we actually have a 57% milk
chocolate, which means 57% cacao

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:50.050
and milk powder, organic whole
milk powder and organic sugar.

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:51.500
So those are all
the ingredients.

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:52.830
So we do add flavors

00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:54.820
and we don't make only
the plain chocolate.

00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:58.220
And we also have special
editions I can show you here,

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:01.570
and that's great because
-- so, for example,

00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:03.200
this one here, the first one.

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.420
See it? Grapefruit,

00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:09.100
it's grapefruit [inaudible]
oil with [inaudible].

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:15.440
So it's a very interesting
flavor, thanks to Matt,

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.180
he developed this chocolate bar.

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:19.750
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: That
one's a lot of fun.

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:21.050
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: Yeah.

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:22.690
It's actually 70%
dark chocolate.

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:25.550
So it's dark chocolate
with some --

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:27.600
added those two other
ingredients.

00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:32.300
This one here is a barrel-aged
edition, and that's aged,

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.510
you know, wine barrel
for about six months

00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:37.550
and it gets the flavor.

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:38.890
The same process.

00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:40.340
&gt;&gt; The dry beans are?

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:44.140
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: The cacao
nibs or the dry beans, yes.

00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:45.960
One or the other.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:51.290
This one here is the same
process but it's a rye barrel.

00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:52.590
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon:
Rye whiskey barrel.

00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:53.890
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho:
Rye whiskey barrel.

00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:57.030
It's actually a local company
that's a winery distributer.

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:59.290
It's based here in
Washington, DC.

00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:02.030
And it gathers the beans
kind of like a tray

00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:03.870
of the beans -- sorry,
the barrels.

00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:07.260
They give us the barrels after
they empty it out of whiskey.

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:09.650
We fill up with cacao nibs.

00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:11.800
And after six months, they
get the barrels back and fill

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:16.780
up with whiskey and it has
chocolate flavor into it.

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:20.050
So it's a very interesting
process.

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:21.830
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon:
So you were asking

00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:23.130
about what the difference is

00:57:23.130 --> 00:57:24.890
between like milk
and dark chocolate.

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:29.150
And really, that's one of those
hard things that goes back

00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:32.390
to what we all grew up with,
which is this hard line

00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:34.510
between stuff like Hershey's
-- which is milk chocolate --

00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:37.310
and then what most people
probably recognize dark

00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:38.890
chocolate is like
baking chocolate.

00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:41.860
And it's super bitter, and
it's unpleasant, it's terrible.

00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:47.730
But dark chocolate I think
legally is defined as anything

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:53.450
that contains cacao over I want
to say 20% actual cacao beans.

00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:58.900
And so technically our milk
chocolate is a dark milk

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:01.720
chocolate, which is
really fascinating.

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:05.040
And so what's great about is you
have this great sort of marrying

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:07.680
of the flavors of the
milk and the creaminess

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.050
and then the fruit flavors

00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:12.490
from the actual cacao
and the chocolate.

00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:16.120
Our milk chocolate bar is
one of my favorite things.

00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:22.180
And then when we're
making our single origin,

00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:23.700
these bars that kind of follow.

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.000
This is the blended bar.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.770
That's the other two beans from
Brazil, I was talking about.

00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:30.250
And our milk chocolate
is actually made

00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:31.570
with the same blend.

00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:34.590
And then after that we have our
single origin dark chocolates,

00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:36.540
which are made with
a single bean

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:39.590
from a single farm
from a single area.

00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:44.240
And those we don't
specifically aim.

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:49.160
It's kind of dependent on what
flavors we get in the chocolate

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.360
when -- in the beans, when we
get them in and we taste them.

00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.430
Sometimes, like I was saying
earlier, we'll get a bean in

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:56.440
and we'll say, okay, this
has this really nice sort

00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.810
of dark fruit flavors.

00:58:57.810 --> 00:59:00.360
It's kind of raisiny and figgy.

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:02.060
And let's see if we
can bring that out.

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:04.060
And that's kind of
what we aim for.

00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:08.100
And keeping that in mind, if
there's something really strange

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:10.730
in there that we know
people won't like --

00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:12.030
which I think was
your other question.

00:59:12.030 --> 00:59:14.020
Is like do we try and make
chocolate for, you know,

00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:17.710
like flavors that
people are interested in?

00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:19.040
And yes, absolutely.

00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:22.060
Because, you know, I
might really like some

00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:25.500
like weird esoteric like
mushroomy flavor that's

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.270
in some bean that we
get, but I don't know

00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:30.020
that anyone else
wants to eat chocolate

00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:31.480
that tastes like mushrooms.

00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:34.780
So of course we try and kind
of like look at those beans

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:38.400
and say, okay, like there
is this interesting flavor,

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.100
but maybe that's not going to
be like the most enjoyed flavor,

00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:43.120
so let's not try
to bring that out.

00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:46.440
Like let's try and like guide
it towards these other flavors

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:49.120
that we think, you
know, people will like.

00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:50.420
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho:
We also have --

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.830
all the people that
work with us, of course,

00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:55.430
and they are passionate
about chocolate.

00:59:55.430 --> 01:00:00.410
And one of them, Barb, she knows
everything about chocolate,

01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:02.160
about anything that
you can ask her.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.510
The other one, she
has a chocolate blog,

01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:06.140
she's also passionate
about chocolate.

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:08.100
And the reason I'm saying

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:11.950
that is they help
us with the flavors.

01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:14.190
So they taste them, what do
you think about this flavor?

01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:16.560
Okay, I like it, but
she doesn't like it.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:20.280
So otherwise, maybe has a
very funky, she likes things

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.460
that I personally
don't like [inaudible].

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:29.470
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Yeah, we
try to taste as a group.

01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:34.890
And, you know, maybe I think in
the future, we have been talking

01:00:34.890 --> 01:00:38.150
about when we're
developing new chocolates,

01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:42.950
of like having people
come in as like a preview

01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:46.540
and taste different recipes
and kind of give us feedback

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:49.120
and like what people like,
what they don't like.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.840
And kind of like help us sort
of, you know, make chocolate

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.440
that people can really enjoy.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.420
And then you get
to taste chocolate.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:01.170
&gt;&gt; Samuel Carvalho: That's what
we kind of do at the store.

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:03.000
We have -- of course
it's a store,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.690
but we have samples there.

01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:07.520
So we can get people's
feedback as they're trying it,

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.500
and it's always very fun
watching people's face.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.640
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Thank
you so much for having us.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.710
We're so glad we got to be here.

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:17.510
Thank you all.

01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:21.120
[ Applause ]

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.890
&gt;&gt; Alda Migoni: I've got
some closing remarks.

01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:25.190
So thank you to both
of our presenters

01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:29.330
for a very informative and
illustrative presentation.

01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:33.920
I'm genuinely a fan
of your chocolate.

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.410
So thank you for coming.

01:01:35.410 --> 01:01:37.160
And I did want to say thank you

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.300
for helping us celebrate
National Hispanic Heritage Month

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.700
with us here today.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.070
I do also want to
direct your attention

01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:45.260
to our general collection,
there are two books.

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:50.140
That if you're interested in
the socioeconomic justice aspect

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.610
of direct trade or fair
trade and chocolate,

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:55.940
or you want to learn more
about slave and child labor

01:01:55.940 --> 01:02:00.080
in the West Ivory Coast,
and the way in which Hershey

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.240
and Nestle have engaged in
these type of practices,

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.170
I recommend looking into
our collections here.

01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:07.660
There's two books
I would recommend.

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:10.360
One is "The True History of
Chocolate," by Coe and Coe.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.870
And the other book is
also "Sacred Gifts,

01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:16.140
Profane Pleasures, a History
of Chocolate and Tobacco

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:18.860
in the Atlantic World,"
by Marcy Norton.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.250
And those are in
our collections.

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:23.200
And please come visit any
reference librarian to help you

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.900
with your venture into the
wild world of chocolate.

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:27.710
So thank you again and thank you

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:30.390
for celebrating National
Hispanic Heritage Month.

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:33.120
&gt;&gt; Matthew Dixon: Thank
you so much for coming.
