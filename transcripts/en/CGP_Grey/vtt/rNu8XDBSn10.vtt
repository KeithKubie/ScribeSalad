00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.460
Welcome to the United Kingdom
(and a Whole Lot More)
explained by me, C. G. P. Grey.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.960
United Kingdom?
England?
Great Britain?

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.900
Are these three the same place?
Are they different places?

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.200
Do British people secretly laugh those
who use the terms incorrectly?
Who knows the answers to these questions?

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.140
I do, and I'm going to tell you right now.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.480
For the lost — this is the world, this is the European continent, and this is the place we have to untangle.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.300
The area shown in purple is the United Kingdom.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.780
Part of the confusion is that the United Kingdom is not a single country, but is instead is a country of countries.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.020
It contains, inside of it —
four, co-equal, and sovereign nations.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.780
The first of these is England, shown here in red.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.740
England is often confused with the United Kingdom,
as a whole, because it's the largest and

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.000
most populous of the nations,
and contains the de facto capital city, London.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.990
To the north is Scotland, shown in blue,
and to the west is Wales, shown in white,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.920
and — often forgotten even
by those who live in the United Kingdom —
is Northern Ireland, shown in orange.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.800
Each country has a local term for the population.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.800
While you can call them all 'British,'
it's not recommended;
as the four countries generally don't like each other.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.300
The Northern Irish, Scottish, and Welsh
regard the English as slave-driving, colonial masters

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.360
(no matter that all three have their own, devolved, Parliaments; and are allowed to vote on English laws despite the reverse not being true),

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.180
and the English generally regard the rest as rural, yokels who spend too much time with their sheep.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.840
However, as the four constituent countries
don't have their own passports,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.400
they're all British citizens, like it or not.
They are British citizens of the United Kingdom,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.960
whose full name, by the way, is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.980
So where's Great Britain hiding?

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.180
Right here, the area covered in black is Great Britain.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.480
Unlike England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Great Britain is a geographical —
rather than a political — term.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.920
Great Britain is the largest island
among the British Isles.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.920
Within the United Kingdom,
the term 'Great Britain' is often used to refer to —
England, Scotland, and Wales alone

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.980
— with the intentional exclusion of Northern Ireland.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.740
This is mostly, but not completely, true, as all three constituent countries have islands
that are not part of Great Britain:

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.000
such as the Isle of Wight (part of England),
the Welsh Isle of Anglesey,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.520
the Scottish Hebrides, the Shetland Islands,
the Orkney Islands, and the Islands of the Clyde.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.600
The second biggest island in the British Isles is Ireland.

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:42.780
It's worth noting, at this point,
that Ireland is not a country;

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.460
like Great Britain,
it's a geographical — not political — term.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.500
The Island of Ireland contains, on it, two countries:

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.460
Northern Ireland, which we have already discussed,
and the Republic of Ireland.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.980
When people say they are 'Irish,'
they're referring to the Republic of Ireland

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.860
(which is a separate country from the United Kingdom).

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.560
However, both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom are members of the European Union —

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.720
even though England, in particular, likes to
pretend that it's an island in the mid-Atlantic,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.500
rather than 50 kilometers off the coast of France —
but that's a story for another time.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.180
To review:

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.020
the two largest islands in the British Isles
are Ireland and Great Britain.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.900
Ireland has, on it, two countries —
the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland;

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.780
while Great Britain, mostly, contains three:
England, Scotland and Wales.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.860
These last three, when combined with Northern Ireland, form the United Kingdom.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.740
There are still many unanswered questions:
such as, why, when you travel to Canada,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.320
is there British royalty on the money?

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.320
To answer this, we need to talk about empire.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.400
You can't have gone to school, in the English-speaking world, without having learned that the British Empire

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.440
once spanned 1/4th the world's land
and governed nearly 1/4th the world's people.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.200
While it's easy to remember the parts of the
British Empire that broke away violently,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.580
we often forget how many nations gained independence through diplomacy, not bloodshed.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.780
These want-to-be nations struck a deal with the Empire: where they continued to recognize the Monarchy

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.480
as the Head of State, in exchange
for a local, autonomous parliament.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.760
To understand how they are connected,
we need to talk about the Crown.

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.549
Not the physical crown — that sits behind glass in the Tower of London, and earns millions

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.209
of tourist pounds for the UK — but the Crown as a complicated, legal entity,

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.049
best thought of as a one-man corporation.

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.329
Who created this corporation?

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.129
God did.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.209
According to British tradition, all power is vested in God and the Monarch is crowned in a Christian ceremony.

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.480
God, however, not wanting to be bothered with micromanagement,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.880
conveniently delegates his power his power to an entity called the Crown.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.260
While this used to be the physical
crown in the Tower of London, it evolved,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.520
over time, into a legal corporation; sole able to be controlled only by the ruling monarch.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.920
It's a useful reminder that the United Kingdom is still, technically, a theocracy: with the reigning monarch

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.020
acting as both the Head of State and the Supreme Governor of the official state religion: Anglicanism.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.260
Such are the oddities that arise when dealing with a thousand year-old Monarchy.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.340
Back to Canada and the rest.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.480
The former colonies that gained their independence through diplomacy, and continue to recognize
the authority of the Crown,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.900
are known as the Commonwealth Realm.
They are, in decreasing order of population:

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.280
Canada, Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Jamaica, the Solomon Islands, Belize,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.900
the Bahamas, Barbados, Saint Lucia, 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.340
Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Tuvalu.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.100
All are independent nations, but still recognize the Monarchy as the Head of State

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.380
(even though it has little
 real power within their borders).

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.760
There are three further entities that belong to the Crown, and these are the Crown Dependencies:
the Isle of Man, Jersey, and Guernsey.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.880
Unlike the Commonwealth Realm, they are not considered independent nations, but are granted

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.040
local autonomy by the Crown, and a British Citizenship by the United Kingdom

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.280
(though, the UK does reserve the right to over-rule 
the laws of their local assemblies).

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.600
Are we all done 𝘯𝘰𝘸?
Almost, but not quite;

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.920
there are still a couple of loose threads,
such as this place:

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.340
the tiny city of Gibraltar on the southern coast of Spain.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.860
Famous for its rock, 
its monkeys, and for causing diplomatic
tension between the United Kingdom and Spain.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.900
But what about the Falkland Islands:
which caused so much tension

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.820
between the United Kingdom and Argentina, that they went to war over them.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.580
These places belong in the last group of Crown properties known as: British Overseas Territories,

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.340
but their former name,
'Crown Colonies,' gives away their origin.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.120
They are the last vestiges of the British Empire.
Unlike the Commonwealth Realm,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.300
they have not become independent nations and continue to rely on the United Kingdom

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.420
for military and, sometimes, economic assistance.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.700
Like the Crown Dependencies, everyone born within their borders is a British citizen.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.740
The Crown Colonies are,
in decreasing order of population:

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.460
Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Gibraltar, the British Virgin Islands, 
Akrotiri and Dhekelia, Anguilla,

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.940
Saint Helena, the Ascension Islands, Tristan da Cunha, Montserrat, the British Indian Ocean Territory,
the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands,

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.200
the Falkland Islands, the British Antarctic Territory,
and the Pitcairn Islands.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.200
For our final Venn diagram:

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.640
the United Kingdom is a country situated
on the British Isles and is part of the Crown,
which is controlled by the Monarchy.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.300
Also part of the Crown and the British Isles are the Crown Dependencies.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.920
The independent nations of the former Empire that still recognize the Crown are the Commonwealth Realm,

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.160
and the non-independent remnants of the former Empire and are the British Overseas Territories.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.120
Thank you very much for watching!
