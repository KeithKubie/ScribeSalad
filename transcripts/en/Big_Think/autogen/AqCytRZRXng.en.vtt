if you challenge the student to come up
with the answer for her or himself then

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530
with the answer for her or himself then
 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.540
with the answer for her or himself then
he's chosen to do that she has chosen to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550
he's chosen to do that she has chosen to
 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.180
he's chosen to do that she has chosen to
get the answer and so it it makes it

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
get the answer and so it it makes it
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.479

it a thousand times and so what you want
to do is arrange science education so

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820
to do is arrange science education so
 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.270
