00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.550
The 40 or so muscles in the human face 
can be activated in different combinations

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.921
to create thousands of expressions.

00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:16.840
But do these expressions look the same

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.352
and communicate the same
meaning around the world,

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:20.959
regardless of culture?

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:23.991
Is one person’s smile another’s grimace?

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:29.521
Charles Darwin theorized that emotional 
expression was a common human feature.

00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:31.290
But he was in the minority.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.062
Until the mid-20th century,

00:00:33.062 --> 00:00:37.079
many researchers believed 
that the specific ways we show emotion

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.492
were learned behaviors 
that varied across cultures.

00:00:40.492 --> 00:00:45.692
Personality theorist Silvan Tomkins 
was one of the few to insist otherwise.

00:00:45.692 --> 00:00:47.871
Tomkins claimed that certain affects—

00:00:47.871 --> 00:00:50.863
emotional states and their associated 
facial expressions—

00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:52.963
were universal.

00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:58.063
In the 1960s, psychologist Paul Ekman 
set about testing this theory

00:00:58.063 --> 00:01:00.613
by examining hundreds 
of hours of film footage

00:01:00.613 --> 00:01:04.581
of remote tribes isolated 
from the modern world.

00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:08.633
Ekman found the native peoples’ 
expressions to be not only familiar,

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:12.664
but occurring in precisely 
the situations he would expect.

00:01:12.664 --> 00:01:18.244
Conversely, he ran tests with tribes who
had no prior exposure to Western culture.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.964
They were able to correctly match photos
of different facial expressions

00:01:21.964 --> 00:01:25.794
with stories designed 
to trigger particular feelings.

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.204
Over the next few decades,

00:01:27.204 --> 00:01:29.807
further research has
corroborated Darwin’s idea

00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:34.375
that some of our most important emotional
expressions are in fact universal.

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:38.325
The degrees of expression appropriate 
to a given situation can, however,

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:40.983
vary greatly across cultures.

00:01:40.983 --> 00:01:43.965
For instance, researchers 
have studied facial expression

00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:45.735
in people who are born blind,

00:01:45.735 --> 00:01:48.507
hypothesizing that 
if expressions are universal,

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:52.355
they would be displayed 
in the same way as sighted people.

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:55.276
In one study, both blind 
and sighted athletes

00:01:55.276 --> 00:02:00.215
displayed the same expressions of emotion
when winning or losing their matches.

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:03.746
Further evidence can be found 
in our evolutionary relatives.

00:02:03.746 --> 00:02:07.536
Comparisons of facial expression
between humans and non-human mammals

00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:11.627
have found similarities in the structure 
and movement of facial muscles.

00:02:11.627 --> 00:02:14.246
Chimpanzee laughter 
looks different from ours,

00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:17.556
but uses some of the same 
muscle movements.

00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:22.107
Back in the 60s, Ekman identified 
six core expressions.

00:02:22.107 --> 00:02:25.838
Anger is accompanied by lowered
eyebrows drawn together,

00:02:25.838 --> 00:02:27.269
tense and narrowed eyes,

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.907
and tight lips;

00:02:28.907 --> 00:02:33.296
disgust, by the lips pulled up
and the nose crinkling.

00:02:33.296 --> 00:02:38.208
In fear, the upper white of the eyes 
are revealed as the eyebrows raise

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:40.370
and the mouth stretches open,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.168
while surprise looks similar,

00:02:42.168 --> 00:02:46.052
but with rounded eyebrows 
and relaxed lips.

00:02:46.052 --> 00:02:49.212
Sadness is indicated by the inner corners 
of the eyebrows

00:02:49.212 --> 00:02:51.418
being drawn inwards and upwards,

00:02:51.418 --> 00:02:52.553
drooping eyes,

00:02:52.553 --> 00:02:54.644
and a downturned mouth.

00:02:54.644 --> 00:02:56.527
And of course there’s happiness:

00:02:56.527 --> 00:02:58.597
lips drawn up and back,

00:02:58.597 --> 00:03:01.969
and raised cheeks causing wrinkling 
around the eyes.

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.530
More recently, researchers 
have proposed additional entries

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.781
such as contempt,

00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:07.798
shame,

00:03:07.798 --> 00:03:09.479
and disapproval,

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:11.679
but opinions vary 
on how distinct boundaries

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:14.780
between these categories can be drawn.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.937
So if Ekman and other researchers 
are correct,

00:03:17.937 --> 00:03:20.299
what makes certain expressions universal?

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.781
And why are they expressed 
in these particular ways?

00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:27.460
Scientists have a lot of theories rooted 
in our evolutionary history.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.250
One is that certain expressions 
are important for survival.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.560
Fear and surprise could signal 
to others an immediate danger.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.860
Studies of humans and some other primates

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.311
have found that we pay more attention 
to faces that signal threats

00:03:41.311 --> 00:03:42.922
over neutral faces,

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:45.291
particularly when we’re already 
on high alert.

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:48.024
Expressions also could 
help improve group fitness

00:03:48.024 --> 00:03:51.680
by communicating our internal states 
to those around us.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.023
Sadness, for example, signals to the group
that something’s wrong.

00:03:56.023 --> 00:03:58.012
There’s some evidence that expressions

00:03:58.012 --> 00:04:01.502
might be even more directly linked 
to our physiology.

00:04:01.502 --> 00:04:03.293
The fear expression, for instance,

00:04:03.293 --> 00:04:07.363
could directly improve survival 
in potentially dangerous situations

00:04:07.363 --> 00:04:09.542
by letting our eyes absorb more light

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:14.553
and our lungs take in more air, 
preparing us to fight or flee.

00:04:14.553 --> 00:04:18.144
There’s still much research to be done 
in understanding emotional expression,

00:04:18.144 --> 00:04:21.863
particularly as we learn more about 
the inner workings of the brain.

00:04:21.863 --> 00:04:25.003
But if you ever find yourself 
among strangers in a strange land,

00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:27.593
a friendly smile could go a long way.
