00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:09.224
ALAN PRICE: Good evening.

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:10.895
AUDIENCE: Good evening.

00:00:10.895 --> 00:00:12.020
ALAN PRICE: I'm Alan Price.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.080
I'm Director here at the
John F. Kennedy Presidential

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.500
Library and Museum, and
it's good to see you here.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.180
Many of you, I'm
seeing you again.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.070
So welcome back.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.580
On behalf of my colleague
Steven Rothstein at the Kennedy

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.450
Library Foundation, and all
my Library and Foundation

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.780
colleagues, I thank you
for coming this evening.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.790
I would like to acknowledge
the generous support

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.270
of our underwriters of the
Kennedy Library Forums,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.570
lead sponsors, Bank
of America, the Lowell

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.990
Institute, and Gourmet
Catering, and our media

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:51.140
sponsors, the Boston
Globe, Xfinity, WBUR.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.470
Almost 40 years ago,
President Carter

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.370
spoke here at the
dedication of this library.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.490
In his remarks, he
noted that the library

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.239
would serve as a place
for the work of reflection

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.560
and evaluation of what
President Kennedy did.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.230
This evening, we are so
pleased to have the opportunity

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.350
to spend this time reflecting
on the work of President

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.670
Carter with our
esteemed special guests.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.480
Stuart Eizenstat was President
Carter's Chief White House

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.640
Domestic Policy Advisor.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.300
He served President Clinton
as Ambassador to the European

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.330
Union, Undersecretary
of Commerce,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.470
Undersecretary of State, Deputy
Secretary of the Treasury,

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.410
and Special Representative
of the President

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.140
on Holocaust-era issues.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.620
In the Obama administration,
he was Special Representative

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.040
of the Secretary of State
on Holocaust issues.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.650
He is now an international
lawyer with Covington

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.480
and Burling in Washington.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.090
He also has a terrific book out.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.390
It really is wonderful.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.990
Meredith Evans was appointed
Director of the Jimmy Carter

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.680
Presidential Library and Museum,
administered by the National

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.660
Archives and Records
Administration,

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.630
in November 2015.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.720
As director, she focuses
on civic engagement,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.690
the role of the presidency
and public policy,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.720
and making accessible
the records of President

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.710
Carter, his cabinet, and the
White House administration.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.410
She has written on the role and
value of museums, libraries,

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.390
and archives, and has presented
at various international and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.010
national conferences.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.045
Please join me in welcoming our
special guests this evening.

00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:44.015
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:49.460
MEREDITH EVANS: Go

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.720
STUART EIZENSTAT: Thank
you very much, Alan.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.240
You know, it's typical
for people to say,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.050
when you see any audience,
that it's a special evening.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.670
But this really is
a special evening

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.750
for a variety of reasons.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.760
The first is my
connection to Boston.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.780
I married my late wife
of 45 years, Fran,

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.160
who was a Boston native.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.920
We met at Harvard Law School.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.560
And I have the pleasure
of having a number

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.420
of my classmates and others--

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.360
Ambassador Barry White
and some of my colleagues

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.120
have come before.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.710
It is also special because--
and I hope she's here--

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.620
one of the people who was
instrumental in my Holocaust

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.320
work during the
Clinton administration,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.310
where I negotiated $8 billion
dollars of recoveries.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.100
And she was really the
heroine for the Swiss bank

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.510
negotiations.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.580
She's really the one
that pioneered it--

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.620
Greta Beer-- and got me
very much involved in it.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.270
It's also special to have
Dr. Meredith Evans here

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.790
because of the Carter
Center connection

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.040
that I obviously have.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.560
But most pertinent to tonight
is this library itself.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.910
For one thing, I can say
without qualification

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.870
that my inspiration
for public service

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.670
came from a 1962 speech,
which President Kennedy gave

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.075
at Kenan Football Stadium at
Chapel Hill at the University

00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:31.040
at North Carolina.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.850
And he urged all of
us to try to serve

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.220
our country and the world,
and make it a better place.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.800
And without question, that
was really the catalyst

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.350
for my public career.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.410
Like so many in my generation--

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.860
I'm sure I'm
speaking for others--

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.740
I remember exactly where
I was, to the minute,

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.470
when the assassination
occurred in Chapel Hill

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.900
at the Science Department.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.310
And I drove up from
Chapel Hill overnight

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.410
to be at the US Capitol when his
body was brought from the White

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.600
House to the Capitol.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.120
And as Allan said, on
October 20th, 1979,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.030
President Carter, who was
not a great speechmaker,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.170
gave a great speech
here at the opening.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.505
May I say, not because
I helped write it--

00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:32.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.320
--but because of the
emotion behind it.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.120
And it was emotional for
a variety of reasons,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.080
both because of his
drawing inspiration

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.330
from President Kennedy, but also
because it came about two weeks

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.350
before the announcement by Ted
that he was running against us.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.930
So we've always
remembered that, and we'll

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.250
talk more about that later.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.630
Jimmy Carter's political
hero was Harry Truman.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.660
And he placed his
famous slogan, "The buck

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:12.630
stops here," on his Oval
Office desk on a plaque.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.730
Both presidents left the
White House highly unpopular.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.500
Truman is now remembered much
more for his achievements

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.940
than for his failures.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.760
And I'm hopeful that my
book has a similar impact

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.750
on a reassessment of
Jimmy Carter as President.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.070
Not just as the most admired,
and as we were talking about,

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.430
the longest-serving
former president.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.520
Almost 70% of all
our major legislation

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.720
was passed by Congress,
just under the percent

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.330
of the first president I served
in the White House, Lyndon

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.040
Johnson, after
Harvard Law School.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.070
He honored the presidency.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.580
He respected the institutions
of government, the press--

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.300
even when it was brutally
difficult on him because he

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.370
realized that it had an
important role in a free

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.630
society--

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.880
the FBI, the Justice Department.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.650
Walter Mondale,
his Vice President,

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:22.690
put it very succinctly in words
that are on the Carter Center

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.590
Foundation.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:32.420
"We honored the law, we kept the
peace, and we told the truth."

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.490
Now, the rap on the
Carter presidency

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.030
is summarized in my
book by what I call--

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.070
and excuse my Southern
accent-- four Is.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:48.820
Inflation, Iran, inexperience by
the president and his so-called

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.010
Georgia Mafia, of
whom I was one--

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.650
I was the experienced guy having
worked a year in the Johnson

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.730
White House--

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:04.520
and interparty warfare with
the liberal wing of the party

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.610
led by Ted Kennedy.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.590
We'll talk about that
more in a moment.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:14.640
The problem is these are
very real liabilities.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.750
I am totally candid about them.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.180
It's the reason why The New
York Times and Washington

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.340
Post, and many
other publications,

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.500
have given us a
very good review.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.660
Because it's not just
an insider's view,

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.640
it's an honest view of
his mistakes and failures,

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.338
including my own as advisor.

00:08:34.338 --> 00:08:36.380
This is not a book that
could have been entitled,

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.669
If He Had Only Listened to Me.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.039
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:44.030
But, also, his achievements,
which have been so

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.510
obscured by these problems.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:52.040
Achievements at home and abroad,
which are of lasting importance

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.105
to us this day.

00:08:55.912 --> 00:08:58.120
And I wanted to write the
book while there were still

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.950
living eyewitnesses, and
before history's verdict

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:06.340
that Jimmy Carter was
a failed president

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:11.210
was so indelibly emblazoned
in people's minds

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.730
that that would be
the long and short

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.420
of the 39th President
of the United States.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.450
One of the unique
features about the book

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:25.430
is based on a habit I had from
University of North Carolina.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.555
I took it into Harvard
Law School and then

00:09:27.555 --> 00:09:28.430
into the White House.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:33.050
And that was being an
inveterate note taker.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.470
And this book is based
on over 5,000 pages

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.370
of contemporaneous verbatim
notes of everything I heard,

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.980
everything I saw,
everything I observed,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.550
every meeting that I was in.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.490
They're in the National
Archives and the Carter Library,

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.660
and the Library of Congress.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.220
And I augmented that
with 350 interviews,

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.230
five of the president himself.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.760
But I was not selective.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.090
I interviewed Republicans
and Democrats, conservatives

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.670
and liberals, detractors
and supporters,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:08.290
so that I could give a
complete and candid assessment

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.660
of the Carter presidency.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.360
To understand the
Carter presidency,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:20.030
you have to understand the
1970s, in which we governed.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.180
It was a decade of
profound and, indeed,

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:28.320
epic change in several ways.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.810
It was the decade in which
we suffered our first loss

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:39.350
in a foreign war in Vietnam, in
which there was urban violence

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.700
throughout our major cities.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.120
I remember being on the portico
of the Johnson White House

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.700
seeing 16th Street burn.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:53.080
And it was a decade of a
new economic phenomenon

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.180
that even Harvard economists
couldn't give a name to.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.580
So they called it the
ugly name of stagflation,

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.720
something we had never had
before and never since--

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.360
simultaneous slow growth
and high inflation.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.390
Sort of contradiction
of the Phillips curve.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:15.250
It was a decade in which a whole
set of new social movements,

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:19.780
which we take for granted
today, burst onto the scene.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.290
The environmental movement,
the consumer movement,

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.050
the black power movement
that morphed now

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:32.440
into Black Lives Matter,
the women's rights movement,

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.330
now #MeToo.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:39.670
And after the Roe V. Wade
Supreme Court decision in 1973

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.600
on abortion, the
right-to-life movement.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.480
It was a decade in which a
new political force, which

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:53.320
is very much with us in 2019,
was brought onto the scene

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.180
by Reverend Jerry Falwell,
a conservative Baptist

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:03.040
minister from
Virginia, who catalyzed

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.490
the evangelical movement
into a political force.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.260
He called Carter,
who was probably

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.630
the most religious president
we've had in American history,

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.800
not a real Baptist, who
was harboring homosexuals

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.700
on his staff.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:24.010
And Ronald Reagan
very adroitly merged

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:30.460
that evangelical movement to
Richard Nixon's silent majority

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.960
of dissatisfied blue collar
workers in the Midwest

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.240
into a winning
coalition in 1980.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.530
That's precisely the
political coalition

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.010
of Donald J. Trump to this day.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:50.640
Abroad, it was also a
decade of epic change.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.640
We were in the midst
of the Cold War,

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.120
and the Soviet Union was
at its most aggressive--

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:04.710
enormous buildups of
military spending in the air,

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:10.060
on the ground, and on the sea.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:16.330
Encouraging funding and
supporting Cuban proxy troops

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.090
for Communist revolutions
in the Horn of Africa,

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.240
Angola, Namibia.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.270
Ultimately, as I'll
discuss a little later,

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.400
invading Afghanistan--

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:34.090
the first invasion of a country
directly since World War II.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:36.250
And even supporting
Euro Communist

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.770
movements with some
success in Western Europe,

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.640
particularly, in Italy.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.590
It was a decade in
which a new major force

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.030
came onto the scene.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.390
Tip toeing, at that
time-- now in full force--

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.880
the People's Republic of China.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.250
More on that, also, in a minute.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:02.440
It was a decade in which
a Polish-born priest

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:08.680
became Pope John Paul
II and gave hope,

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.910
along with Carter's
human rights campaign,

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.950
to those living behind
the Iron Curtain.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.870
And it was a decade in
which a revolution occurred,

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.130
which is front page
news to this day

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.500
and bedevils us to this day.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:36.590
And that is the radical
Islamic revolution of Iran.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.240
So let me briefly
take you through

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:43.510
a few domestic achievements
which are totally unrecognized.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.090
The energy security
we enjoy today--

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:52.310
the lack of dependence on
OPEC-imported foreign oil,

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:56.140
which was over 50% when we took
office and growing by leaps

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.790
and bounds every month--

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.720
owes much to the foundation
that President Carter

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.970
laid with three major
energy bills in four years.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:11.550
Which did everything from ending
price controls on natural gas

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.880
and crude oil to encourage
domestic production, which

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.530
had been stalled because of the
limited price it could be gone.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:23.280
This year, 2019, the
United States of America

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:29.140
will be the number one producer
of energy in the world.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:33.010
More than Saudi Arabia,
more than Russia.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.640
We put conservation at the
center of our energy policy--

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.460
the first fuel
economy standards,

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.130
the first insulation standards.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:45.150
And we inaugurated-- and I have
a picture of it in the book--

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.680
the solar era of clean
energy, as Carter

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.730
put a solar panel on the
White House symbolically.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.620
It was then taken down by
Reagan in the first weeks.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:00.440
But he couldn't take down the
solar movement, which is now

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.640
10% of our total electricity.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.400
Carter was also a great
consumer champion.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.300
Seemed odd, perhaps, for a small
businessman from the South.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:19.470
He appointed consumer advocates
to regulate industries some

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.300
even from Ralph
Nader's organizations.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.150
Not as today,
appointing people who

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.990
come from or were lobbyists
for the industries

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.270
they're supposed to regulate.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:36.980
And we married that to
transformative deregulation

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.440
of all modes of
transportation to bring

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:44.120
to consumers more competition
and lower prices for buses,

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:49.290
for rail, for trucking,
and most relevant to us

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:51.900
as consumers, airlines.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:59.410
We would not have the Southwests
and Jet Blues, the efficiency

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:03.040
of the UPS and
FedEx air cargoes,

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.000
had we not remove the shackles
which prevented new carriers

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.430
from coming in and competing.

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.880
We democratized air travel
for the middle class.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.619
That might not seem
too great if you're

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:17.849
sitting in seat 36E
in the economy class,

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:20.349
and you're squeezed and hoping
just to get a drink of water.

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:24.250
But the fact is we opened air
travel to the middle class.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.430
And we didn't stop there.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.060
We went on to begin
the deregulation

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:33.380
of telecommunications and
inaugurated the cable era.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.500
And for those of you who are
aficionados of local craft

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.760
beers, we ended even the
Prohibition-era restriction

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.240
which prevented their flow.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.720
In addition, Carter
was, without question,

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.830
the greatest environmental
president in American history.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.860
Even more than
Theodore Roosevelt.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.790
We doubled the size of Theodore
Roosevelt's National Park

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.430
system with the
Alaska Lands Bill,

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:05.300
over the fierce opposition
of the Alaska delegation,

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.060
which wanted the whole
state open for oil and gas

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.590
exploration.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:14.180
And in typical Carter detail, he
took a giant map of the state,

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.880
laid it on the Oval Office
rug, got on his hands and knees

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.860
with Senator Ted Stevens--

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:23.810
the 25-year veteran conservative
Republican senator from

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:24.320
Alaska--

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.940
and showed him exactly what
was going to be in the park

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.610
and not available for
exploration, what would be.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.290
And Stevens told
us afterward he was

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.570
amazed at having represented
the state for 1/4

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.130
quarter of a century--

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.770
Carter knew more
about it than he did.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.200
We were elected in
'76 against Ford,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.880
in significant part as
a reaction to Watergate.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.330
Carter talked about a government
as good as its people.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.970
"I'll never lie to you."

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.440
And that very much resonated.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.140
But this was not just
campaign rhetoric.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.250
Every single piece,
every single piece

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:07.560
of ethics legislation
in force today

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.650
in an ethically-challenged
Washington,

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:17.730
came from his vision and was
signed into law with his pen.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.730
The 1978 Ethics Act, for
example, for the first time

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.700
required senior officials
going into government

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.820
to disclose their assets
and potential conflicts

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.400
of interest.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.860
It limited your
ability to take gifts--

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.660
then $25 while you're in office.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.720
It limited your ability to
lobby the agencies you were

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.640
with after you left office.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.160
Where did Robert
Mueller come from?

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.960
It came from the Office
of Special Counsel

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.800
we created to
investigate wrongdoing.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.050
We can talk more about the
differences between the two

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:57.200
offices, but it was
clearly the precursor.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.710
We put inspectors general
into every single department

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.050
to root out fraud,
waste, and abuse,

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:08.090
reform the civil service system,
had merit selection of judges

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:13.246
by independent
ABA-appointed people.

00:20:13.246 --> 00:20:18.350
Now, I got caught up,
unwittingly, in the gift rule.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.590
And that is because
a business magazine

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:24.410
did a profile of me saying--

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.440
not totally accurately--
that I had a great love

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.020
for the little $0.01 Tootsie
Rolls that many of you

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.770
may remember we grew up with.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.440
And so the Tootsie
Roll company sent me

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.780
a mammoth box of Tootsie Rolls.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.660
And I was not only
salivating myself,

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.020
but I knew I was going to
be the hero to my young kids

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.278
when I came home, only to find
out from the ethics officer--

00:20:45.278 --> 00:20:46.820
he said, damned if
I'm going to count

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.440
every one of these
Tootsie Rolls,

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.360
but this box is so large,
it may be worth $25.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.360
You've got to return it.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.870
So I did with a letter to the
CEO, thanking him and saying,

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:00.050
you know, we're now living
on a higher ethical plane.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:00.770
Sounds great.

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:02.300
Except, a year or
so later, there's

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.790
a profile done of the
Tootsie Roll company.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:08.010
And the CEO says, Eizenstat
tried to have it both ways.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.940
He sends us this high and
mighty letter, we open the box,

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:11.970
it's empty.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:12.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:15.500
So I'm still trying to find
the Secret Service agent who

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:16.978
stole my Tootsie Rolls.

00:21:16.978 --> 00:21:19.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:26.120
Now, more seriously, the
first target, remarkably,

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:31.140
of the new Special Counsel
we created by legislation

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.470
was none other than
President Carter's own Chief

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:40.520
of Staff, Hamilton Jordan, who
was falsely accused by someone

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.020
whose name may ring a bell.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.660
Roy Cohn, who was
the hatchet man

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.980
for Senator McCarthy and
the early political advisor

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.450
to Donald J. Trump.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.420
And he was representing
the owners of a bar

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.000
in New York called Studio 54.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.550
Hamilton should never
have been in that bar,

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.100
but they were being
investigated for tax evasion.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.590
And as part of a
plea bargain, he

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:07.730
tried to get them to say that
Hamilton was snorting cocaine,

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.340
which he was not, in the bar.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.560
And a year later--
and $1 million

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.640
out of Ham's pocket the
grand jury, 24 to 0,

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.800
said, totally untrue.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.640
But that's not the point.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.930
The point is that this happened
for a year in our re-election

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:27.850
year-- in 1980--
when Hamilton, who

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.060
had been the genius
behind our '76 campaign,

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.970
was supposed to do the
same thing in 1980.

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:35.410
It's a total distraction.

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:39.250
Not once-- not once
did Carter call it

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.370
a witch hunt,
politically motivated.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:46.260
We believed in the rule of
law, and we let it play out.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:50.030
I'll let you draw
your own comparisons.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:53.420
Here's is a Southern president
from the deepest part

00:22:53.420 --> 00:23:02.530
of the Deep South, who appoints
more women, more minorities,

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:08.320
more Jews to judgeships and
to senior administration

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.965
officials than all 38 presidents
before him put together.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.210
Some of you may have
seen the documentary RBG.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:20.245
Or if not, she's
mentioned in my book.

00:23:20.245 --> 00:23:21.620
And she said, "I
would never have

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:24.830
been on the Supreme Court
had Jimmy Carter not opened

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.660
judgeships to women
and appointed me

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.950
to the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia."

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:34.450
We supported affirmative
action in admissions.

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:37.100
Harvard is now facing that
issue, of course, now.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.245
We saved New York City and
Chrysler from bankruptcy

00:23:39.245 --> 00:23:41.420
and created the
Department of Education--

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.880
he was a great education
president-- and much,

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.060
much more.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.220
With Walter Mondale
as Vice President,

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:54.670
we took an office that was a
constitutional afterthought.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.230
Any of you who
have seen Hamilton

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.810
know what I'm talking about.

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:04.000
And we made it a real position.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.150
John Nance Garner, who was
FDR's first vice president,

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:11.090
said, it's not worth
a bucket of warm spit.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.902
And I'm cleaning the language
up for this audience.

00:24:13.902 --> 00:24:15.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:18.740
After we won the '76
election, in the transition,

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.340
Mondale sent Carter
10 requests to try

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.160
to make something
of this office.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.500
Access to all
classified documents--

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.180
did you know that
Harry Truman didn't

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.770
know that there
was an atomic bomb

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:35.690
project until after FDR died?

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:41.260
The ability to go into any
meeting without notice,

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.860
and one on one meetings with
the president every week,

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.830
just the two of them
in the Oval Office,

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.570
Carter not only
checked every one.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:50.890
He did every one.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.650
And then added one that
Mondale didn't even

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:55.420
have the temerity to ask for.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:00.220
He moved the entire office
of the vice president

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.720
into the West Wing just down the
hallway from the Oval Office.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.480
And just like in real estate,
where location is everything,

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.200
it is in politics, as well.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.750
It was a symbol that's true to
this day, with Pence and Trump,

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:18.340
that the vice president really
is now an engaged official.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.950
Now, our Achilles
heel, domestically,

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:26.080
was one of those
four I's, inflation.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.130
I'm very candid about it.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:32.890
We inherited high inflation
from Nixon and Ford.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.950
And it got worse.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:38.360
It got worse.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.560
And Carter called us
in the summer of 1979,

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.350
as we're starting to look
at a re-election year.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:50.610
And he said, look, I've
got a choice to make.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:55.800
I have tried everything to deal
with this embedded inflation.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.480
I've had to
anti-inflation czars.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.180
I've given five
anti-inflation speeches.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.310
I've had voluntary wage
and price guidelines

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.432
I've had to cut
Social spending to try

00:26:04.432 --> 00:26:07.640
to satisfy financial markets.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.270
And it's made me
highly unpopular

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.980
with the liberal wing.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.010
Nothing has worked.

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:19.040
And so he said, I'm going to
take the toughest medicine that

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.550
the economy can take, even
if it means-- which it did--

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.430
his re-election.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:28.260
He said, I'm going to appoint
Paul Volcker to be chairman

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.060
of the Fed, knowing
in advance, as I

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:35.580
describe in a meeting in my
book, just the two of them,

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:39.110
exactly what Volcker
was going to do.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.990
I mean, the contrast, it
was sort of Mutt and Jeff.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.880
And Carter is about 5'9".

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:49.920
And Volcker is 6'7", and a
giant of an intellect, as well,

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.650
he'd been president of the
Federal Reserve in New York.

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:56.310
And he said to
Carter exactly this.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:00.710
If you appoint me, I'm going
to tighten the money supply.

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:03.180
It's going to cause
inflation to go up.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.020
It's going to cause
unemployment to go up

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.030
in the middle of your election.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:11.630
If you're not prepared to
support me, don't appoint me.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.250
I don't want the job.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.780
I don't want you saying to me--

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.630
just think of what
poor Jerome Powell

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:19.380
goes through when he
raises interest rates

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.940
a half of a percent--

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.540
don't appoint me if you're
going to point the finger at me

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.223
and say, it's Volcker
that's responsible

00:27:26.223 --> 00:27:27.390
for the high interest rates.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:29.905
And Carter said, you
take care of the interest

00:27:29.905 --> 00:27:30.780
rates in the economy.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.580
I'll take care of the politics.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.350
A number of us
were very concerned

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.390
about the appointment.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:40.860
And what Volcker did is why
we have low inflation today,

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.000
without question.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.005
You can ask Bernanke.

00:27:43.005 --> 00:27:44.820
You can ask .

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:48.850
Greenspan you can
ask any economist.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:55.610
Inflation dropped like a rock
as a result of squeezing it out

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:57.560
of the economy
through high interest

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.010
rates and high unemployment.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:05.470
It dropped like a rock at the
end of Reagan's first year,

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.450
not in time for our re-election.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:14.870
And it's emblematic that
Carter put so many seeds down

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:19.360
which blossomed only
after he left office.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.280
So let's look at some
of the accomplishments

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:28.120
abroad which, in some respects,
are even more significant.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:34.100
The Camp David Accords and
the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.820
are, in my opinion,
the greatest act

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:42.500
of presidential personal
diplomacy in American history,

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.980
more than Woodrow Wilson at
the Paris Peace Conference

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:51.710
after World War I. 13 agonizing
days and nights, Carter

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:57.620
personally drafts 22
separate peace agreements.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.950
And he has to
negotiate separately

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:04.930
with Prime Minister Begin of
Israel and Sadat of Egypt.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.980
Because they were like
two scorpions in a bottle.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.360
We put them together
the first day

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.920
and it was a terrible scene.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.270
And then he added
several personal touches,

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.510
studying these men-- we
got the CIA profiles.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:24.850
And he studied them
to understand what

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:26.410
made these two people tick.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:29.120
Where were their red lines?

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.590
And so he adds to
personal touches.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:36.520
The first Sunday of the
13 days, he takes them

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.610
in his presidential
limousine, Begin on his left,

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:45.060
Sadat on his right, to the
Gettysburg battlefield.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.690
And he did that
because he wanted

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:51.370
to drive home that five wars
between Egypt and Israel

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.640
were enough.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.250
Now, Sadat was a general.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:59.910
He had actually studied in some
of our military institutions

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:00.410
here.

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:03.980
He knew all the
problems that the South

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.320
had at Gettysburg,
Pickett's last charge,

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.450
and so forth, and started
expounding on them,

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:09.950
making it a little
bit uncomfortable

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:11.900
for Carter as a
southern president.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.150
But OK.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:15.630
Begin was anything
but a general.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:17.330
But he was a Lincoln scholar.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:21.620
And on the spot, verbatim, he
delivered Lincoln's Gettysburg

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:22.190
Address.

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:24.530
It's really a very,
very special event.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:29.050
But even with that, even with
22 drafts, we were close,

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:31.440
the last Sunday,
the 13th day, when

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.920
everybody agreed if we can't
get it done we've got to call it

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.360
quits.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:40.200
And Begin comes to Carter
and says, Mr. President,

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.890
I cannot and will not
make any more compromises.

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:47.610
I've got an El Al plane waiting
for me at Andrews Air Force

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:48.450
Base.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:50.490
Get me a White House
car to take me there.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.530
I'm out of here.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:58.780
Carter realizing that would
collapse Sadat's historic trip

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:02.710
to Jerusalem at
great risk to himself

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:06.090
when he pledged no more wars.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:09.180
It would inflame the Middle
East and encourage the radicals

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:14.150
like Hafez al-Assad,
Bashar's father.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:18.280
And it would engulf his own
presidency, a total failure.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.480
He calls them in--

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.450
by the way, over the
objection of almost all of us.

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:25.450
Because we said
it was too risky.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:28.600
And so he does one other
personal touch, knowing

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.590
that Begin had a great love
for his eight grandchildren,

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:36.070
a picture had been taken,
photo of the three of them.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:38.410
The first day at
Camp David, he gets

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:43.030
eight copies, and the names of
each of Begin's grandchildren,

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:47.620
enscribes them to each
with, "hopes for peace.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:50.290
Best wishes, Jimmy
Carter," hand-delivers

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:55.270
them to Begin at his
cabin at Camp David,

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.900
and sees Begin go
through each of them,

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:02.360
vocalize the names of
each of the grandchildren.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:07.070
He sees pagans lips
quiver and his eyes tear.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.640
Begin puts his
bags down and says,

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:13.520
Mr. President, I'll
make one last try.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.180
And that made Camp
David possible.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.880
But that wasn't the end of it.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.210
Barry and other lawyers here,
Camp David was an accord.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:22.200
It was a framework.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.750
It wasn't legally binding.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:26.400
It called for the treaty--

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.560
and by the way, full autonomy
for the Palestinians.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.290
That's another story-- the
treaty between Egypt and Israel

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:33.570
within three months of
the close of Camp David.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:38.340
Six months passed, no treaty.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.960
So Carter, over literally--

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.230
I'm not exaggerating--
everybody's objection decides

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:46.830
to go to the region and do
shuttle diplomacy between Cairo

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:52.880
and Jerusalem to see if he
can put the pieces together.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.960
Four days of non-stop
negotiations.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.150
And just like the last
day at Camp David,

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.040
we're close, but not there.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.280
And literally everybody gave up.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.730
Air Force One is refueled.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:09.730
The airspace over Ben
Gurion airport is cleared.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.370
The top aides are already
going from Jerusalem

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:15.160
down to Tel Aviv.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.690
And Begin calls up and
says, Mr. President,

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.440
I'd like to see you
once before you leave.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.720
And we thought,
well, it's a courtesy

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.110
to say thanks, but no thanks.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:28.330
And so he gets to the
King David Hotel, where

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:33.670
the president was in the
Presidential Suite, and says,

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:34.240
boys--

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.740
because Carter called
us down, and said, look,

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:36.490
we're not ready.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:38.560
Rosa and I have to get dressed--

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.060
to entertain the prime minister.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.050
And so we're bantering.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:44.770
And he says, now, boys, you
know, this is a famous hotel,

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:45.460
the King David.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.720
Oh, yes, sir, we know that.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.707
But not for the
reasons you think.

00:33:48.707 --> 00:33:51.040
When I was head of the Irgun
during the British mandate,

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.780
I blew this hotel up.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.830
Don't worry, I'm not going to do
it until the president leaves.

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:59.080
And he goes up to the
Presidential Suite.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.930
That's where the
treaty was finalized.

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:05.500
They come down, the elevator
of this famous hotel.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.900
And the elevator
breaks between floors.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:12.219
The Secret Service had to pull
the two of them, but-first,

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:13.260
down.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:17.248
And I call it the breech
birth of the treaty.

00:34:17.248 --> 00:34:20.587
MEREDITH EVANS: You're
taking all of my questions.

00:34:20.587 --> 00:34:23.622
I'm not going to
have anything left.

00:34:23.622 --> 00:34:25.330
STUART EIZENSTAT:
Carter put human rights

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:28.120
at the center of
his foreign policy,

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:31.719
not because it was a sort
of Dewey dot concept,

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:34.449
because he wanted to compete
with the Soviet Union,

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:37.080
and believed that
the way to do it

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.199
was to put the best of
America's domestic values

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:41.250
into our foreign policy.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.500
He applied it to the
military dictators

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:47.969
in Latin America, who were
anti-communist, by the way,

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:49.755
and pro-American,
but very repressive.

00:34:49.755 --> 00:34:53.300
He got thousands of
prisoners released catalyzed,

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.929
the new democratic
movements there,

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:56.760
which flowered in
the '80s, and then

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.910
created a new era in
Latin American relations

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:01.860
by marrying it to the
Panama Canal, which

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.920
was our toughest battle.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.980
Here's something you would
never see in today's Washington.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.590
One of the heroes of
the Panama Canal Treaty

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:15.830
was the Republican minority
leader, Howard Baker,

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:17.960
a man of very small
physical stature,

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:22.760
but a great man of the Senate.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.620
And he did what he
thought was right,

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.660
even though he knew
it would foreclose his

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.800
getting the
Republican nomination,

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.370
and brings about a
dozen Republicans along.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:36.390
And the most humorous of those
who put us over the top--

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.460
we needed a 2/3
number in the Senate--

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.580
was Senator Hayakawa, a
conservative Republican

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.550
of California, who coined
the phrase, it's our canal,

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:48.550
we stole it fair and square.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:49.770
Hardly a likely vote.

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:54.040
So Mondale had worked with
Hayakawa in the Senate,

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.160
and knew he had, even my
senate terms, a very high ego.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.490
He puts him on the
phone with Carter.

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:02.240
And Carter says, what
can I do to convince

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.100
you to vote for this treaty?

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.388
And he said, don't talk
to me about the treaty.

00:36:06.388 --> 00:36:07.680
You know what I think about it.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.150
But if you'll let me
come every two weeks

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:15.060
and share my wisdom with
you, then I'll consider it.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.720
And Carter says, Senator,
only every two weeks?

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.340
I wouldn't want to
limit you to that.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.720
Flattered, he voted
for the treaty.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.012
And Carter never saw him again.

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.770
We also embraced human
rights for the Soviet Union,

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:29.660
applied it to their
soft underbelly,

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.660
championed the rights
of Soviet Jewry,

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.720
doubled the number of
Soviet Jews who emigrated.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.278
And according Natan
Sharansky, the leader

00:36:39.278 --> 00:36:40.820
of the Soviet Jewish
Movement, later,

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:44.810
the head of the Jewish Agency
and a cabinet minister, Carter

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:47.240
saved his life, he
said, by saying,

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:52.700
in the midst of his trial that
he, in fact, was not a US spy.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.885
And we applied hard power.

00:36:54.885 --> 00:36:57.260
This is, maybe, one of the
biggest surprises in the book.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:00.290
Carter is somehow viewed
as weak on defense.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:04.400
I assert in the book, backed
up by a very new Pentagon study

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:10.330
that's just come out, that all
of the weapons systems that

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:12.660
Reagan deployed-- and I
give him full credit for it,

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.890
the MX missile, and
the cruise missile,

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:16.793
and the stealth
bomber, and so forth,

00:37:16.793 --> 00:37:18.460
intermediate nuclear
weapons of Europe--

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.960
Carter green lighted.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.590
We reversed the post-Vietnam
decline in spending.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:28.100
And his finest hour, even
his conservative critics say,

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.350
his finest hour
was on Afghanistan.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:33.980
There's never an off
minute in the White House.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.610
Christmas, 1979, the
Soviets invade Afghanistan,

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:42.230
put their own puppet
on the throne.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:45.920
And Carter reacts with the
Carter Doctrine saying,

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.410
military force, if
you go any further,

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:52.100
we put a grain embargo to stop
any grain going to the Soviet

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.740
Union four weeks before
the Iowa caucuses,

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.200
where they happened to
grow a lot of grain.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:01.630
We put draft registration in for
young people, hardly popular.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:05.120
We armed the Mujahideen,
the opposition.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.500
And then, in one of the
most emotional things,

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:13.010
Moscow Olympics
were due in 1980,

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:16.550
this was very important
to their prestige,

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:18.830
and we announced we
were boycotting it.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:22.610
Just imagine, we get all the
Olympians into the White House.

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:25.460
These kids have trained
for four years to go.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.860
And we have to tell
them they can't.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:31.460
It was very tough.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:34.450
So just one or two last things.

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:39.570
China, Nixon and Kissinger
deserve all the credit.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:43.450
We normalized relations
with China not Nixon Ford,

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:46.090
because of the Taiwan lobby.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.060
We were successful.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:48.810
Deng Xiaoping comes
to the White House--

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:50.710
I was in the cabinet room--

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.090
all 4'11" of him.

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:57.040
He says to the president, thank
you for normalizing relations.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:02.190
What I really want is I want
the lowest tariff levels

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:04.067
you can give on your products.

00:39:04.067 --> 00:39:06.150
And he said, I know there
is a law, Jackson-Vanik,

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:08.880
which precludes it for
countries that bar immigration.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.530
But that's aimed at
the Soviet Union.

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:12.240
We don't.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.800
You write on this
piece of paper--

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.050
and he takes a little White
House notepad and pencil--

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:19.870
write on here the number of
Chinese you'd like us to take.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:21.410
Give you each year, a million?

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:22.688
10 million?

00:39:22.688 --> 00:39:24.730
And Carter twinkles and
says, I'll tell you what.

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.710
I'll take 10 million
Chinese a year

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.720
if you'll take 10,000
American journalists.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.450
Neither had to.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:36.550
So I'm going to conclude
by talking about Iran.

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:40.480
And then, hopefully, we'll get
into Ted Kennedy and Carter's

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.750
problems as a politician.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.160
But I want to conclude
with Iran because it

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.950
was the coup de grace that
did end the administration.

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:51.750
I don't think it's
fair to blame Carter

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.690
for the Iranian revolution,
for the Shaw's leaving,

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:56.640
any more than its fair
to blame Eisenhower

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.720
for the Cuban revolution 90
miles from our shore or Obama

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.940
for Mubarak being overthrown.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:06.210
But having said that, it's
the worst intelligence failure

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:08.550
in American history,
in my opinion.

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:14.640
The CIA had brought a Shah back
on the throne as a 21-year-old.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.740
Every president had given
him an open shopping list.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:21.860
And yet, they didn't realize
that his domestic support

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:25.170
rested on quicksand and
that, for five years,

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:28.940
he was getting secret
treatments for cancer.

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.990
The hostage crisis occurs.

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:33.630
And here, I'll double
back to John Kennedy.

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:37.940
I recommended-- and
this is one time I

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.310
wish he had followed my advice.

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:47.170
I advised a blockade
of Iran's harbors

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:50.230
to prevent the oil, which was
their lifeline, from going out.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:55.570
And I cited John Kennedy's
blockade of Cuba.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:41:01.730
Instead, the president has
the hostage families over,

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:03.500
pledges that he's going
to get their loved

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.290
ones out safe and
sound, which he does,

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:11.890
but only after 444
humiliating days.

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:13.750
He holds himself up
in the White House--

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:18.070
another mistake-- to show that
he's working full time on this,

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:21.830
doesn't campaign
against Kennedy.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:24.090
And he made himself the
hostage in the White House.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:26.160
He caused more press
attention to it.

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:30.330
Walter Cronkite ends every
news program, day 103, day 205,

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:32.760
day 307 of the hostage crisis.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.330
It was like a drop
of poison every day.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:42.230
And then the straw that broke
the camel's back, the failed

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.730
rescue mission at Desert One.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.590
People, again, say
it's Carter's weakness.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:47.150
He should have had
more helicopters.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.710
Not true.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:50.690
The military wanted six.

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:53.180
Carter added two
more for insurance.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:56.150
That was the maximum they could
fit under an aircraft carrier

00:41:56.150 --> 00:42:00.020
and avoid Soviet reconnaissance.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:00.710
It failed.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.770
Because everything
that could go wrong did

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:05.540
go wrong, including dust storms.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.540
But most fundamentally,
because, believe it or not,

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.230
there was no joint military
command for the four

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:16.120
military services
that had to cooperate,

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.680
and when the rotor blade
of one of the helicopters

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.710
hit the C130 cargo
plane full of fuel

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:27.370
to get the helicopters into
Tehran, it burst into flames.

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:29.250
Eight servicemen died.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:32.960
And it engulfed our
administration, as well.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.790
So again, we'll conclude.

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:37.360
I'll get some questions where
I can talk more about Carter

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.580
as a politician and Ted Kennedy.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:43.690
I'm not nominating Jimmy
Carter for Mount Rushmore

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:44.950
in this book.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:48.940
I am suggesting he
belongs in the foothills

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:52.000
with other presidents who
have made their country

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.660
and the world a better place.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:54.160
Thank you.

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.718
And again, I'll
look forward to--

00:42:55.718 --> 00:43:07.988
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:07.988 --> 00:43:09.780
MEREDITH EVANS: I
started out taking notes.

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.378
And then I realized I was
checking off the questions

00:43:12.378 --> 00:43:13.170
I was going to ask.

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:15.120
Because he answered them.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.890
Amazing, right?

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:19.380
You would think I would
learn, having spent time

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.710
with President Carter myself,
that they're well read

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:27.910
and take copious
notes, as you can see.

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:29.190
So just a few things.

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:32.180
You talked a lot already.

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:37.797
Could you speak more to
President Carter's foresight?

00:43:37.797 --> 00:43:40.380
We have one of the solar panels
that he put on the White House

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.880
in our library.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.060
And people are always
shocked to see it.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:49.020
So early to think
about solar panels.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:52.410
You talked about the diversity
in women and people of color

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:54.120
that he appointed.

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.860
What other things
can you think of?

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.622
There's health care.

00:43:58.622 --> 00:44:00.330
I don't think many
people know that there

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:02.400
was a universal
health care policy

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.530
that President
Carter and his team

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:06.360
were trying to
implement, as well.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.610
So could you just speak
to some of the things

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:13.450
that he's done that were
really before your time

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:14.260
during those years?

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:14.680
STUART EIZENSTAT: Sure.

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.790
So I'll mention that.

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:20.500
Then I'd like to get in
to Carter as a politician

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.460
and as a person.

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:24.450
Because I think it's very
important to understand that.

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:27.490
I do want to recognize, by
the way, a cousin, Harriet

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:31.210
and Jeff Brandt, who are here.

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:36.780
International Refugee Week
is going to be coming.

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:42.640
And just contrast that
with what we have today.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:48.570
1975, you remember the famous
picture of the US helicopter

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:55.240
leaving the US embassy in
Saigon, people hanging on?

00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:00.270
So the North Vietnamese
take over the whole country.

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:04.820
And anybody connected with the
south, directly or indirectly,

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.230
is, to say the least, at risk.

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:10.970
There's an enormous
outflow in the South China

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:14.180
Sea of boat people, the
original boat people

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:17.580
and they're sinking
in their craft.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.560
Mondale, in what
was his finest hour,

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.780
calls an international
convention,

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:27.160
reminds people of the
Evian Conference in '38

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.760
under Roosevelt, where Jews
were-- their death sentence

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:35.110
came then when no country would
lift its immigration quotas.

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:38.180
And he says that specifically.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:46.112
And we ended up taking 500,000
Vietnamese into this country.

00:45:46.112 --> 00:45:47.820
Carter orders the
Navy, which didn't want

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.910
to do it, to pick the
people up from the boats.

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:54.510
So at a time when
immigration and refugees are

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:58.371
so controversial, this
is something to remember.

00:45:58.371 --> 00:45:59.970
Now, this gets me to--

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:04.530
and again I want to talk
about Carter as a politician,

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:09.880
and then, hopefully, get into
the Ted Kennedy issue, which

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.450
we have to do at this library.

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:19.840
So Carter's great strength
was also his great weakness.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.310
He was a ferocious campaigner.

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:27.610
But he believed that, once
you were in the Oval Office,

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:30.660
you park politics at
the Oval Office door.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:34.380
And you did, quote,
unquote, "the right thing."

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:36.630
And that's why he was able
to do so many of the things

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.060
I mentioned that were
politically unpopular.

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.350
Panama was terrible.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:44.010
I mean, Rosalynn begged
him not to do it,

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:45.360
and the Middle East, and energy.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.120
These were all political losers.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.410
But it was also a weakness.

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:53.880
Because a president is not
just commander in chief.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.680
He has to be
politician in chief.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.050
He has to nurture his base.

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:01.030
He has to keep his party
behind him, something

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:03.230
that Trump does very well.

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:05.730
And Carter lost his party.

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:08.430
He ended up being too
conservative for the liberals

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:11.180
and too liberal for
the conservatives.

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:15.660
And so, when Ted Kennedy
ran against him--

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:19.840
it's, again, one of those
I's, inter-party warfare.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.750
And permit me just to
talk a minute about this.

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:26.660
Because it's a very
important piece of the book.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:29.660
And one can hardly
not talk about it

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.930
when Ted's papers
are here, when he's

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:36.138
got an institute a
stone's throw from here.

00:47:36.138 --> 00:47:38.180
But if you want to go into
something else first--

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:38.972
MEREDITH EVANS: No.

00:47:38.972 --> 00:47:41.400
I'd like you-- let's lead into--

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.580
talk about the
health care policies

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.530
that President Carter was--

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:47.447
STUART EIZENSTAT: Well,
the health care policy

00:47:47.447 --> 00:47:48.860
is at the center of Ted's run.

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:54.310
I want to say, by the way,
that I am the only Carter

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:59.710
aide Ted asked to be
interviewed for his archives.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:02.760
So here's the story.

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.550
Ted Kennedy had one
of the highest support

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:11.000
rankings of any senator
for our legislation.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.650
We wouldn't have gotten
airline deregulation

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:18.520
passed without him.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:21.220
After the election,
we win six states

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:23.860
and the District of Columbia.

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:27.060
Ted calls up and
says, Stu, there's

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:31.080
a vacancy on the First Circuit
Court of Appeals in Boston.

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.743
You know what Stephen
Breyer has done

00:48:33.743 --> 00:48:35.160
working with you
and the president

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:38.370
on airline deregulation,
a professor at Harvard.

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:39.780
And I said, Ted,
the only problem

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:42.390
is, there are two
insurmountable hurdles.

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:43.040
What are those?

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.900
The first is, Carter
has no love lost

00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:47.807
because you ran against him.

00:48:47.807 --> 00:48:48.640
And he said, I know.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.820
That's why I'm calling
you and not the president.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.260
He said, what's the other one?

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.340
Think of Merrick Garland.

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.268
I said, Ted, we lost the Senate.

00:49:00.268 --> 00:49:02.560
Strom Thurmond's going to be
the chairman of the Senate

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.393
Judiciary Committee.

00:49:03.393 --> 00:49:05.710
Why wouldn't he wait
two and a half months

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:08.860
'til Reagan's in office
and appoint a conservative?

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.410
You take care of Carter.

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:11.410
I'll take care of Strom.

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:13.660
I go into Carter with one
of my legal [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.610
I got 10 reasons why he
should appoint Steve.

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:17.380
I said, don't ask me who asked.

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:18.560
But you should appoint him.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.330
You remember what he said.

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:19.580
Yeah.

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:20.372
It'll be a tribute.

00:49:20.372 --> 00:49:21.130
OK.

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:22.630
Call Ted, I've done my part.

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:24.100
How about yours?

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:26.677
Strom's in my pocket.

00:49:26.677 --> 00:49:27.510
I said, how is that?

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:29.880
You guys are
political opposites.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.850
He said, well, Steve has
breakfast every morning

00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:33.720
with Emory Sneeden.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.010
They work things out
on a bipartisan basis.

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:39.560
Ted Kennedy was incredible.

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.742
We had nominated Steve
to the first circuit.

00:49:41.742 --> 00:49:43.700
He wouldn't be on the
Supreme Court without it.

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:48.380
He passed unanimously in a lame
duck session with a lame duck

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.460
president.

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:54.820
OK, now, Ted's number
one goal, from the day

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:58.660
he came into the Senate
to the day he died,

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.120
was health care, national
health insurance.

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.420
He had gone through so many
iterations, Kennedy-Mills,

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.460
Kennedy-Corman, et cetera.

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:10.030
We pledged to support health
care in the '76 campaign.

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:13.210
But Carter didn't want that
to be the first thing out

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:17.380
of the box because it was so
difficult, and so complex,

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:19.300
and so costly.

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:22.960
So we negotiated with
Ted for two years.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.340
I personally negotiated with
him for weeks in his Senate

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:29.050
and his Capital office.

00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:35.130
And we reached an agreement
on a multi-phased program.

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:38.850
Ted moved off of his
single-payer-- sound familiar--

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:42.600
single payer
program and accepted

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:46.840
our concept of
employer-paid premiums

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.590
and expansion of
Medicaid, covering

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:50.630
young kids and the elderly.

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:54.030
Almost exactly
what Obamacare is.

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:56.660
And we agreed that it
would be phased in.

00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:00.790
Ted agreed to the entire thing.

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:04.740
And then, at the last second,
labor put pressure on him

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:05.890
to take a single payer.

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:07.150
It collapsed.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:11.540
20 years later, it took 20
years to get health insurance.

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:15.080
And he said to one of
his aides, and quote her

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:20.380
in the book, "after
another failed attempt,

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:22.810
where's the Carter Bill
when we really need it?"

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:27.650
Now, you have to understand
the intensity of the opposition

00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:31.210
that Ted brought
to this challenge.

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:33.550
We beat him two to
one in delegates

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:36.560
going into the convention.

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:39.490
He tried to get the Rules
Committee to support

00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:42.130
a so-called open
convention, meaning

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:44.440
that the delegates
who were pledged

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.620
to abide by the results of
their primaries and caucuses

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:50.980
would be open to vote
for whoever they wanted.

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:53.480
The chairman of
the Rules Committee

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:56.530
was Senator Danny
Inouye, who had--

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:59.150
representing Hawaii,
Japanese-American,

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:01.460
family interred in
California during the war,

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:04.400
looses an arm in Italy
fighting in a war.

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.250
And he says to us, after
the Rules Committee,

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:12.150
this is the most angry,
sweat-laden meeting

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:14.480
I've been in since the war.

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.660
There are over 50
minority planks,

00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:21.020
including health insurance, on
the floor of the convention.

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:25.700
Instead of reconciling
after the convention,

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:29.010
he gives this speech, stealing
the soul of the convention,

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:31.110
the dream will never die.

00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:35.280
He doesn't give the
traditional handshake.

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:38.520
And so we went into
the general election

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.020
hobbled with a divided party.

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.550
Would we have lost anyway?

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:45.220
Maybe, maybe because of Iran,
maybe because inflation.

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:48.540
But I can tell you that we
were substantially weakened.

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:50.175
It's something I've
never understood.

00:52:50.175 --> 00:52:52.050
Ted and I had a great
relationship through it

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:54.000
all and afterward.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.900
But it's something that
history has to explain.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.250
MEREDITH EVANS: So you
talked about President Carter

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:05.380
as a politician and versus
himself, how he normally is,

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:07.460
with his value system.

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.660
The two are kind
of one in the same.

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:12.310
He's a very humble person.

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:13.750
He has a strong value system.

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:16.480
And he leads in
what he believes.

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:21.530
If he's able to
unite global leaders,

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:24.200
what was the challenge with
uniting within the party?

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.200
STUART EIZENSTAT: That's
a really good question.

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:30.680
I mean, he did so much better
in international affairs,

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:35.160
not just Camp David,
not just China,

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:39.260
but so many other major
achievements abroad that I

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:42.980
mention in the book,
including what's known--

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.380
by a Harvard
professor, by the way,

00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:48.410
Robert Putnam from
the Kennedy School--

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:52.820
as the single best
economic summit in history,

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:57.540
the Bonn Summit, where we got
all the countries to agree

00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:58.780
to stimulate their economies.

00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:01.180
We got the trade round
done, and so forth.

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:04.050
So what was the difference?

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.810
And the difference
goes to Carter.

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:11.080
And again, it's his uniqueness,
his strength, and his weakness.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.960
He has a very
strong moral streak.

00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:19.060
One of the things a
President has to do

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.620
is, when he proposes
legislation, and if he's lucky,

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.340
he gets half of it back.

00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:26.520
Say it's the best thing
since sliced bread.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:30.850
As Bob Strauss once said,
making lemonade out of a lemon.

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:32.590
Carter never could do that.

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:35.960
He would always focus on
what hadn't been done.

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:39.980
Compromise was very difficult.
He had a strong morality.

00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:43.100
He saw something that
needed to be done.

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.740
He proposed something.

00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:46.670
And when other people
didn't see it that way,

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:49.910
and they wanted a local
dam built, or a highway,

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:53.990
or bridge in return for a vote,
it rankled the hell out of him.

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:57.350
And he had difficulty doing it.

00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:59.240
Again, it's a highly
political office.

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.740
And you have to be
willing to do it.

00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:04.490
Not withstanding that,
because of his vision,

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:05.870
and because of
his determination,

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:08.000
we got 70% passed.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.050
But it always was done in
a difficult and almost ugly

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:15.080
fashion, with it making look
like he was being dragged

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:16.970
to the altar rather
than dragging

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:18.930
the members of Congress there.

00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:20.900
MEREDITH EVANS: So talk
about his first 100

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:24.410
days as president.

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:30.380
He basically reorganized
several, if not all,

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:32.977
departments in many ways.

00:55:32.977 --> 00:55:34.310
What was the struggle with that?

00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:36.140
If you're saying
that his morality is

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:39.940
sort of his weakness, right, and
there's challenges with that,

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:43.040
is that part of the
100 days of his?

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:48.630
STUART EIZENSTAT: So he made
a very critical decision.

00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:53.040
On December 9th, 1976,
after the election,

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:57.200
during the transition,
before he's inaugurated,

00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:02.290
he misread the
lessons of Watergate.

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:06.020
H.R. Haldeman was
Nixon's chief of staff.

00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:07.320
He was awful.

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.860
He kept everybody away.

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:12.460
He isolated Nixon.

00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:15.780
And Carter said, I'm
not going to have that.

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:18.570
And so he allowed five
or six of his top aides,

00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:22.890
myself included, to have
equal access to him,

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:25.940
with no chief of staff.

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:29.240
And it was called, after
Jack Kennedy, that's

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:31.730
the way Kennedy initially
organized his White House,

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:34.730
called the spokes of the
wheel, with the president

00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:37.550
at the center, and
five or six spokes.

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:42.530
OK, now, Ford had tried
to do the same thing.

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:44.210
He was a congressman.

00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:46.520
He comes into the office
after the resignation.

00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:49.660
And he organizes
it the same way.

00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:56.380
And I have, in my interview with
Dick Cheney, a disaster, chaos,

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:58.120
nobody setting priorities.

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:05.960
And after a couple of months,
he appoints first Rumsfeld, then

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.940
Cheney as chief of
staff, to bring order,

00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:09.457
to bring priorities.

00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:17.770
And Cheney says that,
after they lost,

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:21.010
the Ford White House staff
does a roast for him.

00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:23.470
And they give him, as
a going away present,

00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:28.180
a huge plaque with a
broken bicycle wheel saying

00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:30.610
"don't do the spokes
of the wheel."

00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:33.490
And he leaves it in
Ham Jordan's office,

00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:35.230
when Carter comes in,
with a note saying,

00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:36.740
don't repeat our mistakes.

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:38.080
We did.

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.810
And so the problem
with the first 100 days

00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:42.430
is there weren't any priorities.

00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:46.560
There was welfare reform, tax
reform, reorganization, Panama,

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.990
the SALT nuclear treaty,
energy legislation,

00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:53.020
too much for Congress to digest.

00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:54.310
No priorities were set.

00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:57.700
I mean, Tip O'Neill,
of course, from Boston,

00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:00.100
would beg him at the
leadership breakfasts,

00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:02.410
tell us what your
priorities are.

00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:04.480
We can't handle all of this.

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.800
So that's another thing.

00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.600
We got so much back.

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.540
But compared to
what we brought in,

00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:13.270
it looked like it
was chicken feed.

00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.780
It wasn't.

00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:14.770
It was huge.

00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:16.220
But we just proposed too much.

00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:17.950
And again, it was
a serious mistake.

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:20.530
It was two and a
half years before he

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:22.142
appointed a chief of staff.

00:58:22.142 --> 00:58:23.290
MEREDITH EVANS: Yeah.

00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:26.200
They also say that
he reads everything.

00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:28.240
And I can attest to that.

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.722
He reads a lot.

00:58:29.722 --> 00:58:32.180
And when you're president, and
don't have a chief of staff,

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:33.275
that's not consumable.

00:58:33.275 --> 00:58:34.150
STUART EIZENSTAT: No.

00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:36.150
You have nobody to--

00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:40.840
I mean, look,
Carter, like I did,

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:43.180
took the Evelyn Woods
Reading Dynamics Course.

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:44.290
He was a speed reader.

00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:45.760
And he is a speed reader.

00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.670
He has a voracious
interest in everything.

00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:54.040
And it was a fault, for sure,
it was a fault, for sure,

00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:57.605
that he would take our
decision memoranda, which

00:58:57.605 --> 00:59:00.640
I would help prepare,
and he would always

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:05.220
ask for the appendices
and more information.

00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:08.490
He would bring back
some of my memos

00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:12.540
with misspellings and
punctuation marks.

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:16.590
And I used to think that it
was terrible for a president

00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:18.600
to get too much information.

00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:22.459
Now, I think it's a lot better
than getting no information.

00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:30.830
MEREDITH EVANS: To this
day, he still does that.

00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:33.610
He corrects memos.

00:59:33.610 --> 00:59:39.120
I've had one of those typos
circled on me, before.

00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:42.530
So let's go back, all the
way to the '76 campaign.

00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:44.090
Did you work on that campaign?

00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:44.640
Or did you--

00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:45.598
STUART EIZENSTAT: Yeah.

00:59:45.598 --> 00:59:47.090
So this is a good example--

00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:48.150
I did.

00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:51.800
It's a good example to young
people, and maybe to all of us,

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.330
that sometimes, you
should follow your heart

00:59:54.330 --> 00:59:56.510
and not your head.

00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:59.910
So I graduated from
Harvard Law School.

00:59:59.910 --> 01:00:03.330
I go into the Johnson
White House for a year.

01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:05.670
I left because he decided
not to run for re-election.

01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:09.210
My office is next to Humphrey's
office and the Executive Office

01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:10.560
Building.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.200
I knew the Humphrey staff.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.970
I had joined Humphrey's staff
as his research director

01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:18.190
from the first to the
last day against Nixon.

01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:18.790
He loses.

01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:21.250
I go back to Atlanta,
clerk for a federal judge.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:25.680
And I make a beeline for
the office of Carl Sanders,

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:28.730
who had been the
governor before ,

01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:32.540
had parlayed that into a
very successful law practice.

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:37.210
I come in as an Atlanta
native, and so forth.

01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:40.800
And I said, Governor-- he
couldn't succeed himself

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.990
immediately under the
Georgia constitution.

01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:45.690
But he could run for a
second term after four years.

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:48.000
So he was the odds-on favorite.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.150
And I said, look, I'm
an Atlanta native,

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:52.140
a high school All-American,
Grady High School,

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:54.060
and Harvard Law School,
and the White House,

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.320
and Humphrey, and all that.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:58.800
And I'd like to volunteer
for your campaign staff

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.510
when you formally announce.

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:02.130
And he sort of gave a nod.

01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:03.743
Now, what did you need me for?

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:04.910
He was the odds-on favorite.

01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:06.702
He had all the money,
sumptuous law office,

01:01:06.702 --> 01:01:08.070
double breasted suit.

01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:11.520
And then my high school
classmate, Henry Bower,

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.090
says, you ought to go see
this state senator who's

01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:16.300
running for governor.

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.790
He's lost one since in '66.

01:01:18.790 --> 01:01:19.660
He's running again.

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:20.160
I said, no.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:20.790
I can't do it.

01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:23.550
I mean, I've already
committed to Carl Sanders.

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:28.140
And he bugs me so much that I
go to see Carter in a office

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:31.050
building right opposite the
federal courthouse in Atlanta.

01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:34.680
And it's the exact opposite
of this sumptuous law office.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:38.940
I'm not exaggerating, there
is a aluminum folding table

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:41.220
with two folding chairs.

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:45.360
And Carter, not in a
tie and sumptuous suit,

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:50.040
but in work boots with khaki
slacks and a work shirt.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.410
And he starts talking to me.

01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:56.760
And I am entranced, not
just because he's handsome,

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.820
but because here's someone from
the deepest part of the Deep

01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:01.320
South.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:04.500
You have to go to
Plains, Georgia,

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:10.890
this gnat-infested place of
500 people, to understand.

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:14.560
No traffic lights, then or now.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.380
But he understands urban issues.

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:21.220
He's going to come out, as
gubernatorial candidate,

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:24.880
in favor of mass
transit for Atlanta,

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:27.580
in favor of reorganizing
the state government,

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:32.500
in favor of education, and,
this was the key thing for me,

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:35.980
in favor of civil rights.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:39.130
At his inauguration, he says,
the time for discrimination

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:40.180
is over.

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:44.200
Still, I felt, OK, I got
a commitment to Sanders.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.763
He calls me back a second
time, and then, again, I

01:02:47.763 --> 01:02:49.180
followed my heart
and not my head.

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:51.430
Because my head would have
said, go with the favorite.

01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:55.940
I became his policy director
as a gubernatorial candidate,

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:59.360
his policy director as
president, his domestic advisor

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.470
after that.

01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:03.410
So, again, sometimes
you should follow

01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:05.867
your instincts and your
heart and not your head.

01:03:05.867 --> 01:03:08.450
MEREDITH EVANS: What things were
different about that governor

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:11.960
campaign versus
running for president?

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.942
Did he change in any way?

01:03:14.942 --> 01:03:16.400
STUART EIZENSTAT:
He had to change.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.680
Because, when he
ran for governor,

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:23.950
he went to every one
of the 159 counties.

01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:27.640
Georgia is the second-largest
state, geographically, east

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.050
of the Mississippi.

01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:33.860
Every single state,
tireless campaigner.

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:38.240
Now, that also was true
when he ran for president,

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:41.320
but with some
important exceptions.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:45.650
Ham Jordan wrote a 74-page,
single-spaced memorandum

01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:48.890
of how to take this
unknown Georgia governor

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:50.570
and make him president.

01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:53.870
He goes on What's My Line, OK?

01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:55.710
Remember the program,
What's My Line?

01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:59.270
And nobody guesses that he's
the governor of Georgia.

01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:01.490
So, I mean, he starts with
zero name recognition.

01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:07.070
He spends 100 days campaigning
before the Iowa caucuses,

01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:10.580
understanding as Ham did,
and the other candidates

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:15.450
who were better known didn't,
that if you win that caucus,

01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:18.450
it's a catapult
for New Hampshire.

01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:21.490
And you know how he won the
caucus, beside 100 votes,

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:23.010
100 times there?

01:04:23.010 --> 01:04:27.390
Because every president
who's successful,

01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:29.490
every president
who's successful,

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:32.910
understands the mood of
the public at that moment.

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:35.820
It may be different four years
before and four years hence.

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:39.000
And he understood that even
democratic voters didn't

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.970
want a renewed Great Society.

01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:44.760
They wanted to remove
the stain of Watergate.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:48.850
They wanted an outsider
of high morals and ethics.

01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:49.900
OK.

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:56.980
Then we win with 27%
of the vote in Iowa.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:58.810
Bayh, who just
died, unfortunately,

01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:04.150
a great man, 13%, Mo
Udall, 10%, undecided, 60%.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:06.730
Headline, "Carter Wins Iowa."

01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:09.437
And then it was on to New
Hampshire, and so forth.

01:05:09.437 --> 01:05:11.020
But when you're
running for president,

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:13.350
you cannot go everywhere.

01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:15.540
You've got to start
speaking more broadly.

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:17.160
You've got to pick your places.

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.810
You've got to pick your issues.

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:20.730
And you've got to
pick your message.

01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:24.750
If the message is too
diffuse, you lose.

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:28.790
We had three debates with Ford.

01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:32.540
And those were decisive,
particularly the second debate,

01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:35.300
on foreign policy, where
Carter, the supposed novice

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:40.070
against the 25-year
veteran, Gerald Ford.

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:42.620
And Ford has asked
the basic question

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:45.260
by Max Frankel from
The New York Times,

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:52.460
Mr. President, some
of your top aides

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:57.730
seem to talk about the Soviet
influence in Eastern Europe.

01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:02.290
Says Ford, the Soviets
don't occupy Eastern Europe.

01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:05.360
They don't control
Eastern Europe.

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.350
That was decisive.

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:10.400
Carter turns and says, tell
that to the Czech-Americans,

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:14.270
and the Hungarian-Americans,
and the people whose families

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:16.040
are behind the Iron Curtain?

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.150
It took away all of
Ford's advantage.

01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:20.290
And it was very decisive.

01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:24.580
Now, one last thing, we come
out of the Democratic Convention

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:29.390
with a 30-point lead over Ford.

01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:31.000
30 point lead!

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.720
OK, it was inflated
a little bit,

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.540
in the sense that, after
conventions, you get a boost.

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:36.890
But 30%!

01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:41.630
We lost all but a half of 1%.

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:42.450
Why?

01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:46.610
And this is decisive for him
going into the White House.

01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:50.030
He campaigned as an
outsider, as a new Democrat,

01:06:50.030 --> 01:06:51.920
as a different Democrat.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:56.410
And when he gets the
nomination in New York,

01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:58.870
and all the barnacles
of the party, the labor

01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:01.510
movement, and all the
others, latch onto him,

01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:03.010
and he starts to
take on those-- he

01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:05.950
becomes like a
traditional Democrat.

01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:08.290
He called it, in one of
the interviews that I had,

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:10.170
an albatross around his neck.

01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:12.430
And so he was never
quite comfortable

01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:15.910
in the skin of a traditional
Democrat, as Ted was,

01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:16.535
of course.

01:07:16.535 --> 01:07:17.410
MEREDITH EVANS: Yeah.

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:18.460
I can see that.

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:20.860
I think part of that campaign,
it was a family affair.

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:22.152
His son's campaigned.

01:07:22.152 --> 01:07:23.110
Mrs. Carter campaigned.

01:07:23.110 --> 01:07:24.790
STUART EIZENSTAT: Well,
you had the peanut brigade.

01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:26.890
You had Dot Padgett with
the peanut brigade going

01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:28.750
into New Hampshire,
with hundreds

01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:30.290
of people, and
his family, going.

01:07:30.290 --> 01:07:32.290
MEREDITH EVANS: There's
some serious differences

01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:33.280
between then and now.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.380
I think about President
Carter's relationship

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.438
with Ford was very amicable.

01:07:37.438 --> 01:07:38.980
How much do you
think it cost for him

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:41.580
to campaign for president?

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:45.310
STUART EIZENSTAT: So
Carter spent, and Ford,

01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:50.865
under the checkoff system
then in place, $20 million.

01:07:50.865 --> 01:07:53.420
$20 million for a
presidential campaign.

01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:55.250
I mean, you can't
run the first week

01:07:55.250 --> 01:08:00.440
of a congressional campaign
for $20 million dollars.

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:04.370
It's changed so much with
the money in politics.

01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:07.940
I do want to give you one
anecdote from the campaign.

01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:11.270
Because my book really has
wonderful profiles of people

01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:13.760
who could, kind of, out
of a Shakespearean play,

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.310
the sort of heroic, and the
tragic, and the humorous,

01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:18.800
and the villainous,
and one, who,

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.649
you have to understand to
understand Jimmy Carter,

01:08:21.649 --> 01:08:23.660
is his mother, Miss Lillian.

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:28.840
So in her 20s, she is
a registered nurse.

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:33.040
She takes care of black
and white patients,

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.200
never done at that
time, gets paid

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.540
in chickens and vegetables.

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:41.830
At age 68, goes into the
Peace Corps in India,

01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:44.979
and has a luminescent smile.

01:08:44.979 --> 01:08:49.783
And she becomes, of course,
during his campaign in '76,

01:08:49.783 --> 01:08:50.950
one of his chief supporters.

01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:54.560
So a reporter comes
down from New York

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:59.630
to quiz her about
her son's slogan,

01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:01.213
"I'll never lie to you."

01:09:01.213 --> 01:09:03.380
And this New York reporter
comes to planes and says,

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:06.200
now, come on Miss
Lillian, you must know,

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:13.040
as his mother, that he must have
lied all the time growing up.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:16.735
Honey, he told white
lies all the time.

01:09:16.735 --> 01:09:19.520
Well, what do you mean by
a white lie, Miss Lillian?

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:22.010
Well, you know how I said
it was wonderful to have you

01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:24.944
down here from New York to
Plains, that was a white lie.

01:09:24.944 --> 01:09:31.082
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:31.082 --> 01:09:33.040
MEREDITH EVANS: So I have
a poster in my office

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.210
from the campaign.

01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:38.710
And it says, "there's a
simple and effective way

01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:41.950
for public officials
to regain public trust.

01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:43.960
And that's to be trustworthy."

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:48.550
And you talked a lot about
President Carter's morality.

01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:50.649
We know that he's very
connected to his family.

01:09:50.649 --> 01:09:55.190
And that transcends
into his leadership.

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:57.430
Can you say a little
bit, before we open it up

01:09:57.430 --> 01:10:01.030
for questions from the audience,
about the boat-lift in 1980,

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.860
a little bit more,
how that speaks

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:09.030
to his humanitarian-ness,
his civil rights?

01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:11.860
That's his legacy, even
through the Carter Center,

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:16.120
his desire for people to have
housing, and food, and just

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:20.843
basic needs, and a place to
rebuild their lives, right?

01:10:20.843 --> 01:10:21.760
STUART EIZENSTAT: Yes.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.970
And this, also, we can
talk about it, perhaps,

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:25.595
in questions from
the audience, to hear

01:10:25.595 --> 01:10:27.210
about the Palestinian
issue, too.

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:33.730
So here's, again, someone coming
from the most conservative part

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:34.680
of the Deep South.

01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:43.170
His playmates, but
not his classmates,

01:10:43.170 --> 01:10:45.680
were African-Americans.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.690
Sumter County is 2/3 black.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:53.620
So he would play
stickball with them.

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:56.360
And then they would go
their separate ways.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.140
And he told me, in
one of the interviews,

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:02.250
that one of the
formative things for him

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:06.520
is that he goes into the
Navy, into the nuclear Navy.

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.460
The only major argument
he and Rosalynn had,

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:13.330
I think, in 72 years, after
his father contracts cancer,

01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:16.390
he decides to leave a
very promising career

01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:18.940
as a nuclear submarine
officer and come back

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.930
to this little hamlet.

01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:23.410
That's the last thing
that Rosalynn wanted.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:29.780
And his first elected office
is to Sumter County Board

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:30.740
of Education.

01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:34.270
And he tells me this anecdote.

01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:37.170
He starts to-- this is during
the separate but equal period,

01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:37.670
right?

01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:40.670
Separate but equal schools.

01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:46.130
So he starts touring the black
schools in Sumter County.

01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:49.970
And he says, I find,
first, the black students

01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:53.240
have either no books or just
broken and discarded books.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:58.070
And second, the desks that
teenage high school students

01:11:58.070 --> 01:12:02.820
are supposed to sit at
are four five-year-olds.

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:05.165
It was really something
emblazoned in his mind.

01:12:05.165 --> 01:12:06.540
It's, again, why
he said, when he

01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:09.260
was in his inaugural
speech as governor,

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:11.460
the time for
discrimination is over.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:15.390
It's why he became a great civil
rights champion as president,

01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:19.920
supporting affirmative action,
against his southern base,

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.928
I mean, against
his southern base.

01:12:22.928 --> 01:12:25.470
So this, I mean, this, to me,
was one of the most important--

01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:28.790
and then, you mentioned,
again, the boatlift

01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:30.040
and the Human Rights Campaign.

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.200
It was all part of this.

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:35.760
Human rights, to him, were
a foreign policy equivalent

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:39.350
of civil rights at home.

01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:41.170
Just that direct equation.

01:12:41.170 --> 01:12:43.780
Now, look, there were
times you couldn't

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:46.170
apply human rights abroad.

01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:49.290
We gave the Shah,
largely, a pass.

01:12:49.290 --> 01:12:50.660
We did.

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:54.350
I mean, you can't apply it
everywhere in every occasion.

01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:57.540
But it was a centerpiece
of his foreign policy.

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.210
And again, for him,
it was the opposite.

01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:02.000
And we could talk
about this longer.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.095
This is where his view
on the Palestinians come.

01:13:05.095 --> 01:13:07.520
MEREDITH EVANS: Yeah.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:09.700
Are there mics?

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:12.340
So I'm sure there's some
questions, although he answered

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:14.680
probably most of them already.

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.000
He's very good at that.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.190
There are some mics, I
think, in the aisles.

01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:18.940
It's hard to see.

01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:19.940
Yep, mics in the aisles.

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:26.760
So if anybody has a question,
this is a good time.

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.950
STUART EIZENSTAT: If
there are no questions,

01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:29.940
I'm leaving right now.

01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:31.490
I mean, there've
got to be questions.

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:31.990
OK.

01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:33.560
AUDIENCE: I have one.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.770
MEREDITH EVANS: Yes.

01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:35.620
AUDIENCE: Is this--

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.383
MEREDITH EVANS: It's on.

01:13:37.383 --> 01:13:38.800
AUDIENCE: So I
just had a question

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.070
about another humanitarian,
Eleanor Roosevelt,

01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:49.660
who, in 1977, if I'm
correct, he made Val-Kill

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:55.210
into a national park, the
only national park dedicated

01:13:55.210 --> 01:13:57.160
to a first lady.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.280
I wanted to find out what
the background was for that,

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:02.570
and how it all transpired?

01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:03.070
Thank you.

01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:04.237
STUART EIZENSTAT: Thank you.

01:14:04.237 --> 01:14:04.900
Thank you.

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:09.560
So the relationship
with Eleanor Roosevelt

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.690
really came through Rosalynn.

01:14:11.690 --> 01:14:17.430
Because Rosalynn emulated her
role as First Lady from hers.

01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:24.180
And here, again, I have a
long profile of Rosalynn.

01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:28.410
She was so shy when he was
first running for governor,

01:14:28.410 --> 01:14:32.370
she literally could
not speak on a podium.

01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:34.590
And she comes into
the White House.

01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:37.500
And she blossoms like
a beautiful flower.

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:42.120
She becomes only the
second first lady

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:46.120
next to Eleanor Roosevelt
to testify in Congress

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:47.960
on her own bill,
which she drafted,

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:50.700
the Humane Mental Health Bill.

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:53.910
She attends cabinet meetings.

01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:57.690
She becomes a political partner.

01:14:57.690 --> 01:15:01.140
The president, like
Eleanor, was for FDR.

01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:06.090
So it was really
her relationship

01:15:06.090 --> 01:15:08.100
with Eleanor's memory.

01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:11.370
And one of the reasons why
Carter was such a feminist--

01:15:11.370 --> 01:15:15.360
and I use that term advisedly--
in terms of appointing women

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.510
and so forth to
non-traditional positions,

01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:23.540
like assistant secretary
of defense, OK,

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:26.860
was, in part,
because of Rosalynn.

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:31.080
And this is what-- it
just bothers me so much.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:34.800
Look, I've told you very
frankly his limitations

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.100
as a politician.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:41.570
But he was a great
man in his vision.

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:45.500
And his party abandoned
him as well as he not

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.270
get his party together.

01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:50.070
So this goes to the women,
and to Eleanor Roosevelt.

01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:51.710
He appoints all these women.

01:15:51.710 --> 01:15:55.520
He appoints the first
presidential commission

01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:00.740
on the status of women, headed
by Bella Abzug, remember her?

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:03.620
And she walks off the
commission because he's not

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:06.050
funding some of the
social programs enough

01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:08.680
and campaigns against him.

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:11.690
Labor, we raised
the minimum wage,

01:16:11.690 --> 01:16:14.410
we create 10 million jobs.

01:16:14.410 --> 01:16:17.230
He comes from a right-to-work,
non-union state,

01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:24.170
and he supports labor law reform
to make it easier to organize.

01:16:24.170 --> 01:16:26.870
We have jobs programs,
youth employment programs.

01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:30.390
Labor backs Kennedy and not us.

01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:34.410
Same with the Jewish Community,
Camp David, and the piece,

01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:37.270
we break the back
of the Arab boycott.

01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:40.490
He's the father of the US
Holocaust Memorial Museum,

01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:46.310
the father of the museum,
the presidential commission,

01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:48.500
Soviet Jewish emigration.

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.320
And the only good thing to
come out of Iran, beside,

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.850
finally getting
the hostages out,

01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:56.840
we saved 50,000
Iranian Jews, refugees,

01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:00.710
by bending the visa laws,
frankly, and getting them out

01:17:00.710 --> 01:17:03.800
of Tehran, and allowing those
who were in and would have been

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:06.200
subject to our executive
order expelling

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.350
Iranians in the United States
out of the hostage crisis.

01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:12.890
And yet, he gets the lowest
percentage of Jewish votes

01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:17.840
of any Democratic president or
candidate in modern times, 40%.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:20.550
For God's sake,
McGovern gets 70%.

01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:22.070
That's, again, another story.

01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:25.550
But in any event, the point
is that Eleanor Roosevelt was

01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:30.318
a great figure for Rosalynn.

01:17:30.318 --> 01:17:32.110
MEREDITH EVANS: I'm so
happy you said that.

01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:33.660
I think Rosalynn
Carter's probably

01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:35.320
one of the best first ladies.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.020
Ever she's the best-kept
secret, in many ways.

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:39.520
So--

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:41.920
STUART EIZENSTAT: She
was, in some respects,

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.060
a tougher politician.

01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:44.530
I mean, I mentioned Panama.

01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:47.560
She said, Jimmy,
don't do Panama.

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:49.030
It's electric.

01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:51.940
Every president going back
to LBJ has tried to do it.

01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:53.960
And they've dropped it.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.860
Wait 'til your second term.

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:58.017
And he said, suppose I
don't have a second term.

01:17:58.017 --> 01:18:00.350
MEREDITH EVANS: She was also
good on the campaign trail.

01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:02.267
They would ask her about
her favorite recipes.

01:18:02.267 --> 01:18:03.980
And she'd say, I'm
not here for that.

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:06.500
I'm here to talk politics.

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:07.070

Carter by marriage.

And I appreciate Jimmy Carter.

01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:21.860
Because he's that
champion of human rights.

01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:30.080
I belong to his library
and museum in Atlanta.

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:34.680
And I don't know if many
people know all the things

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:40.280
that Jimmy Carter did in favor
of for the people in Africa.

01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:45.390

01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:48.080
Now, you were an advisor.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:51.440
Were you an advisor during
the political campaign?

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:56.115
Or all after President
Carter was elected?

01:18:56.115 --> 01:18:58.490
STUART EIZENSTAT: I'm not sure
I understood her question?

01:18:58.490 --> 01:19:00.290
MEREDITH EVANS: So
is your question--

01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:02.090
AUDIENCE: Is, if
he was an advisor

01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:06.110
to the political
campaign in 1976?

01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:09.605
MEREDITH EVANS: Were you
an advisor and in '76?

01:19:09.605 --> 01:19:10.880
to President Carter?

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.950
STUART EIZENSTAT: Yes,
yes, the whole time, sure.

01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:14.990
AUDIENCE: Because one
of the winning cards--

01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:16.700
STUART EIZENSTAT: But I mean,
if you're talking about Africa--

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:18.230
are you talking about Africa?

01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:21.227
AUDIENCE: Well, I was talking
about work he's doing today.

01:19:21.227 --> 01:19:22.060
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:26.030
--all over the years,
after the presidency.

01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:28.550
But what I'm asking
you is, if you

01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:34.480
were his advisor during his
political campaign in 1976?

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.230
STUART EIZENSTAT: Yes.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.820
AUDIENCE: One of
the winning cards--

01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:41.210
because President
Carter has been, always,

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:45.890
against the abuse of people,
in favor of human rights.

01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:49.310
One of the winning
cards the last debate

01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:53.660
with Gerald Ford, who is,
today, the only president who

01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:56.630
was never elected
by the Americans,

01:19:56.630 --> 01:20:00.590
was the question that
Carter asked Ford

01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:03.940
about the involvement
of the United States

01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:07.700
with the coupe in
Chile, with Pinochet.

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:08.900
Ford didn't know how to--

01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:11.450
STUART EIZENSTAT: Ma'am,
you've talked a long time.

01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:12.030
So let me--

01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:12.950
MEREDITH EVANS: So
is your question--

01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:14.617
STUART EIZENSTAT:
What is your question?

01:20:14.617 --> 01:20:16.750
AUDIENCE: Oh, the
question is, are you aware

01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:22.400
that one of the winning
cards for President Carter

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:29.120
was because Carter point to
Ford to ask questions of Ford

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.520
about their
political involvement

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:36.658
with the coup in Chile,
with Pinochet Ford didn't

01:20:36.658 --> 01:20:37.450
know how to answer.

She's asking about--

01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:40.490
STUART EIZENSTAT:
Yes, I understand.

01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:47.597
STUART EIZENSTAT: --Bolivia.

01:20:47.597 --> 01:20:50.990
And we cut their arms
off, military arms off,

01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:53.610
because of their repression.

01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:54.440
AUDIENCE: So, my--

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.480
STUART EIZENSTAT: I'm
sorry, ma'am, please.

01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:00.640
I think, in fairness,
would you let other--

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.380
I don't know, really,
what you're asking.

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:06.730
But I can only say, he took on
the military dictators there.

01:21:06.730 --> 01:21:08.170
He did in Africa.

01:21:08.170 --> 01:21:10.630
I just-- I'm not sure
what else you're asking.

01:21:10.630 --> 01:21:14.350
AUDIENCE: What I'm saying
is that the Carter warned

01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:15.888
the presidency
against Gerald Ford--

01:21:15.888 --> 01:21:17.680
STUART EIZENSTAT: Can
you please stop this?

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:18.880
MEREDITH EVANS: She's
saying that he won--

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.160
you're saying that he won
the presidency because

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:22.520
of his global work?

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.010
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:27.260
He was upset about--
he ask a question.

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:30.020
Ford didn't know how
to answer any question.

01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:34.198
[INAUDIBLE] He look
very bad about that one.

01:21:34.198 --> 01:21:35.740
MEREDITH EVANS: I
thank you for that.

01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:37.750
Thank you for bringing
that to our attention.

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:39.643
AUDIENCE: Because
it's the truth.

01:21:39.643 --> 01:21:40.726
MEREDITH EVANS: Thank you.

01:21:40.726 --> 01:21:41.559
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.148
MEREDITH EVANS: Sir?

01:21:47.148 --> 01:21:48.033
Oh.

01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:48.700
Sir, right here.

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:49.547
AUDIENCE: Oh, me.

01:21:49.547 --> 01:21:50.380
MEREDITH EVANS: Yes!

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:52.870
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:56.950
There's two things
I'd like to say.

01:21:56.950 --> 01:22:04.168
First off, I am the recipient
of socialized health care.

01:22:04.168 --> 01:22:04.960
MEREDITH EVANS: OK.

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.600
AUDIENCE: You guys pay
for my health care.

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.150
I wish I could pay for yours.

01:22:10.150 --> 01:22:13.510
And granted, it's the VA.

01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:15.340
But they treat me wonderfully.

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:19.930
They've kept me alive for
a long period of time.

01:22:19.930 --> 01:22:22.090
Now, the thing
that I want to ask

01:22:22.090 --> 01:22:33.450
is, when I see a shadow
of a president standing

01:22:33.450 --> 01:22:38.700
with three people trying
to privatize the Veteran's

01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:41.880
Administration, how
well do you think

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.333
this is going to go over
with the American people?

01:22:44.333 --> 01:22:45.500
MEREDITH EVANS: Interesting.

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:48.800
STUART EIZENSTAT: Well, I
mean, privatizing the VA,

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.420
it won't go one inch.

01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:54.200
I mean, it's a very popular
program for veterans.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:57.710
And it has no chance of being,
and shouldn't be, privatized.

01:23:00.458 --> 01:23:01.410
AUDIENCE: I agree.

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:02.250
I agree with you.

01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:04.770
I just am wondering--

01:23:04.770 --> 01:23:08.190
STUART EIZENSTAT: I can tell you
that our VA chief, Max Cleland,

01:23:08.190 --> 01:23:11.850
was a triple amputee
from Vietnam.

01:23:11.850 --> 01:23:13.785
And we were great
supporters of the VA system.

01:23:13.785 --> 01:23:16.410
MEREDITH EVANS: I don't want to
say anything bad about Kennedy.

01:23:16.410 --> 01:23:20.280
But if he had voted
on Carter's side,

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:24.590
we would have health care, paid
for children up to 12, right?

01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:25.340
AUDIENCE: I agree.

01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:28.140
STUART EIZENSTAT: We were
going to expand Medicaid

01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:30.470
dramatically.

01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:33.710
We were providing
employer-paid insurance.

01:23:33.710 --> 01:23:35.270
We were expanding the VA.

01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:39.680
We were going to cover children
and catastrophic health care.

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:45.310
And as Obama has learned,
ours is an incremental system.

01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:48.050
You just can't do
everything at once.

01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:50.070
And the VA is important.

01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:53.730
But thinking that we can
have Medicare for all,

01:23:53.730 --> 01:23:56.185
and abandon the whole
private insurance system,

01:23:56.185 --> 01:23:57.060
doesn't work, either.

01:23:57.060 --> 01:23:58.820
You have to have a
combination of the two.

01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:00.540
MEREDITH EVANS: It would
have been nice, though.

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:00.990
STUART EIZENSTAT: Yes, please.

01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:01.710
MEREDITH EVANS: Thank
you for your question.

01:24:01.710 --> 01:24:02.440
Sir?

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah, my question
is about nuclear weapons.

01:24:04.890 --> 01:24:08.430
What was President Carter's
concern about nuclear weapons

01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:09.780
during his administration?

01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:11.650
And how does he feel
about them today?

01:24:11.650 --> 01:24:12.525
STUART EIZENSTAT: OK.

01:24:12.525 --> 01:24:17.575
So he was a nuclear engineer.

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.230
He was an officer
in a nuclear sub.

01:24:24.230 --> 01:24:29.580
And years later, when
the SS Jimmy Carter

01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:35.300
was christened in
Connecticut, at Groton,

01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:38.910
it was the last Nautilus
Class submarine.

01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:41.460
I went into it for a tour.

01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:42.330
And I came back.

01:24:42.330 --> 01:24:44.790
And I said to my
wife, Fran, I said,

01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:48.740
it's unbelievable to think
that people stay underground

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:53.610
for 60 to 90 days in
this cramped quarter.

01:24:53.610 --> 01:25:00.140
So he understood nuclear
power more than anyone.

01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:06.480
He had a great concern
about nuclear proliferation

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:12.430
and negotiated the SALT II
to Nuclear Arms Reduction

01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:15.160
Treaty with the Soviet Union.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:16.690
So here is-- again,
I want to try

01:25:16.690 --> 01:25:21.040
to put this in today's terms so
you understand how much we've

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:24.390
lost from the mentality there.

01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:27.810
I mentioned, already, Panama,
how we had bipartisan support.

01:25:27.810 --> 01:25:28.310
OK.

01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:33.090
So we're going into 1980.

01:25:33.090 --> 01:25:36.510
Reagan is opposed
to SALT. Still,

01:25:36.510 --> 01:25:39.990
we have a heavily
democratic Senate.

01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:47.130
And then there's a finding
of a Soviet brigade in Cuba.

01:25:47.130 --> 01:25:49.530
Here we go back to
Jack Kennedy again.

01:25:49.530 --> 01:25:55.260
This was a secret protocol
in the Cuban Missile Crisis,

01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:58.330
it was never made
public, that the Soviets

01:25:58.330 --> 01:26:05.690
would be allowed to keep 2,000
defensive troops in Cuba.

01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:08.790
This was just their successors.

01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:10.360
Everybody makes a
big to-deal of it.

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:13.700
The Soviets are on our doorstep.

01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:15.290
SALT doesn't pass.

01:26:15.290 --> 01:26:18.460
But here's what happened.

01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:21.770
Reagan comes into office.

01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:28.630
And for the full term of SALT,
seven years, both the Soviets,

01:26:28.630 --> 01:26:33.610
Gorbachev, and Reagan,
abide by that treaty

01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:36.430
as if it had been ratified.

01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:40.440
Just look at what happens today.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:44.860
The nuclear agreement
with Iran, we pull out of.

01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:48.220
The agreement called the
Trans-Pacific Partnership,

01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:49.600
we pull out of.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:52.150
The INF Treaty, we pull out of.

01:26:52.150 --> 01:26:55.880
The Paris Piece
Accords, we pull out of.

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:59.780
I mean, presidents
are supposed to--

01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:02.480
there's a continuity,
so foreign governments

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:06.140
can trust the word of United
States, when we reach a treaty,

01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:10.360
that our successor is
going to honor the treaty.

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:13.063
Reagan did, to his credit.

01:27:13.063 --> 01:27:14.980
MEREDITH EVANS: So we
barely have enough time.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:18.670
So what I'd like to do is
hear the last two questions.

01:27:18.670 --> 01:27:22.840
And then you can give short
answers to both questions.

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.047
Can we do it?

01:27:24.047 --> 01:27:24.880
I'm going to start--

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:25.930
STUART EIZENSTAT: Yes and no.

01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:27.100
MEREDITH EVANS: Can I
start-- let me start here.

01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:28.267
Because you've been waiting.

01:27:28.267 --> 01:27:30.310
So, sir, can you give
us your question?

01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.940
AUDIENCE: Sure.

01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:33.280
I'd just like to ask,
it's a little-known fact

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:36.970
that the negotiation of the
release of the hostages in Iran

01:27:36.970 --> 01:27:39.220
was actually negotiated by
the Carter administration.

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:41.110
But it occurred shortly
after Ronald Reagan

01:27:41.110 --> 01:27:43.030
had been inaugurated.

01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:46.438
What was the final negotiations
during the final days

01:27:46.438 --> 01:27:47.230
of the White House?

01:27:47.230 --> 01:27:47.540
MEREDITH EVANS: Can I see that?

01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.090
Yeah, OK.

01:27:48.090 --> 01:27:48.550
STUART EIZENSTAT: Yeah, OK.

01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:50.717
MEREDITH EVANS: So you want
to know what the final--

01:27:51.250 --> 01:27:53.930
AUDIENCE: What was the final
days of the White House like?

01:27:53.930 --> 01:27:55.388
MEREDITH EVANS:
What was that like?

01:27:55.388 --> 01:27:56.763
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
what was it like?

01:27:56.763 --> 01:27:59.260
What was the process the Carter
administration went through

01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:01.720
to negotiate with Iran
to get the hostages out?

01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:03.370
And just a quick
final question, what

01:28:03.370 --> 01:28:05.050
was the Carter
administration's reaction

01:28:05.050 --> 01:28:08.470
to them being released
so soon after Carter

01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:10.927
had been taken out, thus
giving the success to Reagan?

01:28:10.927 --> 01:28:12.010
MEREDITH EVANS: Thank you.

01:28:12.010 --> 01:28:14.110
Sir, question?

01:28:14.110 --> 01:28:16.000
AUDIENCE: I just
wanted to mention

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:23.200
that I nominated President
Carter for the Profile

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:29.500
in Courage Award, which is given
by this presidential library,

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:34.990
because of the, I believe,
the very underestimated

01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:38.160
presidency that he had.

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:41.180
And I believe that
everyone in this audience

01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:48.150
can attest to is his very
successful post-presidency.

01:28:48.150 --> 01:28:49.650
STUART EIZENSTAT:
Tell me your name.

01:28:49.650 --> 01:28:51.260
AUDIENCE: My name
is Vincent Bonito.

01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.590
And I am from New Jersey.

01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:52.970
STUART EIZENSTAT:
Thank you for that.

01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:55.150
AUDIENCE: And I am a
proud Kennedy Democrat.

01:28:55.150 --> 01:28:57.150
I do have a quick question,
if you could expand.

01:28:57.150 --> 01:28:58.520
MEREDITH EVANS: You knew I
was going to ask that, right?

01:28:58.520 --> 01:28:59.690
Do you have a question?

01:28:59.690 --> 01:29:03.500
AUDIENCE: What, if any,
was the relationship

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:10.760
like between President Carter
and the late President Reagan,

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.100
if you please?

01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:14.600
MEREDITH EVANS: So which one
would you like to answer first?

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.196
STUART EIZENSTAT: OK, so I'll
take the first question first.

01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:26.360
Khomeini, who was the leader
of the Iranian revolution,

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:31.540
hated Jimmy Carter
because Carter embodied,

01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:37.050
to him, all the presidents
who had supported the Shah.

01:29:37.050 --> 01:29:40.560
We had several agreements
to release the hostages

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:46.126
with his government, every
one of which he vetoed.

01:29:46.126 --> 01:29:51.100
Now, here is a question.

01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:54.430
And Gary Sick, who was our Iran
expert on national Security

01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:56.200
Council, wrote a
book about this,

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.090
there were congressional
hearings which

01:29:58.090 --> 01:30:03.490
were inconclusive, how is it
that the hostages were released

01:30:03.490 --> 01:30:08.620
the minute Reagan is sworn in,
and not before the election,

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:11.687
or even when we're
in the transition?

01:30:11.687 --> 01:30:13.020
I mean we reached the agreement.

01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:15.240
How is it?

01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:21.310
So the allegation
was made by Gary

01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:26.220
that the Reagan people went
to Khomeini and said to him,

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:30.180
don't release the hostages.

01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:33.240
It will win the
election for Carter.

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:35.895
And if you don't,
you'll get arms--

01:30:35.895 --> 01:30:41.520
it was the Iran Contra affair--
you'll get arms from us.

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:43.500
They were then at war with Iraq.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:44.930
Saddam Hussein had invaded them.

01:30:47.530 --> 01:30:49.390
That's never been proven.

01:30:49.390 --> 01:30:53.560
I want to make it absolutely
clear, it's never been proven.

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:56.110
There were congressional
hearings about it.

01:30:56.110 --> 01:31:00.190
What we do know is that his
vice presidential running

01:31:00.190 --> 01:31:05.110
mate, George H.W. Bush, went
to Paris during the campaign.

01:31:05.110 --> 01:31:07.180
I don't know that there
are a lot of votes there.

01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:09.100
His campaign manager
went to Mexico.

01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:11.020
Was this part of a scheme?

01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:12.740
We don't know.

01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:15.660
What I do know is this.

01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:18.190
It made a huge difference.

01:31:18.190 --> 01:31:23.110
And just imagine this, two
things from '80 campaign,

01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:24.670
I have to tell you.

01:31:24.670 --> 01:31:27.190
We made the huge
political mistake

01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:31.330
of having one debate with Reagan
eight days before the election.

01:31:31.330 --> 01:31:34.360
Never do that when
you're an incumbent.

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:36.550
Reagan's a great debater.

01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:38.920
But in my interview
with James Baker

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:43.110
for this book, his
campaign manager,

01:31:43.110 --> 01:31:45.080
he admitted that
they stole the debate

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:48.770
book I'd prepared Carter,
with all of the attack lines,

01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:50.160
and so forth.

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:54.860
He said, our campaign
manager put the thing

01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:58.170
on my door about two
weeks before the campaign,

01:31:58.170 --> 01:32:00.540
and said, Jim, you might
want to look at this.

01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:03.920
And he says to me, I thought
for a second or two about

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:06.080
whether I'm dealing
with stolen goods.

01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:10.670
But it only took a second to
decide I was going to read it.

01:32:10.670 --> 01:32:11.570
Was it decisive?

01:32:11.570 --> 01:32:12.200
Maybe not.

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:15.110
But I sure would have liked
to have had their debate book.

01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:18.080
But now Iran, OK?

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:21.410
So we lost in a landslide.

01:32:24.190 --> 01:32:25.750
Before the debate, we're ahead.

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:27.610
We lose the debate.

01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:31.390
But debates have a half
life of a couple of days.

01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:35.650
So the Saturday before
the Tuesday election--

01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:37.930
I'm not talking about
our own internal polls--

01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:44.180
CBS, NBC have us
even and advancing.

01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:46.860
And it looks like we're
going to pull off.

01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:52.240
I'm in the Chicago Hilton Hotel,
at the airport, because we're

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:54.800
campaigning there.

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:58.260
And I get a call at 3:00
o'clock in the morning.

01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:00.180
Air Force One is going
to leave in 45 minutes.

01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:01.920
The president's going
back to Washington.

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.530
I said, why are we leaving?

01:33:04.530 --> 01:33:06.990
The Iranians have
made another offer.

01:33:06.990 --> 01:33:09.180
I begged Carter not to go back.

01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:11.920
I said, just read the offer.

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.690
It was a positive
step, but not enough.

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:18.540
He, instead, went back.

01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:20.580
It reignited the
whole hostage thing.

01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:22.360
It was not sufficient.

01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:24.240
And we dropped like a rock.

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:26.430
So what was it like?

01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:29.600
Our last-- every president
or presidential campaign

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:30.470
does this.

01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:35.330
The last day of the
election, you go east to west

01:33:35.330 --> 01:33:37.890
to follow the setting sun.

01:33:37.890 --> 01:33:39.660
And you end up in California.

01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:42.550
We ended up, in
this case, actually,

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:46.420
in a Boeing hangar in Seattle.

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:46.920
They

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:51.120
Were not making the X 8s,
by the way, at that time.

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.410
And we come back.

01:33:52.410 --> 01:33:54.420
We get on Air Force One.

01:33:54.420 --> 01:34:00.130
And Pat Caddell, our pollster,
calls and says, it's all over.

01:34:00.130 --> 01:34:02.140
The Iran thing has come back.

01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:03.460
We're dropping like a rock.

01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:04.840
Of course, he tells Carter.

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:06.190
Carter comes out.

01:34:06.190 --> 01:34:10.580
And I have to admit,
I'm crying like a baby.

01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:11.460
I hugged him.

01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:15.310
And I said, we've let you down.

01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:19.020
And he said, no, you
haven't let me down.

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:23.400
We land in Warner
Robins, Dakota Plains--

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:25.530
mind you, this is the
way modern politics are.

01:34:25.530 --> 01:34:27.800
The first vote
hasn't been cast yet.

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:30.270
But we knew we'd lost
because of the polls.

01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:32.760
Rosalynn is crying,
has to hide herself.

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:36.990
It was an extremely emotional
way to end a presidency.

01:34:36.990 --> 01:34:39.720
And that's the way
Carter is remembered,

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:41.130
for losing overwhelmingly.

01:34:41.130 --> 01:34:42.570
And that's why I
wrote this book.

01:34:42.570 --> 01:34:44.700
Because there's so
much that occurred

01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:49.360
between the time he took the
oath of office and the time

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.280
he left.

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:56.910
So much was done that we
benefit from today that I want

01:34:56.910 --> 01:34:59.250
that full picture to be out.

01:34:59.250 --> 01:35:01.583
And I want everyone
to hear it and see it.

01:35:01.583 --> 01:35:03.000
MEREDITH EVANS:
So, yes or no, was

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.513
there a relationship
between Carter and Reagan,

01:35:06.513 --> 01:35:07.930
knowing that that
emotional loss--

01:35:07.930 --> 01:35:08.805
STUART EIZENSTAT: OK.

01:35:08.805 --> 01:35:11.880
The answer is no,
with one exception,

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:15.870
and that is, the
hostages are released.

01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:19.370
Reagan is day one
of his presidency.

01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:24.150
In a gracious act, he has
Carter go on Air Force One

01:35:24.150 --> 01:35:27.030
to get the hostages in Germany.

01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:31.680
Now, interestingly, he and
Ford have a bitter campaign.

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:36.820
I mean, again, we won by a 1/2
of 1%, by 30 electoral votes.

01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:39.100
And there was no
relationship there.

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:42.430
Two things happened to cause
a beautiful relationship

01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:43.960
to happen.

01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:50.100
The first is, Golda Meyer
dies, former prime minister

01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:51.960
of Israel.

01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:54.840
And Reagan asks the
three living presidents--

01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:58.170
I have a picture in my
office, the three of of them--

01:35:58.170 --> 01:36:01.320
Nixon, Ford, and Carter
to go on Air Force One.

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:07.800
So the seating on Air Force
One, as they go to Israel,

01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:10.530
is Carter and Ford are
sitting next to each other.

01:36:10.530 --> 01:36:12.100
And then there's a aisle.

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:14.320
And Nixon is on the other side.

01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:16.560
And he's brooding
the whole time.

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:18.570
And Ford had no
great love for him.

01:36:18.570 --> 01:36:22.860
And Carter and Ford bond
during this 12-hour trip

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:23.520
back and forth.

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:28.170
They did joint things at
their presidential libraries.

01:36:28.170 --> 01:36:30.120
And I created, with
his domestic advisor,

01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:32.760
Jim Cannon something called
the American Agenda, which

01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:35.340
they co-chaired, which
had a bipartisan group

01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:38.470
to give advice to whoever was
elected in '88, it was Ford.

01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:40.600
That was still when
bipartisanship was possible.

01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:43.590
So we went to Beaver
Creek, where his place.

01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:45.180
We went to the Carter Center.

01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:47.965
They had a beautiful
relationship.

01:36:47.965 --> 01:36:50.340
MEREDITH EVANS: So on that
note, beautiful relationships,

01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:53.130
with happy thoughts, we're
going to end our conversation

01:36:53.130 --> 01:36:54.576
with Mr. Eizenstat.

01:36:54.576 --> 01:37:00.830
[APPLAUSE]

01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:02.288
STUART EIZENSTAT:
Talk about books.

01:37:02.288 --> 01:37:04.700
MEREDITH EVANS: They're here.

01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:08.000
His book is a fabulous read.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.680
I love it.

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:12.710
It's done with archival
materials and his own work.

01:37:12.710 --> 01:37:13.627
And they're available.

01:37:13.627 --> 01:37:15.585
STUART EIZENSTAT: And
I'm signing books after--

01:37:15.585 --> 01:37:17.040
MEREDITH EVANS:
And he's signing.
