00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.970
INTERVIEWER: Ninjas were a
class of covert operatives

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.500
that are believed to have
existed in Japan from the 15th

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.610
to 17th century, and
possibly even earlier.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.830
While they no longer
officially exist,

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.830
the mystique of these
ancient assassins

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.550
has been popularized
over the centuries.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.900
And recently, the town
of Aichi, in Japan,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.660
posted a job listing seeking
to hire full-time ninjas.

00:00:29.048 --> 00:00:32.520
SATOSHI ADACHI:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:01:10.246 --> 00:01:13.710
CHRIS O'NEILL: I have no
anxiety to do acrobatic tricks

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.120
and audition that way.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.760
But the interview section was
going to be all in Japanese,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.754
so I was so nervous to get up
and speak-- It was a challenge.

00:01:22.754 --> 00:01:24.420
I don't know if I'm
much of a performer,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.400
but I love ninja culture,
I love ninja history,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.040
I love Japanese history-- I
just wanted to be a ninja!

00:01:32.072 --> 00:01:33.530
SATOSHI ADACHI:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.970
INTERVIEWER: As
professional ninjas,

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.830
they travel around the
country and abroad,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.120
showcasing warrior skills
at live performances.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.700
EMI YAMADA: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:02:28.562 --> 00:02:30.740
SATOSHI ADACHI:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.660
EMI YAMADA: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:02:51.064 --> 00:02:52.980
CHRIS O'NEILL: I really
like talking to people

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.210
about coming to Aichi
and coming to Nagoya.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.300
I'm passionate about this
place, it's beautiful.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.100
For me, this is real Japan.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.307
It's got so much
history, so much culture.

00:03:01.307 --> 00:03:03.140
I fell in love with
this place, and I really

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.290
want to share real Japan
with everybody else.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.680
But I'm so excited to be
the first [JAPANESE] ninja.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.091
I think it shows people that
no matter what anybody says,

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:12.965
anything is possible.

00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:14.540
When I was a kid,
I said, I wanted

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.360
to be a ninja--
people laughed at me.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.665
But I worked hard, I
waited for that chance,

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:19.540
and I finally got it.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.065
It's a big responsibility
and I'm going to do my best.

00:03:23.065 --> 00:03:24.440
INTERVIEWER: Be
sure to check out

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.680
this next episode about
another unusual career path,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.906
as told by the
supermodel of hands.

00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:32.530
ELLEN SIROT: I wear
gloves quite often,

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.154
especially when I'm
outside, to protect

00:03:34.154 --> 00:03:36.980
my hands from the elements and
from things that can happen.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.810
But I take really
good care of them,

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.290
and you'll see why I'm a
hand model-- because I have

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.120
flawless skin, and nice long
nails, and very graceful hands,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.240
and that's really
become my signature.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.740
INTERVIEWER: And

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.470
