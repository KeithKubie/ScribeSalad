00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.420
Okay, the answer is the paternal grandmother.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.370
And the reason is, because only the paternal

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.100
grandmother shares the chromosome segment with the

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.830
HERC2 gene, not the maternal grandmother. And the

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.530
significance behind this is actually pretty exciting.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.210
We know that Seamus must be homozygous recessive

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.320
and his parents, Joanna and Hayward, must

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.750
be heterozygous dominant. But he inherited a HERC2

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.410
gene containing segment of his chromosome 15

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.030
from his paternal grandmother. That means from

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.750
Susan, even though she had brown eyes, she must have been heterozygous for the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.970
HERC2 gene, which was passed down to Hayward, which he then passed down to his

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.070
son Seamus. So even though Hayward and Susan both had brown eyes, his paternal

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.900
grandmother was responsible for giving Seamus

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.380
the allele that made his eyes blue.
