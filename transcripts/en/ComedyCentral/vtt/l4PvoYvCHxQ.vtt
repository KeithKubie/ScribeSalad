00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.505
Okay, so tickets
are 50 each.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:06.540
Obviously, we
need an eighth.
Ok.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.343
Plus drinks, that's like
200 bucks total.

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:11.678
And since Todd wouldn't
give me my paycheck.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.981
Girl!

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:16.617
You took all of
his office supplies.

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:18.919
Listen, what I do
at my place of work

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.921
is none of your godamn
business, okay?

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.991
Okay, I think you really
need to be fired really soon.
I know.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.928
("What a Wonderful World"
playing)

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.229
Oh, I love this song.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.532
Ugh--
This is a slave song.

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:33.100
It's not
a slave song.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.368
Yes, it is.

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:35.669
It's widely known
by the black community

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.038
that "What a Wonderful World"
is, like, a slave song.

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:39.573
Right, right, right, I
totally forgot that you're,

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:41.608
like, the voice of the whole
black community.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.310
It's a thing--
Google it.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.611
It's in
a Fugees song.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.080
Wyclef's like, "And I think
to myself."

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:48.415
He's like
angry about it.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.584
I feel like all we ever talk
about is black people

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:53.187
and slaver...y...

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:54.188
Hi.

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.156
I would like to
return these items.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.658
I once owned them
personally,

00:00:57.758 --> 00:00:59.893
but I have no
use for them now, so.

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:04.631
Your total comes
to $135.67.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:05.966
Yes!
Shit-- Yes!

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.069
Oh.

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:13.073
You know, we'd love
to get that in liquid cash.
Yeah.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.778
Okay.

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.213
Okay, what about
my fishbowl of change?

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:21.215
There's got to be, like, 30
or 40 bucks in there?

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.616
Can you leave?

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:24.818
Yeah, we're gonna--
We're ending
the convo.
