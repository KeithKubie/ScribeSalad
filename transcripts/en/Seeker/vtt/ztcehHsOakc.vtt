00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.280
When I was a kid, I looooved doing impressions
- I got a kick out of changing my accent and

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.690
prank calling my friends.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.460
But, some people claim to be stuck with a
foreign accent.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.920
Is this a thing?

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.599
Hello communicators, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.320
A mother of two who lives in the UK seems
to confuse a lot of people.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.000
If you saw her in a supermarket, you’d probably
guess she was a local, that is, until you

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.330
hear her speak.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.199
Some people think she’s French, others German,
Italian, and yet others even Japanese!

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.410
She just doesn’t sound British.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.820
People can’t seem to agree on what accent
she has, but they are certain she is speaking

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.820
in an accent.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.320
The thing is, she’s never lived anywhere
but the UK, so what’s going on here?

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.320
Is she faking it?

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.510
Well, she told a Professor at the University
of Central Florida in Orlando, “I’m not

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.570
trying to be foreign.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.200
I’m just trying to be me.”

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.540
Turns out, she’s telling the truth.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.190
In March 2006 she began involuntarily slurring
her words and in the matter of days, her voice

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.930
had completely changed.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.239
Doctors were baffled.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.799
But, after numerous tests and observations,
she found out that she is one of the more

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:13.279
than 140 reported cases of people suffering
from a condition called Foreign Accent Syndrome

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:14.700
or FAS.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.509
Foreign accent syndrome is a motor speech
disorder in which a person’s intonation

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.849
and stress patterns are altered.

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:24.600
The way they compose phrases and sentences
is also affected.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.710
This causes them to be perceived as non-native
speakers of their mother tongue.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.430
In the UK woman’s specific case, her funny
accent was a result of cerebral vasculitis

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.200
- basically this means that her brain was
not receiving enough oxygen in areas responsible

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.200
for language.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.829
But, other types of brain injuries can cause
people to have Foreign Accent Syndrome too.

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.789
Another British woman woke up with a Chinese
sounding accent after having a severe migraine.

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.990
Yet others, have sounded differently since
birth.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.759
A Dutch boy can’t help but speak in what
sounds like a French or Mediterranean accent.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.360
Before him, all known cases of Foreign Accent
Syndrome were associated with brain damage,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.919
so his case tells scientists there may also
be a genetic component involved.

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:11.260
This is why Dr. Johan Verhoeven from City
University London and his team decided to

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.189
investigate what was going on.

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:17.920
By using single emission CT scans, they found
that his brain had significantly less blood

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.430
flow to certain areas compared to other people.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.740
They saw reduced flow to the prefrontal cortex
in the left hemisphere, which makes sense

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.840
because this area is associated with speech.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.240
But, they also found that he had less blood
flow to the right side of his cerebellum.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.159
This area is usually not associated with speech
- it’s thought to be more strongly linked

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.569
to body movement.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.120
So this finding tells researchers that perhaps
the cerebellum is also involved with cognitive

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.610
functions - like producing speech.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.970
People who develop these so called accents
are obviously not faking it.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.359
It’s a real thing.

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.740
That being said, calling their condition Foreign
Accent Syndrome is a bit of misnomer that

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.000
may contribute to some people’s skepticism.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.219
Nonetheless, for people with FAS, speaking
this way is not a matter of choice.

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:23.310
It’s just what it is - like a speech impediment.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.879
One speech impediment that is a bit controversial
is the lisp.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:43.680
Check out my episode on why some people have
lisps here.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.680
