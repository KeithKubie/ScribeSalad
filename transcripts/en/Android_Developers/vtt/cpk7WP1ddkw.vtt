00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.100
SPARKY RHODE: Everybody, welcome
once again to the

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.060
"Android EMEA Developer
Relations Office Hours," where

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.940
we talk to you about anything
that's on your mind regarding

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.370
developing Android
applications.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.290
I'm Sparky, coming to you from
a very cloudy and foggy

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.540
Munich, Germany.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.690
Typical fall day here
in Central Europe.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.890
And I'm also joined by--

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.620
oh, looks like Matt, Nick, Rich,
and-- who's that fourth

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.420
guy in London?

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.875
RICH HYNDMAN: Who's the
fourth guy in London?

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:34.090
WIEBE ELSINGA: My name is Wiebe,
and I'm one of the

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.790
organizers of the Dutch Android
User Group visiting

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.246
here in London.

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:38.650
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, it's--

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.000
SPARKY RHODE: Awesome.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.320
RICH HYNDMAN: The run-up to
Droidcon UK, the largest

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.990
Android-focused conference in
Europe, I guess, each year.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.120
And it's kicking off tomorrow,
so Droids are appearing in

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.500
London from all over Europe.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.790
So we're very pleased to be
joined by Wiebe here, and of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.190
course his cohort, Johan,
has joined us

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.710
electronically as well.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.300
And hey to Al Sutton for joining
us pretty much always.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.080
AL SUTTON: Yeah.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.675
RICH HYNDMAN: Good to have
you on board, Al.

00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:07.130
I guess I'll see you tomorrow
in person at Droidcon?

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.480
AL SUTTON: Absolutely.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.340
Yeah, I wouldn't miss
it for the world.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.890
RICH HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.725
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, yeah.

00:01:10.725 --> 00:01:12.832
RICH HYNDMAN: How come you're
missing Droidcon, Johan?

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.290
JOHAN PELGRIM: Good question,
good question.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.930
I think it's probably maybe--

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.890
RICH HYNDMAN: This is where you
slip in the bit about--

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.940
JOHAN PELGRIM: Oh,
the money thing--

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.930
RICH HYNDMAN: Droidcon
Holland?

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.860
JOHAN PELGRIM: Yeah.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.240
That's true as well.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.120
NICK BUTCHER: What is that
Droidcon Holland

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.370
of which you speak?

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.760
JOHAN PELGRIM: No,
that's one thing.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.640
Of course, there many
conferences and I desperately

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.680
want to go to Google
I/O next year.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.945
So I'm not to trying to control
my management with

00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:40.510
Droidcon UK.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.500
And as you say, Nick, we
have a Droidcon in the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.286
Netherlands as well.

00:01:46.286 --> 00:01:49.680
And Wiebe is there, so he
can report back to us.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.830
So basically that's it.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.050
WIEBE ELSINGA: I'm
on a mission.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.170
RICH HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.110
Well, I'm definitely really
looking forward to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.140
Droidcon this year.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.370
It will be the biggest, baddest

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.690
Android conference ever.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.630
When I say bad--

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.970
NICK BUTCHER: In the Michael
Jackson sense.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.490
AL SUTTON: Getting dodgier.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.977
[LAUGHS].

00:02:07.977 --> 00:02:09.925
RICH HYNDMAN: OK, so
on to Android.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.950
So before we kick off with the
Moderator questions, I'll make

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.320
the standard disclaimer that
we're not going to talk about

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.140
any roadmaps, future products,
anything that's unannounced.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.010
And if anybody from the floor
inside the Hangout has a

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.586
question for us live, please go
ahead now, else we'll hit

00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:29.836
the Moderator.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.400
JOHAN PELGRIM: Well, basically
I was trying to find out what

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.390
the status is on the Gradle
builds, because we are a

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.230
preview, and how focused is
Google to get this into

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.620
production phase or where we
can actually use it in

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.605
production?

00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:51.280
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I think
it's classified as

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.355
experimental at the moment.

00:02:53.355 --> 00:02:55.800
I think that's how they refer to
it in most of their posts.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.160
So I don't know is the answer.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.520
Like, Al, you probably have
followed this a lot closer

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.050
than I actually have.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.035
Is the aim to finally get it
to production quality?

00:03:05.035 --> 00:03:08.890
Or is it more of an experiment
to find out what we need or--

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.800
AL SUTTON: It's currently on the
experimental side, but the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.720
idea is to replace the current
build system with something

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.140
that Jake Warden's happy with.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.410
Or rather something that has
more features and can deal

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.270
with more situations.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.500
So eventually it will become a
replacement for the current

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.410
build system, and there'll
be an overlap time.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.930
But it's very early days yet, so
best thing is to jump on to

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.730
adt-dev, the Google group,
and follow it on there.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.730
And contribute back if you think
it's not going in the

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.350
right direction.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.490
NICK BUTCHER: Are we still
on preview 0.2?

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.140
AL SUTTON: I believe so, yes.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.500
NICK BUTCHER: Very early days.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.750
JOHAN PELGRIM: OK, thanks.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.900
NICK BUTCHER: Have you had
a play of it yet, Johan?

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.040
JOHAN PELGRIM: Yeah, just
a simple build.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.290
Just have tried it once, so--

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.920
I haven't tried it for
production yet.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.160
I'm using Maven, by the way.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.590
So I'm not entirely happy
with that, so I'm--

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.160
NICK BUTCHER: Uh-huh.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.060
JOHAN PELGRIM: Desperately
wanting to get my hands on

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.480
Gradle Build.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.672
NICK BUTCHER: Cool All right.

00:04:10.672 --> 00:04:12.700
So you've got some
new people who've

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.380
joined us in the Hangout?

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.630
Who have we got?

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.382
SPARKY RHODE: Tell me that's
not me echoing.

00:04:22.382 --> 00:04:23.320
Doesn't look like it.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.110
OK.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.750
We've got a bunch of people
in the Hangout now.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.425
MATT GAUNT: The live
stream just freezes

00:04:29.425 --> 00:04:30.100
at this point here.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.665
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:33.450
Nick.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.770
Al.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.580
We've got [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:41.230
Al, Android developers,
Ernest, who is this?

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.970
Guiseppe, Johan we've got,
and Linda Knerling.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:44.435
Hi.

00:04:44.435 --> 00:04:44.900
MALE SPEAKER: Hi, BJ.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.760
SPARKY RHODE: Welcome.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.960
Glad to have you all
in the Hangout.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.000
It's really great to see
such a big group here.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.633
Does anybody else have a topic
of interest or concern that

00:04:54.633 --> 00:04:56.130
you would like to bring up?

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.220
[BEEPING]

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.580
ERNEST: I don't know.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.770
Can you guys hear me good?

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.030
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.570
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.650
ERNEST: All right.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.380
So I actually had a question
just because I'm

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.160
a pretty new developer.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.460
I haven't programmed or
anything, like I just started

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.340
in the past three months.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.310
Anyway, long story short.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.850
I came out with my first app
yesterday, and I'm not sure if

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.100
this is the right forum--

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.480
--to actually come on top
of search results?

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.790
SPARKY RHODE: My app is still
not the top search result for

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.820
its own name.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.390
ERNEST: Yeah.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.130
You see, that's--

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.520
I mean, I'm trying to just give
my friends the name of

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.230
the application and they
just can't find it.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.290
So it kind of sucks.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.450
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah,
sometimes--

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.850
definitely near the start of an
application launch, it can

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.440
be best just to deep link
people straight with the

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.150
package name to your
application.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.180
Also, if you search for the
package name, it will appear.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.430
Obviously, when you're searching
for app titles, then

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.220
search rankings do apply.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.750
So it's going to be all down
to numbers of installs,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.765
ratings, and 198 other different
factors related to

00:06:09.765 --> 00:06:12.233
how we rank listings
into Play Store.

00:06:12.233 --> 00:06:16.161
WIEBE ELSINGA: Or maybe the
filtering the application--

00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:16.652
RICH HYNDMAN: Mm-hmm.

00:06:16.652 --> 00:06:19.952
WIEBE ELSINGA: If there is
a index specification--

00:06:19.952 --> 00:06:20.760
index on the manifest.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.200
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.490
There is also the possibility
that your friends' devices

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.830
aren't supported by
your application,

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.330
so it may be filtering.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.110
But often it's just the market
filtering out some of the apps

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.760
with fewer installs.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.540
So getting some installs of your
app will definitely help

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.780
it appear in the search rankings
and appear further up

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.920
in the search rankings.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.290
ERNEST: Gotcha.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.630
NICK BUTCHER: And
your issue is--

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:43.970
ERNEST: All right.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:44.710
That helps.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.905
NICK BUTCHER: Sometimes--

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.720
what's your app called?

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.840
ERNEST: It's called Have To Do,
and it supports all the

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.890
way down to API level 4.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:53.300
So--

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.250
RICH HYNDMAN: Nice.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.390
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, the one
issue we've heard of before as

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.580
well is if you have--

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.720
the name of your app is close
to a dictionary word but

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.440
slightly changed, like just
one word different to a

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.150
dictionary word, sometimes
our query rewrite-- you

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.810
know, Did You Mean--

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.910
could be a little bit
too aggressive.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.210
So in those cases, you can
report that using the

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:13.800
developer console.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.916
Or you can report developer
issue and we'll take a look at

00:07:17.916 --> 00:07:20.185
that to make sure our search
algorithm's not being too

00:07:20.185 --> 00:07:21.710
aggressive with its rewrites.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:22.535
RICH HYNDMAN: Have To Do--

00:07:22.535 --> 00:07:23.150
sorry.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.525
NICK BUTCHER: But yeah,
yours doesn't sound

00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:24.900
like a case of that.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.110
RICH HYNDMAN: It doesn't sound
like a case of that.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.320
But Have To Do is quite a
generic set of three words

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.795
that could relate to many
different apps.

00:07:32.795 --> 00:07:34.030
I mean, you could call it--

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.260
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.050
to do list--

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.850
SPARKY RHODE: If the words are
separated by spaces, then put

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.690
quotes around the phrase,
and that will fix it.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.604
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
I tried that.

00:07:41.604 --> 00:07:43.086
It didn't come up.

00:07:43.086 --> 00:07:43.455
SPARKY RHODE: Oh.

00:07:43.455 --> 00:07:43.580
OK.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.760
NICK BUTCHER: It's quite
a generic name, though.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.555
There's a lot of apps
fighting for To Do.

00:07:50.555 --> 00:07:52.250
ERNEST: Yeah, it's
just weird that--

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:53.660
exactly that.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.230
Like the guy mentions, if quotes
around it would help.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.000
But apparently not.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.390
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, package
name should usually do it.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.820
You just need to get some
installs and hopefully it will

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.950
start appearing in
the rankings.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:07.790
Consider--

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.380
personally, I would consider
changing the name as well.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:10.780
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.066
RICH HYNDMAN: Because it's never
going to be that easy to

00:08:12.066 --> 00:08:14.630
search for that name unless it
becomes a really, really

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.420
consumer-orientated brand.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.895
WIEBE ELSINGA: So
be more unique.

00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:19.950
RICH HYNDMAN: Be more unique
on the name than calling it

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.420
something To Do.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.670
OK?

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.690
NICK BUTCHER: And
congratulations on launching

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:27.340
your first app.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.143
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:08:28.143 --> 00:08:28.850
Awesome.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.100
ERNEST: Thank you.

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:34.280
RICH HYNDMAN: Anything else
from the Hangout?

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.510
AL SUTTON: I've got a carry-over
from last week,

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:40.390
where someone was asking about
TrustZone on processes and

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.760
using it for secure
processing.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.190
RICH HYNDMAN: Uh-huh.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.350
AL SUTTON: It tends to only
be used on bootloaders.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.210
Basically what happens with
TrustZone is it sets up two

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:53.930
separate worlds on the core or
the multi-core device, where

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.520
the two cannot communicate
except through a very well

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.430
defined API.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.510
And it assigns hardware
resources to work from to one

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.910
or the other world.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.730
Android tends to run in what's
known as the normal world, and

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.300
things like secure bootloaders
and stuff tend to run in

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:07.910
secure worlds.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.100
It tends not to be something
that will be useful from an

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.760
application in Android.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.740
It's more designed at hardware
manufacturers to use.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.140
So hopefully that answers
last week's question.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.010
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.332
Well, thanks for that
extra detail.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.900
Any other live questions
in the room?

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.270
Who do we have?

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.520
Giuseppe, how are you?

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.050
Did you have a question
for us?

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.300
RICH HYNDMAN: We can't
hear you there.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.054
You may be muted.

00:09:36.054 --> 00:09:38.440
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah, Giuseppe's
been muted.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.480
RICH HYNDMAN: Was he
beeping earlier?

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.945
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, was that
the beeping noise?

00:09:40.945 --> 00:09:42.195
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.810
If you have a message for us,
we still can't hear you,

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.995
Giuseppe, so maybe just type it
in the chat window, or find

00:09:51.995 --> 00:09:53.245
out how to un-mute.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:56.990
NICK BUTCHER: I think
there was a--

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.680
was there a question in the
sidebar as well before we

00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.730
dropped out?

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.480
MATT GAUNT: From Linden, yeah.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.656
NICK BUTCHER: Has anyone
still got that?

00:10:01.656 --> 00:10:02.745
Or is Linden--

00:10:02.745 --> 00:10:03.060
AL SUTTON: Yep.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.180
Linden says, is there a means
to determine if talking--

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.030
GIUSEPPE: Can you hear me now?

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.960
AL SUTTON: Partially talking--

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.270
SPARKY RHODE: Yes.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.955
AL SUTTON: Or to queue an
accessibility announcement.

00:10:10.955 --> 00:10:12.500
SPARKY RHODE: OK.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.930
Let's go to Giuseppe and
then we'll get back

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.345
to the sidebar there.

00:10:15.345 --> 00:10:16.315
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:16.800
SPARKY RHODE: Hi,
Giuseppe, again.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.285
GIUSEPPE: OK.

00:10:17.285 --> 00:10:18.830
SPARKY RHODE: Thanks for--

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.820
GIUSEPPE: So you must
hear me now, right?

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.730
SEVERAL VOICES: Yes.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:22.410
GIUSEPPE: Very good.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:22.750
MALE SPEAKER: Hello.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.400
GIUSEPPE: So I already--
hello--

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.100
already asked this question to
Richard in Italy, because I

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.920
had the good chance to meet
him here last week, right?

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.170
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.650
GIUSEPPE: And we still confused
Richard of Frankly

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.220
Speaking about the action bar
problem, because we are still

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.050
getting from this Jake Wharton
information that he want to

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.340
leave this project.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.240
So we are using this
ActionBarSherlock for old

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.360
version before own combo.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.100
We are using this Sherlock bar
action bar for our application

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.010
but we don't know
what to do else.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.190
Because the action bar compact
that Google team is

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:05.250
developing, it's stopped there
from long time now, and not

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.310
any update anymore.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.315
And actually, we don't
know what to do.

00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:09.740
That's it.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.370
That's my question
at the moment.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.890
NICK BUTCHER: So what's
the actual question?

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.770
RICH HYNDMAN: So the question
is, we don't have a compatible

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.390
action bar that does
what he wants.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.220
And Jake Wharton is saying he's
going to stop working on

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:19.850
his own one.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:20.380
NICK BUTCHER: Mm-hmm.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.855
RICH HYNDMAN: What should
the developer do?

00:11:21.855 --> 00:11:23.100
Should he use Jake's,
or should he--

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.250
NICK BUTCHER: When did
Jake say that?

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.270
RICH HYNDMAN: He posted
it on G+.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.430
NICK BUTCHER: What,
their deprecated

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:27.680
from inception place?

00:11:30.302 --> 00:11:31.690
RICH HYNDMAN: I don't know
what it's called.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.330
GIUSEPPE: Sorry?

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.320
NICK BUTCHER: What did
Jake actually say?

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.960
He's not going to
carry on with--

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.640
GIUSEPPE: He said that during
the last I/O he was very good

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:47.502
received by the Google team,
but after this time, no any

00:11:47.502 --> 00:11:51.530
more contacts, no any chance
to include, probably, the

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:55.000
ActionBarSherlock
inside the code.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.660
And probably he will leave
the project and

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.610
will not update anymore.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.950
This is on his blog right now.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.400
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.570
I haven't seen that place yet.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.350
I can't comment,
again, on that.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:09.210
But I guess the situation is
that ActionBarSherlock works

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.860
very well on all their
devices, so

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.050
I wouldn't be concerned.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.660
In fact, I always recommend it
to developers for backwards

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.400
compatibility.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.360
I think it's fine to use.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.890
If he's not going to carry
on work on it, I

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.560
think that's fine.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.320
So, say any new functionality
gets added to the action bar,

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.380
for example, in the future,
perhaps it won't be back

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.500
ported to all the devices.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.885
But you're already at a certain
functionality level

00:12:30.885 --> 00:12:32.520
now, which is good enough.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.750
At Google I/O, we said we are
going to release our own

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:39.970
backward-compatible action bar
version, which we obviously

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.050
haven't carried out yet, we
haven't launched that yet, but

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.330
I believe it's still coming.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.080
So there was another project--
so just say that I get

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.000
confused-- there was another
project called ActionBarCompat

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.850
which is in the SDK samples,
which was--

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.130
that's not the same thing.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.480
That is an older, much, much
more simplified kind of-- it

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.600
looks like an action bar, but it
doesn't offer the same kind

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.840
of API surface, for example.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.830
That's an older project which
has been deprecated in favor

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.095
of this newer one, which we
have announced but not

00:13:08.095 --> 00:13:08.910
launched yet.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.810
So I hope that's clear.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:11.270
Yeah.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.430
So I would say you shouldn't
have any fear using

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:14.230
ActionBarSherlock right now.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.120
It's a really, really
awesome project.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.240
And it's open source, so even if
Jake leaves it, then many,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.360
many, many other contributors
may still pick up the reins,

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.820
yourself included.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.700
Plus, there's also this
forthcoming project from

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.310
Google itself, which
if you choose to

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:30.390
wait, that's your decision.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.530
But until then, there's
ActionBarSherlock.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:34.230
GIUSEPPE: OK.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.080
Very good question.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:35.570
Very good answer.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.310
Thank you very much.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:39.860
NICK BUTCHER:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN].

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.730
GIUSEPPE: [SPEAKING ITALIAN].

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.940
SPARKY RHODE: I answered that
question in the Moderator in

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.350
three words.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.400
I said, use what works.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:46.760
NICK BUTCHER: "Use

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.800
what works." [LAUGHTER]

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.280
NICK BUTCHER: That's a
good summary there.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.240
GIUSEPPE: Yes, that's right.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.840
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.240
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.370
Shall we move on to the first
Moderator question, talking

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:56.690
about the Moderator?

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:57.110
Oh,no.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.230
We said we'd look at Linden's
query-- sorry--

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.030
in the sidebar.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.510
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:03.025
We've also just had the first
Moderator question, because

00:14:03.025 --> 00:14:05.090
that question was in
the Moderator.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.850
RICH HYNDMAN: Two birds,
one stone, dead.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:08.495
Right.

00:14:08.495 --> 00:14:10.620
Can someone read what it
says in the chat bar?

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.180
It's distant.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:12.910
SPARKY RHODE: Sure.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.860
"Is there a means to determine
if a TalkBack is currently

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:21.113
talking or to queue an
accessibility announcement?"

00:14:21.113 --> 00:14:22.526
It goes on to say--

00:14:22.526 --> 00:14:22.997
GIUSEPPE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:22.997 --> 00:14:23.470
Google.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:24.660
SPARKY RHODE: Of an
accessibility

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.292
event, is what I meant.

00:14:26.292 --> 00:14:26.724
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:14:26.724 --> 00:14:28.370
15 people are going to
speak to Giuseppe.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.620
[LAUGHS].

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:32.960
SPARKY RHODE: I don't know.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.300
I mean--

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:34.570
right.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:40.180
Because these audio patches tend
to play asynchronously,

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:40.580
don't they?

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.020
So I don't actually know if we
have an API to say, no, it

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:43.900
hasn't finished yet.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.660
Do you guys know?

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.400
RICH HYNDMAN: I don't know
either, with TalkBack.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.240
I kind of assumed it was
pretty autonomous.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.380
Tell it what to do and
it just gets on with

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.670
it in its own time.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.888
Queueing up things and
talking about them.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.800
But I haven't used it myself in
anything similar as to put

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.630
content descriptions
in my XML tags.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.790
NICK BUTCHER: I don't have
anything else that I've found.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:07.030
Yeah.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.630
Perhaps if you could post that
question to Stack Overflow and

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.890
send us a link, might the best
way to tackle this question.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.050
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, we
can take that one

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:15.080
offline on Stack Overflow.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.380
That would be quite cool.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:22.010
He is currently doing a post
delay to interrupt and be the

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.340
last thing talking.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.470
Yeah, fair enough.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:32.670
Sorry, but we haven't too much
experience in that to

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.190
comment right now.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.220
But, yeah, the Stack Overflow
idea would work well for us.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.310
Put it on Stack Overflow and
we'll check it out on there

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.908
and see if we can answer
it offline.

00:15:40.908 --> 00:15:42.310
MATT GAUNT: Sounds good.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:43.560
RICH HYNDMAN: Cheers.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.540
Next from the Moderator,
Sparky.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:48.830
SPARKY RHODE: Sure.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.894
Let's see what we've
got queued up.

00:15:51.894 --> 00:15:54.610
NICK BUTCHER: This question's
in the G+ thread as well.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.210
SPARKY RHODE: This is from
Reini in Austria.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.610
"Would you mind explaining the
best way to animate changes to

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.330
the action bar such as
expanding, collapsing an

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:07.710
action view or replacing the
available menu items." I

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:13.330
responded by saying, I just call
the methods and let the

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:14.570
system do what it will.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.700
But there is a very, very easy
way to get a simple animation,

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.910
to which is you just put this
into your style.xml.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:25.290
You can put
android:animateLayoutChanges

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:29.970
true, and that property will
then actually animate the

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.030
insertion of a new item into
your action bar instead of

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.770
just having it pop into place.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:39.070
So it's not like a great big
animation, but at least it

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.940
gradually slides all the
existing items over and puts

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:42.820
it in there.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:43.510
NICK BUTCHER: I've
not tried that.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:45.570
Is that similar to when you
invoke the contextual action

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.880
bar and it kind of does a nice
little rotate animation.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.460
Is it similar to that?

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.270
SPARKY RHODE: It's
not a rotate.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.980
It's just a little
slide into place.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:53.570
NICK BUTCHER: That sounds cool.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:53.970
Cool.

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.380
Didn't know that.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.080
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah, I mean--

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.720
NICK BUTCHER: So where do
you put animate changes?

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.970
Where do you state that?

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.260
SPARKY RHODE: So it's
interesting.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:11.210
It's listed as a property
on view containers.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:15.940
But I didn't see any way to
access the action bar as a

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:16.560
view container.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.230
I didn't find any API
to hang that on.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:25.450
So I put it into the top
level of style.xml.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:25.750
So I said--

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:26.120
NICK BUTCHER: Oh.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.060
So every layout change
will be animated.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:29.590
SPARKY RHODE: Yes.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.130
Exactly.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.010
That's what I did.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:33.850
So.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:34.240
NICK BUTCHER: Mm.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.220
Sounds a little bit too broad.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.105
You should probably be able to
apply it just to the action

00:17:39.105 --> 00:17:40.645
bar somehow.

00:17:40.645 --> 00:17:43.110
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah, I couldn't
find an API to specifically

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.710
hang it on the action bar.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:48.656
Maybe there is one, but
I didn't see it.

00:17:48.656 --> 00:17:49.118
NICK BUTCHER: Hmm.

00:17:49.118 --> 00:17:50.966
[LAUGHS].

00:17:50.966 --> 00:17:51.890
RICH HYNDMAN: Hmm.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:52.360
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.560
[LAUGHS].

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.370
SPARKY RHODE: Then I went
on to say there are some

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:01.250
callbacks that happen in
response to adding things to

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.570
the action bar.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.890
And you could always catch those
callbacks and insert

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.400
your own animation
if you wanted to.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.680
Draw animator rectangle of
zipples going from your button

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.870
to the action bar, and then push
everything over and grow

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:16.600
it into place.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.550
Something like that.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.036
You could probably patch into
those callbacks and put that

00:18:21.036 --> 00:18:22.260
in yourself.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:26.420
NICK BUTCHER: With your
action view, perhaps.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.260
Because expanding class
in an action view.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.740
So essentially you're writing
you own view, aren't you?

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.500
The action view is like
the search view is.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.190
So I think once you're in that
territory, you can just use

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:39.300
the normal view property
animator methods.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.550
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:18:43.744 --> 00:18:45.270
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.070
SPARKY RHODE: I see that
Giuseppe has given us a

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.100
question on the sidebar.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:54.720
He says, "I would like to know
if, for the future, Google is

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.880
planning to do any own IDEs
specific for Android instead

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:04.050
of Eclipse?"

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.990
I've been in companies that
have gone down that road

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:12.060
before, and making your own IDE
is a huge amount of work

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.080
with relatively little marginal
additional benefit.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.620
And that's why there exist
things like Eclipse, which

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.810
companies very commonly
will either fork--

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.020
which is also an approach
I don't recommend--

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.440
or write plug-ins for
as we do today.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.010
NICK BUTCHER: Didn't we just get
behind joining the Eclipse

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.930
Foundation yesterday
or something?

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.650
AL SUTTON: Google became a
strategic member of the

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.140
Eclipse Foundation, which means
it's going to provide

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.850
the organization with eight
full-time developers to work

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:40.280
on Eclipse.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.480
So hopefully work from the
inside rather than making a

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.170
copy and working from
the outside.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.610
GIUSEPPE: Good.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:47.994
WIEBE ELSINGA: More stability.

00:19:47.994 --> 00:19:48.898
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, that's
much better.

00:19:48.898 --> 00:19:50.930
NICK BUTCHER: And I think
generally our approach with

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.940
the Android tooling as well is
to try to be as IDE-agnostic

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.970
as possible.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.720
So while we try to provide
good support in Eclipse--

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.110
because that's the most
used IDE [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.280
that's out there--

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.030
but I think most of the tooling
is designed to have an

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.860
API surface that can be hooked
into other things.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.910
So IntelliJ, for example,
is very popular.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:15.010
IDE is able to take advantage
of all the many ADT

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.390
improvements quite quickly.

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:17.440
So, yeah.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.650
I think we attack it from
both fronts, really.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:21.000
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.140
So I'm actually really glad to
think that we're not making

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:25.970
our own IDE.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.220
I think that would
be a mistake.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.210
RICH HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:31.655
GIUSEPPE: Excellent.

00:20:31.655 --> 00:20:32.100
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.780
Al Sutton is typing.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:34.540
[LAUGHS].

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.250
He just put a link to the--

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.380
AL SUTTON: Just a URL
for you guys.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.616
RICH HYNDMAN: --Google
Eclipse detail.

00:20:38.616 --> 00:20:39.030
GIUSEPPE: Thanks.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.820
Thanks, Al.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.070
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.130
You said that we have
some questions

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.950
in the comment thread.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:48.340
NICK BUTCHER: Mm.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.190
A multitude of long questions.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:50.835
RICH HYNDMAN: Multitude
of long questions

00:20:50.835 --> 00:20:52.340
in the comment thread.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.350
SPARKY RHODE: Oh, goodness.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.860
NICK BUTCHER: Firstly, David
says, "nice shirts."

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:56.720
MATT GAUNT: Thanks.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:56.920
WIEBE ELSINGA: Thanks.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.320
RICH HYNDMAN: Cheers.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:57.835
NICK BUTCHER: Thanks.

00:20:57.835 --> 00:20:59.640
RICH HYNDMAN: Classically
attired.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.890
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:03.285 --> 00:21:04.230
NICK BUTCHER: It's
a strong shirt.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.345
And then also, it goes on to
ask-- he flatters first to get

00:21:06.345 --> 00:21:09.340
our attention, and then asks,
"Do you think to include QR

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.670
technologies more in Android
systems?" To which I would

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.894
probably say, duh?

00:21:15.894 --> 00:21:18.510
RICH HYNDMAN: But didn't the
original ZXing zebra crossing

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.275
library did come out
of Google, right?

00:21:20.275 --> 00:21:21.470
NICK BUTCHER: Mm-hmm.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:25.540
RICH HYNDMAN: So everybody has
the capability to have QR

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.660
technologies inside every single
Android device and

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.920
every Android app.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.810
So, the only thing we could
go further would be

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.070
pre-installing that on
the apps, I guess--

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.720
on the devices.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.276
But that doesn't sound
like something we

00:21:36.276 --> 00:21:37.690
would go out and do.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.635
NICK BUTCHER: I like it when
the OS doesn't try and do

00:21:39.635 --> 00:21:40.600
everything as well.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:45.020
It kind of leaves room for this
vibrant app kind of model

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.210
ecosystem out there.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.647
But by standardizing
on certain intents,

00:21:48.647 --> 00:21:50.140
they can all compete.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.650
RICH HYNDMAN: It would be
maybe nice if the camera

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:54.530
recognized QR codes and said,
you don't have a QR code

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:55.500
scanner installed.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.475
Would you like to choose one?

00:21:57.475 --> 00:21:58.850
AL SUTTON: They could
make Goggles the

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.410
default camera app.

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:01.710
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, Goggles
doesn't even come

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.015
pre-installed, does it?

00:22:03.015 --> 00:22:03.380
AL SUTTON: No.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.550
One of the things would be
putting it into the framework

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.370
would cause a problem for Google
TV which, of course,

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.100
doesn't have a camera
embedded in it.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.502
So what would applications do?

00:22:11.502 --> 00:22:12.430
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.840
True.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.220
RICH HYNDMAN: Just like
the camera app

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.830
that's in the framework.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.080
[LAUGHS].

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.300
Yeah.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.235
But, really, I think the answer
to that is you don't

00:22:25.235 --> 00:22:27.560
really comment.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.610
SPARKY RHODE: I think having
a QR reader is really nice.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.470
QR as a method of sharing leaves
a little something to

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.090
be desired.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:36.000
So for a sharing UX, I
think we're leaning

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.350
more towards NFC instead.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.040
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.510
High five that Beam.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:42.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.500
MATT GAUNT: This goes for the
two people go into high five

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.370
and their phones just go pfff!

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:48.370
MATT GAUNT: Anyway.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:48.640
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.450
High five slow, and slow-motion
high five, and

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:51.500
speeding on the way through.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:51.865
MATT GAUNT: Gentle--

00:22:51.865 --> 00:22:53.170
RICH HYNDMAN: And then psssh.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:53.930
NICK BUTCHER: You want
to read this--

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.868
one of the long questions?

00:22:55.868 --> 00:22:57.780
RICH HYNDMAN: Read it off the
10-inch tablet because it's

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.740
such a question.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.310
MATT GAUNT: So, Andre.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.130
Question one of three.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.000
"We are working on a product
that uses In-App

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:04.700
subscriptions.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.130
When the app search service is
running, it uses some of our

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:07.630
server resources.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.385
That costs us money."

00:23:09.385 --> 00:23:12.520
And the problem is, "what can
we do if someone creates an

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.350
account, buys a subscription,
and then shares the account

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:18.380
between 20 people or worse
on some forum?

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.730
Can we only allow, say, five
simultaneous connections from

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.520
one account to be active
at the same time?

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.930
I know that if you buy something
in your account, it

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.270
should be accessible on
all of your devices.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:31.040
I hope the suggested solution
doesn't break this rule.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.750
Service accessible, but you have
to disable it first, or

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.510
somewhere else."

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:38.050
RICH HYNDMAN: Which sounds like
you're allowing people to

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.820
buy a subscription to a set of
logon details that aren't

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.610
related to their device, which
maybe isn't a great idea.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.370
I mean, if you buy a
subscription, then you should

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.065
tie it to the account that
the subscription

00:23:50.065 --> 00:23:51.360
was purchased from.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.110
Because then you can check
if the person owns the

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:55.810
subscription, and if they're
logged in with that email

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.670
address on all their devices,
they get access to that

00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:59.465
subscription from all
their devices.

00:23:59.465 --> 00:24:01.360
NICK BUTCHER: So you're saying
if they share that account.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.130
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:02.910
Like [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.930
shell account just for buying
a subscription.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.723
RICH HYNDMAN: That would break
the entire Play model.

00:24:07.723 --> 00:24:09.536
I mean, you could buy every app
in one account then share

00:24:09.536 --> 00:24:10.912
it with a thousand friends.

00:24:10.912 --> 00:24:13.660
And actually, we would probably
shut it down, but--

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.290
if--

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:16.170
seems--

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.420
SPARKY RHODE: I have noticed
that some of the Google Play

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.110
properties do ref counting.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:27.110
The other day, I was a
little bit surprised.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.000
I was not expecting it.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.710
I tried to listen to a music
track using Google Music, and

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.370
I got a little dialog box that
says, attention, you already

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.960
have 10 devices registered to
this Google Music account.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.490
Please de-authorize one.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:40.910
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.820
Anyone who tests a lot
of devices gets that.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.820
I've been there as well.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.330
It's not just because we all
have 10 devices each, but as--

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.790
this is a problem I faced
with Eurosports as well.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.360
You subscribe to that and it
only allows five devices.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.240
So as you migrate across
devices and you change

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.420
handsets and tablets, the
service provider needs to

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.480
provide an interface--

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.300
which we do for Google Music and
Eurosport as well, where

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.590
you can log into the internet
and then say, it no longer

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.470
works on this device, this
device or this device.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:07.412
NICK BUTCHER: So that's why the
question is asking, can

00:25:07.412 --> 00:25:08.060
they do that?

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.690
Can they have a maximum number
of devices from which it will

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.650
allow the subscription?

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:14.380
I don't know.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.960
And does it break any
rules to do that?

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.510
I don't know of any rules
they're breaking--

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.760
RICH HYNDMAN: No, the Eurosport
app does it, and

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.850
I've never heard any
complaints to

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:22.230
tell me about it.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:23.340
NICK BUTCHER: That's using
our subscription?

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.740
RICH HYNDMAN: And Music.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.630
SPARKY RHODE: It does seem like
you ought to be able to

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.220
say,

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:28.675
RICH HYNDMAN: As long as it's
in the terms and conditions.

00:25:28.675 --> 00:25:31.600
SPARKY RHODE: --no more than
five devices in one day,

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.190
perhaps, or something
like that.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.140
RICH HYNDMAN: It's going to come
down to whether you start

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.300
getting bad user feedback and
lower ratings, in which case

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.580
you need to change your
system, really.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.065
I mean, the users will revolt if
you implement it poorly, so

00:25:43.065 --> 00:25:45.210
that they aren't constantly
having to authorize and view

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.820
authorized devices.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.320
NICK BUTCHER: I think he's
happy with that.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.660
I think he's mostly concerned,
is he breaking any of our

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.700
rules, because we are very keen
on subscriptions being

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.385
available on all a
user's devices.

00:25:55.385 --> 00:25:55.930
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:59.094
NICK BUTCHER: And the answer, I
don't think any of us know,

00:25:59.094 --> 00:26:00.250
but I doubt it.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:00.940
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.990
Like you say, if you start
getting negative feedback,

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:05.680
then it sounds like you're
doing something wrong.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.080
I don't think anyone would sit
there and complain, oh, I've

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.412
tried to download this onto my
20th device, and you're saying

00:26:10.412 --> 00:26:11.040
I can't do it.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.450
What's wrong?

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:12.860
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:13.702
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:26:13.702 --> 00:26:14.965
RICH HYNDMAN: Potentially,
I mean.

00:26:14.965 --> 00:26:17.290
SPARKY RHODE: Seems like an
opportunity for an ask for the

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:22.510
Google Play infrastructure to
watch for signs of abusive

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.430
numbers of devices configured
to a single account or

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:26.720
something like that.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.260
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, I'm
sure it already does.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.520
SPARKY RHODE: Maybe.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:31.950
Cool.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:34.232
NICK BUTCHER: Flags do fly.

00:26:34.232 --> 00:26:36.290
MATT GAUNT: So, should I move
on to question two?

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:37.540
RICH HYNDMAN: Go on, man,
part two of three.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.020
MATT GAUNT: Go on then.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.410
Number two.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.925
"Why doesn't the billing service
give us the account

00:26:41.925 --> 00:26:43.750
that was used for the
In-App purchase?

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.360
It would be really useful when
there is more than one account

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.470
on the phone.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.310
Now anyone on a Rigid phone can
just copy the DB, say that

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:51.910
you've bought the
subscription.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.860
We can't verify if the account
that bought it is really on

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.610
the phone, because we don't
know which one it was.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.310
When you encrypt the DB with
some device-unique key, it's

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.970
just a minor bump on
the way to create a

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:07.620
crack-up." So, yes.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.786
Getting access to the
actual account.

00:27:09.786 --> 00:27:11.120
It's an interesting one.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.790
SPARKY RHODE: Doesn't the
Google Play merchant

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.370
transaction history
say what account?

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.060
RICH HYNDMAN: It does, but it's
awkward to get to, and

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.700
it's not on the device.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:19.950
SPARKY RHODE: Mm.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:23.780
RICH HYNDMAN: You get
the transaction ID

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.260
on the device, right?

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:25.600
NICK BUTCHER: Mm-hmm.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.720
SPARKY RHODE: Hmm.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.970
AL SUTTON: You could use it to
log into a damp app engine

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.840
application using the Account
Manager, which would register

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.160
that subscription as being
active, and that would give

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.690
you the details that come from
the Account Manager for the

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.016
Google account.

00:27:40.016 --> 00:27:41.160
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, there
is a bit of a

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:41.820
disjoint, isn't there?

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.880
Asking the users to choose
which account, or--

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.000
NICK BUTCHER: But how do you
know which account, if they

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.680
have multiple accounts
on the device, Al?

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.680
AL SUTTON: And that would
be the problem.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.100
They'd have to select one.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.350
But I'm guessing if they're
buying it, they'd pick which

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.470
one they want to associate
it with.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.770
If you pop the dialog up saying,
which of the Google

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.580
accounts on the device do you
want to associate this

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:58.830
subscription with?

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.120
RICH HYNDMAN: Hmm.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.732
NICK BUTCHER: I think
that would

00:28:03.732 --> 00:28:04.960
probably be the best bet.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.560
SPARKY RHODE: I would think
that you probably couldn't

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.880
associate the subscription with
any account other than

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.130
the one that bought it.

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:12.150
That bought the app, but--

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:15.510
MATT GAUNT: Can't you get a list
of purchased items from

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:19.676
the billing service for
the logged-in account?

00:28:19.676 --> 00:28:22.540
Because isn't it in the sample
app, if you're doing--

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.090
RICH HYNDMAN: No.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.815
Oh, you mean do a--

00:28:23.815 --> 00:28:24.500
MATT GAUNT: Restore
transactions.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.105
RICH HYNDMAN: Restore
transactions.

00:28:25.105 --> 00:28:26.350
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.750
And then you--

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.360
RICH HYNDMAN: So then you could
find out which is the--

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:29.910
MATT GAUNT: See, yeah, you--

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.370
RICH HYNDMAN: If the current
account logged in is the one

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:32.740
that bought the thing you could
find out from that.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.180
MATT GAUNT: You'd have to
match transactions ID,

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.830
otherwise you'd just have
to then say, no, you--

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:38.020
RICH HYNDMAN: Also, restore
transactions works on the

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.400
account you bought it from,
not the one that's

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.650
currently logged in.

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.672
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, there is
a bit of a disjoint.

00:28:45.672 --> 00:28:47.500
I guess it would be nice to
have an API where you say,

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.620
this is transaction ID, this is
the account they logged in.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.060
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.492
MATT GAUNT: Does this match?

00:28:52.492 --> 00:28:53.190
NICK BUTCHER: What if
the billing service

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.383
returned the account?

00:28:54.383 --> 00:28:54.866
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:28:54.866 --> 00:28:56.315
RICH HYNDMAN: If the billing
service returned the account,

00:28:56.315 --> 00:28:57.281
it probably should be easier.

00:28:57.281 --> 00:28:58.247
NICK BUTCHER: Good feedback.

00:28:58.247 --> 00:28:58.730
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:02.056
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, it's good
feedback from Audrey there--

00:29:02.056 --> 00:29:03.532
Andre?

00:29:03.532 --> 00:29:04.782
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.872
All we can do is pass that
back to the billing team.

00:29:11.872 --> 00:29:13.020
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:13.690
RICH HYNDMAN: And see
if they come back

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:14.940
with a better solution.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:18.400
Hmm.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:18.800
Yeah, go on.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.690
Might as well go on
to part three,

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:20.590
even though we haven't--

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:21.840
MATT GAUNT: Thanks
for nothing.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.660
"I haven't found out anywhere in
the docs what happens when

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.470
the account that was used for
buying the subscription is

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:28.650
removed from the phone.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.870
Do you receive a cancelled
purchase broadcast sent by the

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:36.110
bank's service?" I wouldn't
have thought so.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.100
SPARKY RHODE: No, I don't
think so, either.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.470
MATT GAUNT: It would still
be part of the account.

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:40.205
RICH HYNDMAN: That person is
still subscribed to it, and

00:29:40.205 --> 00:29:41.810
they can still log into the
Play Store and see their

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.100
subscriptions on the web.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.260
MATT GAUNT: I don't think you
get a cancellation signal

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.000
unless they go into the Play
Store and hit Cancel.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.620
RICH HYNDMAN: I don't think
it's cancelled, yeah.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.300
That would suggest that if you
reset your device, it would

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.390
cancel all your subscriptions
until you then re-added the

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:54.880
account, and then re-added
them again.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.906
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:29:55.906 --> 00:29:57.840
But I guess this kind of comes
down to what we talked about

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.910
in the first question, where if
you start sort of managing

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:04.530
the user devices that they've
logged in on, then this kind

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:06.400
of starts coming out for free.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.860
Rather than cancelling it the
minute they disconnect that

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.920
account from a device, they
cancel it on whatever

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.650
mechanism you come up with.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:16.760
RICH HYNDMAN: Also, you don't
get cancellation notifications

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.740
at the time.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.530
You just get the--

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.950
at the end of the billing
cycle, you get the--

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:24.410
it's then cancelled.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:25.660
Instead of re--

00:30:52.264 --> 00:30:54.495
They did.

00:30:54.495 --> 00:30:58.200
Sorry, there was a comment
thread that you liked?

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.550
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:01.010
I think it's Chow?

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.440
Hi.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:01.870
I am Chow.

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:04.960
I live in Phnom Penh,
Cambodia.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.980
I want to join your
Hangouts now.

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.100
I love Android so much.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:08.792
How can I join you?

00:31:08.792 --> 00:31:09.140
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh, that's nice.

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:12.070
I'll add you to the Hangout
Circles, Phnom Penh, and you

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.560
can come in.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.280
I mean, we've got one, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.744
seven-- yeah, we've got room.

00:31:15.744 --> 00:31:17.712
I'll see if I can
add you as a--

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:26.160
SPARKY RHODE: While I was out of
the loop for a moment, did

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.600
you guys get to Giuseppe's
question

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.264
about reply to comments?

00:31:31.264 --> 00:31:32.240
MALE VOICE: Nope.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.090
Go for it, Sparky.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:36.580
GIUSEPPE: Can I ask in person?

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.090
SPARKY RHODE: Please.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:39.330
GIUSEPPE: OK.

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:42.020
Well, I have a couple of
question about the Play

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.020
Console, OK?

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.570
The first--

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:48.640
I think that the first is, it's
very famous, but we need

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:53.010
to at the whole find a way to
reply to people that give

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:54.060
their stupid--

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:54.990
sorry--

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:59.090
their comments to the
application using the video.

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:02.760
So we have to find the solution
as soon as possible,

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.350
because we need to reply them.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:08.490
Otherwise, you make a lot of job
a lotter job, and because

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:13.200
the user don't know how to use
the application, or probably,

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.850
he don't know well the English,
then at the whole he

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:19.180
would put just that one stars,
and your application rate

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.430
would go down.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:21.610
The second question--

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:24.150
I will give all the three
questions all together, then

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.490
you can reply all.

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:31.480
The second question is, we
develop an application that

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.160
make possible to the user
to make a music job.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.460
They can--

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.190
Richard probably know better
this application that I'm

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.780
talking about.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.161
They can compose music, they can
mix, they can blah, blah,

00:32:45.161 --> 00:32:46.470
blah, et cetera, et cetera.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:51.010
We would like to use the In-App
store to make possible

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:56.820
for the users to resell
to us their jobs.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:00.730
I mean, for example, I make you
the music mix, I make the

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:05.540
very good music song, then
I probably share on the--

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.530
of course, on the server
maintained by us.

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:13.280
But I would like the In-App
to resell this product.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:19.940
And last question is, how do
we do for the API without

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.990
Merchant Key?

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:26.020
I know that Merchant Key exists
only for USA and UK

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:31.960
people, but here in Italy, we
cannot use the API, because we

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.390
don't have the Merchant Key.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:37.720
We have just the co-merchant
key.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.970
That's all.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.510
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:42.550
So I can talk about
the second one.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.810
What was the first one?

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:44.090
I kind of missed it.

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:44.460
I was--

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.840
MATT GAUNT: Can he have
reply to comments?

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:48.860
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh, fair enough.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.710
Ellie spoke about reply to
comments on our Hangout that

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:55.940
we did with the publisher
site team [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.120
on Monday--

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.150
the Google Play Developer
Console preview team--

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:05.020
and she didn't announce
anything new about it.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:09.224
Just said that we're currently
still trialing it, and we'll

00:34:09.224 --> 00:34:11.100
announce something when we have
something to announce,

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.540
unfortunately.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:12.969
On these--

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:13.590
NICK BUTCHER: We hear
you, though.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.139
RICH HYNDMAN: We hear you.

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:14.750
NICK BUTCHER: We want to.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.010
RICH HYNDMAN: The second
question is a reasonable one

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.810
to discuss.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:20.360
So they have an application
where the users of the

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.690
application create
sounds and music.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:22.389
MATT GAUNT: Mm-hmm.

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:23.870
RICH HYNDMAN: And then, in the
app, they want to have a store

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:25.739
where other people can
buy the sounds and

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:26.664
music that you've created.

00:34:26.664 --> 00:34:27.250
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:28.659
RICH HYNDMAN: And they want that
store to be powered by

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:29.683
our In-App purchases.

00:34:29.683 --> 00:34:30.409
MATT GAUNT: OK.

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:30.860
RICH HYNDMAN: And then--

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.350
so they'll get the money and
then they'll distribute it

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:35.980
back across to the people that
have created the music.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:36.900
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.494
RICH HYNDMAN: So the only way I
thought of doing that was to

00:34:39.494 --> 00:34:42.230
have un-managed purchases at
various prices, because you

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:45.119
can't really go and start
changing your In-App purchases

00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:47.330
for every single track
that somebody lists.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:47.570
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.360
RICH HYNDMAN: But then it's
quite hard to figure out what

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.780
everybody's bought.

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:51.550
You'd have to manage
that on your--

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:53.310
NICK BUTCHER: The catch was
the-- you can't distribute a

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:55.010
store in our store.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.200
RICH HYNDMAN: But
it's using our--

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.810
the In-App billing items.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:34:59.150
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.640
RICH HYNDMAN: It's not a--

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.305
NICK BUTCHER: Maybe
you can use,

00:35:00.305 --> 00:35:02.610
like an internal currency.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:04.564
That would be quite a nice
way of doing it.

00:35:04.564 --> 00:35:04.961
SPARKY RHODE: Hmm.

00:35:04.961 --> 00:35:07.050
RICH HYNDMAN: And then you
can clear it in and out.

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:08.720
You can buy credits for songs.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.005
MATT GAUNT: And then plus you'd
start then being able to

00:35:10.005 --> 00:35:11.370
manage your own transaction
history.

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:12.680
SPARKY RHODE: Wow.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.400
I like that.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.280
Make it like a jukebox and
you buy virtual quarters.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.480
Or nickels, if you're
old school.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.474
[LAUGHS].

00:35:19.474 --> 00:35:20.330
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:21.760
Yeah, that could work,
couldn't it?

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.360
And then you could either
use your currency--

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.750
when you upload tracks, you
either get currency which you

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.950
can re-spend in the app, or you
can check it out at some

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.650
point via--

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:31.450
that becomes a problem
as well.

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:32.170
I guess.

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:33.000
If you're buying, how
do you get the money

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.650
back out of the system?

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:37.650
MATT GAUNT: Well, would it
be a problem, though?

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.520
Because if you've got the money
that someone's paying to

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.550
the developer through the
In-App purchasing, then

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:47.450
essentially it's a separate
agreement between the

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:49.810
developer and then the person
who's made the mix.

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:53.190
So then that's outside
of Google--

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:56.410
GIUSEPPE: I have an
idea to suggest.

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:59.250
I don't know if that
applicable.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:07.460
We must have an In-App item that
allows to the user to buy

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:13.500
any kind of a list, any item
in the list, in some list,

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.940
that have this value
in, like, points.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.320
Let's suppose like coins, OK?

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:23.050
He buy, for example,
five Euro of items.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:27.520
And each songs, one cost one
Euro, one cost of cents of

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.580
Euro, et cetera, et cetera.

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:35.930
And then he can spend these
credits buying these items.

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:40.130
But at the end, the money must
go to the developers, and

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:43.820
divide with the Google,
of course, as is now.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:49.820
But we must find some way to
give credit to the users, and

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:54.380
then they can spend this money
on any kind of items.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:58.310
And the items will not
have a price, but

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:02.030
will have coins value.

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.450
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:06.280
GIUSEPPE: Five coins, ten coins,
like games that we sell

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.520
around the world.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.885
WIEBE ELSINGA: So you're not
selling the application or the

00:37:09.885 --> 00:37:11.764
email purchase, but you're
selling the coins?

00:37:11.764 --> 00:37:12.198
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:37:12.198 --> 00:37:13.500
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.350
AL SUTTON: Can the--

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:16.960
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, the application
has been paid by

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.030
real money.

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:20.810
But the internal items--

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.210
so, songs, et cetera,
et cetera--

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.340
can be buy with coins.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.883
But to get coins, you need to
pre-pay something, some part.

00:37:28.883 --> 00:37:29.670
MALE VOICE: Yeah.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:32.220
AL SUTTON: Will the songs be
playable outside of your

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.870
application?

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:37.000
GIUSEPPE: Sorry, I
didn't get you.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.750
AL SUTTON: When the user buys
a song and downloads it, are

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.770
you intending them to be able
to play it outside of your

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:47.640
application on, say,
other devices?

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.830
GIUSEPPE: No, I don't.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:50.790
Not at all.

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:54.940
The song or the pieces will
be useful only for own

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.410
application.

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:57.930
AL SUTTON: Cool.

00:37:57.930 --> 00:37:59.950
It's just, well, that's one of
the things that's prohibited

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:04.380
by Play Store is downloading
songs for redistribution.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.220
GIUSEPPE: Yes.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.590
SPARKY RHODE: I think
the virtual currency

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:10.145
idea is a good idea.

00:38:10.145 --> 00:38:11.320
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, virtual
currency.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:11.510
Yes.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.695
This is what we must do.

00:38:12.695 --> 00:38:16.710
SPARKY RHODE: The question is
how much of that can the

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:20.350
Google Play infrastructure
provide for you.

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:22.470
And I'm thinking probably
not very much.

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.140
Basically, just the management
and selling of the virtual

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.540
coins is about the--

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.050
as far as I know, that's
probably about what you can

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:32.220
get from Google Play.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:32.690
NICK BUTCHER: Right.

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:33.470
You're probably going
to do it as an

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:34.240
un-managed purchase, right?

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.800
So you're going to have to
have your own server-side

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.780
infrastructure to keep
track of each user's

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.070
balance, and so forth.

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:40.690
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:41.160
RICH HYNDMAN: Right.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.970
SPARKY RHODE: As well as the
redistribution of money out to

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:45.160
the artists.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:45.990
MATT GAUNT: Yep.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.176
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, we're
not going to do

00:38:47.176 --> 00:38:49.770
anything other than that.

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:50.690
GIUSEPPE: That is the point.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:53.460
The distribution of the money.

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:54.270
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:57.610
I don't think we provide
anything off the shelf for

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:58.480
that, do we?

00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:58.800
NICK BUTCHER: Well, no.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.380
If Google Music is launched in
your territory, you could

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.950
encourage them to do the--

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.820
what's that thing where you can
sign up to sell your own

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.430
songs on Google Music?

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:06.260
Encourage them to do that.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.510
MATT GAUNT: Awesome.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:11.660
RICH HYNDMAN: We've talked about
this app for the last 10

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.550
minutes, but you haven't said
what your app's actually

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:14.800
called, Giuseppe?

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.200
What's the application called
that you're talking about, so

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.291
people can go and try
it out if they want?

00:39:24.291 --> 00:39:25.320
Oh, you're on mute.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.690
Someone has muted you.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:27.160
GIUSEPPE: Ah.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.570
Yeah, someone.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.240
In a few seconds someone is
muting me, I don't know why.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:35.530
Anyway, the name of the
application is Voice Pro.

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:36.650
NICK BUTCHER: Voice Pro.

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:37.220
RICH HYNDMAN: Voice Pro.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:37.880
GIUSEPPE: Voice Pro.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.920
Yes.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.740
RICH HYNDMAN: Lots of native
audio processing.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:44.680
Apply effects to your tracks,
do lots of different

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:49.970
processing on them, and very
fast in the background.

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:52.100
NICK BUTCHER: But is the rest
of the world ready?

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.182
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:53.182 --> 00:39:56.014
GIUSEPPE: And what about
the Merchant Key?

00:39:56.014 --> 00:39:56.840
NICK BUTCHER: I don't
understand--

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.960
RICH HYNDMAN: What about
the Merchant Key?

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.610
So you're saying that--

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:03.705
is this the server-to-server
In-App billing?

00:40:03.705 --> 00:40:04.110
GIUSEPPE: Mm-hmm.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:06.240
RICH HYNDMAN: You're saying
that, to use that API, the--

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.540
GIUSEPPE: Yes, yes.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.190
RICH HYNDMAN: You need
the Merchant Key?

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.396
GIUSEPPE: Yes.

00:40:08.396 --> 00:40:11.301
We can't, because we don't
have the Merchant Key.

00:40:11.301 --> 00:40:15.546
RICH HYNDMAN: I thought it was
a standard OAuth to log in,

00:40:15.546 --> 00:40:17.620
and you didn't need the
Merchant Key for it.

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:25.190
Have you-- you've tried to
go through the flow?

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:27.110
GIUSEPPE: Yeah.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:31.510
If I check in my Checkout
account, and go in the

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:36.000
settings, I don't have the
Merchant Key like other people

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.990
in UK or in USA.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:43.860
So without the Merchant Key, I
cannot use at all the API.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.480
MATT GAUNT: You do have
to do something there.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.885
You have to set up the account
you want the payments to go to

00:40:47.885 --> 00:40:49.135
or something, don't you?

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.950
RICH HYNDMAN: I'll have a
quick look into that.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:54.980
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.740
RICH HYNDMAN: Once we answer
the next question off the

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.275
comment thread or
the Moderator.

00:40:59.275 --> 00:41:03.870
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, but if you will
access from UK account,

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:05.520
you will see the Merchant Key.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.820
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah,
I know that only

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.460
UK and US have merchants.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.820
So I'll see what you're
supposed to do.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.070
NICK BUTCHER: See if something
is needed.

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:17.740
RICH HYNDMAN: So just carry
on through the--

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.090
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:20.319
To go to the next question.

00:41:20.319 --> 00:41:21.245
SPARKY RHODE: All right.

00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:23.660
Should we see what's next
on the Moderator?

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.150
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:25.250
Accept one from the Moderator.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:27.700
SPARKY RHODE: OK.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.975
This is from--

00:41:28.975 --> 00:41:31.770
it looks like Desgraci
in Colombia.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.610
It says, "A custom fragment out
of emanation--" Heh, heh,

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:35.040
can't talk--

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.400
"custom fragment animation
problem when I pop out a

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.970
fragment from the back stack.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:42.010
The enter animation works,
but the exit one

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.390
doesn't, because it never--

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:46.500
it doesn't show the animation,
then it doesn't take the

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:50.610
fragment out from
the back stack."

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:51.510
Don't know.

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:56.800
I'm guessing that if the exit
animation is not being shown,

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.140
maybe it's just that the
fragment isn't being removed

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.890
from the fragment collection,
like via a Fragment

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:03.450
Transaction.

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:06.390
And I think the back stack
is just a separate issue.

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:11.170
But I'm sort of speculating
there.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:11.590
I don't know.

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:15.360
Does that ring any bells
with you guys?

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:17.370
MATT GAUNT: Can't say I can
comment on this one.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.040
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.350
The only gotchas I've come
across with those is when you

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.121
are adding it to--

00:42:25.121 --> 00:42:29.090
when you have the fragment and
you specify your own custom

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:32.700
animations, it just accepts an
ID, doesn't it, which is the

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:33.260
animation type.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.950
And I've had people have
problems when they're

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:37.920
specifying the old type
animations, not the new type

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.440
animations.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.220
So, rather than the
android.view.animation type

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.230
animation, you need to use an

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:45.380
android.animation type animation.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.645
So I've come across issues with
that way, if you supplied

00:42:47.645 --> 00:42:48.650
the wrong type of animation.

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:49.820
Because it's just
an int, right?

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:50.230
It's not type saved.

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:52.370
It's just an int pointing
towards a res ID.

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:55.570
If you're supplying the wrong
kind of animation resource,

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:57.500
then it obviously won't play.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.920
But yeah, I've had
issues with that.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.456
But beyond that, without having
a look at the code, I'm

00:43:01.456 --> 00:43:02.540
a bit stumped.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:02.940
SPARKY RHODE: Right.

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.070
So you don't--

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:04.540
OK.

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:09.780
So nothing really jumps out at
you with regards to how to get

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:11.720
the animation and then the
back stack removal

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.443
specifically when you're getting
rid of the fragment.

00:43:14.443 --> 00:43:16.120
NICK BUTCHER: No, you should
just happen, right?

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.895
Like if you just do add to back
stack, null, and then

00:43:18.895 --> 00:43:21.260
when you hit Back or whatever,
it should remove it probably

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.140
from the back stack and also
play the animation.

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:24.800
But, yeah.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.090
It sounds like that's not
happening, so without seeing

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:28.972
the code, it's kind
of hard to debug.

00:43:28.972 --> 00:43:29.390
SPARKY RHODE: OK.

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:32.640
So maybe a good piece of advice
for him would be put it

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.685
on Stack Overflow and
send us a link.

00:43:34.685 --> 00:43:36.692
NICK BUTCHER: Mm, yeah.

00:43:36.692 --> 00:43:37.600
SPARKY RHODE: OK.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.330
NICK BUTCHER: Absolutely.

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:40.250
Have you got an answer
for us, Rich?

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:42.605
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah,
again, using--

00:43:42.605 --> 00:43:44.110
I've been through the
subscription documentation.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:47.790
I can't find anything in the
documentation which suggests

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:49.400
you need a Merchant
ID to use the

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.480
subscriptions server interface.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.800
So you get all the IDs you need
from the API console.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:02.700
So if you can point me to
where you're finding the

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.940
problem, I can look
into it more.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.585
But from what I can see, you
don't need the Merchant ID to

00:44:06.585 --> 00:44:09.820
do the subscriptions requests.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.350
And I've done an implementation
of it myself,

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:13.960
and made the requests myself.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.190
And I can't remember
ever using that

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:18.390
Merchant ID for anything.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:20.320
GIUSEPPE: Mm.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:25.480
Are we talking about
the same API IP?

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:30.430
Because I'm talking about
Checkout API, and not the

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:31.370
Google Play store.

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:32.203
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh.

00:44:32.203 --> 00:44:34.960
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, not the
subscriptions API.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:35.290
RICH HYNDMAN: Right.

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:36.690
No, Checkout API is
only available in

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:38.640
the UK and the US.

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.200
GIUSEPPE: Yeah.

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:39.880
I need the Checkout.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.860
I need to have checks to
the Checkout data.

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:44.140
RICH HYNDMAN: Right.

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.606
GIUSEPPE: Probably I say the
Play Store, I'm wrong.

00:44:46.606 --> 00:44:49.970
RICH HYNDMAN: No, I'm not
sure that is possible.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:51.730
MATT GAUNT: And Richard's
off again.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:52.512
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:44:52.512 --> 00:44:54.020
Now I remember something
about that.

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:54.820
The--

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.620
yeah.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.840
NICK BUTCHER: OK, let's
move on while you--

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.730
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, go ahead.

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:01.710
GIUSEPPE: What happens
if an Italian

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:05.740
developers open an UK account?

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:08.210
What happened in that case?

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:08.860
NICK BUTCHER: What, especially
if you're

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:09.660
trying to sell stuff?

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.940
Then your account could get into
bad standing, because you

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.940
might have to verify that you
really are a UK business, and

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:16.500
you won't be able to do that.

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.370
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, at some
point it will ask for

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:20.730
verification.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:21.355
GIUSEPPE: Not a problem.

00:45:21.355 --> 00:45:21.680
No problem.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.200
NICK BUTCHER: If you're
a registered company--

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.930
RICH HYNDMAN: If you register
a company in the UK?

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:28.205
GIUSEPPE: I have already,
I have already.

00:45:28.205 --> 00:45:28.490
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:30.340
GIUSEPPE: I can use that,
I can use that.

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:36.680
But the problem is to move the
application from the old point

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.020
to the new one.

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:39.510
What will happen then?

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:41.320
NICK BUTCHER: That's
simple enough.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.940
GIUSEPPE: Can I change the
account and leaving

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.750
the name and the--

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:46.140
NICK BUTCHER: Yep.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.860
GIUSEPPE: Com dot
Voice Pro dot--

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:48.510
like the same?

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:48.790
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:49.140
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:50.700
You can move an application
between developer accounts,

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:51.680
that's not a problem.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.400
The only complications there
are that-- oh, you'll

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.440
obviously have a
new public key.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.480
Because it will be a different
developer account.

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:01.200
So anything which is using the
public key will have to have

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.115
the code updated.

00:46:02.115 --> 00:46:05.980
So In-App purchases--

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:06.940
GIUSEPPE: Oh, yes, yes, yes.

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:10.460
All the things that use a public
key, I have to update,

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.610
reboot, and republish again.

00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:15.760
But I can republish under
new name, right?

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:15.960
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.020
You'd normally publish an update
before the move which

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:21.625
accepts both public keys,
and then move the app.

00:46:21.625 --> 00:46:24.212
And then, at some point down
the line, remove the old

00:46:24.212 --> 00:46:25.900
public key from your code.

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.620
GIUSEPPE: Before to publish to
the new account, I need to

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.210
delete the old application?

00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:33.180
Because otherwise I will
duplicate the name?

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:33.650
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:34.500
GIUSEPPE: Yes.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.220
NICK BUTCHER: No, it's a move.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.470
It's not a take-down and
republish, it's a move.

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:38.330
It's a--

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:39.410
don't do that.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:42.050
Don't take it down and publish
the same thing, because you

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:44.055
can't, because the package
name will be taken.

00:46:44.055 --> 00:46:44.360
GIUSEPPE: Uh-huh.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.990
NICK BUTCHER: There's a form on
the Google Play help docs--

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:50.800
Rich, you want to place a link
to the transfer app form in

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:51.250
the comments?

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:51.980
GIUSEPPE: In the app docs?

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.210
In the app docs, I
will find move?

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:56.960
NICK BUTCHER: There's a process
you can ask us to move

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.820
an application between
developer accounts.

00:46:58.820 --> 00:46:59.230
GIUSEPPE: Oh.

00:46:59.230 --> 00:46:59.990
A process.

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.870
Oh, it's not automatically.

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:03.680
I cannot do myself, but I have
to ask someone to make--

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.430
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
don't do that.

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:07.395
Don't un-publish from one
account and try and re-publish

00:47:07.395 --> 00:47:09.690
from the other, because you
will not be able to.

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:10.210
GIUSEPPE: OK.

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:15.000
So do you suggest me to open
before the UK account, then

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.160
keep in touch with the back
office, and ask them to move

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.380
from here to here,
and that's all?

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.860
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:22.560
GIUSEPPE: OK.

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:26.130
But if they will move, they
will move it using the old

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:29.280
code with the old public
key, right?

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:29.770
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:32.680
This is why I say, before you
request the move, publish an

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:36.080
update to the application, so
that the application can

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:39.820
handle both the old and
the new public keys,

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.200
then ask for the move.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:41.610
GIUSEPPE: Ah, OK.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:42.030
AL SUTTON: I just put the

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:45.240
instructions in the chat window--

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.290
NICK BUTCHER: Ah, cool.

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:48.260
AL SUTTON: The instructions on
Google Play about getting it

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:49.750
transferred across.

00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.820
NICK BUTCHER: Thanks, Al.

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:51.130
Do you see that, Giuseppe?

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:51.490
So this is the--

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:52.410
GIUSEPPE: Thanks, all.

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:52.700
Thanks.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:53.320
Yes, all.

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.030
I see, I see.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.290
Thanks.

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:55.370
NICK BUTCHER: All right, let's
give someone else a chance to

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.940
ask something.

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.280
NICK BUTCHER: Any more Live
questions before we go back to

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.000
the comments on Moderator?

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.960
ERNEST: Yeah, I actually
have one.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:10.390
I'm trying to write a method now
that will basically tell

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:12.820
if there's been an update
in the application.

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:19.310
So basically if the version
code has changed.

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:22.250
And I'm just trying to
test this method.

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:29.230
So when I run it in Eclipse, if
I just run the application

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:32.110
with the changed version code,
do you know if that's

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:34.590
comparable to going
in the marketplace

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:38.380
and pressing Update?

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.970
SPARKY RHODE: I don't
think so.

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:42.210
I think that's out of band.

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:48.310
I mean, that's the Google Play
application that's managing

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:49.460
that for you.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:50.490
ERNEST: Mm.

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:53.050
SPARKY RHODE: So that's the
Google Play app on your device

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:54.640
talking to market and
saying, oh, look.

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.290
This APK changed.

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:58.630
Let's offer an update.

00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:02.190
ERNEST: Well, no, I have in my
application, like, on Create.

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:04.850
Like I have, hey, if
this version code

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:06.830
changed, run this.

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:09.220
But I'm trying to test
that, of course,

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.470
before I publish it.

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:16.260
So when I go into Eclipse and
I install it the first time,

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:21.500
on version code one, and then I
change something, and I put

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.960
version code two, will--

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:24.830
does--

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:27.660
basically, through Eclipse,
pick up that update?

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:28.830
MATT GAUNT: So--

00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:29.940
what--

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.240
ERNEST: Does it transfer over
as an update, and not just a

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.430
clean install?

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:36.720
MATT GAUNT: It depends on what
you're trying to compare it

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:37.120
to, I would have thought.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.140
Because you can get the version
number for the app

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.270
that's installed, but you need
to have saved the previous

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:44.140
version somewhere, right?

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:46.180
SPARKY RHODE: I think what
he's asking is, would the

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:48.460
update process happen
if you changed the

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.540
version number in Eclipse?

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:51.751
And I'm thinking, no.

00:49:51.751 --> 00:49:54.170
That when you click Run, it's
just going to take your

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:57.180
modified APK with the new
version number, plop it right

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.840
on top of the old one--

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.200
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.030
SPARKY RHODE: And run.

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:05.770
But that said, if you have--

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:08.830
I mean, say you have, for
example, databases.

00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:11.130
You can have version numbers

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:12.380
associated with your databases.

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:13.600
And your new app can
say, oh, look.

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.850
That database is out of date.

00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:19.290
Let me run the UPDATE logic for
the database, or just say

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:22.116
have a shared preference
with the license--

00:50:22.116 --> 00:50:24.450
ERNEST: Yeah, I have it saved in
the shared preference, so I

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:25.166
guess that's what I need.

00:50:25.166 --> 00:50:26.140
NICK BUTCHER: I think
it will work.

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:28.110
Because I think it just ADB
installed on a server.

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:29.510
I mean, you can see it come
out in the logs, right?

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:30.340
When you hit--

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.920
ERNEST: Yeah, well, so shared
preferences are persisted

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:33.965
across updates.

00:50:33.965 --> 00:50:34.330
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:34.650
ERNEST: Of course.

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:35.350
So, all right.

00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:37.620
SPARKY RHODE: That's just
File, essentially.

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:38.110
ERNEST: Gotcha.

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:38.538
Excellent.

00:50:38.538 --> 00:50:40.170
All right.

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:40.660
MATT GAUNT: Cool.

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:41.610
RICH HYNDMAN: Cool.

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:44.080
NICK BUTCHER: Any more
Live questions?

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.460
Spartan, maybe?

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.230
RICH HYNDMAN: Sorry?

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:48.850
NICK BUTCHER: Looks like
a Spartan helmet.

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:49.240
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.630
What is that?

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:53.856
SPARKY RHODE: No.

00:50:53.856 --> 00:50:54.310
WIEBE ELSINGA: Looks like--

00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:55.700
SPARKY RHODE: All right,
shall I look at

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.080
one from the Moderator?

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:57.790
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, go for it.

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:00.930
SPARKY RHODE: We've got, "I'm
trying to port some animation

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:02.740
from HTML5 to Android.

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:05.590
What functions in Android, like
skew/rotate images, can

00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:07.110
help me out?"

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:08.330
That's a pretty broad
question.

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:10.040
I would say it depends
on exactly what

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.443
animation you're doing.

00:51:11.443 --> 00:51:14.480
I mean, HTML5 has canvas
animation,

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.940
Android has canvas animation.

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:19.750
HTML has WebGL, Android's
got OpenGL.

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:21.770
So basically look at your--

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:24.190
essentially, your animation
package that you're working

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:27.270
in, and use the equivalent
one in Android.

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.960
The other thing I see--

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.290
NICK BUTCHER: Is that the WebGL
spec is pretty close to

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.990
the OpenGL ES 2.0 spec
as far as I know.

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:35.790
I'm not an expert on this, but
I think I've just heard that

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:36.250
anecdotally.

00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:40.720
So yeah, I think you just need
to just Google for WebGL

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.630
versus OpenGL ES 2.0.

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:48.060
SPARKY RHODE: I also suggested
that the writer actually try

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:51.880
his HTML in Chrome on Android
and see how far he gets.

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.130
Some of it might
actually work.

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:56.200
I think the WebGL probably
wouldn't, but the canvas

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.195
animation might.

00:51:58.195 --> 00:51:59.770
Don't know.

00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:05.050
And also, there's the little
caveat that the full version

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:07.905
of Chrome on Android is going to
be a much more powerful and

00:52:07.905 --> 00:52:09.940
feature-full than
the web view.

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:14.340
So, what you get it in a browser
app might not be the

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.720
same as what you get by
embedding HTML into a native

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.776
Android app.

00:52:18.776 --> 00:52:19.970
NICK BUTCHER: Indeed so.

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:20.800
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.540
Open-ended question with
lots of answers.

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.010
NICK BUTCHER: We're running
out of time.

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:26.050
So lets go real quick.

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:27.290
Speed answer mode.

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:31.120
So Gabriel asks, he is launching
his app, and he has

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.140
plans to later introduce
synchronization, which will

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:36.320
require extra permissions,
such as get accounts, use

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:37.960
credentials, incidents
and so on.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:41.240
Should he launch his app with
these new permissions that he

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.340
isn't using yet?

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:44.760
Or should he wait and then
increase the permissions when

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:45.735
he updates?

00:52:45.735 --> 00:52:46.690
RICH HYNDMAN: Good question.

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:48.860
I would personally vote for
waiting and increasing the

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.220
permissions, even though it
means that people will have to

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:52.680
volunteer to the update.

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.660
I think it's worse-- much
worse-- having an application

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:56.490
out there which asks
for permissions

00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:57.360
that it doesn't use.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.420
It confuses people.

00:52:58.420 --> 00:52:59.550
They wonder what's going
on in the background.

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:01.830
And if you explain it by saying,
I will need these in

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:03.945
the future, it's a little
bit creepy.

00:53:03.945 --> 00:53:05.010
MATT GAUNT: And plus, people--

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:06.280
it depends whether they
actually read the

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.190
description and stuff.

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:08.825
They're more likely to pay
attention to the list of

00:53:08.825 --> 00:53:09.750
permissions than read
the description.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:10.330
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:11.850
I would go with the minimum list
of permissions that you

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:14.680
can get away with at
any one stage.

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.865
MATT GAUNT: And plus, once
you've built up that trust

00:53:15.865 --> 00:53:17.690
with the users, when it comes
to updating with additional

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:19.823
permissions, they kind of assume
that there's going to

00:53:19.823 --> 00:53:20.400
be additional features
for them.

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:20.826
So--

00:53:20.826 --> 00:53:21.678
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:53:21.678 --> 00:53:22.530
That's true.

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:22.820
NICK BUTCHER: Next!

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:23.620
Speed round.

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:24.010
OK.

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:27.780
Gregory asks, in the Action
Bar Icon Pack there's an

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:30.050
allicons.ai.

00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:31.780
How do you extract
certain icons?

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:33.130
I guess the answer is you
use Adobe Illustrator.

00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:35.406
RICH HYNDMAN: Use Illustrator,
yeah.

00:53:35.406 --> 00:53:37.460
AL SUTTON: Or, alternatively,
the separate icons should be

00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:41.780
in the AOSP repository
as individual PNGs.

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:42.900
SPARKY RHODE: You can
also get them--

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.727
I mean-- at least from
the developer.androi

00:53:45.727 --> 00:53:50.990
d.com/design/downloads has some
downloads that have all

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:52.920
the icons just as separate
models--

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.930
NICK BUTCHER: That's what
he's talking about.

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:54.270
SPARKY RHODE: --you can use.

00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:55.080
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:57.890
SPARKY RHODE: But I mean, there
are separate pings in

00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:58.770
drawable directories, right?

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:00.250
So you don't have to actually
separate them out.

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:02.410
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, but he
actually wants the vectors,

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:03.740
not the bitmaps.

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.520
He says, Kenny has it in STG.

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.480
So I think right now, unless you
find someone very kindly

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.490
to pull all that, I don't
think you can

00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:11.762
get there, see that.

00:54:11.762 --> 00:54:12.240
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.720
Find an app that can read
Adobe Illustrator files.

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:17.260
NICK BUTCHER: Specian asks for
a future comment on when an

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:18.110
NDK support's coming.

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:20.070
So we can't comment on
future release dates.

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:21.810
MATT GAUNT: Yep.

00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:22.830
NICK BUTCHER: "I've been toying
around with the idea of

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:24.140
developing a game using
overlays on

00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:25.810
a Google Maps MapView.

00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:26.630
I've got a working prototype.

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:29.080
But how does the licensing work
for such an application?

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:32.990
Can I even use Maps
for that purpose?"

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.410
NICK BUTCHER: Yes.

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:35.240
SPARKY RHODE: Talk
to your Geo guys.

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:39.600
RICH HYNDMAN: If you're using
MapView or Maps on the mobile,

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:40.626
it's using the client
quotas, isn't it,

00:54:40.626 --> 00:54:41.770
not the server quotas.

00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:43.290
So you should be fine.

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:44.650
MATT GAUNT: Mm-hmm.

00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:48.128
RICH HYNDMAN: It's on a per
session per client basis.

00:54:48.128 --> 00:54:49.900
MATT GAUNT: Good.

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:50.470
RICH HYNDMAN: Is that it?

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:51.345
NICK BUTCHER: Ah, no.

00:54:51.345 --> 00:54:52.870
MATT GAUNT: There's
a couple more.

00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:54.900
SPARKY RHODE: Andre is
clarifying what he meant by

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.630
question three.

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:59.750
He says, "If the account that
bought the subscription is

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:01.450
removed from the phone--

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:03.240
you see, when a subscription
is bought, we store the

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.430
information on our database.

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:07.210
And then on every start, we call
our server to check if

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:08.405
the subscription
is still valid.

00:55:08.405 --> 00:55:11.390
Now that the account is removed,
that user should no

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:15.720
longer be able to access
the functionality." OK.

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.620
MATT GAUNT: I'm a bit confused
as to why they're no longer

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.130
eligible to access it.

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:22.515
Because they're still paying
the subscription.

00:55:22.515 --> 00:55:24.330
They should still have it.

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:27.860
SPARKY RHODE: I think it's
because the account that

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:31.030
licensed the content is no
longer present on the device

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:33.490
when the device is trying
to talk to the server.

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:34.160
MATT GAUNT: Oh, OK.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.030
So the account has been removed
but the app hasn't

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:36.790
been removed.

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:40.130
So therefore you're
still doing it.

00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:41.520
SPARKY RHODE: I would
say, yeah.

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.050
If the user account that paid
for the subscription has been

00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:46.410
removed from the phone, then,
absolutely, that phone should

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:48.560
no longer be able
to get the data.

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:49.820
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.250
SPARKY RHODE: But I don't
know if there's a tech--

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:51.520
NICK BUTCHER: I don't know.

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.180
I take it another way.

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:56.500
Because basically you've tied
that user's account to your

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:57.820
notion of their account
on the server.

00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:00.030
If they're still logged
in with that same

00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:01.050
account with your--

00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:02.920
you know, because the source of
truth for the subscriptions

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:03.860
is your server, right?

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.570
Basically, your server, does
it talk to our server to

00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:08.330
verify it before it renews?

00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:08.710
Right?

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:10.920
But if it's still logged in
with the same-- like, your

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.510
account for your service, then
I think that's valid.

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:15.990
RICH HYNDMAN: At the same time,
if the device checks

00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:18.914
through the Market whether you
are still subscribed, it will

00:56:18.914 --> 00:56:20.770
come back and say, no.

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:22.800
If you do restore transactions
or whatever.

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.250
NICK BUTCHER: I still think the
source of truth should be

00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:25.675
your server, and your server
is doing a service--

00:56:25.675 --> 00:56:27.430
telecommunication.

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:28.440
RICH HYNDMAN: Same
with a paid app.

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.001
If you buy a paid app and it's
using LBL, then you'd take

00:56:31.001 --> 00:56:32.685
their account off the device
and lose access to the app.

00:56:32.685 --> 00:56:36.570
And so, it would be nicer if you
did what Nick was saying,

00:56:36.570 --> 00:56:40.020
but acceptable in either way.

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:41.234
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:56:41.234 --> 00:56:43.000
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.500
NICK BUTCHER: Are we out of
time, or are we going to do

00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:45.240
any more Moderators?

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.110
AL SUTTON: There's a quick
one there for Matt.

00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:50.970
Any update on the
Google TV NDK?

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:52.500
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, so we can't
really comment on that.

00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:55.520
There's a massive long thread
which I think Cristy or

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:57.430
Cristian Uccello has
responded to.

00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:58.880
So I've literally just
followed that.

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.470
Because I think we are following
that thread.

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:01.920
NICK BUTCHER: Thread where?

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:04.860
MATT GAUNT: It is on Google
Issues somewhere.

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:05.810
I can't remember what--

00:57:05.810 --> 00:57:06.660
RICH HYNDMAN: There's so
many Google Issues.

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:07.490
There's only so much reading--

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:10.108
MATT GAUNT: I will find it
and then send it back.

00:57:10.108 --> 00:57:12.210
Yeah, I'll find it and put
it in the comments.

00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:14.500
Any quickies in the sidebar
we can cover?

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:15.350
RICH HYNDMAN: "I'm new
to Android dev.

00:57:15.350 --> 00:57:17.510
I would like to ask if I can use
my own database to store

00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:19.380
the data for my app." Yes.

00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:23.240
Go into
developer.android.com/training

00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:25.090
and look at how to store data.

00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:26.300
There's a thing on--

00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:27.160
SPARKY RHODE: Training.

00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.960
Basics, Saving Data.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.880
RICH HYNDMAN: Written
by our very own

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:34.550
Munich-based Sparky Rhode.

00:57:34.550 --> 00:57:38.340
I shall write that in the chat
bar for you as my last thing.

00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:39.590
So you'll have to copy
it out before you--

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.640
SPARKY RHODE: So just going back
to an earlier question, I

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.800
wanted to comment
about the SVGs.

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.745
You were talking about
Adobe Illustrator.

00:57:48.745 --> 00:57:49.220
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:52.550
SPARKY RHODE: If you want a poor
man's method of working

00:57:52.550 --> 00:57:56.390
with SVGs, the last time I did
anything with that, I used the

00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:59.320
Chrome Web browser to preview
it and I edited

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:01.170
the sucker in gedit.

00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:02.500
In just a raw text file.

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:02.980
MATT GAUNT: Wow.

00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:03.460
RICH HYNDMAN: Ha ha.

00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:03.740
Hardcore.

00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:03.970
MATT GAUNT: Oh, yeah.

00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:05.064
Awesome.

00:58:05.064 --> 00:58:07.250
NICK BUTCHER: Oh my god.

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:08.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:10.664
RICH HYNDMAN: OK, then.

00:58:10.664 --> 00:58:13.800
That brings us to the end of
this week's "Android Developer

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:14.580
Office Hours."

00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:15.640
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, also we
have one more on that.

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:17.732
You could also petition
Alex Faaborg who

00:58:17.732 --> 00:58:18.895
creates those resources.

00:58:18.895 --> 00:58:20.250
Say, please resubmit SVG.

00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:21.160
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:24.015
And hopefully we'll see some
of you who are watching

00:58:24.015 --> 00:58:26.490
tomorrow and the day after
at Droidcon London.

00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:27.480
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:28.470
RICH HYNDMAN: Very excited
about that.

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:30.730
MATT GAUNT: Hells, yeah.

00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:32.090
RICH HYNDMAN: Um--

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:32.560
bye?

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:36.770
RICH HYNDMAN: Can we
just leave now?

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:38.770
What a bad day.

00:58:38.770 --> 00:58:40.695
And we're done.

00:58:40.695 --> 00:58:41.100
AL SUTTON: Thanks, guys.

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:41.355
Bye.

00:58:41.355 --> 00:58:41.610
RICH HYNDMAN: Thanks,
everyone.

00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:42.088
MATT GAUNT: Cheers.

00:58:42.088 --> 00:58:43.044
NICK BUTCHER: Thanks,
everyone.

00:58:43.044 --> 00:58:44.000
WIEBE ELSINGA: Have fun.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.250
JOHAN PELGRIM: Bye bye.
