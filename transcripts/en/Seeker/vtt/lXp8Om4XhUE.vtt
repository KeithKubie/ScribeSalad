00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.970
You know, I’ve never been a big fan of the
whole “soulmate” thing.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.499
I mean, that would require actually having
a soul.

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:13.910
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.880
The “soulmate” is a concept with a rich
mythological history.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.730
According to Plato, Aristophanes described
ancient human beings as having 2 faces, 4

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.810
arms, 4 legs, and 2 sets of genitals.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.109
When humans threatened the gods, Zeus struck
all humans in HALF, casting them into utter

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.109
misery.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.031
If a human managed to find their other half,
the other half of their SOUL, there was a

00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:36.040
profound sense of completeness and understanding.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.050
The greatest joy there could ever be in life.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.300
It’s kinda cute, right?

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.050
These days, people regard soulmates as a romantic
concept, someone you feel completed by - that

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.190
you were made for each other.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.559
A Marist poll a few years ago found that roughly
3 in 4 Americans believe there is ONE person

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.239
on earth who is meant for them and will make
them feel complete.

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.230
Now scientists are saying that maaaaaybe this
whole “soulmates” thing is a bad idea,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.230
guys.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.870
A new study in the Journal of Experimental
Social Psychology categorized people into

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.220
2 rough groups: those who frame their relationships
as a “unity” AKA soulmates and those who

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.430
frame their relationships as a “journey”
that you’re on with someone.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.110
What they found is that those who describe
their relationship as a unity have more dismal

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.190
romantic outcomes.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.930
The researchers asked the participants to
compare levels of satisfaction during times

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.840
of harmony and times of conflict.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.030
They found that only for those who believe
in unity, they were significantly more upset

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.090
in times of conflict than those who take the
journey approach.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.380
Previous research on the topic has found that
the soulmate group tends to have short but

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.750
intensely passionate relationships, as they
seek out the person they feel a connection

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.750
with.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.320
The relationships were shorter because, when
conflict came up, they had trouble coping

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.130
with it and working toward resolution.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.450
Instead, they saw conflict as a sign that
they weren’t meant to be.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.130
By contrast, the journey group were more likely
to seek out partners that they could see themselves

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.390
growing with - not that they necessarily had
intense passion with right away.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.960
When conflict happened, they were more likely
to work to resolve them, and this group had

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.580
more satisfying relationships overall.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.140
The moral of the story: the soulmates thing
could jeopardize relationships if it’s taken

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.140
too seriously.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.460
The researchers at the University of Toronto
say, if anything, this research is a great

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.570
example of how the ways that we talk about
and think about relationships can greatly

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.680
influence our success and satisfaction in
them.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.340
So folks, are you a believer in “the one”?

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.810
Or does it belong in Ancient Greece?

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.200
