LORNA GIBSON: So
really the way I

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.340
set up the lectures
is I write out

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.960
notes for myself of
what I want to cover,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.940
and the notes are
pretty detailed.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.220
And in the past I always
just had the notes for me.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.410
And even though they
were reasonably neat

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.960
and I could read them, I didn't
hand them out to the students.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.790
But because I've turned my
fall course into an MITx course

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.660
and I want to make the lecture
notes available for that,

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.700
when I was doing that course for
MITx I made really nice notes.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.730
And a friend of
mine who lectures,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.160
I was asking her how she did it,
and she said she actually goes

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.990
and measures the chalkboard,
and she measures the aspect

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.270
ratio, how tall to
wide the chalkboard is.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.940
And then she sets up her notes
so that they're the same aspect

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.830
ratio, and she plans
out exactly where

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.630
she's going to put everything
on the board on her notes.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.530
And so I started doing that.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.920
And when I'm doing the lecture
I put it all on the board,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.677
and I find a lot
of students-- even

00:01:01.677 --> 00:01:03.260
though I hand the
notes out now-- they

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.980
like to write their own notes.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.170
And I think it helps them
pay attention in class

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.285
and helps them kind of
focus on the material.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.460
So another thing I do in
the lectures, when I first

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.020
started lecturing and
for a long time I just

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.840
focused on the engineering,
you know, on the equations,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.100
this is the derivation,
this is an example,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.370
this is how you use this.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.720
And it was all just about
kind of the engineering

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.680
of whatever I was working on.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.250
And I found over
the last few years,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.390
actually in both courses, in the
fall one on mechanical behavior

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.000
and in the spring course
on cellular solids,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.377
I look for more interesting
examples and stories, kind

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:43.730
of stories about the
people who discovered

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.260
some of the principles
that we talk about.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.690
I tell them stories about
engineering situations that

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.599
came up and there was some
interesting thing happened.

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:56.640
And the students love it.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.500
I mean, they really like having
the kind of hard core mechanics

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.640
broken up with some
sort of stories.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.100
So I do that a lot more
now than I used to do.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.720
So probably most
lecturers have some kind

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.220
of interesting example
or historical thing

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.790
that I talk about.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.160
So for instance, when I
teach the fall course,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.450
the mechanical
behavior materials,

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.570
one of the first things
we talk about is stress.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.980
So stress is a
force per unit area.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.910
If I take this piece a wood
and I pull on it like this

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.220
I'm pulling on it with a
force that goes out like this.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.040
Stress is just that force
divided by that area.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.300
And the unit of stress in the
SI system is called the Pascal.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.100
And it's named
after Blaise Pascal

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.660
who's a French mathematician.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.190
And a couple of years ago I
was in France for a conference

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.320
and I was in a little town
called Clermont-Ferrand,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.694
which is in the
middle of France.

00:02:47.694 --> 00:02:49.300
It's a pretty little town.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.990
And I'm just walking
around one day

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.660
kind of seeing the square
and the cathedral and all

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.420
this stuff, and I
see there is sign,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.810
there's like Pascal
something or another.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.860
And this was apparently the
site of Blaise Pascal's house.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.090
And right next door
to it is Cafe Pascal.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.390
So of course, I have to take
a photograph of Cafe Pascal.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.540
And in this other course, when
we get to the bit about stress

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.140
and I tell them
about the Pascal I

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.757
show them the picture
of the Cafe Pascal.

00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:23.090
And the other amusing thing
that they kind of get a kick

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.560
out of because of Boston, you
know how in Boston there's

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.300
the Freedom Trail and
there's a red line

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.230
goes around all these
historical sites

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.140
all this colonial and
revolutionary stuff

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.730
around Boston.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.640
It's kind of cool, all
the tourists to it.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.190
Well in Clermont-Ferrand
there's a Pascal Trail.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.280
And there's little
metal medallions

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.370
of the portrait of Blaise
Pascal put in the sidewalk

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.850
and you can walk
around Clermont-Ferrand

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.490
doing the Pascal Trail.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.070
So I kind of keep an eye
out for stuff like that

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.960
and I put that into
the course now,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.150
and I never used to
do that kind of stuff.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.170
I have a picture from
the Library of Congress,

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.810
which I went to just
for fun a while ago.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.170
And one of the main buildings is
this old, beautiful historical

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.750
building for the
Library of Congress.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.960
And they have a marble staircase
that goes up the middle.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.080
And the staircase has
all these little cherubs.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.640
And there's an
agriculture cherub

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.360
and he's holding
a sheaf of wheat.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.635
And there's a wine
cherub and he's holding

00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:15.785
a little thing of grapes.

00:04:15.785 --> 00:04:17.660
Well, it turns out
there's a mechanics cherub

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.353
and he's holding a gear.

00:04:20.353 --> 00:04:21.769
So at the end of
the first lecture

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.700
I show them the mechanic's
cherub with the gear.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.200
So there's these
cute little things.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.491
So I just keep an eye out
for these cute little things.

00:04:28.491 --> 00:04:30.744
And last fall, this past
fall, one of the students

00:04:30.744 --> 00:04:32.910
came up at the end of the
first lecture and he said,

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.190
I really like art.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.680
And he says, is there going
to be more art in the class?

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.250
And I'm like, not usually.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.060
This has kind of exhausted
my art in mechanics.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.690
And I said, but I'll
keep an eye out.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.320
And through the term there
actually were different things

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.370
that I saw that had to
do with mechanics and art

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.670
I showed the class.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.430
So one of them was at the
Peabody Essex Museum this fall

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.030
there's been and display of the
mobile sculptures of Alexander

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.100
Calder.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.450
And they also made
these very large,

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.140
I think they're called
stabile sculptures, as well.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.560
The big sail at MIT is
one of his sculptures.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.710
And these mobiles are
actually a really nice example

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.390
of free body diagrams in
mechanics and balancing

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.210
the forces.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.050
So anyway, I got a picture
of one of his mobiles

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.509
and I went up to the exhibit.

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:24.050
And when I was at
the exhibit I found

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.320
that he did a degree in
mechanical engineering.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.670
He actually was a
mechanical engineer.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.960
And so the students
were very, very tickled

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.500
by the sculpture, the fact
that he studied engineering.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.450
So anyway, I look out
for stuff like that.
