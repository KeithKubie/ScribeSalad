00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.240
That sums up the different things
wanted to talk about in triple C.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.790
So we talked about
coordinating between agents.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.550
We talked about communicating
between agents.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.434
And we talked about coaching or
kind of teaching,

00:00:11.434 --> 00:00:15.357
instructing between agents to convey
an idea of a reward function.

00:00:15.357 --> 00:00:15.884
So what do you think?

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:17.295
Are you ready to through and

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:20.550
kind of fill in the topics that
we touched on in each of these?

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.625
&gt;&gt; I'm going to say no and-
&gt;&gt; I don't think that's on the script.

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:28.605
You're supposed to say yes, and
we're supposed to go through it.

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:30.920
&gt;&gt; I'll tell you why because I
think this is really cool, and

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.490
I think we're giving it short shrift.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.051
I think there are several more examples
that we could go through that would

00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:39.384
really kind of drive home this point,
particularly the coaching and

00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:40.740
communication point.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.540
And I think we should do it.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.769
So let's do some more of these.

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:45.910
&gt;&gt; So what you're saying is you
didn't think I lectured enough, and

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.500
that I should now on the spot
make up more material.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.660
That's kind of tough.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.320
&gt;&gt; You don't have to
make up more material.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.940
I mean, the material is out there,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.858
you can just very easily describe
some stuff that we know about.

00:00:56.858 --> 00:00:59.367
How about doing that?

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:00.543
No?

00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:04.075
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'd rather not, I mean I
feel like we covered the topic and

00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:05.521
we should just go with it.

00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:08.361
&gt;&gt; Okay, I think I can prove to you
that we haven't covered the topic.

00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:12.430
And the way I could prove it to you is
simply by covering more of the topic.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.010
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's fair.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.630
&gt;&gt; All right, so let's do that.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.010
So you know what, here,
I'll make it easy for you.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.710
I have two or three things in mind that
I think that we could talk about that

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.340
would really kind of
drive the point home, and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.020
I will talk about them happily.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.040
&gt;&gt; All right, I appreciate that,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.680
and I would be very interested to hear
what you have to say about these topics.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.600
So why don't we stop for now, and

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.490
then you can go research those topics,
and we'll come back and talk about it.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.866
&gt;&gt; Nope,
I'm ready to talk about them now.

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.488
&gt;&gt; Wow, okay, that's impressive.

00:01:37.488 --> 00:01:39.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; So you just want to take over.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.852
Okay, so the thing is I'm actually
in Rhode Island right now, and

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:47.000
so it's not clear to me how we can just
kind of switch places and let you drive.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.090
&gt;&gt; Well, why don't we use
the magic of technology?
