so it was it was kind of a huge epiphany

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
so it was it was kind of a huge epiphany
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.570
so it was it was kind of a huge epiphany
for me that it the immediacy of the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580
for me that it the immediacy of the
 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.240
for me that it the immediacy of the
online world is so compelling because as

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
online world is so compelling because as
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.399
online world is so compelling because as
things change then it changes what's

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409
things change then it changes what's
 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.120
things change then it changes what's
important and the you know so when you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
important and the you know so when you
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.670
important and the you know so when you
talk about this idea of brainstorming I

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680
talk about this idea of brainstorming I
 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.649
talk about this idea of brainstorming I
think it's really important that you

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659
think it's really important that you
 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.530
think it's really important that you
instead of you know separating yourself

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
instead of you know separating yourself
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.450
instead of you know separating yourself
from your customers and and thinking

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
from your customers and and thinking
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.980
from your customers and and thinking
about your you know whatever you think

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
about your you know whatever you think
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.109
about your you know whatever you think
is important is to do the exact opposite

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
is important is to do the exact opposite
 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.700
is important is to do the exact opposite
which is to go where your customers are

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
which is to go where your customers are
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.190
which is to go where your customers are
and watch them and live with them if you

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
and watch them and live with them if you
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.020
and watch them and live with them if you
can and and really it's about

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
can and and really it's about
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.090
can and and really it's about
understanding how they're solving their

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100
understanding how they're solving their
 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.460
understanding how they're solving their
problems because that's where you're

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
problems because that's where you're
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.719
problems because that's where you're
going to get a much better idea about

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729
going to get a much better idea about
 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.789
going to get a much better idea about
what their habits are because if you

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
what their habits are because if you
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.649
what their habits are because if you
introduce a product that works against

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
introduce a product that works against
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.069
introduce a product that works against
habits it's a very very hard sell

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079
habits it's a very very hard sell
 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.780
habits it's a very very hard sell
because you're going to get all that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
because you're going to get all that
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.120
because you're going to get all that
built up inertia and I think that that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130
built up inertia and I think that that
 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.920
built up inertia and I think that that
in the future what we're going to be

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930
in the future what we're going to be
 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.130
in the future what we're going to be
doing to be more effective is really you

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140
doing to be more effective is really you
 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.830
doing to be more effective is really you
know watching first spending a lot of

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
know watching first spending a lot of
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.620
know watching first spending a lot of
time with our customers solving that

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
time with our customers solving that
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.389
time with our customers solving that
problem as best we can and then

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
problem as best we can and then
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.100
problem as best we can and then
reintroducing that to the customer in

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110
reintroducing that to the customer in
 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.900
reintroducing that to the customer in
that natural environment and then see

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910
that natural environment and then see
 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.220
that natural environment and then see
how well we've done

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230
how well we've done
 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.290
how well we've done
