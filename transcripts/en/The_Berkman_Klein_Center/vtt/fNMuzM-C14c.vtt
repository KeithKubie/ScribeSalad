00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.900
The next type of
copyrightable work on the list

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.590
consists of motion pictures
and other audiovisual works.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.500
A motion picture is
defined in the statute

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.290
as an audiovisual work consisting of
a series of related images, which,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.960
when shown in succession,
impart an impression of motion,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.980
together with accompanying
sounds, if any.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.560
Some audiovisual works, such as
film strips or sets of slides,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.257
don't fit this narrow definition.

00:00:44.257 --> 00:00:46.340
But that doesn't make much
difference in practice,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.197
because the copyrights
in all audiovisual works

00:00:49.197 --> 00:00:50.780
are handled in basically the same way.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.200
Fortunately for our
purposes, the legal rules

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.180
governing copyrights
in motion pictures are

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.460
simpler than the rules
governing copyrights in music.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.530
But the business models that depend
upon motion picture copyrights

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.240
are at least this intricate.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.460
Again, I'll use a slide to sketch
the main features of those rules

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.090
and models.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.940
In this lecture, I'll give you a
quick overview of the structure.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.520
Then, in subsequent
lectures, we'll return

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.854
to specific sectors of this structure,
and discuss the rules and controversies

00:01:24.854 --> 00:01:26.270
that have arisen in those sectors.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.560
As we saw, a typical
piece of recorded music

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.730
implicates two copyrights-- the
copyright in the musical composition

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.707
and the copyright in
the sound recording.

00:01:38.707 --> 00:01:40.540
Much of the complexity
in the music industry

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.240
arises out of the complex
relationship between those two rights.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.100
By contrast, in the
typical film, there exists

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.810
only one copyright-- in
the motion picture itself.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.040
In the United States, this
copyright is ordinarily

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.030
owned by the producer of the film.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.260
Sometimes that producer will
be an individual person.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.950
More often, the producer will
consists of a company, which

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.199
creates the film, aided by
a motion picture studio,

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.370
which typically finances
and distributes it.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.430
Finally, the producer is
sometimes a branch or subsidiary

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.310
of the studio itself.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.910
In this presentation I'll assume the
producer is an independent company.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.500
To create the film, the
producer, of course,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.030
needs the assistance of myriad
artists-- screenwriters,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.830
actors, directors, and so forth.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.150
Do those artists share in
the copyright in the film?

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.590
In some countries, the answer is yes.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.730
And then complex
contractual arrangements

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.070
are necessary to acquire
all of their rights.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.140
In the United States, by
contrast, the answer is no.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.090
Copyright in the film is
owned by the producer,

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.780
which hires the various artists.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.770
The character of the
deals used by the producer

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.470
to assemble the creative
contributions of the artists vary.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.270
Suppose, for example,
the producer wishes

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.760
to adapt an already-existing novel.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.990
The producer might
negotiate an assignment

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.370
of the copyright in the
novel-- indeed, we'll

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.670
see an example of this in
a minute-- but that's rare.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.800
It's much more likely that the
producer will obtain a license

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.506
to make a so-called derivative
work based upon the novel,

00:03:19.506 --> 00:03:21.630
leaving the copyright in
the hands of the novelist.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.060
What about the screenwriters,
actors, director, and composer,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.150
whose work is, of course, essential
to convert the novel into a motion

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.240
picture?

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.430
Decades ago, it was common
for the producer or studio

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.700
to hire such people as long-term
employees, in which case

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.910
their creative contributions would
belong to the producer or studio.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.810
Today, by contrast, these
relationships are more likely to be

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.690
arm's-length, but the
legal outcome is similar.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.670
The way in which this
is achieved today is

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.530
through so-called
work-for-hire agreements,

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.460
which we'll examine in detail
in Lecture Number Five.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.150
If the movie is filmed on site,
rather than in a studio lot,

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.010
the producer customarily
obtains-- and pays

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.800
for-- releases from the
owners of the buildings that

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.330
will appear in the
background of the scenes.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.230
It's far from clear that such
releases are legally required.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.589
Lawyers for the producers
typically take the position

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:23.660
that the owners of the buildings
have no enforceable rights,

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.200
and, thus, that the producer
could, if it wished,

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.590
make and show the film
without paying them anything.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.510
However, the insurance companies that
provide the producers' so-called errors

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.220
and omissions insurance tend
to be highly risk-averse,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.840
and demand that the producers
obtain these releases.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.800
If the producer wishes to include
an existing sound recording

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.160
in the soundtrack of
the movie, the producer

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.640
will obtain a so-called
master use license

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.560
from the record company that owns
the copyright in the sound recording,

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.890
and a synchronization license from
the music publisher that, as we saw,

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.090
owns the copyright in the
composition embodying the recording.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.430
What do these various
artists and copyright owners

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.000
obtain in return for entering
into these contracts and licenses?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.440
In most cases, they're
paid a negotiated flat fee.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.850
However, a few of the most
important contributors--

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.110
for example, the key actors
and perhaps the director--

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.570
may negotiate a share of the back-end
profits generated by the film.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.180
So, to return to our
story, the producer,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.810
which now owns the copyright
in the completed film,

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.440
typically enters into a perpetual
worldwide-- sometimes universewide--

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.640
distribution agreement with a
major motion picture studio.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.290
Like the music publisher,
who figured so prominently

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.180
in the previous section of
this lecture, the studio

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.690
then typically makes money by
issuing a series of licenses

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.010
to companies that wish to
present the film to consumers

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.530
in one way or another.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.230
Typically, the first
set of such licenses

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.130
is granted to theaters, which then
show the film to their patrons,

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.950
collecting box office revenues.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.420
The terms of the deals between
the studios and the theaters

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.120
have changed dramatically over time.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.890
Nowadays, when the dust settles,
typically between 40% and 50%

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.110
of the revenues collected by the
theaters are paid to the studios.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.730
When attendance in
theaters begins to decline,

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.010
the studio is likely to enter into
similar licenses with pay TV companies,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.270
airlines, and so forth, permitting them
to show the film to their subscribers

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.330
or passengers.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.050
Next, the studio will probably
grant a similar license

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.640
to a television network, which
will broadcast the film--

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.780
leavened, of course,
with advertisements--

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.430
to the public at large.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.110
Cable companies may pick
up the network signals,

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.500
and relay the broadcast
to their own customers.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.180
When they do so, they have
to pay the studios fees.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.190
But the amounts of
those fees are governed

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.250
by another compulsory licensing
system of the sort we discussed

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.580
in connection with the music industry.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.400
More on this later.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.370
The studio then may begin to exploit
ancillary sources of revenue,

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.240
which are increasingly valuable.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.800
For example, it may issue
a mechanical license

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.460
to a record company, which will
produce CDs and other products

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.520
containing the recording of
the soundtrack of the movie.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.590
The studio may authorize
a merchandise manufacturer

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.730
to make and sell dolls, lunch boxes,
backpacks, and other products,

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:40.410
based upon the characters
or plot of the movie.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.870
Sometimes, advertisers will pay to use
components of the film in their ads.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.840
Last but not least,
the studio will likely

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.790
authorize sales of copies of the
film to video stores and, now,

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.740
online distributors, which
will make them available,

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.670
either by sale or rental, to customers.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.580
So that's enough for now.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.790
We'll return later to several
litigated cases that implicate one

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.842
or another part of this
overall business model.
