TY BURRELL: Now
that I've learned

00:00:02.734 --> 00:00:05.300
self-driving cars
aren't that far off,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.767
what about ride sharing?

00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:08.333
Are companies like
Lyft and Uber going

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.667
to be part of the solution?

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:11.533
How you doing?

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.166
All right?

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.567
What are the odds?

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:15.934
You are John Zimmer,
President of Lyft.

00:00:15.934 --> 00:00:16.767
You got it.

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:17.767
Can you drive.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:18.867
Yeah, I think I got this.

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:20.000
You don't sound
very confident.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.633
I'm going to get in anyway.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:25.200
All right, where
do you want to go to?

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.467
TY BURRELL: Right here is great.

00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:28.066
[laughter]

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.266
This is as far as I'm going.

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.133
Thanks, buddy.

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.600
JOHN ZIMMER: Yeah.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.100
TY BURRELL: Well, I'm
on a mission to learn

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.767
about the future of cars.

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:37.300
And I have two kids.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.233
I'm very concerned
about their future

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:40.633
and about carbon emissions.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:43.200
How much does Lyft think
about that kind of stuff?

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.934
JOHN ZIMMER: That was one
of the original reasons

00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:46.433
why we wanted to do this.

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:49.800
The environmental toll of
having just over one person

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.734
in every car is just horrible.

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:55.834
TY BURRELL: How pie in the
sky is a driverless city?

00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:57.433
Yeah, it's very real.

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:01.567
It's the only way we can double
population in our old cities.

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:02.734
Right.

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:04.400
JOHN ZIMMER: Imagine
this experience right now

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.867
with no cars parked in a
city, maybe half as many roads

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:12.233
because the rides themselves
are more efficient.

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:14.333
The cost will come
down to the point

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:17.967
where you can get a ride
anywhere for under $5.

00:01:17.967 --> 00:01:20.567
So it's like the ultimate
form of public transportation

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:21.934
door-to-door.

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:25.767
When you have autonomous, the
economics work out that way.

00:01:25.767 --> 00:01:28.734
It feels like one of
those moments in history

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:33.600
where we can either move
forward in the right way

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.467
or we can move forward
in the wrong way

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:37.700
because it's such a
crucial turning point.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.767
JOHN ZIMMER: Mm-hmm.

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:41.967
The ultimate outcome
should be clean fuel

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:44.800
and should be
autonomous and have

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.667
the opportunity for people to
share those autonomous rides.

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:49.200
That is a big win.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.100
And electric is a
big part of that.
