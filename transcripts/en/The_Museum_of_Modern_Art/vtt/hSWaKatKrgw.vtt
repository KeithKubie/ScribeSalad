00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.080
Sarah: I can’t even tell which ones we decided
to re-matte and not, so that’s a good…

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.680
Peter: Well, what we did was… remember that
we tried to…

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.760
Sarah: We went with some of the existing?

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.640
Peter: Well, we wanted to come up with the
sizes that were very close to each other.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.840
So we came up with the 18–22” as the sizes
that could work as a whole, so even the frames

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.000
that are…

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.480
Sarah: …horizontal are the same?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.160
Peter: Yeah, they still have the same size
frame.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.000
Sarah: So did we reuse any frames?

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.400
Peter: No, I ordered the frames,
yeah, yeah.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.280
Sarah: You’re spoiling me.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.600
Sarah: There were two that I was worried about
the orientation that I just wanted to check

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.960
because we had a little…

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.040
Peter: Wasn’t this the one?

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.560
Sarah: That was one.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.360
And then the other one is on the corner.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.320
Because this is upside down unless you
hinged it backwards.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
Peter: We could open this one so we can take a look.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.200
Sarah: Oh good.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.280
The hanging hardware isn’t there, so does
it matter?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.280
Peter: It doesn’t.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.920
That’s the orientation that we have.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.800
Sarah: Okay, well how about this way?

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.080
Is it the same at the top and bottom?

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.080
Could we…?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.440
Peter: Yep.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.440
Sarah: Then maybe we’re saved?

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.040
Peter: You mean like this?

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.800
Sarah: Yeah.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.800
Is it hinged?

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.880
Peter: Yeah, it’s cornered.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.600
Sarah: Okay, all around.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.200
Because we found this from 1952 where it was
the opposite of what we thought.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.800
Peter: So what we’ll do is we’ll change
the number on the back because it’s upside down now

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.840
and then we’ll put it here.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.240
So now we know the orientation is this.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.160
Sarah: So this one we found in this book,
and I thought it was…

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.200
I mean, gravity would have left it the other
way.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.440
Peter: Yeah, so we have it like this.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.600
Sarah: No.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.320
This one’s actually a vertical.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.480
Peter: A vertical like?…

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.200
Peter: Like this.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.760
Sarah: A vertical like that.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.240
And the reason we know is because on the back
she signed and titled it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.880
and they helpfully reproduced the backs and
everything in this catalogue.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.960
It’s much more interesting, huh?

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.080
Peter: This is the top.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.760
Sarah: Want me to leave you a photocopy?

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.480
Peter: You can, yeah, we could do that.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.000
Just put it with this.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.360
Sarah: This is a warm white?

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.240
Peter: Warm white and so is the frame.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.200
Sarah: Beautiful.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.680
Thank you.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.160
Peter: I think we’re ready to go.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.240
Sarah: Great.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.960
You know, the default position is that gravity
is how you would orient a work, but we know

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.040
that for these Brazilian modernists they are sometimes subverting that or playing with it.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.680
So we found a reproduction in a recent catalogue
where the picture was oriented as a vertical

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.840
instead of as a horizontal as we had it.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.400
And the first thing we have to do is to check
the back of our print to make sure there isn’t

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.880
information that contradicts the way it’s
reproduced in the catalogue

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.920
so it’s sort of like a “trust, but verify”
situation.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.800
And then the helpful thing about this catalogue
is that it’s not only oriented a certain

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.360
way in the catalogue

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.880
but also they show the verso of the print
so we can see the artist’s inscriptions

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.600
and stamps all support the way they orient
it in the catalogue

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.440
and that makes us feel very confident that
the way we had it was wrong

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.440
and the way that it’s oriented in the catalogue (as a 
vertical instead of a horizontal) is correct

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.600
even though that’s not the way gravity would
lead you to expect it to be.
