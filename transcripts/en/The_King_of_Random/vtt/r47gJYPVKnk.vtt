Today, our video
is sponsored by NordVPN.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.640
In today's video, we're trying
a spy movie trick

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.368
to see if we can make an
impression of a key in clay,

00:00:07.368 --> 00:00:10.220
and then make our own copy based
on that impression.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:18.600
[Music]

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.120
Calli, have you
ever seen a movie

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.640
where someone makes a copy of
a key by pressing it into clay,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.080
and then having their own
version of the key later?

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.000
I've heard of one or two.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.800
Yeah.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.360
I'm pretty sure
I've seen that movie too,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.880
and we have a common request

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.540
from YouTube user
Purple Pewdiepie asking

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.240
if we can try casting
a gallium key in the sand.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.940
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.800
We'll take a key
that opens a padlock,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.760
make a mold using some clay,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.920
and then use so gallium
to cast a copy of our own.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.900
Purple Pewdiepie,
we want to try this idea.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.600
Although, we are going
to change it up a little bit.

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:50.650
Instead of using sand,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.920
like we've used for casting
some stuff in the past,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.560
we're going to try
using an oil-based clay.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.480
Clay, you're going to get
much better resolution.

00:00:57.483 --> 00:00:59.156
When we're trying
to cast that key,

00:00:59.156 --> 00:01:00.850
we need all
of those fine details,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.000
and all of those teeth.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.622
Clay is going to give us
what we need.

00:01:03.622 --> 00:01:05.810
Sand can be
fairly fine resolution,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.784
but clay is made from just
the absolute smallest,

00:01:08.784 --> 00:01:10.940
finest, silt-like particles,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.500
and so, this is going to get us
like a really accurate result,

00:01:14.504 --> 00:01:16.436
and if we want a working key,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.360
I think we need
the best detail.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.400
We've got a treasure chest.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.040
It has a lock on it,
and we have a key.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.962
So I mean,
we can already get inside.

00:01:23.962 --> 00:01:25.602
But the point is we want to see

00:01:25.602 --> 00:01:27.352
what would happen
if like in movies,

00:01:27.352 --> 00:01:28.850
you only have
a couple of seconds,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.215
maybe you manage to pick
someone's pocket or something.

00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:32.367
You have their keychain.

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:34.142
You have that key
for just a minute.

00:01:34.142 --> 00:01:35.437
Just how long do you need

00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:38.390
to have their key before you
can take an impression of it,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.100
and then make
your own copy later?

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.560
This is an oil
based sculpting clay,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.940
and it does a really good job
of picking up details,

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.650
but it's also very rigid
to the point where it's

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.450
actually kind of hard to get
an impression in it right now.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.240
It needs to be warmed up

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.760
before it's soft enough
that we can do stuff with it.

00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:58.992
The easiest way to do that,
toss it in the microwave.

00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:01.999
Now, if this were water
based clay, first off,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.520
you wouldn't want
to be doing this.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.120
Usually it's a coarser grit,

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:07.150
but also, you can't put
in the microwave.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.771
It would not really dry,
it kind of explodes.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.437
Don't do that.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.500
Oil-based clay.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.920
This is a really
good way of warming up.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.640
Just don't get it too hot.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.360
That's so much better.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.013
That is squishy.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.240
It comes completely squishes
apart in your hands.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.750
That's what we're looking for.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.600
We're good to go.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.339
We're trying now to get
a nice flat smooth surface

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:27.680
on one side of the clay.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.972
That's going to help
us get a better mold.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.500
Although, we are just going
to be smooshing it a lot,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.960
so it may or may not make
too much of a difference.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.200
Once we've got the key cast,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.580
we're going to need
a way to fill it,

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.897
and with some kind of metal,
you can just pour it in.

00:02:41.897 --> 00:02:43.583
But a key doesn't leave
a lot of space,

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:44.589
so we're probably going

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.310
to want something that can force
the metal down into the mold,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.149
and my thought is

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.650
that we can use this little
plastic dosing syringe.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.340
It will suck up
the liquid gallium,

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.580
so I think,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.064
we first need to take
our little syringe here,

00:02:56.064 --> 00:02:58.600
and mold a spot
for it into the clay,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.000
and then we'll line up the key.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.660
We're going to be pressing these
two pieces of clay together.

00:03:02.673 --> 00:03:04.724
But if we normally just
take two pieces of clay,

00:03:04.724 --> 00:03:05.772
and press them together,

00:03:05.772 --> 00:03:07.900
it's sort of just becomes
one piece of clay.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.700
It's doesn't like
to come back apart.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.124
Really easy way to separate

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.400
that is just using
some baby powder.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.220
We'll sprinkle it
over the surface of the clay.

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:17.399
Then when we press
our pieces back together,

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.100
we can pull them
apart very easily.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.660
[Music]

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.600
Now, we've got
our syringe marking.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.715
That's where we're going
to be able to put

00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:29.850
our dosing syringe in,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.928
and inject the metal
right into it.

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:34.000
And now, time to do the key.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.360
Just to make sure though,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.000
let's reapply the baby powder.
&gt;&gt; Just a little bit.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.440
Kinda align the key up,

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.940
so that the top of it intersects
with where the syringe will be.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.940
That way, we should have
a direct channel

00:03:45.953 --> 00:03:47.000
to fill this thing.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.020
[Music]

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.260
Pretty well lined up,
and now, go for it.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.220
Just smoosh it.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.240
You don't want it
to slip at all.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.220
In fact, if we want to stop
the slipping a little bit,

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.493
we can just take some

00:04:02.493 --> 00:04:05.502
of the edges, and pinch
them together a little bit.

00:04:05.502 --> 00:04:08.300
That should keep
it from sliding.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.520
All right.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.815
So we've got this as pressed
and as well formed

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:15.172
as we can without
it slipping anywhere,

00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:16.672
but the clay is still so soft.

00:04:16.672 --> 00:04:17.296
It's malleable.

00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:18.695
So if we were
to peel these apart,

00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:19.582
it would still work.

00:04:19.582 --> 00:04:22.043
So what we want to do is
we want to make this clay

00:04:22.043 --> 00:04:23.550
just as hard as it was before.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.140
Best way to do that,
bucket of ice water.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.340
[Music]

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.080
It should cool down
pretty quick actually.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.712
Scalpel.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.580
Let's see what we got.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:54.860
[Music]

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.660
All right.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.040
I made these little score lines
on the side, and hopefully,

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.103
we'll be able to use those
to line up in backup.

00:05:00.103 --> 00:05:02.150
But before we put it
back together and try

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.042
and fill with metal,

00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:04.650
there's another step
we need to take.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.063
If I try and inject
the metal right into this,

00:05:07.063 --> 00:05:08.055
it's just not going

00:05:08.055 --> 00:05:11.300
to go anywhere because the air
won't have any way to get out.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.950
So I'm going to use a knife

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.719
and carved just
a little air channel.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.160
Hopefully, that will let all
of our gallium get out.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.940
And now, to help
hold everything together,

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.700
and to keep gallium

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.100
from leaking out, just pinch
closed all of the clay gaps.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.740
There's a good chance we'll get
a little bit of flashing,

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.832
but this should minimize it.

00:05:37.442 --> 00:05:40.338
Flashing is when you get
the casting material,

00:05:40.338 --> 00:05:41.432
leaving the edges

00:05:41.432 --> 00:05:44.200
that are supposed
to be defined by the mold.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.750
I want to be able to squish
the clay back down.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.101
But if I press in the middle,

00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:49.920
it's just going
to collapse the key,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.597
and then we'll never get
anything usable out of it.

00:05:52.597 --> 00:05:54.868
You've got our gallium
that still liquid,

00:05:54.868 --> 00:05:56.297
but it's not very warm.

00:05:56.297 --> 00:05:57.415
Like at this point,

00:05:57.415 --> 00:06:00.050
it's probably about
on the point of turning back

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.000
and start getting some crystals,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.060
which is good because it means
it should solidify faster.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.880
I'll try.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.720
[Music]

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.540
I think that's
actually in there.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.155
And now, what we're going
to do is just put this back

00:06:17.155 --> 00:06:20.001
in the ice water and
let it cool down.

00:06:20.112 --> 00:06:22.471
While Nate waits
for the gallium to cool down,

00:06:22.471 --> 00:06:24.114
why don't we talk
about Nord VPN,

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.500
our sponsor for this video?

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.972
Okay, but I have iMessaging.

00:06:27.972 --> 00:06:29.223
I get the blue bubbles.

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:32.052
I can replace the battery
in my phone if I need do.

00:06:32.052 --> 00:06:34.043
I get better apps faster
than you do.

00:06:34.043 --> 00:06:35.500
I have a headphone jack.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.340
I'm an Android.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.540
And I'm an iPhone.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.940
There is one thing that
we can agree on however.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.780
That is true, NordVPN.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.160
NordVPN, it's a
virtual private network.

00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:47.050
It protects your devices,
it protects all of them.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.459
Android, iPhone, PC,

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:51.750
Apple, they all work
and your internet is safe.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.649
Guys, if you're ever

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:54.900
in a place where you
don't trust the internet,

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.839
if you're traveling,

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:58.517
if you're in a hotel and you're
not sure about that Wi-Fi,

00:06:58.517 --> 00:07:00.302
you want to be
working through NordVPN.

00:07:00.302 --> 00:07:02.551
They have got servers
in over 61 countries.

00:07:02.551 --> 00:07:05.335
Those servers are super fast
and the best part is,

00:07:05.335 --> 00:07:06.529
if you don't like it,

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:09.400
there's a risk free 30 day
money-back guarantee.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.680
There's other cool uses too.

00:07:10.682 --> 00:07:11.917
It works by rerouting

00:07:11.917 --> 00:07:14.623
your internet through a server
in a different country.

00:07:14.623 --> 00:07:16.615
It lets you access
parts of the internet

00:07:16.615 --> 00:07:18.265
that may be blocked
where you are.

00:07:18.265 --> 00:07:20.783
For instance, you can watch
some streaming services

00:07:20.783 --> 00:07:23.150
that may be different
in one country or another.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.302
You can use peer
to peer file-sharing

00:07:25.302 --> 00:07:27.755
without having to worry
about what's being monitored.

00:07:27.755 --> 00:07:30.605
So just in time for the busiest
shopping days of the year,

00:07:30.605 --> 00:07:33.150

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.250

On all of your devices,
and for a short time,

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.500
use code random to get
an extra month for free.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.419
You punched your phone.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.100
You've just been browsing

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:56.760
cat pictures this whole time?

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.480
Yeah, they're NordVPN.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:11.960
[Music]

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.760
Most definitely is key shape.

00:08:13.762 --> 00:08:15.950
It does look mostly like a key.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.440
We did get some flashing,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.000
this right here is what
I was talking about.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.941
That's flashing.

00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:22.660
It's when it just expands
beyond where it's supposed to,

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.500
but I think we might be able
to get that to work.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:35.480
[Music]

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.000
We have a key shape,
and it's really not bad,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.700
but I don't think it's clean
enough to open the lock.

00:08:41.703 --> 00:08:42.875
Yeah, there's just,

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:46.450
there's little bits of flashing
and just part sticking out,

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.950
and I think we just clean
it up with file.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.796
A little bit will get
a usable result.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:09:02.840
[Music]

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.020
Okay, I think...

00:09:04.432 --> 00:09:05.389
Ready for test?

00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:06.600
I think we're good.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:07.820
Here it goes.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:13.040
[Music]

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.699
Key fits.

00:09:13.699 --> 00:09:14.793
It went in.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.920
[Music]

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.260
Lock is popped!

00:09:21.414 --> 00:09:23.030
With a gallium key...

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.340
That is nuts.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.700
It twisted.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.840
It did.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.700
It actually bend.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.000
The key is just very
slightly corkscrewed.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.840
Bend.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.700
Be straightened.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.680
Wonder if it's just
like getting too warm,

00:09:39.692 --> 00:09:41.120
we'll put it back
in the ice water.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:47.140
[Music]

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.480
You can do it!

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.000
[Music]

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.560
Oh my gosh!

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.600
It is done
for but we did it.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.890
We got a few opens
with this key,

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.890
but I think it has had it.

00:10:03.542 --> 00:10:05.752
So can you cast a key
out of gallium?

00:10:05.752 --> 00:10:07.880
You can cast a key
out of gallium.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.056
Making the mold of it,

00:10:09.056 --> 00:10:10.958
if you had clay,
you could smoosh the key

00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.199
into the mold really quick.

00:10:12.199 --> 00:10:15.200
You need some baby powder too
to keep it from getting ruined.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.350
But we also found

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.841
that it helped a lot to just
throw it in the ice water,

00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:21.560
so as you're peeling it apart,
it didn't completely deform.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.975
Two or three minutes tops.

00:10:22.975 --> 00:10:25.490
I mean that's maybe longer
than you would ideally want

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.260
if you were a spy stealing a key
something from someone, but...

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.340
Still works.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:29.840
It works.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.487
We didn't want to try
that with a car

00:10:31.487 --> 00:10:33.700
because if this broke off
in a car's ignition,

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.122
it's kind of a bigger problem.

00:10:35.122 --> 00:10:37.072
If it breaks off
inside the master lock,

00:10:37.362 --> 00:10:38.741
not the end of the world.

00:10:38.741 --> 00:10:40.782
Probably can just
metal too right out.

00:10:40.782 --> 00:10:43.880
[Music]

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.080
Nate, here you go.

00:10:50.092 --> 00:10:51.682
I made that for you.

00:10:51.682 --> 00:10:53.829
The key is still in the lock.

00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:56.340
It's mostly still in the lock.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.400
Okay, but what was
in the treasure chest?

00:10:58.402 --> 00:11:09.300
[Music]

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.862
It's a King of Random kit.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.480
Wow, I wanted one of these.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.760
