00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.123
- [Instructor] What we're going to do

00:00:01.123 --> 00:00:02.610
in this video is start to think about

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.550
how we describe position in one dimension

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.770
as a function of time.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.920
So we could say our position,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.320
and we're gonna think about position

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.990
on the x-axis as a function of time.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.720
And we could define it by some expression,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.330
let's say, in this situation,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.930
it is going to be our
time to the third power

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.570
minus three times our
time squared plus five.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.760
And this is going to apply

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.890
for our time being non-negative

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.220
'cause the idea of negative time,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.640
at least for now, is a bit strange.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.310
So let's think about what this

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.880
right over here is describing.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.360
And to help us do that,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.640
we could set up a little bit of a table

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.510
to understand that depending
on what time we are,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.680
let's say that time is in seconds,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.140
what is going to be our
position along our x-axis?

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.140
So at time equals zero, x of
zero is just going to be five.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.170
At time one, you're gonna have
one minus three plus five.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.040
So that is going to be,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.200
let's see, one minus
three is negative two,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.330
plus five is going to be,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.090
we're going to be at position three.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.550
And then at time two, we are going to be

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.030
at eight minus 12 plus five,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.950
so we're going to be at position one.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.660
And then at time t equals three,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.570
it's gonna be 27 minus 27 plus five,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.360
we're gonna be back at five.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.530
And so, this can at
least help us understand

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.540
what's going on for the
first three seconds.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.370
So let me draw our positive x-axis.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.990
So, say it looks something like that.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.170
And this is x equals zero.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.230
This is our x-axis.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.230
X equals one, two, three, four, and five.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.260
And now let's play out how this particle

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.560
that's being described is
moving along the x-axis.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.150
So we're gonna start here,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.150
and we're gonna go one, two, three.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.470
Let's do it again.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.460
We're going to go one, two, three,

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.110
the way I just moved
my mouse, if we assume

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.730
that I got the time roughly right,

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.800
is how that particle would move.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.960
And we can graph this as well.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.740
So for example, it would look like this.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.260
We are starting at time t equals zero.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.620
Our position, this is our
vertical axis, our y-axis,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.750
but we're just saying
y is going to be equal

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.000
to our position along the x-axis.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.500
So that's a little bit counterintuitive

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.600
because we're talking about our position

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.260
in the left-right dimension,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.920
and here you're seeing it start off

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.230
in the vertical dimension,

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.670
but you see the same thing.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.520
At time t equals one, our
position has gone down to three.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.050
Then it goes down further.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.400
At time equals two, our
position is down to one.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.550
And then, we switch direction

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.110
and then over the next, if we
say that time is in seconds,

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.390
over the next second, we get back to five.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.990
Now an interesting thing to think about

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.870
in the context of calculus is,

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.220
well, what is our velocity
at any point in time?

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.310
And velocity as you might remember,

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.510
is the derivative of position.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.950
So let me write that down.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.560
So we're gonna be thinking about velocity

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.030
as a function of time.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.140
And you could view velocity
as the first derivative

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.280
of position with respect to time

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.500
which is just going to be equal to,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.040
or we're gonna apply the power rule

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.860
and some derivative
properties multiple times.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.800
If this is unfamiliar to you,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.460
I encourage you to review it.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.990
But this is going to be three t squared

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.460
minus six t and then plus zero,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.580
and we're gonna restrict
the domain as well for t

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.560
is greater than or equal to zero.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.220
And then, we can plot that.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.480
It would look like that.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.530
Now let's see if this curve
makes intuitive sense.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.320
We mentioned that one second, two seconds,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.670
three seconds.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.990
So we're starting moving to the left.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.950
And the convention is if
you're moving to the left,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.080
you have negative velocity,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.970
and if you're moving to the right,

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.530
you have positive velocity.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.370
And you can see here our velocity

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.140
immediately gets more and more negative

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.610
until we get to one second,

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.420
and then it stays negative
but it's getting less

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.250
and less negative until
we get to two seconds.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.860
And at two seconds, our
velocity becomes positive.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.770
And that makes sense,
because at two seconds

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.790
was when our velocity switched directions

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.400
to the rightward direction.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.030
So, our velocity is getting
more and more negative,

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.670
less and less negative, and
then we switch directions

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.140
and we go just like that.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.020
And we see it right over here.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.530
Now one thing to keep in mind

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.390
when we're thinking about
velocity as a function of time

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.620
is that velocity and speed
are two different things.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.040
Speed, speed, let me write it over here.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.830
Speed is equal to, if you think about it

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.180
in one dimension, you could think about it

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.310
as the absolute value of your velocity

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.140
as a function of time or
your magnitude of velocity

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.740
as a function of time.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.660
So in the beginning,
even though your velocity

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.940
is becoming more and more negative,

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.680
your speed is actually increasing.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.780
Your speed is increasing to the left,

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.440
then your speed is
decreasing, you slow down,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.110
and then your speed is increasing

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.300
as we go to the right.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.930
And we'll do some worked examples

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.090
that work through that a little bit more.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.710
Now the last concept we
will touch on in this video

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.490
is the idea of acceleration.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.570
And acceleration you can view

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.360
as the rate of change of
velocity with respect to time.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.560
So acceleration as a function of time

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.450
is just going to be the first derivative

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.300
of velocity with respect to time

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.910
which is equal to the second derivative

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.330
of position with respect to time.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
It's just going to be the
derivative of this expression.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.310
So once again, using the power rule here,

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.300
that's going to be six t.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.120
And then using the power rule here,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.700
minus six, and once again,
we will restrict the domain.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.380
And we can graph that as well.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.660
And we would see right over here,

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.190
this is y is equal to acceleration
as a function of time.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.900
And you can see at time equals zero,

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.510
our acceleration is quite negative.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.280
It is negative six.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.190
And then it becomes less
and less and less negative.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.830
And then, our acceleration actually

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.480
becomes positive at t equals one.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.060
Now, does that makes sense?

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.010
Well, we're going one, two, three.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.780
You might say, "Wait, we
didn't switch directions

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.650
"until we get to the second second."

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.980
But remember, after we
get to the first second,

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.770
our velocity in the negative direction

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.040
becomes less negative which means

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.050
that our acceleration is positive.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.930
If that's a little confusing,

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.010
pause the video and
really think through that.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.470
So, our acceleration is
negative, then positive,

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.870
and then positive continues.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.390
And so, this is just to
give you an intuition.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.580
In the next few videos, we'll
do several worked examples

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.860
that help us dive deeper into this idea

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.650
of studying motion and position,

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.560
into this idea of studying
motion in one dimension.
