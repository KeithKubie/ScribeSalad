00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.890
Now hopefully lining up all these sequences together makes it pretty

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.420
easy to see what the consensus sequence should be. Now if we

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.810
actually take this problem for what it is, look at the first

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.170
column or the first position, and we see that pretty much all

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.990
the letters are thymines or Ts and there's one A or

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.750
adenine. So we would say that he consensus letter for this first

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.020
position is thymine or T. And if we do this for all

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.620
the other positions, we get the consensus sequence, which should be TGACGTCA.
