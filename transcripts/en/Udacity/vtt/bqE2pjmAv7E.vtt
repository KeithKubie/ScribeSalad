00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.210
For that, you'll need a more complex storage

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.860
system like WebSQL or IndexDB. WebSQL provides a SQL

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.870
light based database directly in the browser. You can

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.400
use SQL queries to access data and to find

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.980
relationships. And ,you can have structured data in

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.530
your value storage as well. Now, this is significantly

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.510
more complex. Than the simple and limited key value

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.550
storage and local store. However, there's two main problems

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.450
with it. The first problem is, although this

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.950
API is available in Chrome, Safari, and Opera

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.100
and IOS Safari in the Android browser, even,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.750
it's not available on IE or Firefox. The

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.650
second problem is clear from the specification, which

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.580
is no longer being maintained. In short, web

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.990
SQL is a dead end. It's out there

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.680
in Chrome, the Android browsers, Safari and IOS

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.250
Safari, and Opera. But, it's not available in IE

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.270
or Firefox ,and it's likely that it never will be.
