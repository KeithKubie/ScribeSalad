ROMAN NURIK: All right everyone,
and hello, and

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.680
welcome to Android Design in
Action, the first episode of

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.980
the year 2013.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.520
My name is Roman Nurik.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.490
ADAM KOCH: Hey guys,
happy new year.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.610
Adam Koch here.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.660
NICK BUTCHER: And hi,
Nick Butcher.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.690
I'm joining you from sunny
California, rather than

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.680
London, as it may say below.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.900
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah,
it says London.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.680
We didn't have time to change
the name card below Nick.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.190
It does say London, but he is
actually broadcasting from

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.130
Mountain View, California.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.605
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:32.460
We're not very good with
Photoshop yet.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.170
ROMAN NURIK: So today, our
episode is going to be a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.120
little bit of both design and
development, not too much

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.560
development.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.770
You won't see any code.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.204
You'll see maybe a few little
pointers to things here and

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:48.630
there, but it'll be mostly for
designers, but developers

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.940
should definitely
pay attention.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.450
So today's episode is titled
Iterative Improvements, and

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.030
what that means is we're going
to take a look at a very bare

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.510
bones starting point app--

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.960
and this is not a real app, it's
just a hypothetical app--

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.050
and we'll see how over the
course of a few key steps, we

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.850
can get it from a point which
is kind of nothing to be

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.600
talked about, kind of a really
uglyish app, it doesn't really

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.590
create a great reading
experience, to something

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.920
that's just a little
better than that.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.320
Before we get started, do you
guys have any comments on--

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.210
well actually before that, the
type of app we're going to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.635
talk about is a basic article
reader, not really an RSS

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:32.360
reader like Google Reader, but
basically something that has a

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.296
list of articles and the
article details.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:37.380
Should we just get started?

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.880
Do you guys have any comments
you want to share

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.350
before we jump in?

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.155
NICK BUTCHER: No, let's
go straight in.

00:01:41.155 --> 00:01:41.710
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, let's go.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.970
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.890
Let's do it since we have
tons of slides.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.950
So let's look at the
bare bones app.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.470
So this is the starting point.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.100
I'm sure many of you have seen
apps kind of like this in the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.330
Play Store.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.470
There are lots of issues
at play here.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.380
First, it's kind of hard to tell
the different articles on

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.100
the left apart.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.350
There's no action bar.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.590
This is using the pre-Android
4.0, Android 3.0, title bar,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.780
this has got the Legacy
menu button here.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.370
All sorts of things
wrong with this.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.930
And obviously, there's lots
of wrong spacing, metrics.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.270
We'll talk about all the details
in a bit, but this is

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.530
kind of our starting point.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.980
So like I said, we're going to
jump through a couple of

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.000
different steps and along the
way, we'll talk about what is

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.550
involved in each step and
how to actually do it.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.480
So the first step is to change
to the Holo theme, and add an

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.150
action bar to your app.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.630
So you can see here that the
Holo theme-- actually, the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.120
Holo theme automatically gives
you an action bar by default.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.990
But you have the action bar at
the top, and what that gives

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.800
you is that gives you a sense of
place into where you are in

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.020
the app and which app you're
in-- so you see the little

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.300
icon here--

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.370
as well as some basic actions
that are immediately

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.270
available on screen.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.500
So things like refresh, if you
wanted to be able to refresh

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.010
the list of articles, as well
as an overflow, giving you

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.240
access to things that usually
you would see under the legacy

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.460
menu button.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.830
ADAM KOCH: And just from a
developer standpoint, it's

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.820
really a matter of enabling a
target SDK version for your

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.070
application in your manifest of,
I think, 11 or above, but

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.580
obviously, we recommend
targeting the latest platform

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.430
version where you can.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.390
So in this case, we just put
down here a little note that

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.160
says target SDK version of 17.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.630
And in addition, there's a theme
that you can set for

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.620
Holo, so in this case, it's
Theme.Holo Light Dark Action

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.420
Bar, so that's the light theme
down bottom, with a dark

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.930
action bar at the top.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.085
NICK BUTCHER: And one really
little thing to pick out here

00:03:46.085 --> 00:03:47.870
is if you take a look at the
background color on here, you

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.010
see it's changed from pretty
much pure white to a slightly

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.370
off white, which is part of
the Holo palette really.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.030
And there's really good reasons
that we selected these

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.390
base colors for the base themes
which you inherit from,

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.500
because that white on mobile
can be a searingly bright

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.140
color, which you want to use
quite sparingly, and it's not

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.770
very great for the
background color.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.230
So it's a subtle change, but
it instantly makes the app

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.820
easier to read.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.530
ROMAN NURIK: For sure.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.170
And we've kept that throughout,
so you'll see the

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.810
evolution of this design with
more branding elements and

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.320
things like that, and we've
kept that default color.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.010
So let's move on.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.700
What's the next step?

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.230
We have an action bar, we
have the Holo theme.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.640
That gives you a little bit,
that improves the visual

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.990
design a little bit, but
what's the next step?

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.980
So the next step is to customize
the action bar and

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.680
give your app a little
touch of branding.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.670
So you'll see here that
we've chosen an

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.840
orange color palette.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.510
And again, this is
really up to you.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.810
If you have an existing service,
an existing color

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.360
scheme for your brand,
introduce it.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.290
This is the best place, I'd say,
in your app to introduce

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.050
branding, is the action bar
since it's a key structural

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.940
element, yet at the same time,
it's a key area to

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.640
differentiate.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.500
And then the little icon we
chose here, this is actually

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.030
not a standard launcher icon.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.160
This is a custom icon
for the action bar.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.960
And so remember that you don't
necessarily have to have your

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.210
exact pixel for pixel launcher
icon in the action bar.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.110
You can customize it so that it
looks good in the context

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.190
of the action bar.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.330
And so the launcher icon for
this app would probably be an

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.870
orange circle with a white y,
but we decided that this

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.540
inverted color scheme would
look good here.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.820
And you'll also notice that
we've introduced some of the

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.160
same color scheme elements
throughout the content.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.120
By the way, I should
preface that.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.480
All the content here
is meat specific.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.980
It's a bunch of bacon,
chicken, and steaks.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.830
This is just kind of example
content, so it's--

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.420
ADAM KOCH: Pretty
bacon-friendly

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.740
color scheme, actually.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.870
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, a very
bacon-oriented reading

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.150
experience.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.897
ADAM KOCH: Yes.

00:05:51.897 --> 00:05:53.765
NICK BUTCHER: I've not had
breakfast yet, and it's making

00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:55.640
me very hungry.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.730
ROMAN NURIK: What is it, 7:30
AM over there, Nick?

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.200
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.390
ROMAN NURIK: So links and other
things throughout are

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.650
accented with this orange,
so that's the next step.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.250
And then--

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.430
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, and then
I guess from a developer

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.610
standpoint--

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.240
I think actually, Nick, you had
some blog posts up on the

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.110
developer blog that outlined
some ways to theme the action

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.880
bar, but there's also a great
tool called the Action Bar

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.960
Style Generator.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.990
If you just Google for it,
you'll find that, which

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.180
generates all those things for
you, so you don't have to

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.990
worry about all the different
types of elements and

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.164
attributes that you
need to style.

00:06:29.164 --> 00:06:32.035
NICK BUTCHER: Thanks very much
for that [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:32.035 --> 00:06:33.190
ROMAN NURIK: All right,
moving on.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.370
So the next step, and this
is one of the key

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.450
most important steps.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.810
This is, I think, one of the
key ways in which polished

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.750
apps and apps with really good
fit and finish differentiate

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.530
from the less polished apps,
is the margins and the

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.330
spacing, the way they
treat white space.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.760
And this is one of a UI
designer's best tools in

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.630
creating contrast
and readability.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.160
Readability is the concept of
not necessarily legibility of

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.050
paragraphs and words, but
readability is the sense of,

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.770
given a block of text, how
easy is it for the eye to

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.230
consume that information.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.560
And adding margins and
spaces is one of the

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.210
key ways to do that.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.850
So you notice that from that
previous screen, we've tweaked

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:17.450
the spacing so that you can
better separate each article

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.410
in the list on the left from
its background and from the

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.840
other articles, as well as we've
added some standard 16dp

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.410
margins throughout the content
on the detail screen here.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.320
ADAM KOCH: And you'll probably
hear us often mention the 48dp

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.360
rhythm from the design side, so
that's really what all of

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.360
this is based off.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.550
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and we'll
show some red lines at the end

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.780
that show some of the
spacings that we use

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.480
on tablets as well.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.720
And this is, again, one of
the key ways in which you

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.840
differentiate handset from
tablet to make sure that,

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.030
again, that readability,
that comfort in

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.740
reading is still there.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.320
So let's move on unless,
Nick, you had any--

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:57.520
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.453
It just instantly got more
breathing room, I think it's

00:07:59.453 --> 00:08:00.500
so much easier to stand now.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.140
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.250
So the next step is another
important way in which you can

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.420
introduce consistency and a
strong rhythm in your app is

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.230
the way you treat photo
thumbnails.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.470
So you'll notice that in the
previous version, these photos

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.750
were all jaggedy or lopsided.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.450
They didn't have a strong
rhythm, because they had

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:22.950
different aspect ratios.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:28.500
So one of the ways in which you
can alleviate this is to

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.880
introduce a different type of
scaling, and Adam could talk

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.440
about that, but basically you'll
notice here that all

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.580
the photos line up.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.320
They're full bleed edge to edge,
and they introduce kind

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.130
of a strong, single line
in your design.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.510
So it's very easy for the eye to
separate the text from the

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.950
image, and to separate the
images from each other since

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.090
there's kind of that light
separator there.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.300
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, and then from
the developer side, there's an

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.720
attribute scale type, which you
can set to center crop,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.620
where the framework will
actually do this for you.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.330
Of course, if you're pulling
down an image from a server

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.610
side or something like that, you
could have the images come

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.920
down at the right size already,
but in many cases

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.700
that's not possible.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.980
So this is actually a really
good way to make sure that

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.100
they're all lined up and
of the same size.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:15.790
I really like this.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.860
It really brings the images out
a little bit more, and as

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.860
you say, the lines really
make a huge difference

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.250
there on the left.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.910
NICK BUTCHER: The before version
where you have the

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.900
uneven raggedness, the edge is
like a jagged tooth pattern.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.415
It looks like you have these
gappy teeth, and it just isn't

00:09:31.415 --> 00:09:32.790
right, [INAUDIBLE] very well.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.760
That is a big improvement.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.480
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.240
What you want to avoid is, if
you look at your design or

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.280
your UI from a few feet away,
you don't want to see a New

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.590
York City skyline.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.660
You want to see consistent
grids.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.300
You want to see rectangular
grids.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.670
And in some cases for really
complex, interesting UIs, you

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.880
probably want to go just a
little deeper than that.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.290
You want to do some more
interesting things.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.780
But at the very most basic
level, if you're simply

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:00.030
presenting a collection of
information, you want to make

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.910
sure that you're establishing
a grid, and establishing

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.220
single lines so that it's very
easy for the eye to follow the

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.920
flow of information.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.320
OK, moving on.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.740
I think the next step is one
of the biggest, and this is

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.860
something we've touched on a
million times in the show, but

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.040
typography.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.630
In a moment you'll see the
difference that just a few

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:28.560
attributes can make in the
overall visual aesthetic, but

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.290
also just the ease in consuming
information.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.245
So let's go to the next
section on typography.

00:10:34.245 --> 00:10:36.790
So you'll notice that here--

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.720
and this is more like micro
typography, where we've looked

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.710
at the treatment of text at the

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.060
individual character level.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.750
I guess it's a combination of
macro and micro, macro being

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:52.620
the typography that's creating
the general figures of text,

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.360
the general blocks of text.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.660
In this case, we've looked at
the micro aspect of that.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.880
So if we look in here to the
list screen, you'll notice

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.430
that in each of the articles,
the title stands

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:07.360
out a little more.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.160
It's Roboto Bold Condensed.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.530
And the subtitle, the "18
minutes ago by the author,"

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:18.040
that was made more muted since
that's less important

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.830
information.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.690
Once your eye settles on a title
that you want to read

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:25.260
about, maybe at that point, you
then want to read about

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.470
the subtitle or you want to
find out who wrote that.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.350
And so once your eye settles
on the title, then you can

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.000
make the small visual step to
look at who wrote it and when

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.120
it was published.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.910
But this really cleanly
separates each individual

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.570
title from the subtitle
as well.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.500
And then on the detail screen
here, we've used a similar

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.830
treatment for the title here.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:51.890
We've again used Roboto
Condensed Bold.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:56.570
But then for the text itself,
we've actually used a custom

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.000
font, it's called Rosario.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.230
But this is generally
not necessary to

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:01.960
use a custom font.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.580
You can use one of the Roboto
variants for body text.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.100
But we found that in this case,
it may be possible to

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.190
introduce this custom font in
a light way, not using it

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:16.190
overly throughout the UI, not
making every single UI element

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:17.340
this custom font.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.510
But in this case, it may
improve legibility.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:25.480
So any thoughts on the
typography, guys?

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.260
NICK BUTCHER: You want to
talk about the line

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.090
spacing as well at all?

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:28.420
ROMAN NURIK: Sure.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.300
So another important aspect
you should look at, when

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.900
changing fonts especially,
is the line spacing.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.440
In typography terms,
it's the leading.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.490
It's basically the space
between each line.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.440
And this affects, again, that
readability aspect.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.410
How easy is it for the eye to
move from one line to the next

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.120
as you get to the end of one
line, jumping over to the next

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.340
one and starting that?

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.620
So all these things-- the
spacing around the text, the

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.090
line spacing between each
line-- that's all very

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.700
important to the readability.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.780
And so here we've used I think
a multiplier of 1.2.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.340
But generally, if you feel that
your text is a little too

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:11.430
cramped, don't underestimate the
power of introducing a 1.1

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.250
or 1.2 line spacing.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.490
ADAM KOCH: And from the
development side, there's two

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:17.940
attributes generally that you
want to look at here.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.510
It's Android Family and
Android Line Spacing

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:21.890
Multiplier.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:26.541
So those together allow you to
achieve an effect like this.

00:13:26.541 --> 00:13:29.070
ROMAN NURIK: And I should
mention that for custom

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.530
fonts-- and again, use them very
sparingly in key areas

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.530
where it may improve the
experience for reading large

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.360
blocks of text.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.930
For custom typefaces,
you may want to look

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.200
at Google Web Fonts.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.990
Rosario, for example, is
available through Google Web

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.870
Fonts and it hints really,
really well on mobile.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.410
So that's another key important
thing is you've got

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.450
to make sure to not just pick a
font based on what it looks

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.310
like on the web.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.410
You want to actually try it out
on a few devices, and make

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:56.260
sure that it looks
really crisp.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.690
Because some fonts, some TTF
files, don't actually have

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:03.840
really good hinting
instructions, and so when

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.740
they're taken down to smaller
sizes, they're not going to

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.380
look very good.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.150
They're just going to
kind of be off and

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.010
not very well aligned.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.630
So that's something that is
definitely important to try,

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:18.440
and not just on the web
but on mobile as well.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.690
Shall we move on?

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.550
NICK BUTCHER: Well, I just want
to say, I think the use

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.710
of different font weights is
a very good way for giving

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:24.850
structure to your content.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.190
I think exactly what Roman was
saying about how you want to

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.150
make this [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.190
18 minutes ago, see visually,
but be equally

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:33.500
legible if you need it.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.755
Just by glancing at this
screenshot, if you look away

00:14:36.755 --> 00:14:39.700
and look back, it just stands
out, the structure of the

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.880
content and what you want to
read first, and it's so much

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.400
easier to scan the page now.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.930
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:45.250
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.500
This concept of visual hierarchy
is very important.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.560
You want to make sure to
establish a visual hierarchy

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.270
in terms of, what is the top
level item and then what are

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.210
its sub-items?

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.620
In this case, the top level
item is the title.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.430
The title of the article is
basically the name that you

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.040
would put in the tree
for the article.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.640
That would be its title.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.600
So the subtitle, as well as its
body content, is kind of a

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.450
child of that, so that should
be lower in the visual

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.390
hierarchy, so it should stand
out a little less.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.640
Again, once your eye hits the
title, then it could move on

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.190
to the sub-items in that tree
to go ahead and read details

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.462
about that.

00:15:26.462 --> 00:15:29.330
All right, moving on?

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.400
So alternatively, we actually
created an alternative

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.030
presentation.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.640
This is something that doesn't
work in every case.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.190
And I think in this case
actually, it doesn't work

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:37.720
super well.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.490
But alternatively, you could
combine photos and text.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:45.260
This is something that a couple
of popular apps do now.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.420
But what you could do is combine
photos and text.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.920
Just make sure that, again,
your text lines up.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.600
So here you'll notice that the
title still lines up with the

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.620
subtitle, and it lines up
with the body as well.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.770
So that's, again, very important
to establish those

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.020
clear lines for alignment.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.950
NICK BUTCHER: So have you used
a visual treatment behind the

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.360
text here to give it some
contrast because you don't

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.110
control the image?

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:10.590
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.560
So there's a little
bit here in the

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.970
sense of we use a gradient.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.570
We've shown this in the past
with, I think it was

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.950
TripAdvisor's redesign.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.380
Nick, you used that effect.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:27.340
We used a gradient, a light
black gradient.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:33.250
So it fades from about a 30%
or 40% opaque black to 0%

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.040
opaque black so that content
along the bottom has stronger

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.350
background protection.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.130
So if the image itself--

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.600
let's say this image of a
steak-- if the whole image is

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.150
actually white, then you'll
still be able to read the text

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.190
because of that background
protection.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.120
So since we're running sort of
low on time, let's start

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.440
flying through some of these.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.200
So we also added a ViewPager
to make sure that you can

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.730
swipe between the
detail screens.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.880
This is fairly straightforward
using the ViewPager from

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.579
Support Library.

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:06.220
NICK BUTCHER: It's [INAUDIBLE]
is well documented on the

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.140
design side.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.510
ROMAN NURIK: And you should,
where possible, introduce this

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.890
into your detail view so that
you can very quickly swipe

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.130
between items.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.380
So let's jump into tablet.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.920
Let's take a flashback
to our Step Zero.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.510
If you were to run that Step
Zero starting point on a

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.319
tablet, this is what
it would look like.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.950
So you'd have two separate
screens that just make

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.080
horrible use of space.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.130
You have all these large regions
of white space here at

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.920
the bottom.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.740
You also very large
line lengths--

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.370
we'll talk about that--

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.490
which makes reading
really a pain.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:44.620
So as you're reading the first
line here, here, here, here,

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.600
then it's time to go on
to the next line.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.260
Your eye is trying to move to
the next line, but it's very

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.550
hard for it to find the next
line, because this text has

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.060
too long of a measure.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.540
So we'll talk about how
to improve that.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.280
ADAM KOCH: And of course, the
images are tiny in this

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.056
particular view.

00:18:01.056 --> 00:18:02.792
So on a tablet, that's
not making very

00:18:02.792 --> 00:18:03.446
good use of the space.

00:18:03.446 --> 00:18:03.840
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.990
Pretty terrible overall.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.063
If this is your tablet
experience,

00:18:06.063 --> 00:18:07.370
this is pretty bad.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.406
You should fix it.

00:18:08.406 --> 00:18:09.720
NICK BUTCHER: It's an
instant uninstall.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.620
ROMAN NURIK: An instant
uninstall on the tablet,

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.610
that's right.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:17.190
So let's say we were to fast
forward, and just use all

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.100
those tricks of spacing and
everything and see what that

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.680
would that look like
on the tablet.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.570
It's much better, but still not
great, because you still

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:24.510
have those long lines.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:28.400
You still have that image where
now the aspect ratio is

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.470
completely different from
the source material.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.970
So you only see the very middle
strip of the image,

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:34.560
which is fine in this case.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.240
ADAM KOCH: Doesn't look too
bad in this case, yeah.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.300
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, it's still
a strip of bacon.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.080
You can't go wrong with that.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.310
But you could do better
than this, right?

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.145
So the next step is to
create a two-pane UI.

00:18:45.145 --> 00:18:47.920
So in this case, what we've
done here is we've simply

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.170
combined the master and
the detail into a

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:52.820
single two-pane UI.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.130
And this is fairly
straightforward.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.650
In Eclipse, you can do File,
New, Master Detail Flow to get

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.910
you the basics for this,
but there's also some

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.585
articles you can read.

00:19:04.585 --> 00:19:06.910
ADAM KOCH: Yeah,
developers.Android.com/training

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.500
has two really good training
classes on that.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:09.850
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.490
So it's fairly straightforward
to do it these days.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.380
There's a lot of prewritten
code for you.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.700
It is fairly complex code if
you're just a beginner, but

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.050
it's File, New, and
you're done.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:21.522
And you can read about
the details here in

00:19:21.522 --> 00:19:23.290
these training articles.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.460
So moving on.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.560
How would we then
improve this?

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:32.360
So what we can do is now start
tweaking, again, the margins

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.620
and the spacing and
the different

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.980
dimensions on tablets.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.830
So that when you open up the
same detail view on a tablet,

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.600
you'll actually get larger
text, for example.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.980
You get more spacing on the
sides to, again, better

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.790
separate the figure from the
ground, better separate the

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.240
text from its background.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.750
You can bump up font sizes.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.930
You can bump up line spacing.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.710
Again, lots of things you can
do here to make it better.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.040
And it's fairly easy from the
development side as well.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.570
ADAM KOCH: I mean hopefully,
when we are talking about the

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:08.320
phone side, you extracted all
of the different dimensions,

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.800
padding, spacing, into a
separate XML file, and then

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.710
you can choose when you want
to bump those up again, at

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:16.960
which screen size you want
to bump them up.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.880
So in this example down in the
bottom here, it's at smallest

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.390
with 600dp, and then at 720dp
for seven- and ten-inch

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.080
tablets respectively.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.590
But of course, it's up
to you when you want

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.480
to tweak those sizes.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.590
This is just the standard and
what we would recommend for

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.050
looking at different sizes.

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.020
NICK BUTCHER: And you
can provide multiple

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.720
switchpoints, right?

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.560
So you can have different
metrics on a five-inch,

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.190
seven-inch, [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.770
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, for sure.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:43.670
And actually, one that we don't
often talk about is

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:44.790
small devices.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.510
So devices that have really
small screens, you may want to

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.900
tweak things even further
there, maybe even start

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.580
compressing information into
separate navigable sections.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.510
If your user base is on small
devices, then again, that's

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:01.360
something that you want to do
using something like sw300 or

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:07.680
200dp, or values-small,
for example.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.210
So let's actually look at some
of the metrics here, take a

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.070
quick sidebar.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:16.110
And again, this still uses the
48dp rhythm in the sense that

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:20.550
things are generally multiples
of 48 or 16, and for smaller

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:25.960
sizes, we use 32, 16, 24,
8, things like that.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.770
Powers of two and things
divisible by four, roughly.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:33.630
So here's just some of
the quick examples.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.510
Generous margins around
the content here.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:37.790
I mean, 80dp.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:41.110
If you're not using something
as large as 80 or 64dp for

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.690
margins on a tablet, then you
probably should be, since you

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:48.280
really want a lot of space so
that the eye can comfortably

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.100
read the content.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:57.630
And then the font size here
is fairly large, 48sp's.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:00.160
Let's also look at that
same alternative.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.860
So again, with the photo
behind the text.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.080
It's even more evident
here that there's

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.840
a background gradient.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.750
But again, the key point here is
that you'll notice that the

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:09.690
alignment is still there.

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:14.320
The text still aligns so that
the eye can very quickly read.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.700
We've been talking a
lot about reading.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.820
If you're interested in reading
more about this, look

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.390
up macro typography, as
well as readability.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.850
There's a lot of great articles
out there on how to

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.388
best create a very readable
experience.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.420
Let's keep flying through.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.740
So some extra credit
things that we did.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.030
What could a notification
be like?

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:36.500
Let's say you're a blog author
or an author, and you're

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.510
posting stuff to this
bacon site.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.640
Let's say that there's some
sort of background process

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.420
that says, the photo is

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.700
uploading, the text is uploading.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.130
What could a nice
notification be?

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:50.210
You could get a notification
with a preview of the photo

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:52.680
that everything's
been uploaded.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:58.290
And then when you swipe down,
you'll notice that the

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.905
expanded version actually
has that photo.

00:23:00.905 --> 00:23:03.100
Lets you maybe share
the article.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.480
And this is all very easy
to do from a developer

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.440
standpoint.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.570
ADAM KOCH: There's a class
called NotificationCompat,

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.940
which I think we've mentioned
before, that allows you to

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.210
build these richer notifications
from newer

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:14.940
platform versions, but
remains backward

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.010
compatible with older versions.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.480
Definitely good to use.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.330
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, super
trivial, I'd say, to use.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.980
It's only couple
lines of code.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.350
We're also working
on a template.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.550
You could do File, New,
Notification, it'll just build

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.190
all this code for you.

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:34.660
So moving on, another quick
tidbit is if you're using a

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.830
web view for presenting
content, then you're

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:37.820
automatically going
to get this.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.470
But if you're not, if you're
using a text view, by default,

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:42.200
your text will not
be selectable.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.600
So if you long press on
the body content,

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.710
nothing will happen.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:49.510
So there's a really
neat little trick

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.980
that you could do.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.870
You could set a single attribute
on your text view--

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:54.450
and this is more for developers,
of course--

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.410
that makes that text
selectable.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.440
And from there, you can
obviously customize.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.680
You can say, allow people
to share this text or

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.556
copy it, and so on.

00:24:01.556 --> 00:24:02.710
ADAM KOCH: And surprise,
surprise.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:07.000
That attribute is called
Text Is Selectable.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.050
Easy.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.600
ROMAN NURIK: Very simple.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.700
Let's keep moving on.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.270
So this is the last step here.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.360
This is what it looks like.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.000
So you guys remember from the
very beginning, the very, very

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.160
beginning starting point was
it was just all over the

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.440
place, didn't look
good on a tablet.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.590
The spacing was awful, it was
hard to pick out the articles

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.930
from each other.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:31.300
The photos weren't
well aligned.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.160
The typography was just
very bare bones.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.580
And so with just a few tweaks--
and actually, all

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.240
these screenshots
are screenshots.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.800
They're not Photoshop
mock-ups.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.580
I think overall, it took
us a few hours to

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.780
put this all together.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.580
Each one of these tweaks
is very incremental.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.570
It's minor iteration, right?

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.190
It's not like a revolutionary
design by any means.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:56.200
So with very little
work, I'd say, you

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.790
can get to this point.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.370
So you should definitely
get to it.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.063
With that-- unless you guys
have any final thoughts?

00:25:04.063 --> 00:25:04.406
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:25:04.406 --> 00:25:07.060
I think it's been really awesome
to show the processes,

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.670
and the things that we think
about and look at in a

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:09.880
redesign, so hopefully
it's been--

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.645
ROMAN NURIK: Cool.

00:25:10.645 --> 00:25:13.760
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, makes me want
to eat some bacon ASAP.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.290
ROMAN NURIK: We're past
lunch, but I think

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:19.026
Nick is almost there.

00:25:19.026 --> 00:25:21.810
Let's jump in to Android
Design News.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:25.540
So we don't have too much
design news today.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.090
Nick, do you want to start
with Gunther's blog post?

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:28.820
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.630
So Gunther and the guys from
Apollo did a really, really

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.780
good blog post talking about
the importance and the

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.290
opportunity of using widgets
with your application.

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:38.730
I think they really summed up
the opportunity there for me,

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.690
that this is a prime piece of
real estate on the user's

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.830
device where much of their user
journeys start from, and

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:47.425
you get to show another avenue
for your content, and have a

00:25:47.425 --> 00:25:48.803
really quick and easy
way to put stuff

00:25:48.803 --> 00:25:50.290
on their home screen.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.290
It's a shame when many
apps don't offer this

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:52.675
functionality.

00:25:52.675 --> 00:25:54.490
So really think about how
widgets might work with your

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.870
app and your content.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:58.860
ROMAN NURIK: Absolutely.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.220
Next up, from Taylor,
we have the

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.242
Wireframe Screen Flow Template.

00:26:05.242 --> 00:26:07.490
I'll briefly just
mention that.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.210
It's very important to map out
the different interactions in

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:11.980
your app, not just
the visuals.

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.030
So when you touch this,
what happens?

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:17.200
When you pitch here or
double touch here or

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.820
swipe here, what happens?

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:23.780
And so this is a great starter
template for basically giving

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.880
you the different gestures that
you'd want to do, as well

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.720
as linking up different
screens using

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.420
these little red arrows.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.720
So if you're starting from
scratch, you may want to just

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.290
start from this point if
you're mapping out the

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:36.865
interactions within your app.

00:26:36.865 --> 00:26:39.080
NICK BUTCHER: It kind of
helps you think about

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.030
navigation as well.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.330
So if you think you have
multiple routes into your

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:46.030
content to say, we've done a
widget for the bacon app we've

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.420
just been looking at,
you might come

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.370
into a detail screen.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:52.550
So it helps you think about how
the hierarchy might work

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:53.935
as well, I think.

00:26:53.935 --> 00:26:56.310
ROMAN NURIK: Absolutely.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.200
Moving on--

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.290
so at this point, we should
talk about the different

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:01.910
communities out there.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:04.730
So there are two communities,
and these are evidenced by our

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:06.240
two slides here.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.250
There's the official Android
Design Community on Google+.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:12.160
If you haven't joined it,
feel free to join.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.550
There is an issue currently
with the community in the

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.600
sense that there's a lot
of spam and a lot

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.000
of off-topic posts.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.210
We're currently exploring ways
in which we can make the

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.860
community more valuable,
provide more value for

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.520
everyday designers.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.930
So definitely if you have some
questions or if you want to

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:34.030
start a discussion thread about
a certain topic, feel

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:36.630
free to post here.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:37.030
NICK BUTCHER: There's
some design

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:37.820
topics in there as well.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.010
So it's like design feedback
requests and so on,

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.490
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:41.930
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:44.330
If you have any questions about
your design, if you want

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:48.030
folks in the general public to
provide comments on your

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.955
design, feel free to post
a few screenshots.

00:27:49.955 --> 00:27:52.820
I'd avoid posting links to
apps, because that can be

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.670
viewed as kind of spammy, but
if you could post some

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:57.660
screenshots, folks generally
are good

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.310
about providing feedback.

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.310
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.930
Most discussion seems at this
point around a specific

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.090
question, like, how do you feel
about my spacing on X,

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.270
kind of thing, rather than,
what do you think?

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.870
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.010
And then there's also the
Unofficial Android Designers

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:16.140
Community, which I believe they
have an approval process,

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.885
but it's fairly lightweight.

00:28:17.885 --> 00:28:19.100
And this is more for

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.780
professional Android designers.

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:25.520
If you're doing design work for
a company, for a client,

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.510
or even for your own company
that you work for, and that's

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:37.330
your core job, this is a more
advanced, higher level

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:38.630
thinking community.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.650
There's lots of good
content on here.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.580
So I'd advise joining
both at this point.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.990
And I think lastly, Kahil--

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:51.780
I'm going to butcher
your name, sorry.

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:57.070
Kahil Nettleton has posted a
PSD version of all of the

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.190
icons in the Action Bar
Icon Pack available on

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.860
developer.Androi
d.com/design/downloads.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.960
He's posted that in
a PSD format.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.750
So if you don't use Illustrator
or if you don't

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:12.700
have Illustrator, and you just
want the shapes in PSD format,

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.440
then this may be for you.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.530
Actually, there is one more.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:27.100
Michal has done a great job in
taking all of the slides from

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.460
episodes 1 through 12 of the
show-- basically everything we

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.560
did in 2012--

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.550
and putting them into
a single zip file.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:35.110
So if you've wanted that--

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:37.420
if you don't feel like going
through all the Google+ posts

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.840
and fetching all the screenshots
and all that--

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.790
it's available in a single zip
file available on his Dropbox.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.790
If he decides to take it off
his Dropbox, then sorry.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:50.160
But he's done everybody a favor
in doing this, so thank

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.410
you, Michal.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:55.590
I think that's our last slide.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.880
With that, any parting
thoughts, guys?

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.140
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, one more
piece of news actually.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.316
I forgot to add it into the
show, but I just saw it in one

00:30:02.316 --> 00:30:04.250
of the screenshots from
the community.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.810
If you're in London, there's
an event going on in the

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:13.090
Google Campus building on the
25th and 26th of January, so

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.650
next weekend.

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:18.390
Design and developers coming
together and talking about

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:19.240
designing for Android.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.840
So if you can make it to London,
then check it out.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.360
And for more information,
go to the London GDG--

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.680
the Google Developers Group.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.100
Go to their Google+ page, and
you'll find all the details.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.640
ROMAN NURIK: Cool.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:30.910
ADAM KOCH: Great.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.690
ROMAN NURIK: Well, thanks
for joining us in

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:33.670
Android Design in Action.

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.100
As always, I'm Roman Nurik.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.226
ADAM KOCH: Adam Koch.

00:30:36.226 --> 00:30:37.310
NICK BUTCHER: And
Nick Butcher.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.630
ADAM KOCH: See you guys later.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:39.230
ROMAN NURIK: See you.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:40.480
Peace out.
