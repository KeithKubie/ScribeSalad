00:00:00.000 --> 00:03:10.640
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.380
ROMAN NURIK: Hello, and welcome
once again to "Android

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.340
Design in Action." I'm your
host, Roman Nurik.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.610
ADAM KOCH: Hi, guys.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.960
My name is Adam Koch.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.320
ROMAN NURIK: Today we'll be
talking about podcast creators

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.870
and design tools.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.920
Now when we talk about podcast
creators, we don't mean

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.710
podcast listeners, which I
believe the app clinic guys

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.480
have done before.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.410
We're going to be talking
about podcast creation,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.580
basically the process of
creating, recording, managing,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.700
and then uploading your podcast
to whatever podcast

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.460
host you use.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.565
So with that, should
we jump in?

00:03:45.565 --> 00:03:47.160
ADAM KOCH: Let's go for it.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.290
ROMAN NURIK: So when you talk
about podcast creation, you're

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.110
probably thinking about a couple
of different functions,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.510
basic behaviors that
our podcast

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.050
creation app should offer.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.440
The first is obviously
to record audio.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.790
The second is probably to edit
and fine tune your audio.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.720
So once you've done creating
or once you're done with a

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.940
recording, going in and then
trimming and changing things

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.650
and inserting effects and
muting-- things like that.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.750
And then, of course,
management--

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.329
so just like any sort of blog
management app, you probably

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.300
want some way to publish items,
look at currently

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.600
published items, have a draft
mode for certain things, and

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.770
so on and so forth.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.250
Then we also decided that for
podcast creation, or anything

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.570
that has a thick mode, you
do have two modes here.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.110
You have the recording
mode, like I'm

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.780
currently capturing audio.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.550
And that's something that the
user should be aware of,

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.790
almost like playing music.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.090
If you're playing music, the
user should be aware at all

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.650
times that music is playing.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.110
And that's why you see things
like a notification icon.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.760
Or if you're in the app, you
see a persistent bar.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.290
And the other obvious very thick
mode, or lack thereof,

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.680
is just the idle state or the
pause state where you're not

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.320
recording anything.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.050
So with these high level
functions, we decided

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.800
to look then at--

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.720
actually, I forgot to mention,
we're not actually going to

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.570
redesign or re-imagine
any existing apps.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.220
We're just going to go through
the process of designing a

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.840
hypothetical podcast
creation app.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.430
So here's the first set of
things that we thought about.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.690
The second set of things that
we thought about is the

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.340
underlying functions.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.390
So for each of these main themes
for create and for edit

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.950
and for manager, you want to
have more specific bits of

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.550
functionality.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.540
So for creation, you probably
want to have the ability to

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.710
start and resume recording
during the actual recording.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.950
You want to be able to mute
and unmute probably, if

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.250
something comes up and you
want insert a silence.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.040
And then you probably want to
insert either live sound

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.260
effects or clips, like an intro
clip or an outro clip or

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.730
fake applause or something
like that.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:01.960
ADAM KOCH: A gong, you
always need a gong.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.400
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, the gong.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.120
And then for edit, you want
things to be able to edit the

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.490
basic info, like the title and
description, the stuff that

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.880
basically appears in the RSS.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.650
And then some basic editing
functions as well as

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.710
uploading, obviously.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.800
You want to be able to upload
the final product to the

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.830
podcast host.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.960
And then for management, you
obviously want to be able to

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.910
view the list of published
podcast episodes as well as

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:38.130
the list of drafts and maybe
manage the drafts somehow.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.220
This is a very, very basic
podcast creation app that we

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.530
were thinking about.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.420
We roughly broke things out into
these basic functions.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.910
And this doing this type
of exercise helps

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.090
scope out the app.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.480
And it's a very good idea to do
something like this before

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.660
jumping into the design
or the layout or

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.960
anything more detailed.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.560
So with these high level
functions, we then looked at

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.060
some basic explorations
of layout.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.300
So once you know what the app
does, you want to start

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.290
thinking about how it
roughly looks like

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.830
and it roughly behaves.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.540
So we imagined a single a
podcast creation or recording

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.930
screen with a nice big
chronometer or whatever to

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.180
show the current time just so
you know how far into the

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.220
podcast you are.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.790
You want those functions of
pause and resume and mute to

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.500
be available immediately.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.140
And then you want to have some
way of exposing live effects,

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.360
so things like the intro clips,
the outro clips, the

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.160
gong, things like that.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.880
You want to be to expose that.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.000
And then there's a couple
of notes down there--

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.030
not very important.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.080
Actually, one of the things I
wanted to mention is that

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.570
during the sketching process,
it's always important to think

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.430
about larger devices.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.860
So these are some annotations
that as I was sketching, just

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.950
thinking, what would this
look like on tablets?

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.450
And some of these annotations
are just some very basic

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.250
things, like the multiple tabs
split out into multiple panes

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:08.870
on tablets.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.770
And this happens in landscape
and so on.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.710
So it's always good to
keep in mind things.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.300
Even if you don't fully sketch
them out, just make note of

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.990
your thought process of how
things should adapt on

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.490
different devices.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.850
The next thing we wanted
to do is look at

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.180
the different states.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.480
So your app does have
two states.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.570
It has a paused and
a recording state.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.340
And then here's just some ideas
about what to do with

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.020
the Action bar, what
to do with the

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.030
Record and Pause button.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.809
And another thing that's very
important on Android,

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:41.950
obviously, is notifications.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.750
And we've mentioned this
probably a million times.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.830
It's very important to have
really solid notifications.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.430
So we immediately thought that
as one of these states, in

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.240
this recording state, we want
to have a notification,

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.520
especially if you're
not in the app.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.920
And we just did a very quick
mock of what that could look

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.580
like with the Pause and Mute
actions in line with the

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:00.970
notifications.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.010
ADAM KOCH: And of course, it's a
rich notification, which has

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.860
these Pause and Mute buttons
directly in the notification,

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.470
which is really nice.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.380
ROMAN NURIK: And I think--

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.770
I'm not fully sure, I don't
remember the exact framework

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.980
details-- but I believe that
in a notification, you can

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.780
actually also specify
a chronometer.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.130
So instead of showing the time,
you can show the time

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.540
elapsed for something.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.370
So here, it's just showing the
time elapsed incrementing

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.130
every second.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.990
So you can get a feel, an on the
fly updating feel for how

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:32.430
long the podcast currently is.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.640
There's another note here.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.240
This is something that's just
really important to annotate

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.950
your sketches to make sure that
you take down those brief

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.390
moments of thought that you
have when you're thinking

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.990
about all these different
things.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.380
And then here's just another
quick sketch of what we

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.520
thought things could look like
on a tablet where again,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.060
things are slightly bigger.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.710
The time and display
is slightly bigger.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.150
Things are slightly
rearranged.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.820
But then your two tabs are then
split out into a multiple

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.550
panes, where you the live
effects on the right and the

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.930
recording stuff on the left.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.510
So that was the sketching
process.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.970
Obviously, this is a very
compressed design process.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.690
In a real design process, you
want to sketch much more.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:17.270
You want to iterate.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.700
You want to show it to people
and get feedback.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.940
We only had, basically,
a day to do this.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.020
So we didn't go through
the whole process.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.890
But once you're done with
sketches, once you have a good

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.840
feel of what things should look
like, the next step is to

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.090
do wire framing.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.490
That's the one that we
already talked about.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.950
So the next things is
to do wire framing.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.170
So this looks a little the
higher fidelity than a regular

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.110
wire frame.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.280
This is actually
in Illustrator.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.140
This was done in Illustrator.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.880
Most of our screen mock ups
are done in Photoshop.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.390
This week we decided to do
things in Illustrator.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.280
And you probably won't see
this here, but almost all

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.320
these elements are from the
stencil kit, which we'll talk

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.625
about that comes on
developer.androi

00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:05.432
d.com/design/downloads.

00:11:05.432 --> 00:11:07.550
And so they provide you
with fairly high

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.410
fidelity versions of things.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.840
But you don't necessarily
have to do that.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.990
You can use lower fidelity
stencils, even just squares

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.290
and rectangles just to get a
feel for the positioning.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.120
But in this case, this is a
medium fidelity mock, where

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.190
it's not pixel perfect, but it
is using the actual visual

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.420
elements of Holo.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.390
So here's what your management
screen can look like.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.400
We roughly separated things out
into drafts and published.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.950
So your drafts are probably
the thing you're thinking

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.550
about the most at any given
moment is, the next episode,

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.000
the next episode.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.430
And so those are prioritized
at the top.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.630
And then there's a little subtle
way to rearrange them.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.090
Adam and I were talking
about this.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.640
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, we were just
thinking, we actually don't

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.590
know a lot about creating
podcasts ourselves.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.020
So depending on how you think
people create podcasts, you

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.930
could just prioritize these
based on last edited or last

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.140
viewed or something like that
instead of being able to

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.330
manually rearrange them using
those drag handles.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.100
ROMAN NURIK: And if
you do that, you

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.790
should definitely mention--

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.890
like, over here, there's
April 8, April 1--

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.390
you should show last edited and
then a time, just so that

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.940
it's completely obvious what
the sort order is.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.360
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, you could also
limit it to five most

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.980
recent and have something
that says, show all.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.240
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah that's
definitely a good way.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.180
You could actually do
this using tabs.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.480
You could have drafts
and then published.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.440
But this is a nicer way of
presenting everything at once

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.715
without having to burden the
user with extra navigation.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.230
There's some minor things here
basically just the difference

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.060
between drafts and publishes,
which is the most important

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.130
thing, just to get the users
thinking about was most

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.010
important first.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:42.840
So that's management.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.960
We didn't go into all the
details of management.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.430
Actually, there's one missing
screen shot here.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.450
If you're managing multiple
podcasts, which you probably

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.730
should allow, a great way to do
that is using the spinner

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.110
navigation.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:57.620
And actually, another thing here
is that there shouldn't

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.690
be an up icon, because there's
nowhere to go up.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.750
So this is medium fidelity
mockups.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.620
You're not going to get
the fullest view

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.400
of things from this.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.660
Anyway, let's move on.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.020
So next is the creation
and recording part.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.060
And we spent a lot of time
thinking through this.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.260
Since I think this is the most
unique aspect of a podcast

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.630
creation app, you have to really
think about what the

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.670
process of recording is like,
what the user experience is

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:26.440
like there.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.270
The process of managing blog
post or managing podcast

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.670
episodes is very similar
to a blog.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.710
So we didn't go into
detail there.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.490
So some of the things
you could do here--

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.390
as you can see, this is what
it looks like on a tablet.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.040
So we split things up into
Info and Record.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.870
So Info is basically letting you
manage the basic details

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.920
of the episode, like title, the

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.520
description, things like that.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.760
But the most important part
is the recording process.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.120
So here, you'll see that there's
a nice big preview of

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.080
the current duration,
nice big affordances

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.350
for Pause and Mute.

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:03.790
And this interesting flourish--
and this is where

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:08.190
you can start exploring
different UI types,

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.540
interesting UI elements.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.760
It's less interesting than
sketches, because it's a

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.630
little harder to visualize.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.690
But once you get down to low
to medium fidelity wire

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.370
frames, you can start thinking
through different

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.240
interactions.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.230
So in this case, we just
thought, wouldn't it be cool

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.690
if you have this bar that
changes height based on the

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:26.580
current volume?

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.710
And then from the left,
it actually

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:30.940
just creates the wave.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.020
The wave is slowly progressing
to the left.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.030
But this little bar here is
growing and shrinking.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.010
And then when you're not
recording, it just goes away.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.080
So that's one interesting
take on it.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.110
I haven't seen that before.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:48.020
And then another thing we did
here is we combined the live

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.300
effects into the screen.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.380
So we took the standard
multi-pane approach.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.520
We use a combination of tabs
and multi-pane here, but a

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.040
standard, great way
to use space.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.650
ADAM KOCH: And this is nice,
because you obviously want

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.750
easy access to these effects
while you're recording,

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.665
whereas the info you can edit
once before when you're paused

00:15:07.665 --> 00:15:08.750
or something like that.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.210
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and we'll
see on the phone, you still

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.860
have access to this stuff.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.900
But it's just one swipe away.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.260
ADAM KOCH: It's just taking
advantage of the extra screen

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.540
on the larger device.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.250
ROMAN NURIK: And then here, just
some examples of how you

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.230
can present clips and
live effects.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:24.270
Obviously, pressing the dot,
dot, dot should take you to a

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.850
customization or more effects
screen or something like that.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.990
So let's move on.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.790
So here's what it'll look
like on a phone.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.905
Again, very similar, it's just
that the effects portion is

00:15:34.905 --> 00:15:36.930
taken into a separate tab.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.210
And you have basically
the same UI.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.410
It's somewhat responsive.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.460
You still have slight changes
in core navigation between

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.420
tablet and phone.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:49.020
But the core app is still
very much the same.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.260
So this is the recording
state.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.180
And now, what does it look
like in the pause state?

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.950
So in the pause state,
you no longer have

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:55.720
the option to mute.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.410
Mute doesn't make sense.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.300
And the Resume button
has basically

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.920
been given extra treatment.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.950
Another thing I wanted to call
out is the Action Bar.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:08.000
So if you're recording, the Up
button should probably just

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.960
take you up to the management
screen, that white

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.340
screen that we had.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.920
And then you should show the
notification probably, or a

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.000
persistent Now Recording
bar at the bottom.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.620
But if you're paused, it's an
indication that either you're

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:27.020
temporarily taking a break
or you're done.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.060
You're actually done with
this recording session.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.040
You'll record more later,
but you're done.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.800
And so what we do is, we
actually changed the Action

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:39.460
Bar to go from showing the Up
button to or the Done button

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.640
to further give you the sense
that, hey, I can press Done.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.280
And I can then from
there, publish.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.820
We also looked at this
Info section,

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.910
so editing the details.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.790
If you swipe over, you can
edit the title, the

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:56.600
description.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.560
And you do still have this
persistent bar at the top to

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.340
indicate that something
is happening.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.520
So you always want to
indicate that mode.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.720
If you're in that thick, heavy
mode, like navigation or

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.290
playing music or something, you
always want to make sure

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.680
that there's something on screen
that indicates that.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.950
And if it's in the app,
it could be a

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.390
persistent bar like this.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:17.140
If you're out of the app, then
it should be a notification.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.260
ADAM KOCH: And it's worth noting
as well that the Mute

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.869
and Pause buttons down here
are also persistent across

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:25.445
these tabs, because you see
it here in the Info.

00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:28.040
And we saw on the
Record as well.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.790
So that's that thick state
coming to the front again,

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.090
being able to control
it from any of

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:32.430
these different screens.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.070
And then, of course, if you exit
out of the app, you've

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.060
got the notification there
to control it.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.520
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and if you
swipe over to Effects--

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.170
and this is one of the biggest
reasons for this--

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.160
if you're in Effects, if you're
playing an intro clip,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.250
you probably want to mute
yourself for a moment.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.320
So you press Mute, press
the intro clip.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.140
And soon as that's done
playing, you unmute.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.310
So it's very easy from a single
screen at any point to

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:52.560
do what you want to do.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.400
I think one of the last
components of this is, what

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.200
happens when you're in the Info
screen and you're paused?

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.340
At that point, you probably
want to give the user the

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.860
option to preview and publish.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.890
If they press Preview and
Publish, it takes them to

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.420
separate flow, where
they can maybe even

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.640
edit, maybe make tweaks.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.780
But they can preview what
they've currently recorded.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.660
Once they're ready, it'll
upload using a ongoing

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.960
notification with an upload
progress, and then publish

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.990
when they're ready.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.680
So pretty straightforward,
a lot of this stuff is.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.370
There's nothing very
revolutionary.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.270
But here, you just want to
approach a creation a podcast

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.570
creation app.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.790
I think there's one more
screen on editing.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:39.570
So we didn't spend the time to
figure out where this would go

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:42.430
into the greater scheme
of the app.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:46.200
But one of the things that's
interesting is, this is a

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:51.630
different type of medium that
you're probably used to.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.420
On Android, you're probably
used to editing photos or

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.070
editing text or selecting
text.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:01.240
But you could use the same
metaphors and the same visuals

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.830
to apply to audio.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.340
So you can do something like
long press on the audio to

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.080
select a second or so, and then
show those little drag

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.950
candles so that you can
drag them around.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.420
And then you can have
an insertion point.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.430
So if you have something
in the clipboard, then

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.610
you can do a paste.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:19.790
You should also offer things--

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:23.050
we didn't show this here-- but
things like, fade out, fade

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:24.630
in, all sorts of effects.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.050
Those are very contextual to the
current point in the audio

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:28.940
you're looking at.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:33.050
So definitely make sure to use
this type of UI if you're

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.550
doing editing.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:35.690
I think it would make
a lot of sense.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.760
ADAM KOCH: And we were chatting
about a pretty neat

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.410
addition or feature where you
could possibly play the first

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.920
second of the selected clip and
maybe the last second as

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.580
well, so you can make sure that
your anchor points are at

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.300
the point you want them to be.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.770
ROMAN NURIK: One way you could
do that is, you can offer

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.230
little play buttons here.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:53.090
So a little play button,
and pressing that

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.390
plays the first second.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:58.010
And the play button here that
plays the last second up to

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:04.190
that point, just so
you have the frame

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.750
perfect view of things.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.870
Another thing I wanted to
mention is gestures.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:12.050
So you also want to support
gestures, like multi-finger

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:15.710
gestures and the scrolling
gesture.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.260
And if you're implementing
this--

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.910
I actually just wanted to
make a quick shout out.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:26.360
There's an updated gestures
training class.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.000
If you go to developer.androi
d.com/training/gestures,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.340
there's a nice piece of sample
code that shows you how to do

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.510
all these different things with
all the different gesture

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.660
detectors to--

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.300
ADAM KOCH: It's a very nice
piece of sample code, written

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.680
by a very talented developer.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.920
ROMAN NURIK: So with that,
I think that was

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.050
it for podcast creation.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.860
I think we're about halfway.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:50.140
So let's move on to
design tools.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.580
So design tools--

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:57.020
when we talk about design tools,
we like to break things

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.680
out by the hat you wear,
the discipline.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.430
So we don't just talk about,
here's the basic design tool

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.830
for designers.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.165
There's different disciplines--
interaction

00:21:06.165 --> 00:21:10.010
design, visual design, motion
design, asset production,

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.830
which is a very specific thing
to Android, creating

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.360
nine-patches and things
like that.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.800
So we like to break down the
tools that you should be using

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:23.750
based on these hats
that people wear.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.680
And you'll see a little circle
in each of these slides

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.960
indicating who this is for.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.390
So the very first set of tools--
and this is very, very

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:33.540
obvious-- but the Adobe
Creative Suite.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.250
And this is Illustrator,

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.450
Fireworks, Photoshop, InDesign.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.800
Three things that I really
want to quickly call out.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.110
The first is that we do have
official Android stencils

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.330
available for these.

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:50.490
And so what you saw today with
the podcast creation app was

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:55.040
using the official Android
stencils for Illustrator.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.240
The next is that, most of the
Android design team, as far as

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:02.070
I know, they use Illustrator,
Fireworks, and Photoshop.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.640
Illustrator is very,
very common with

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.085
our interaction designers.

00:22:05.085 --> 00:22:07.450
For visual design, I think
mostly they use

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.220
Photoshop and Fireworks.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.490
But Fireworks can actually
work really well for

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.310
interaction design as well,
because it can actually create

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.880
clickable sections, like you can
have interactive mockups.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.910
I think I demoed this
two years ago.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.660
You can create an interactive
PDF where you click on

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.810
different things, and it takes
you to different pages.

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:29.870
It's a much nicer way to
visualize a flow or to

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.410
visualize a sequence of
events in your app.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:34.150
So definitely consider
doing that.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.260
And there's a recent article on
smashingmag.com on how to

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.700
use InDesign to do something
very similar.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.370
I haven't tried this myself,
but it seems really

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:41.830
interesting.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.980
So if you're doing interaction
design, definitely check out

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.140
this article about InDesign
interaction design.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:53.760
Let's move on to some other
interaction design tools.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.750
For interaction design,
obviously, one of the things

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.750
you want to is sketch a lot--
a lot, a lot, a lot.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:03.390
But there are also some software
tools for sketching

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:04.940
for creating wire frames
and especially

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.150
interactive wire frames.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.020
Here's a quick selection
of them.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.890
I generally prefer using
OmniGraffle, since we have

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.870
officials stencils for those.

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:17.700
And you could actually do both
low and high fidelity wire

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.510
frames there.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.140
Almost all the other tools,
since they don't have the

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.590
official stencils, they have
unofficial stencils, which

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.480
aren't really high fidelity,
which is fine, for wire frames

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.750
it's totally OK.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:32.180
And actually, the last three
here-- fluid UI, Proto.io and

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.230
Balsamiq Mockups--

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:35.380
those are also really good,
because they're web based.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.650
And what that means is that
you can create actual

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:43.650
prototypes, deploy them to a
website, and share them with

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.940
your product manager.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.940
I think you can create logins
for other design team members,

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.970
so you can have multiple members
of the design team

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.770
working on the same project
all along the web.

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.320
So some pretty cool
stuff there.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.230
And then Proto.io was actually
something that Paul Burke

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:02.630
recently mentioned to us,
basically something that lets

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:05.760
you actually mock up gestures
as well as you can do, like

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.590
scrolling and swiping and
things like that.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.740
So lots of good tools here.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.460
And there's more than just
these, obviously, but here's

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.530
the quick selection
of some of them.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:19.420
Here's what Fluid UI looks like,
just a quick example of

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.870
the interactive mockup
so you can create.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:27.000
So in this case, this My Agenda
tab, when you click

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.150
that in the final interactive
HTML file, it actually takes

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.780
you to a different page, so you
can create these links.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.030
It's really cool.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:39.020
The next thing we wanted
to talk about was

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.240
Android Design Preview.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.580
So this is more for
visual designers.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:48.000
And this basically lets you
mirror a portion of your

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.530
screen from your computer
to your Android device.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.280
So let's say you have Photoshop
open, and you have a

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.950
high fidelity visual
mockup open.

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:02.460
This is actually something from
one of our past episodes.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.540
So all you need to do is, you
need to open up the Android

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.670
Design Preview app.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.160
It's this little window
that pops up here.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.860
You can then drag around
this red rectangle.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:12.180
It's kind of faint.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.200
You can't really see it.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.980
But you drag it to encapsulate
your part of the screen that

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.040
you want to mirror And then it
mirrors that to your device.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:25.130
What's not pictured here is the
USB cable that you need

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.920
plugged in.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.470
So you do need to use USB, and
it doesn't work over Wi-Fi

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.590
currently, but it's definitely
a good tool to

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:33.998
have in your arsenal.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:39.410
Next, we have--

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:41.200
actually, I'm going to spend a
little bit of time on this.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:48.340
So a lot of designers on
Android, they often lament

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.320
that there's a lot of asset
production work to do.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.210
And you have to create
nine-patches.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.770
And you have to create all these
different states for

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:58.850
buttons and things and
tabs and whatnot.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.010
And certainly, there
are a lot of things

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.130
you do need to create.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.900
To create a really awesome app,
you need to think about

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:09.520
different screen densities
and things like that.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.000
But there are a lot of
tools out there that

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.460
can help in the process.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.690
And this is especially true if
you're following the Holo

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:15.650
visual language.

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:18.180
So if you have your completely
custom UI, there's not really

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.170
anything that'll help
you with that.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.780
There are some tools, like some
Photoshop actions and

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.580
Fireworks plug-ins that
will do that.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.200
But for the most part, if you're
following Holo, there's

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.530
some really good tools
online for this.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.360
So the first is the Android
Asset Studio.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.830
We covered this before, so I
won't go into detail on it.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.760
But the next is the Actual Bar
Style Generator, which we

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.050
talked about in a
past episode.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.960
I just want to reiterate
how important it

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.780
is to use this tool.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:48.350
Basically, it lets you very
quickly throw in a few colors.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:51.980
And it would generate all this
stuff, all the cruft, the XML

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.900
files, the PNG files, basically
everything that you

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.720
need to get your Action Bar
to base level of theming.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.000
ADAM KOCH: It's a
good jump start.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.370
And I think it's also compatible
with the Action Bar

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:02.830
Sherlock as well.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:03.240
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah,
that's right.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.870
So there's an option to create
Sherlock styles.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.360
So if you're using Action
Bar Sherlock, it'll

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.830
just work with you.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:14.480
And I just can't stress how
important it is to use this in

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.550
addition to Action Bar Sherlock,
in addition to the

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.910
core Action Bar APIs
rather than try to

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:21.010
build your own thing.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:24.810
If you try to build your own
custom Action Bar, you're

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:26.350
going to have to re implement
a lot of stuff.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:28.030
And it's just not going
to look as good.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:32.260
So definitely use this
tool if you can.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.465
And the last tool, which is, I
think, even more impressive in

00:27:35.465 --> 00:27:36.800
its technical--

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.520
and the amount of stuff
it does for you is

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.700
Android Holo Colors.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:46.650
So Android Holo Colors is very
similar to Action Bar, to the

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:49.120
Action Bar Style Generator,
except it creates UI

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:49.810
controls for you.

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:52.650
So if you want purple--

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:56.340
let's say your core brand
accent is purple--

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.770
if you want purple check boxes
and purple buttons and purple

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.620
text fields and everything,
Android Holo Colors will

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:02.980
generate all this for you.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:06.500
You basically tell it which UI
controllers you want to create

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.650
or which controllers you plan on
using, and it will generate

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:10.680
those assets for you.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.990
The last thing I wanted to
mention is, with the Action

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.510
Bar Style Generator, it's not
only good for creating Action

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:18.460
Bar assets, it's also good for
creating touch states.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.680
So the standard touch state
on Android is this

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.400
semi-transparent blue overlay.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.580
But let's say your brand
accent is not blue.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.170
Let's say you want to actually
use something like red or

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:33.170
purple or whatever.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.050
One of the things that the
Action Bar Style Generator

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:38.620
does is, it creates a stateless
drawable, which is

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:45.900
kind of a stateful graphic that
contains the assets for

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.110
the different states.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.990
So if there's nothing, it's
just transparent.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:53.100
If it's pressed, it will
actually use your accent color

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.360
as that overlay.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:59.030
And if it's focused, meaning the
user has selected the item

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:03.760
with the keyboard, it'll use the
standard focus style with

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.710
different levels of
translucency.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.600
But it'll still apply
your accent color.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.790
So the Action Bar Style
Generator is really good for

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.430
generating that.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.050
And I'd say that the combination
of these two tools

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.210
gets you most of the way for
baseline branding of an app.

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:18.320
So definitely use them--

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.660
really important to do that.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.000
Last thing for design tools--
and we'll probably talk more

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.760
in future episodes
on design tools.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.070
But the last thing I
wanted to call out

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:30.910
today is feedback tools.

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:34.470
So we very often provide
designers,

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:35.540
developers with feedback.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.040
They give us PDFs.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.150
We provide them with
feedback back.

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:42.230
So some of the tools that
we use are Google Drive,

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:49.330
specifically the Docs editor
as well as the PDF viewer.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:55.510
PDF editor is like Preview on
Mac or Acrobat, and Skitch.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:59.080
And so I'll briefly mention for
PDF editors, it's really,

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.520
really, really useful to be able
to just load up a set of

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.270
screenshots and just annotate.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.070
PDFs have this awesome
annotation feature where you

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:09.860
can just drop in a text
bubble annotation.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.900
And you can just really quickly
mark up all the

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.000
different things that you either
see wrong or you like

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:14.700
or whatever.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.890
It's a good way for both
developers or product managers

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:21.530
to communicate with designers,
as well as for designers to

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.560
communicate to developers.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.790
So designers, rather than using
specs or red lines if

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.930
you don't want to, you could
just create your mockups,

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:32.230
throw them into a PDF, and then
just annotate like, this

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.050
should stretch.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:37.210
This should be whatever,
something else.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.190
You could use PDF editors
or PDF annotations.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.920
ADAM KOCH: We use this is a
feedback mechanism a lot.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.610
It's worth noting, though,
that not all PDF viewer

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:47.790
support adding these
annotations, but a lot do.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:50.600
So if you're looking for it in
your particular PDF viewer,

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.110
you may need to switch
to another one if

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:55.160
you can't find it.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.140
ROMAN NURIK: Then for Google
Drive, one of the things I

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.480
love about Google Drive is
its commenting abilities.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:04.000
So in Docs, you can just spawn a
comment thread on a specific

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.780
line of feedback.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.790
And then in the image editor
or the image viewer are as

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:12.160
well as the PDF preview, I
believe there's a way to

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.990
highlight a certain portion and
start a comment thread on

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:18.140
a single rectangle.

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.460
So it's similar to the PDF
editor in the sense that you

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.470
can annotate things.

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:26.530
But certainly the combination of
these tools we found to be

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:27.135
super useful.

00:31:27.135 --> 00:31:28.500
ADAM KOCH: It's nice when
there's a lot of back and

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.290
forth, when you've got a few
people commenting on a

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:32.870
particular issue.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.440
ROMAN NURIK: And the last
one, I'd say, Skitch.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.820
So Skitch is something that
basically lets you annotate

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.340
screenshots.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.860
And it's really useful for
feedback on specific photos or

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.010
specific mockups.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:49.160
It doesn't easily let you work
with multiple things at once,

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.740
multiple screenshots at once,
as far as I know.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.660
But it's certainly very useful
for creating arrows and

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.090
annotations and things like that
on top of your mockups.

00:31:58.090 --> 00:31:59.790
So these are just some
of the tools we use.

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.572
Like I said before, we'll
probably talk about it more in

00:32:01.572 --> 00:32:03.440
the future.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.340
So with that, let's just quickly
cover design news.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.380
I think we only have one item.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.730
The only item is from
Paul Burke.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:15.005
So we mentioned, I think, in
the last show two weeks ago

00:32:15.005 --> 00:32:18.590
that there was a New York City
Android designers meet up.

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:19.790
It went really well.

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:21.710
And if you came, then it
was great meeting you.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.350
And thanks for coming.

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:27.480
But if you weren't there, Paul
actually shared a presentation

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.660
on some resources, some
good community

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.670
resources for designers.

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.870
So here's the link to
the presentation--

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:36.880
the slides.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.000
Definitely take a look.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.060
I think we'll probably be
posting another New York City

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.030
Android designers meet up
sometime next in the next

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:44.862
hopefully few months or so.

00:32:44.862 --> 00:32:48.320
But yeah, thanks for
coming if you came.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.340
I think that's it
for the show.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.910
ADAM KOCH: One last thing, I
just want to give a shout out

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:56.480
to the App Clinic, the show that
our teammates run on the

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.110
West Coast.

00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:00.060
They often delve more into the
technical side of things.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.310
So definitely tune into
that later this week.

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:03.945
ROMAN NURIK: And they'll be
covering podcast creation

00:33:03.945 --> 00:33:05.290
apps, as far as I know.

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:07.400
I don't know what they'll be
talking about, but something

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.660
related to podcast creation.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:12.160
So if you like the podcast
creation stuff, tune in there.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.010
Thanks for joining, guys.

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:14.610
As always, I'm Roman Nurik.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:15.065
ADAM KOCH: My name's
Adam Koch.

00:33:15.065 --> 00:33:16.010
See you guys.

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:16.310
ROMAN NURIK: Peace out.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:34:11.715
