00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.570
Suicide is one of the hardest things to deal with. Not just for the person considering suicide, but for the People surrounding that Individual

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.939
Often, people who observe

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.148
suicidal behavior from someone they love become very concerned and even disturbed at what they're seeing. But it's very

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.429
Important not to let your shock overwhelm you

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:36.729
Instead of focusing on the sadness of the situation, there are many things you could do to help these suicidal Individuals

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.680
1 : don't ask too many questions

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.840
In 2010 a study, was done on the rising suicide rates in Japan. An area which has a massive problem with people taking their own Lives

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.720
It found that asking too many questions can sometimes cause a negative reaction in suicidal people.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.800
Could this just

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.219
be due to japanese culture or is this an indicative of a more widespread treat when it comes to suicide People all over the World

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.400
It would make sense for this to apply to all people because the feeling of being interrogated with many, questions is never fun.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.440
Because the shock of finding out someone is suicidal

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.200
It can be tempting to bombard them with constant questions. But a more effective technique is to start slow.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.090
Just letting the person know you're there to help efforts

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.599
2 : Don't give them false hope.

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.119
Another very interesting study

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.019
was done in India. Another Country that is suffering from increased suicide rates.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.859
They found that giving the person false hope can be a disastrous decision.

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:44.199
Although you might feel that making unreasonable promises to the person might convince them not to commit suicide. It actually causes the opposite effect

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.660
They immediately see through this fake promise and become even more disillusioned with the world they live in

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.580
Although it might be tempting to say things like "Everything is going to be okay" take a second to think what you're saying.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.580
Is everything really going to be okay ? As the study suggests, A better option might be to employ a more realistic approach.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.800
3 : Don't try to relate

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.010
The same study as mentioned before, also found that trying to relate to the suicidal person can

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.149
be a bad decision. You have to understand that in the minds of Suicidal People

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.610
no one understands what they're going through

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.190
Even if you have contemplated suicide in the past and feel like you've gone through the exact same thing,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.610
don't try to relate your own experiences to what they're going through.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.249
Suicidal person will most likely reject this advice because they believe it does not apply to them.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.940
Instead, focus on trying to listen to them, and trying to understand their own unique circumstances as best you can.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:51.029
4 : Use their own belief system to convince them. The same study as previously mentioned provides one more great piece of advice.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.690
Researchers revealed that you can help Suicidal People

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:02.249
Choose Life by learning about their personal beliefs and using them to convince the person not to commit suicide if they believe in a specific

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.190
Religion

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.699
Use teachings from that Religion to convince them about the value of life. If they believe in nothing at all

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.790
You can use that to convince them as, well by saying things like "You only live once. Why not make the most out of it?"

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.079
5 : Encourage Them to See a professional

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.280
One of the best thing to do if not the best thing to do to help

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.969
Suicidal People is to encourage them to see a mental health Professional

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.159
That's not to say you should refuse to help them telling them to get help and walk away

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.720
That would not go down well.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:40.320
What you can do - is let them know that you're there for them. Listen carefully and then encourage them to get help.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.019
You have to remember that you're not a professional, you're not trained in this and you don't have the resources to help.

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.509
Unless of course you are a trained mental health Professional

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:58.410
6 Take them seriously.  There has been A huge tendency to dismiss the validity of suicidal tendencies throughout the years

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.949
People often say things like: "They're just doing it for attention." or "You'll never actually go through with it."

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.239
This is perhaps the worse outlook you could take when it comes to suicidal people

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:17.729
You have to take them seriously if no one pays attention to them or displays any concern, this might actually push them further towards suicide

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.450
It makes them feel alone?

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.820
Studies have shown that the vast majority of people who have committed suicides, displayed warning signs before taking their own lives

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.829
In addition a study in Finland found that 10% of people who committed suicide

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.789
Saw a health Professional within 24 hours of taking their own lives

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.569
7 : Try not to seem fake

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.890
Something that really causes a negative effect when it comes to dealing with people

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.160
Contemplating suicide - is when you appear to be fake

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.729
As previously mentioned, it's important you take these people seriously, but this doesn't mean turning yourself into something you're not.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.420
Be yourself.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.050
Don't act like a different person all of a sudden just because you found out that someone close to you is contemplating suicide.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.540
They will see you right through your fake demeanor

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.630
This might cause a negative effect, creating a sense of increased disillusion in their view of the world around them.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.799
An example of this would be adopting a baby, being almost patronizing

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.040
approach to these people

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.319
Speaking softly to them as if they were a small child, but there are many other ways you can

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.200
appear fake when it comes to interacting with suicidal individuals.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.030
8

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.030
Encouraging participation in culture

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.849
Recently Canada, Finland and other countries situated around the Arctic Belt

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.640
embarked on an ongoing study to tackle the growing problem with suicide among the people living in the far North.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:45.840
The vast majority of these people are part of aboriginal groups, such as the Inuit in Canada and the Saami in Finland -

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.479
- societies with growing suicide epidemics.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.809
Although this strategy was specifically tailored towards Inuit People, it can be applied to people all over the World.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.240
When they encourage these people to participate in their own culture, such as singing traditional songs

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.229
Creating traditional arts and crafts and generally doing things typical to their traditional culture, to reduce the risk of suicide.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.669
Perhaps this helps because the suicidal people feel like they belong to a larger collective, thus their sense of loneliness is lessened.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.699
They suddenly feel like they belong to part of a Community and a culture that has spanned multiple generations behind them

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.300
This strategy could definitely be applied to the general population

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.450
Traditional culture Is not something we experience on a day-to-day basis, especially if we live in a big city.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.340
Certain countries

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.970
also seem devoid of culture these days, especially nations like America and Canada, who are relatively young countries.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.489
They don't have centuries of tradition like many nations in Europe

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:47.909
Would it help if we begin to actively promote our ethnic cultures? The result in Inuit Societies seem to suggest so.

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.659
9 : Address unresolved grief

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.449
One of the biggest reasons people contemplate suicide is because they're experiencing unresolved grief

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.190
Indeed it's one of the biggest warning signs of People who might commit suicide in the future.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.979
These people might say that they're about to see dead Loved Ones again, or that they wish they could see dead Family Members again.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.739
When people can't properly work out the grieving process, they turn to drastic measures, including suicide.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.010
They feel it's the only way out, and the only way

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.910
They'll offer see that person again

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.709
If you think this might be the route case of their suicidal thoughts, bring it up.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.389
If you encourage them to address it, they might be able to finally come to terms with it and move on.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.760
10: Stop them from taking certain prescription drugs

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.400
There is also a huge problem with suicides in the military

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.520
specifically the US Army. The rates are so alarming that multiple studies have tried to look

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.060
into this problem and figure out how to tackle it.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.300
In 2012 one of them found that one factor contributing to suicidal behavior

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:53.399
was a reliance on certain prescription drugs - specifically opioids. You seen it again and again

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.920
TV Commercials that sell these drugs are flipping the disclaimer at the end, which says: "This might result in suicidal thoughts"

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.680
While the study was done through the military, it applies to all people

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:10.139
If you know someone who is suicidal and they take certain prescription drugs (most notably opioids), it might be a good

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:14.879
idea to get them to stop or at least bring up the fact that their medication might be the reason they're suicidal

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.690
