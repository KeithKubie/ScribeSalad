Hi I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
US History,

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:09.039
and today we're going to tell the story of how a group of plucky English people struck a blow for religious freedom,

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.290
and founded the greatest, freest and fattest
nation the world has ever seen.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.120
[Libertage]

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.920
These Brits entered a barren land containing
no people,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.660
and quickly invented the automobile, baseball
and Star Trek and we all lived happily ever after.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.620
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, if it is really that
simple, I am so getting an A in this class.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.320
Oh, me from the past, you're just a delight.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:43.280
[Theme Music]

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.460
So most Americans grew up hearing that the United States was founded by pasty English people

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.620
who came here to escape religious persecution.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.420
And that's true of the small proportion of
people who settled in the Massachusetts Bay

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.520
and created what we now know is New England.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.420
But these Pilgrims and Puritans, there's a
difference, weren’t the first people

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.940
or even the first Europeans to come to the
only part of the globe we didn't paint over.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.659
In fact they weren’t the first English people.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.579
The first English people came to Virginia.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.460
Off topic but how weird is it that the first permanent English colony in the Americas was named

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.960
not for Queen Elizabeth’s epicness but for
her supposed chastity.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.720
Right anyway, those first English settlers weren't looking for religious freedom, they wanted to get rich.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.100
So the first successful English colony in America was founded in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.920
I say "successful" because there were two
previous attempts to colonize the region.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.200
They were both epic failures.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.860
The more famous of which was the colony of
Roanoke Island set up by Sir Walter Raleigh,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.960
which is famous because all the colonists disappeared leaving only the word "Croatoan" on carved into a tree.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.220
Jamestown was a project of the Virginia Company,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.640
which existed to make money for its investors,
something it never did.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.960
The hope was that they would find gold in the Chesapeake region like the Spanish had in South America,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.430
so there were a disproportionate number of
goldsmiths

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.299
and jewelers there to fancy up that gold which
of course did not exist.

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.720
Anyway, it turns out that jewelers dislike
farming --

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.030
so much so, that Captain John Smith who soon
took over control of the island once said

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.310
that they would rather starve than farm.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.280
So in the first year, half of the colonists
died.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.480
400 replacements came, but, by 1610, after
a gruesome winter called "The Starving Time,"

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.340
the number of colonists had dwindled to 65.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.870
And eventually word got out that the new world’s
1 year survival rate was

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.290
like 20% and it became harder to find new
colonists.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.639
But 1618, a Virginia company hit upon a recruiting
strategy called the headright system

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.799
which offered 50 acres of land for each person
that a settler paid to bring over.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.219
And this enabled the creation of a number
of large estates,

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.559
which were mostly worked on and populated
by indentured servants.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.440
Indentured servants weren't quite slaves,
but they were kind of temporary slaves.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.050
Like they could be bought and sold and they
had to do what their masters commanded.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.819
But after seven to ten years of that, if they
weren't dead,

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.779
they were paid their freedom dues which they hoped would allow them to buy farms of their own.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.260
Sometimes that worked out, but often either
the money wasn't enough to buy a farm,

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.230
or else they were too dead to collect it.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.989
Even more ominously in 1619, just 12 years
after the founding of Jamestown,

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.049
the first shipment of African slaves arrived
in Virginia.

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.730
So the colony probably would have continued
to struggle along,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.950
if they hadn't found something that people
really loved: tobacco.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.080
Tobacco had been grown in Mexico since at
least 1000 BCE,

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.159
but the Europeans had never seen it and it
proved to be kind of a

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.079
"thank you for the small pox; here's some
lung cancer” gift from the natives.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.200
Interestingly King James hated smoking.

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.930
He called it “a custom loathsome to the
eye and hateful to the nose"

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.670
but he loved him some tax revenue, and nothing
sells like drugs.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.560
By 1624 Virginia was producing more than 200,000
pounds of tobacco per year.

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.729
By the 1680s, more than 30 million pounds
per year.

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:41.559
Tobacco was so profitable the colonists created huge plantations with very little in the way of towns

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:47.139
or infrastructure to hold the social order together, a strategy that always works out brilliantly.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.640
The industry also structured Virginian society.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.020
First off, most of the people who came in the 17th century, three-quarters of them, were servants.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.240
So Virginia became a microcosm of England:

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.220
a small class of wealthy landowners sitting
atop a mass of servants.

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.329
That sounds kind of dirty but it was mostly
just sad.

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.200
The society was also overwhelmingly male, because male servants were more useful in the tobacco fields,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.060
they were the greatest proportion of immigrants.

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.329
In fact they outnumbered women 5 to 1.

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.510
The women who did come over were mostly indentured
servants,

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.060
and if they were to marry, which they often
did because they were in great demand,

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.340
they had to wait until their term of service
was up.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.180
This meant delayed marriage which meant fewer children which further reduced the number of females.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.800
Life was pretty tough for these women, but on the upside Virginia was kind of a swamp of pestilence,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.280
so their husbands often died, and that created a small class of widows or even unmarried women who,

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.220
because of their special status, could make contracts and own property, so that was good, sort of.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.820
OK. A quick word about Maryland.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.840
Maryland was the second Chesapeake Colony,
founded in 1632,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.520
and by now there was no messing around with
joint stock companies.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.860
Maryland was a proprietorship: a massive land grant to a single individual named Cecilius Calvert.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.000
Calvert wanted to turn Maryland into like a medieval feudal kingdom to benefit himself and his family,

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.190
and he was no fan of the representational
institutions that were developing in Virginia.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.970
Also Calvert was Catholic, and Catholics were welcome in Maryland which wasn't always the case elsewhere.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.260
Speaking of which, let's talk about Massachusetts.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.280
So Jamestown might have been the first English colony, but Massachusetts Bay is probably better known.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.380
This is largely because the colonists who came there were so recognizable for their beliefs and also for their hats.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.120
That’s right. I’m talking about the Pilgrims
and the Puritans.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.640
And no, I will not be talking about Thanksgiving

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.300
...is a lie.
I can’t help myself.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.900
But only to clear up the difference between Pilgrims and Puritans and also to talk about Squanto.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.220
God I love me some Squanto.
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.300
Most of the English men and women who settled
in New England were uber-Protestant Puritans

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.240
who believed the Protestant Church of England
was still too Catholic-y

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.120
with its kneeling and incense and extravagantly-hatted
archbishops.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.720
The particular Puritans who, by the way did
not call themselves that -- other people did,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.330
who settled in new England were called Congregationalists

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.390
because they thought congregations should determine leadership and worship structures, not bishops.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.260
The Pilgrims were even more extreme.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.280
They wanted to separate more or less completely
from the Church of England.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.000
So first they fled to the Netherlands, but the Dutch were apparently too corrupt for them,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.960
so they rounded up investors and financed
a new colony in 1620.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.240
They were supposed to land in Virginia, but in what perhaps should have been taken as an omen,

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.040
they were blown wildly off course and ended up in what's now Massachusetts, founding a colony called Plymouth.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.280
While still on board their ship the Mayflower,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.460
41 of the 150 or so colonists wrote and signed
an agreement called the Mayflower Compact,

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:29.220
in which they all bound themselves to follow "just and equal laws" that their chosen representatives would write-up.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.020
Since this was the first written framework
for government in the US, it's kind of a big deal.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.380
But anyway, the Pilgrims had the excellent fortune of landing in Massachusetts with 6 weeks before winter,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.660
and they had the good sense not to bring very
much food with them or any farm animals.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.620
Half of them died before winter was out.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:49.300
The only reason they didn't all die was that local Indians led by Squanto gave them food and saved them.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.920
A year later, grateful that they had survived mainly due to the help of an alliance with the local chief Massasoit,

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.930
and because the Indians had taught them how
to plant corn and where to catch fish,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.340
the Pilgrims held a big feast: the first Thanksgiving.
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.520
And by the way, that feast was on the fourth
Thursday in November,

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.560
not mid-October as is celebrated in some of
these green areas we call Not America.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.620
Anyway Squanto was a pretty amazing character
and not only because he helped save the Pilgrims.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.330
He found that almost all of his tribe, the
Patuxet had been wiped out by disease

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.940
and eventually settled with the Pilgrims on
the site of his former village and then died...

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.330
of disease because it is always ruining everything.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.660
So the Pilgrims struggled on until 1691

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.300
when their colony was subsumed by the larger and much more successful Massachusetts Bay Colony.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.320
The Massachusetts Bay colony was chartered
in 1629 by London merchants who,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.010
like the founders of the Virginia Company,
hoped to make money.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.240
But unlike Virginia, the board of directors
relocated from England to America,

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.730
which meant that in Massachusetts they had a greater degree of autonomy and self-government than they did in Virginia.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.520
Social unity was also much more important
in Massachusetts than it was in Virginia.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.940
The Puritans' religious mission meant that
the common good was, at least at first,

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.570
put above the needs or the rights of the individual.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.900
Those different ideas in the North and South about the role of government would continue...until now.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.900
Oh God. It's time for the mystery document?

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.340
The rules are simple. I read the mystery document
which I have not seen before.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.640
If I get it right, then I do not get shocked with the shock pen, and if I get it wrong I do.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.980
All right.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:22.520
"We must be knit together in this work as one man, we must entertain each other in brotherly affection,

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:28.640
we must be willing to abridge ourselves of
our superfluities (su-per-fluities? I don't know),

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.580
for the supply of others necessities,

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:35.540
we must uphold a familiar commerce together in all meekness, gentleness, patience and liberality,

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:42.400
...for we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon us;

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.800
so that if we shall deal falsely with our
god in this work we have undertaken

00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:49.969
and so cause him to withdraw his present help
from us,

00:08:49.969 --> 00:08:53.689
we shall be made a story and a byword through
the world."

00:08:53.689 --> 00:08:57.100
Alright, first thing I noticed: the author
of this document is a terrible speller

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.180
or possibly wrote this before English was
standardized.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.110
Also, a pretty religious individual.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.150
And the community in question seems to embrace
something near socialism:

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.610
abridging the superfluous for others' necessities.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:10.680
Also it says that the community should be
like a city upon a hill, like a model for everybody.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.199
And because of that metaphor, I know exactly
where it comes from:

00:09:14.199 --> 00:09:17.069
the sermon "A Model of Christian Charity"
by John Winthrop.

00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:20.309
Yes! Yes! No punishment!

00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:23.020
This is one of the most important sermons
in American history.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.089
It shows us just how religious the Puritans
were,

00:09:25.089 --> 00:09:30.080
but it also shows us that their religious mission wasn't really one of individualism but of collective effort.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.360
In other words, the needs of the many outweigh
the needs of the few or the one.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:38.129
But this city on a hill metaphor is the basis
for one kind of American exceptionalism:

00:09:38.129 --> 00:09:43.069
the idea that we are so special and so godly
that we will be a model to other nations,

00:09:43.069 --> 00:09:45.829
at least as long, according to Winthrop,
as we act together.

00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:47.660
Lest you think Winthrop’s words were forgotten,

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.480
they did become the centerpiece of Ronald
Reagan’s 1989 farewell address.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.069
Okay so New England towns were governed democratically,

00:09:54.069 --> 00:09:57.059
but that doesn't mean that the Puritans were
big on equality

00:09:57.059 --> 00:10:00.189
or that everybody was able to participate
in government because no.

00:10:00.189 --> 00:10:03.029
The only people who could vote or hold office
were church members,

00:10:03.029 --> 00:10:07.309
and to be a full church member you had to
be a “visible saint",

00:10:07.309 --> 00:10:11.119
so really, power stayed in the hands of the
church elite. The same went for equality.

00:10:11.119 --> 00:10:15.899
While it was better than in the Chesapeake Colonies or England, as equality went...eh, pretty unequal.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.510
As John Winthrop declared, "Some must be rich,
and some poor.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:24.041
Some high, an eminent in power, and dignity;
others mean and in subjection."

00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:26.020
Or as historian Eric Foner put it

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:31.480
"Inequality was considered an expression of God's will and while some liberties applied to all inhabitants,

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:36.240
there were separate lists of rights for freemen,
women, children and servants."

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.940
There was also slavery in Massachusetts. The
first slaves were recorded in the colony in 1640.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.400
However, Puritans really did foster equality
in one sense.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.260
They wanted everyone to be able to read the
Bible.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.579
In fact, parents could be punished by the
town councils for not properly instructing

00:10:51.579 --> 00:10:53.119
their children in making them literate.

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:56.889
But when Roger Williams called for citizens
to be able to practice any religion they chose,

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:58.490
he was banished from the colonies.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.019
So was Ann Hutchinson who argued the church
membership should be based on inner grace

00:11:02.019 --> 00:11:04.979
and not on outward manifestations like church
attendance.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.960
Williams went on to found Rhode Island, so
that worked out fine for him,

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.619
but Hutchinson, who was doubly threatening
to Massachusetts

00:11:10.619 --> 00:11:13.670
because she was a woman preaching unorthodox
ideas,

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:19.490
was too radical and was further banished to Westchester, New York where she and her family were killed by Indians.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.620
Finally, somebody who doesn't die of disease
or starvation.

00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:26.980
So Americans like to think of their country as being founded by pioneers of religious freedom

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.869
who were seeking liberty from the oppressive
English.

00:11:29.869 --> 00:11:32.290
We've already seen that's only partly true.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:38.220
For one thing, Puritan ideas of equality and representation weren't particularly equitable or representational.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.439
In truth, America was also founded by indigenous
people and by Spanish settlers,

00:11:42.439 --> 00:11:45.949
and the earliest English colonies weren't
about religion; they were about money.

00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:51.340
We'll see this tension between American mythology and American history again next week and also every week.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.200
Thanks for watching; I’ll see you next time.

00:11:53.209 --> 00:11:57.049
