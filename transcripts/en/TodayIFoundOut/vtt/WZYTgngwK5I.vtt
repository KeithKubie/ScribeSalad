Why did Pistachios Used to Be Dyed Red?

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:14.320
Historically, most pistachios in the United
States were imported from the Middle East.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.840
The problem was that when they arrived, they
tended to have numerous blemishes on the shells,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.450
particularly stains left over from the harvesting
methods employed in the Middle East.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.130
These stains weren’t good for marketing
purposes.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.190
To get around this, importers devised an idea
to not only mask the blemishes, but also to

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.080
help draw the eye to the pistachios, namely,
dying them red.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.900
This all began to change in the 1970s when
pistachios started to be grown in the U.S.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.900
commercially.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.930
Today, the vast majority (upwards of 98%)
of pistachios sold in the United States are

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.110
grown and processed in California with much
better harvesting and processing facilities

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.170
than decades before in the Middle East.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.980
These improved facilities result in fewer
blemishes and stains appearing on the pistachios,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.320
so there is less need to dye them, which is
one of the reasons the practice is dying out.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.369
Bonus Facts

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.090
Like the cashew, pistachios are a member of
the Anacardiaceae family, meaning they, too,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.590
naturally contain the chemical urushiol that
makes poison ivy and others in the family

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.939
so irritating.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:26.350
In the pistachio’s case, the primary concentration
of urushiol 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.590
is in the pistachio itself.
