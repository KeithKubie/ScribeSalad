00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.170
&gt;&gt; Will China pull us out of the economic
crisis?

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.010
Part of me, yes.
Here in Dalian, the growth rate of the city

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.450
is 12 percent.
I just have to look outside of my hotel window

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.459
to see all the cranes
and construction sites.

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.240
Obviously, China is still growing.
What I think is needed for China is be even

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.550
more part of the global
community when it comes to global finance

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.849
redesign, for instance, and
global governance.

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.810
So to the question, I would say definitely
yes but more cooperation is

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.980
needed with China, with Europe, with the US,
and the rest of the world.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.320
Thank you.
