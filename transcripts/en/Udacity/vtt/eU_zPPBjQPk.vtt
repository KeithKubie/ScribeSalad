00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.250
So the Boolean formula here is almost always satisfied.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.140
It's satisfied in this case over here.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.740
It's satisfied in this case over here and this one.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.610
The only one where it's not satisfied is this one here,

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.550
and of course that's easy to evaluate,

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.000
so if x1 and x2 and x3 evaluates to true,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.120
then we have the big not, which will make it go to 0

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.470
and 0 or 1 is equal to 1,

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.690
so the Boolean formula is satisfied, but 0 or 0

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.690
evaluates to 0,

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.520
so here the Boolean formula is not satisfied.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.330
For these 2 cases, the Boolean formula is simply satisfied,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.480
because if this goes to 0, then we have the big not over here,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.060
so it will go to 1 and 1 over 1,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.220
and 1 or 0 that also evaluates to 1.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.540
What is this have to do with an if-then?

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.150
Well, it's actually quite simple.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.200
If this part here, x1 and x2 and x3

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.210
evaluates to 1,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.420
then this part over here

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.360
must also be 1 in order to satisfied the Boolean formula.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.129
It does not work if this part over here is 0.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.500
In the other case where x1 and x2 and x3 evaluates to 0,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.210
then as you can see, we basically don't care

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.950
what the other variables are doing, because the Boolean formula is already satisfied,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.950
and that is exactly how an if-then behaves.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.520
If the condition is satisfied,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.190
then we want something specific to happen.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.550
If the conditions are not satisfied, we don't really care what happens,

00:01:26.550 --> 99:59:59.000
or at least we're not really going to force anything to happen.
