00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.420
We know that we've got some slightly... unworkable attitudes to marriage--

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.340
the divorce rate says it all,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.760
and that the problem lies around many of our excessive expectations.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.560
To try to counter these, there could be no better place to start than with our marriage vows:

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.980
moments when we first declare before an audience the ideals that we would like to live by over a lifetime.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.560
In the interest of a saner, more realistic and more practical attitude to marriage,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.060
here are some suggestions for new kinds of marriage vows.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.920
We should good-naturedly admit that the person we're marrying is very far from perfect,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.860
and articulate all the ways in which they will prove irritating, difficult, sometimes irrational,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.320
and often unable to sympathize or understand us.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.400
However, it's vital that we should interpret these flaws as unavoidable;

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.060
no one else would be better, and we are as bad.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.220
We are simply a very flawed species.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.960
We must conclusively kill the idea that things would be ideal if any other creature on the planet.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.480
The only route to a tolerable marriage is to accept that there can only ever be a "good enough" marriage.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.680
Love starts with the experience of being understood in a deeply supportive and uncommon way.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.600
They understand the lonely parts of you;

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.640
you don't have to explain why you find a particular joke so funny, you hate the same people,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.140
they too want to try out a particular sexual scenario.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.980
This won't continue.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.860
We shouldn't blame our lovers for our dereliction of duty in failing to interpret and grasp our internal workings.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.200
They simply couldn't understand who we were and what we needed, which is wholly normal.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.680
No one properly understands, and can therefore fully sympathize with anyone else.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.260
Maturity is founded on an active sense of one's folly.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.700
One's out of control for long periods,

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.900
one's failed to master one's past,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.640
one's permanently anxious,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.160
one is, to put it mildly, an idiot.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.540
If we aren't regularly and very deeply embarrassed about who we are,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.280
it can only be because we have a dangerous capacity for selective memory.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.340
We start out knowing only about being loved--

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.020
the way we were as a child.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.100
We want a recreation in adulthood of what it felt like to be ministered to and indulged.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.960
In a secret part of our minds, we picture someone who will understand our needs, bring us what we want,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.360
be immensely patient and sympathetic to us, and make it all better.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.740
This is, naturally, a disaster.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.640
For a marriage to work, we need to move firmly out of the child and into the parental position.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.660
We need to become someone who will be willing to subordinate their own demands and concerns

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.500
to the needs of another.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.660
The romantic person instinctively sees marriage in terms of emotions,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.520
but what a couple actually get up to over a lifetime

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.600
has much more in common with the workings of a small business.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.980
They must draw up work rosters-- clean, chauffeur, cook, fix, reconcile, and budget.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.600
None of these activities have any glamour whatsoever within the current arrangement of society.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.620
And yet, these tasks are what is truly romantic in a sense of conducive and sustaining of love

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.480
and should be interpreted as the bedrock of successful marriage.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.840
The romantic view expects that love and sex will be aligned,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.860
but in truth, they won't stay so beyond a few months, or a best, one or two years.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.540
This isn't anyone's fault.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.160
Because marriage has other key concerns like companionship, administration, another generation,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.060
sex will suffer.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.380
We're ready to get married when we accept large degree of sexual resignation and the task of sublimation.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.240
The romantic view of marriage stresses that the "right person"

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.080
means someone who shares our tastes, interests, and attitudes to life,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.540
but over an extended period of time, differences inevitably emerge.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.500
It's the capacity to tolerate difference that is the true marker of the "right person."

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.460
Compatibility is an achievement of love;

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.780
it shouldn't be its precondition.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.840
These vows are, of course, pretty dark.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.540
This doesn't mean that they are against marriage-- far from it.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.660
They simply believe that the best way to make a marriage work

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.160
is to be properly alive to the enormous challenges that a union presents,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.460
and to be ready with some realistic philosophies that are ultimately far more romantic

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.420
than the more traditional, familiar, and fateful optimism.
