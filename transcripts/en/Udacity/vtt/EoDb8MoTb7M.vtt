00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Well, it turns out that this finite state machine accepts [a - z]+ or [0 - 9]+,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but we don't need to know that to answer the question.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We can just start at the start state.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We see an 'a'. We end up in state 2, and state 2 is an accepting state, so we accept.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The empty string--we come in here in state 1, and we don't go anywhere

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
because we're out of input.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
State 1 is not an accepting state, so, no.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
'Havel 1936' starts with an uppercase H.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We actually don't have any outgoing edges on uppercase H,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so we fall off immediately and do not accept.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Lowercase 'havel 2011'--that's just looking good.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
h-a-v-e-l, and we're still in state 2, and then we see the 2,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and now we fall off because this accepts either words or numbers, but not combinations.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Then finally '1993'--1-9-9-3. Yes!

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Vaclav Havel was a Czech writer/intellectual and the first president of the Czech Republic

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.077
in 1993.
