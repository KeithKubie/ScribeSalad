00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.950
So security planning, of course,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.750
has to address this question of what
sort of controls make the most sense

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.160
given our assets and
given our threat, posture, and so on.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.220
So what are some of these controls?

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.820
So first thing that you have to worry
about is identity and access management.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.530
This should come as no surprise because
you've been talking with authentication.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.440
That tells us who is making a request
for any kind of resource we have

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.100
in the system, and
then we have access management.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.850
So Identity Access Management is
a buzzword you hear all the time.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.550
Access management basically says if
somebody is making a request for

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.910
a resource, do they have permission
to access that resource?

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.430
So, credentialing is essentially
deciding that the person is,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.450
we're not going to worry about what you
need to show where to show who you are.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.950
And based on that they're going to
create an account for you.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.500
And they're going to decide what kind
of access should be granted to you.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.500
Using passwords, then, for example,
you may have password policies.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.230
How long the password has to be.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.260
How frequently it has to be changed.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.060
We talked about the Georgia Tech
policy for example.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.390
Some places may have a multi
factor authentication for example,

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.270
they may require that you have
a token in relation to a password and

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.220
things like that.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.050
Then we have our assets we are talking
about, we have networks and

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.170
we have hosts, servers and
desktops and so on.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.960
So we have to have defenses for
those as well.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.070
So we may have firewalls who control
what comes into our network or

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.670
our that leaves our network.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.450
We may have Intrusion Detection and
Prevention Systems to look

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.825
at the traffic with the network level
then look at network traffic or

00:01:37.825 --> 00:01:39.600
host activity, and so on, and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.880
decide if there is something
suspicious that may be going on.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.560
Another controller solution
we might acquire is that

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.450
people have anti-virus systems
running on their machines.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.125
People talk about their effectiveness
and question how good they are,

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:57.465
but there's not going to be one solution
that takes care of everything or

00:01:57.465 --> 00:01:59.335
one control that takes
care of everything.

00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:04.115
They all help you increase
the level of assurance, as we said,

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:05.855
that you are secure.

00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:08.175
So we may require this.

00:02:08.175 --> 00:02:12.780
If people access our system, the
network's from outside, we may require

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.710
that we have a VPN solution,
a Virtual Private Network solution.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.920
If they bring your own devices,
that might necessitate something else.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.870
We know that the software,
we are talking about systems and

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.455
controls, so
the software we run on our systems may,

00:02:28.455 --> 00:02:32.665
vulnerabilities may be discovered and
patches may become available.

00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:37.515
And when we talk about controls I think
we're talking technological controls.

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:41.750
These examples of course, password
management or identity management,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.980
firewalls and so on.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.910
So it looked like those, but not a
control is how do we educate our users?

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.522
So this could be, for example,
some sort of periodic thing you run.

00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:56.930
We've seen many companies, for
example, to educate their employees so

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.367
they don't fall for phishing attacks.

00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:03.430
Monthly or they have these things
where they send you an email and

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.940
if you fall for it,
this is not a real attack.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.790
This is sort of used to train and

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.830
educate you that you shouldn't be
falling for those kind of things.
