00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
Hello and welcome to Crash Course European history, I'm John Green,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.820
and as you may know medieval Europe has a terrible reputation.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.240
We often hear that it was disease and famine-ridden (which it was).

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.500
Children were supposedly forced to marry at six or eight or ten years old, which was not common,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.080
although people did start marrying younger,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.640
in part because they were also dying younger.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.700
We hear that knights in shining armor slaughtered wantonly, albeit with good manners called chivalry, which is partly true,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.280
although the chivalric code was in decline.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.720
And we also hear that it wasn't safe to drink the water, so they drank beer exclusively,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.260
which more on that in a moment. But yeah, today we're turning our attention to these so-called "Middle Ages."

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.780
But right, so about beer. In those days, people did drink beer and ale.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.980
The were nutritious (and still are), but they also drank other things: milk, other beverages, and especially water.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.400
There were wells with safe and delicious drinking water.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.740
Still, it's true that a lot of bad things did happen in the 14th and 15th centuries:

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.240
The Black Death, the Great Schism in the Catholic Church, and the Hundred Years War.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.560
Also, in the 14th century,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.600
the Little Ice Age began, which meant cooler temperatures and declining harvests,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.080
and that contributed to stunting and starvation.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.200
But let's begin with the Black Death, a huge pandemic of a disease called Bubonic Plague,

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.630
which spread to Europe from Asia. Many experts believe the plague originated in Tibet as a localized epidemic

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.349
but then spread carried by rats and mice and fleas.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.490
And those animals were able to travel widely because humans were traveling, and the fleas and rats hitched rides with us,

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.630
so in that sense,

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.439
the plague was a product of growing human interconnectedness.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.350
Bubonic plague is a horrible disease. After infection with the bacterium Yersinia Pestis,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.800
lymph nodes swell and sometimes burst; victims often get high fevers and vomit blood;

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.199
gangrene can cause extremities and facial features to turn black with necrosis,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.180
hence "the Black Death";

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.660
and depending on the strain, somewhere between 50 and 60 percent of people infected died.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.040
These days, bubonic plague is treatable by antibiotics,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.130
But such treatments have only been around for a few decades. As recently as the 20th century, outbreaks in India and China

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.470
killed more than 12 million people.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.360
But the 14th century's Black Death was even worse.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.200
Around 25 million people had died in Asia by the time the plague reached Constantinople in 1347,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.940
and within four years, a staggering number of Europeans had died from it,

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.760
often within two days of becoming infected.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.620
People faced a heartbreaking decision: whether to risk caring for their ailing loved ones,

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.000
or leave them to die alone in the hopes of avoiding infection.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.620
Some areas lost up to 80 percent of their population.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.980
The latest research claims that in Europe as a whole, around half of all people died.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.140
Death haunted every moment. It's difficult to grasp

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.730
just how profound the Black Death was,

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.900
but imagine losing half of your community in a few years to a poorly understood disease.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.340
Giovanni Boccaccio wrote, "Many died in the open street.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.539
Others dying in their houses, made it known by the stench of their rotting bodies.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.060
Consecrated churchyards did not suffice for the burial of the vast multitude of bodies,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.240
which were heaped by the hundreds in vast trenches,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.280
...like goods in a ship's hold.
"How different has life become in the last 650 years?"

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.900
The bacterium that caused the Black Death, is now available as a plush stuffed

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.080
...bacterium.
They don't actually look that threatening, especially with eyes. But yeah, this is Yersenia Pestis!

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.880
(Blown up and made into a stuffed animal.) No bacterium! Also you want to know an interesting fact about me?

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.880
I- I can't juggle.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.229
Amid all this devastation, the Hundred Years War added sustained turmoil and destruction.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.889
The war was fought between the rulers of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France, over who would rule large

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:23.220
swaths of continental Europe, and it actually lasted at least 116 years, beginning in 1337.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.240
One of the most interesting questions in history is: "Whether war leads to instability or instability leads to war?"

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.340
and the truth is probably

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.560
..Yes. Both. Like, poor harvests and disease outbreaks make war more likely,

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.920
but war also worsens poor harvests and disease outbreaks.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.460
So amid the huge shocks to Europe that accompanied the Black Death, the Hundred Years War

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.160
increased instability in the food supply, and also in long-held cultural beliefs, like The Code of Chivalry.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.820
Chivalry was a set of behaviors

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.800
toward knightly opponents, whom one would treat on the battlefield with respect and trust, not killing your fellow knight,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.900
but, instead, holding him for ransom in good condition.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.280
Such noble behavior separated the knight from common archers and mercenaries.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.160
But English Kings began to hire such mercenaries from across Europe, who viciously looted and plundered in a way

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.760
that wasn't terribly chivalrous. And some of these knights for hire found it so profitable to fight that even during

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:33.760
truces and peace treaties, they kept on marauding. The 116 Years War also changed the nature of war through innovation.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.160
Like, non-aristocratic soldiers from England and Wales used the longbow,

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.520
famed for its combined deadly speed and accuracy, and that helped the English prevail at the Battle of Agincourt

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.640
Before the 100 Years War, the French had innovated with cannons on ships,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.349
which the English later used in the war's land battles. Both types of cannons, by the way,

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:59.460
relied on gunpowder, a Chinese invention. The Hundred Years War also saw the

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:05.920
spectacular rise and fall of Joan of Arc, born to a prosperous French peasant family in 1412.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.920
When she was sixteen, England had won enough battles to take over the French throne, confirmed in the

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.339
1420 Treaty of Troyes, and France seemed leaderless.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.710
Visions told Joan to get French forces to take to the field and drive out the English, so that

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.720
Charles, whom she believed to be the rightful heir to the French throne, could be crowned,

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.940
and astonishingly this proved successful.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.580
By 1429, Charles was Charles VII of France.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.840
But in the process, the Burgundians, a competing and powerful royal court,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.880
captured Joan and turned her over to the English, who burned her at the stake in 1431.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.670
It's a bad way to go. Although, there are no good ways.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.599
If it sounds like European life in the 14th and 15th centuries was hard,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.599
well, it was. Murder and violent crime rates were likely much higher than they are today,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.840
and dying in war was a pretty routine risk.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.040
Malnutrition and stunting were also very common.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.480
Child mortality was astonishingly high; perhaps as many as 50% of children died before the age of five.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.960
But at least people were surrounded by the comforts of religion.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.900
The comforts of religion, however,

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.660
turned out not to be that comforting.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.920
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.580
In 1300, Pope Boniface VIII was the leader of the Catholic Church,

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.120
but he was also an important political figure in Europe.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:32.180
One of Europe's great questions was whether the Church had authority over the entire Catholic world,

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:38.300
or if kings had the ultimate authority in their kingdoms? Could, for instance, King Philip IV of France

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.469
tax the Catholic clergy in France?

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.140
Pope Boniface thought: No. He was from a well-connected and powerful family,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.180
and at the start of the 14th century, he was flexing his muscles across the papacy,

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.780
ultimately declaring in 1302 that the Pope had supreme power over everyone!

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.510
The timing was bad in that kings were also starting to flex their muscles.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:05.900
They wanted tax money from the Church to expand their administration. Boniface threatened to

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.480
excommunicate Philip, who then had the Pope kidnapped.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:15.629
Boniface was reportedly tortured in captivity and died soon after his release in 1303.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:21.869
By 1305, Philip had arranged for the election of a French Pope and his installation at

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.500
Avignon, just inside what was then the French border,

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.900
which made people think that the papacy was under the thumb of French kings and distant from its

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.200
spiritual mission, which you know, it was.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.180
In 1377 Pope Gregory XI decided to move back to Rome,

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.700
but then he died.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.200
The Cardinals, surrounded by loyal Romans, then elected an Italian pope,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:51.120
causing the French Cardinals to scatter and regroup to elect a French pope to head the papal court in Avignon,

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.360
which meant there were two popes and a schism had occurred.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.940
Historians, in fact, call it the Great Schism.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:58.740
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:04.560
The Great Schism was a huge blow to the Church and its claims of spiritual leadership,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.100
which had already been harmed by the clergy's inability

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.980
or unwillingness to provide spiritual guidance during the Black Death.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.280
Priests and monks and nuns had been as frightened of and as vulnerable to

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.900
death as everyone else.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.940
And now it wasn't even clear which pope was the real Pope,

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.700
or which church was the real Church.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.960
This disunity, combined with stories of decidedly unspiritual indulgences,

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.520
all served to undermine the church's authority.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.820
Instead, spiritual and other direction came from common people, not the high-and-mighty, like

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:43.260
Catherine of Siena, for instance, was an ordinary young woman of intense religious faith,

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:49.900
who was the one who successfully urged Pope Gregory XI to return to Rome. Although then of course, he died.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.380
Before Catherine died in 1380 at the age of 33,

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:58.220
she'd undertaken several diplomatic missions between the Church and Italian cities

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.460
and had traveled across the region urging the clergy to reform themselves

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.700
and fortify their spiritual ministry.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.600
Ultimately others in the Church called a council to end the Great Schism, and church leaders

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.960
finally elected a single pope, Martin V, in 1417.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.040
Although before that, things got truly out of control when a third Pope was elected for a while.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:27.320
I mean, if you wanted to be Pope, your chances really were never better than in the late Middle Ages.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.740
All of this meant that European Christendom really was declining in power,

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:38.420
and in 1453, the Ottomans, a Turkic ethnic group of Muslims captured the capital of the Byzantine Empire,

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:43.760
with the help, by the way, of a Hungarian munitions expert who knew about cannons.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.920
The Byzantine Emperor had felt that the munition expert's fees were too high.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.480
The Ottomans already controlled parts of southeastern Europe,

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:55.840
but capturing the Byzantine capital and beheading its Emperor was a big deal.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:02.700
It was the final fall of the Roman Empire, and Islam went on to replace Christianity as the leading religion in

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.400
Constantinople, as its famed Cathedral became the Hagia Sophia mosque.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.500
And control of Constantinople was a big deal for many reasons, including trade routes,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:17.780
but also because Constantinople at the time was probably Europe's least terrible city

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:23.080
Meanwhile, the aforementioned use of mercenaries helped undermine the feudal system,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:30.400
in which everyone owed loyalty to a lord, from knights to a serf, who was bound to that lord's land.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.220
The Black Death and persistent warfare helped change that too.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.940
And there were also far fewer humans, which meant fewer people to work in agriculture,

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:45.040
so serfs could demand their freedom because their labor had become much more valuable.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.220
Indeed, peasants rebelled when the nobility failed to meet their demands for better conditions.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.670
Like in the Peasants Revolt of 1381 in England,

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.740
they murdered nobles and sacked castles and manor houses.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.560
And in cities, urban artisans wanted higher pay and an end to higher taxes.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:08.220
In 1378, The Ciompi, or workers in the cloth trade, rebelled in Florence, demanding an end to harsh

00:12:08.589 --> 00:12:12.509
prosecution for debt and an end to the imposition of extra taxes.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:16.979
They marched through the streets, shouting, "Long live the little people."

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.039
The expansion of rights for artisans and farm workers

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.040
would of course be a very long process,

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:27.940
but their growing power and the decline of feudalism was a dramatic shift for Europe.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:34.220
Even warfare itself had changed. People no longer fought for ethical reasons or for God's glory

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.960
but for fame and career, as a French chronicler observed.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:45.960
Cutting through the 116 years of back and forth victories and losses, this proverb arose about warfare:

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.540
"That's the way it is with fighting. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose."

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.900
As for life in these years, people recited proverbs like

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.920
"There's nothing more certain than death." (someone along the way added "and taxes")

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.320
Other proverbs emphasized that life had begun to feel like a zero-sum game.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.940
"The big fishes eat the smaller."

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.780
"Men are good so long as it saves their skin."

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.900
But in the midst of that, there was also new thinking.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:18.640
Not just that of The Ciompi and peasants, but of artists and philosophers and architects and others,

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.720
who were simultaneously creating Europe's rebirth or Renaissance.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:29.140
The Great Renaissance Cathedral of Florence was even completed before the end of the Hundred Years War.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:34.840
And next week, we'll start there, in Florence, which was home to so much of that so-called rebirth.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.600
Thanks for watching. I'll see you then.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.840
Thanks so much for watching Crash Course European History,

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.690
which is filmed here in Indianapolis and produced with the help of all of these nice people.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.720
Our animation team is Thought Cafe,

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.940
and Crash Course would not exist without the generous support of our patrons at Patreon.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:56.040
Patreon is a voluntary subscription service where you can support the content you love through a monthly donation

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.140
and help keep crash course free for everyone forever.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.060
Thanks again for watching, and as they say in my hometown, "Don't forget to be awesome!"

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.120
God, it's nice to be back.
