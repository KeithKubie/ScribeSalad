00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.636
 When I share something 

00:00:01.636 --> 00:00:05.486
 It is often because I felt a fleeting idea of ​​how wonderful it was. 

00:00:05.486 --> 00:00:07.976
 Which means that if the participation takes longer than necessary 

00:00:07.976 --> 00:00:10.226
 Press the Undo button and give up. 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.253
 I'm Joanna Smith, and I'm your least favored user. 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.907
 To help you create magical moments when you participate, 

00:00:16.907 --> 00:00:20.241
 Android Marshmallow introduced a new feature called "Direct Share" 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.000
 Direct Share can set direct engagement goals. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.340
 Which launches a specific activity in your application when the user starts to participate. 

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.392
 To be clear here, imagine the following situation: 

00:00:31.652 --> 00:00:33.610
 If you find a new interesting article to share with my sister 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.080
 You have chosen your app from the sharing dialog. 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.150
 Opens your app. 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.445
 that's cool. 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.060
 But direct participation means that I can choose to correspond with my sister 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.960
 Your application opens on this correspondence 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.710
 The article waits for me in the text of the message until I click "Send". 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.215
 Now, this is a good user experience. 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.410
 To enable direct participation with goals, 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.200
 You must define a degree that extends to ChooserTargetService 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.700
 In your new service, 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.630
 You need to activate onGetChooserTargets 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.370
 This method presents the goals of participation to the system 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.114
 So that he can put them in the dialogue of participation. 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.590
 OnGetChooserTargets is where your application can upgrade as much as it wants. 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.610
 Perhaps it makes more sense to show up ten more back-end messages, 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.510
 Or maybe your app provides a way for users 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.080
 Until they discover the people they care about most. 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.394
 You can provide them with a list of close friends instead. 

00:01:30.394 --> 00:01:32.490
 Or maybe you know any correspondence, 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.890
 Such as mass messages, for example, 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.110
 More likely to use links attached, 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.560
 These are the likely objectives of participation. 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.150
 This magic is due to you. 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.240
 We just made our framework 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.491
 So you can build a better application. 

00:01:45.264 --> 00:01:48.410
 Now we need to update our publication. 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.530
 As with any new service, we need to announce it, 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.670
 But what's special about our ad is then BIND_CHOOSER_TARGET_SERVICE 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.090
 This will allow us to interact with the system, 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.935
 In order to share those underlying purposes and share the objectives well. 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.190
 And of course the implicit filter that links this service as an optional service. 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.670
 It covers everything you need to fill out a sharing system dialog. 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.570
 But what if the user chose one of your options? 

00:02:14.915 --> 00:02:17.560
 You'll want to start the appropriate activity when you open your app 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.032
 To do this, you have to link those specific activities to the proper implied purposes. 

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:26.340
 So you'll need some metadata to do that, 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.961
 But it's really that simple. 

00:02:30.256 --> 00:02:32.440
 So to play "Direct Share" in your own application, 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.325
 Look at our very interesting sample, 

00:02:34.325 --> 00:02:36.410
 Which you will find in the description below. 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.290
 Or check our documents. 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.702
 But more importantly, he continued to build better applications. 

00:02:42.907 --> 00:02:45.760
