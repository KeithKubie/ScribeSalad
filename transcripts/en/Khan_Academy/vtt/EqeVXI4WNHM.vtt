00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.186
- [Narrator] We're told
that millions of Americans

00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:10.181
rely on caffeine to get
them up in the morning.

00:00:10.181 --> 00:00:13.350
Which is true, although, if I
drank caffeine in the morning,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.267
I've very sensitive.

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:15.895
I wouldn't be able to sleep at night.

00:00:15.895 --> 00:00:18.595
Here's nutritional data
on some popular drinks

00:00:18.595 --> 00:00:20.845
at Ben's Beans coffee shop.

00:00:22.347 --> 00:00:25.126
All right, so here we
have the different names

00:00:25.126 --> 00:00:26.379
of the drinks.

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:29.070
And then here we have
the type of the drink,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.498
and it looks like they're
either hot or cold.

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:34.296
Here we have the calories
for each of those drink.

00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:36.318
Here we have the sugar content in grams

00:00:36.318 --> 00:00:37.617
for each of those drinks.

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:39.210
And here we have the
caffeine in milligrams

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.324
for each of those drinks.

00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:42.764
And then we are asked,

00:00:42.764 --> 00:00:46.096
the individuals in this data set are,

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:48.128
and then we have three choices.

00:00:48.128 --> 00:00:50.178
Ben's Beans customers.

00:00:50.178 --> 00:00:51.943
Ben's Beans drinks.

00:00:51.943 --> 00:00:54.276
Or the caffeine contents.

00:00:54.276 --> 00:00:55.264
Now, we have to be careful.

00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:57.990
When someone says the
individuals in a data set,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.700
they don't necessarily mean
that they have to be people.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.265
They could be things.

00:01:02.265 --> 00:01:04.612
And the individuals in this data set,

00:01:04.612 --> 00:01:06.754
each of these rows, they're referring

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:11.153
to a certain type of drink
at Ben's Beans coffee shops.

00:01:11.153 --> 00:01:15.327
So the different types of
drinks that Ben's Beans offers,

00:01:15.327 --> 00:01:18.439
those are the individuals
in this data set.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.328
So they're Ben's Beans drinks.

00:01:21.328 --> 00:01:25.189
Next, they ask us the data set contains,

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.427
and they say how many variables

00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:30.730
and how many of those
variable are categorical.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.077
So if we look up here,
let's look at the variables.

00:01:34.077 --> 00:01:35.292
So this first column

00:01:35.292 --> 00:01:37.793
is essentially giving
us the type of drink.

00:01:37.793 --> 00:01:38.729
This wouldn't be a variable,

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.854
this would be more of an identifier.

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:44.823
But all of these other columns
are representing variables.

00:01:44.823 --> 00:01:46.661
So, for example, type is a variable.

00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:48.593
It can either be hot or cold.

00:01:48.593 --> 00:01:52.864
And because it can only take
on one of kind of a number

00:01:52.864 --> 00:01:55.719
of bucket, it's either
going to be hot or cold.

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.337
It's going to fit in
one category or another.

00:01:58.337 --> 00:01:59.912
And you don't just have two categories,

00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:01.746
you could have more than two categories.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.943
But it isn't just some
type of variable number

00:02:03.943 --> 00:02:06.119
that could take on a
bunch of different values.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.460
So this right over here
is a categorical variable.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.346
Calories is not a categorical variable.

00:02:12.346 --> 00:02:14.993
You could have something
with 4.1 calories.

00:02:14.993 --> 00:02:17.431
You could have something with 178.

00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:19.492
Things aren't fitting into nice buckets.

00:02:19.492 --> 00:02:22.651
Same thing for sugars
and for the caffeine.

00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:25.004
These are quantitative variables

00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:27.536
that don't just fit into a category.

00:02:27.536 --> 00:02:29.885
And so here I would say
that we have four variables,

00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:32.106
one, two, three, four.

00:02:32.106 --> 00:02:34.150
One of which is categorical.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.150
So that would be choice A over here.
