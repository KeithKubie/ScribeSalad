00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.280
Where my shorties at?

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.810
I have some good news--from science!

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.920
We shorties are better than everyone.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:13.160
Especially the tall ones....That's all you
need to know.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.780
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.220
You know, short guys take a lot of crap.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.160
One of my best friends growing up was about
the same height as me, 5'2'', and was bullied

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.330
constantly for it.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.660
For ladies, it's reversed right?

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.250
If you're too tall you're more likely to be
the target of teasing and bullying.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.009
Height is one of many gender roles we have
here in the Western world.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.129
And if you ask me, that's friggin stupid,
because PEOPLE COME IN ALL SIZES AND WE HAVE

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.710
NO CONTROL OVER OUR HEIGHT.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.320
Didn't they ever read doctor suess?

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.749
A person's a person no matter how small!

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:44.749
Or large!

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:49.300
And for the record, short people can get around
all quick like and do some real damage so...I'm

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.090
just sayin....shortness is the bomb.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.090
Don't believe me?

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.750
I'll let the science do the talking then.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.479
A whopping 40 year long study recently published
in PLOS-1 monitored over 8000 Japanese-American

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:04.100
men throughout their lifetime and found that
being short means living a longer life.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.250
The scientists found, with great consistency,
that the taller the man, the shorter his life.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.850
Those under 5'2'' lived the longest.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.380
Why do the shorter guys live longer?

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.310
It all comes down to a gene: FOXO3, which
is responsible for a smaller body size and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.890
is also responsible for longevity.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.810
The two go hand in hand, genetically.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.910
Scientists also found that the short guys
were less likely to get cancer and to have

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.430
lower blood insulin.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.289
It's good news for my fellow shorties -- and
this isn't the first study to come to this

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:31.289
conclusion.

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.500
Another study done in 2012 on another isolated
population of men found that the shortest

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.369
in the group lived about 2 years longer on
average.

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.560
Having a sample that comes from the same cultural
and genetic background is really great from

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.229
a scientific perspective because it eliminates
a lot of other variables that could come into

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.859
play and affect the results.

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.549
These findings have also surfaced in studies
of short women - although the studies on women

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.439
were related to a different genes involved
in the regulation of human growth hormone.

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.969
Across other animal species, like mice, flies,
roundworms-- the same or a very similar gene

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.219
has also been linked with a longer life.

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.570
It's interesting because it offers some perspective
on the whole nature versus nurture question

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.709
about living a long life...it may be less
in our control than we think.

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.180
But, as if they saw the tidal wave of junk
food and sitting around coming in the distance,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.959
the scientists did tell the press that a healthy
lifestyle also goes a very long way toward

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:18.959
living a long life.

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.600
Alrighty folks, how tall are you?

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.010
Have you ever been teased for your height?

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.170
