00:00:01.934 --> 00:00:03.202
(upbeat horns)

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:04.871
- Hi, my name's Frank Castillo,

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:06.672 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I'm here to tell
you about Cinco de Mayo,

00:00:06.672 --> 00:00:09.542 align:start size:97% position:3%
or as us Mexican millennials
call it, CDM Five.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.010
(soft music)

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.679
Cinco de Mayo is
a Mexican holiday

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.515
commonly confused with
Mexican Independence Day,

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.083 align:start size:94% position:6%
which is actually a movie
starring Danny Trejo.

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:20.019
(laser explosion)

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.388
In Mexico, Cinco de Mayo
is celebrating the day

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:25.191 align:start size:88% position:13%
the Mexican Army
defeated the French Army

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.726
in the Battle of Puebla.

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:29.562
But I mean, who hasn't
whooped France's ass?

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:30.630
(cheering crowd)

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.231 align:start size:84% position:16%
Not a lot of
Mexican-Americans know

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:34.233
the origin of Cinco De Mayo.

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:35.768
Because they don't
want to get deported.

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:37.136
Instead, it's more
of a celebration

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:38.905
of Mexican culture, in general.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:42.241
But I'm not Mexican, how do
I celebrate Mexican culture?

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:43.743
Do I wear a luchador mask?

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:44.911
A sombrero?

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.045
Fight a French guy?

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:47.280
No!

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.914
That's Cinco de
super-depressing.

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:51.584
The best way to celebrate
is by eating Mexican food.

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:52.485
- [Children] Yum.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:53.752
- Or churros.

00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:55.754
Just a fried stick of
dough covered in sugar.

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:57.490
It's like a really lazy donut.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.259
Interesting fact, Mexicans
don't believe in diabetes.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:01.961
But Frank, I'm not a foodie.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.896
I'm just looking for
any cultural holiday

00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:05.464
as an excuse to get drunk.

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:08.100 align:start size:97% position:3%
Well, if you have to drink,
make sure it's tequila.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.902
You can only make
tequila in Mexico,

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:13.606 align:start size:84% position:16%
and only real Mexicans
can handle tequila.

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:15.108 align:start size:84% position:16%
and only real Mexicans
can handle tequila.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:15.641
Happy Cinco de Mayo everybody.

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.943
(chokes)

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:19.646
Oh my God, that burns so much.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:22.115
(upbeat horns)
