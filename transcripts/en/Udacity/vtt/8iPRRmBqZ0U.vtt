00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.985
And did you guys know that we can further divide the Autonomic Nervous System

00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:08.690
into Sympathetic and Parasympathetic? So essentially, the Autonomic Nervous

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.890
System is our self governing system because what it regulates we have little

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.323
control over. For example, it controls things like heart rate or blood

00:00:16.323 --> 00:00:20.135
pressure, even digestion. But I'm going to bring Susan in to ask her a few

00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:23.936
questions. Because I think that the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic, there's a

00:00:23.936 --> 00:00:28.010
difference between automatically reving us up or calming us down.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.720
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You're right, Lauren. Under the Autonomic Nervous System, we both our

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.532
Sympathetic and Parasympathetic. The Sympathetic is often termed our fight or

00:00:36.532 --> 00:00:40.958
flight response. When we are encountered with stressful or dangerous

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:45.448
situations, this is the nervous system that's going to be activated. That is an

00:00:45.448 --> 00:00:50.343
opposite for the Parasympathetic. Here we talk about the normally relaxed

00:00:50.343 --> 00:00:54.914
state. So, if you are relaxing, digesting your food, this would be our

00:00:54.914 --> 00:01:00.270
Parasympathetic. However, if there is a stressful response, the Sympathetic

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.388
Nervous System will automatically be activated. Here we'll see that we will no

00:01:05.388 --> 00:01:10.330
longer have blood going to our gut to digest our food. Instead that blood is

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.088
going to go to our muscles, which will allow us to fight or to flee. It is

00:01:15.088 --> 00:01:18.932
important to note however, that the Sympathetic Nervous System cannot be

00:01:18.932 --> 00:01:24.246
activated indefinitely. There will be a time in which it has to rest, so we can

00:01:24.246 --> 00:01:27.744
replenish the neurotransmitters that have been released during this fight or

00:01:27.744 --> 00:01:32.934
flight response. We'll talk about neurotransmitters shortly.
