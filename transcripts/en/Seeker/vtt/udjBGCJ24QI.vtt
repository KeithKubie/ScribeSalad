00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.379
Food for thought: Ever counted calories using
nutritional labels?

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:05.380
Well just how accurate are they anyway?

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.660
Hi guys, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.799
Food labels are great, they give you an estimate
of how many calories are in a certain food.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.750
But they have a bit of a flaw.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.020
They fail to take into account how cooking
affects food.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.870
So we end up with a system that likely overestimates
the calories available in unprocessed foods

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.730
and under estimates the calories in processed
food.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.290
Our current calorie counting system is based
on the Atwater System, which is at least a

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.340
hundred years old.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.930
The System standardized the idea of the amount
of energy available in food, 9 calories in

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.130
a gram of fat or 4 calories in every gram
of protein.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.570
But this measures the available of energy
in food, not the digestibility.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.290
A calorie is a unit of energy.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.160
It’s technically the amount of energy needed
to heat up a kilogram of water by 1 degree

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.880
C. Our body burns calories in food through
metabolizing the carbohydrates and proteins

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.050
and what not into smaller molecules our body
can use as energy.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.000
Cooking food changes how many calories are
digestible.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.550
Take potatoes for example, when raw, the sugar
molecules in potatoes are too tightly packed

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.950
for our digestive system to handle.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.140
Cooking causes the starches in the potato
to gelatinize.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.380
That process allows us to access the sugars
stored in the starch, so we get MORE calories

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.979
out of the cooked potato.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.729
On the other hand, digesting raw food takes
work, a stick of celery might have 10 calories,

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.650
but the chewing and digesting burns about
half of them.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.520
All that work means there are fewer calories
for your body to absorb for energy.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.350
But before you go nibbling on an all-carrot
diet, consider this: For our ancestors, cooking

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.320
food meant the difference between life and
death.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.299
The invention of a cooked meal might have
changed everything.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.710
Cooking food provided more energy and lead
to human’s bigger brains and bigger babies.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.890
And people who consume an all-raw diet now,
might not be getting enough calories.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.509
Even when eating food packed with nutrients.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.549
Some women on an all-raw diet get irregular
menstrual cycles, a sign of under-nourishment.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.549
On top of that, the type of cooking method
might change the chemistry of food as well

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:04.549
- whether it’s boiled, baked or microwaved.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.620
Not to mention the bacteria in your gut steal
a few of the calories for themselves.[a] So

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.840
the exact number of calories you’re getting
is affected by way too many factors for those

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.849
labels to be truly accurate.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.099
But while modifications to the Atwater system
have improved it some over the years, there’s

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.670
still no real alternative.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.920
So until nutrition scientists come up with
a better calorie counting system take food

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.209
labels with a grain of salt.

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.050
See what I did there?

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.330
Switching gears for a second, I wanna let
you know that tomorrow Trace, Amy and Ian

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.590
are gonna be chatting with a real live astronaut
about what it’s like to live and work in

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.590
space.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.730
And if you wanna hang out with the space nerds,
be sure to RSVP using the link we’ve got

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.730
in the description.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.450
That’s at at 3pm eastern time, noon pacific.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.060
So do you trust nutritional labels?

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.480
Do they need to be updated?
