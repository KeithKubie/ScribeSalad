TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Hello, and welcome

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.860
to "The Developer Show."

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.568
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and I'm standing here

00:00:06.568 --> 00:00:08.830
with Mary Grove, director
of Google for Entrepreneurs.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:09.830
MARY GROVE: Hi, Timothy.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi, Mary.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.870
How are you?

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.400
MARY GROVE: I'm great.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.370
Thanks for having me.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.150
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Thanks for being here.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.560
MARY GROVE: Absolutely.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.351
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:16.730
Let me jump to a question
about Google for Entrepreneurs.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.040
It's been on my mind
for a little while,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.050
because developers ask
it, and I think it's fair,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.800
and I think we should
give them an answer.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.940
Why is Google doing this?

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.540
MARY GROVE: It's
a great question.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.170
I'm glad you asked.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.990
So there's two ways
that I look at that.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.220
One is if you look at Google's
own history, our own journey

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.900
as a company, entrepreneurship
is such a core part of our DNA.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.900
Google began as a
startup in a garage,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.540
now almost 20 years ago.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.030
We are a company founded
by entrepreneurs,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.420
built by entrepreneurial
people, and it makes sense

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.110
that we are passionate about
empowering the next generation

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.109
of startups like Google to
become successful, to launch,

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:48.900
to use the internet to
grow their business.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.220
So that's the first reason.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.900
The second reason, though,
is actually an economic one.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.330
We believe that by investing
in communities, long term

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.022
investing in
startup communities,

00:00:58.022 --> 00:00:59.480
these are the next
set of companies

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.770
who are going to come
online, use the internet,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.330
leverage Google's
products as well,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.600
so really, it's this
notion that all boats rise,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.150
and long, long term,
it's also going

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.552
to benefit our own business too.

00:01:08.552 --> 00:01:10.010
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Now before you were

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.100
the director of this
huge amazing thing,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.220
you were a BD
principal at Google,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.720
and I'm curious,
what did you learn

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.120
doing those global
partnerships that brought you

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.152
into this new job?

00:01:20.152 --> 00:01:20.860
MARY GROVE: Sure.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.352
So my actual, my personal
story with entrepreneurship

00:01:23.352 --> 00:01:24.310
begins with my parents.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.480
So my parents are both
immigrants from Thailand,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.344
and they moved to
America, sort of

00:01:28.344 --> 00:01:30.260
personified the
quintessential American dream.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.870
They were entrepreneurs and
really showed me firsthand

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.120
that you can really
create whatever future

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.230
you dream for yourself.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.600
So at Google, fast
forward many years later,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.210
I was working in new business
development, as you said,

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.460
looking at emerging
markets for Google.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.990
And everywhere we worked,
we looked for three things.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.660
One is how can we increase
access, so internet and mobile

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.790
penetration.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.240
Two is how can we
increase content created

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.240
from these regions,
and the third bucket,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.826
which is my personal sort of
passion, was entrepreneurship.

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.200
So how can we work
with students,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.240
developers in the emerging
entrepreneur ecosystem

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.880
to really help them create the
next generation of companies

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.000
and really create and
grow their own economies?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.660
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
let's say you're

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.300
a budding entrepreneur out there
with an early stage startup.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.654
What's your first step
getting help from Google?

00:02:16.654 --> 00:02:18.570
MARY GROVE: There's many
ways to look at that.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.160
There are so many amazing groups
and networks that Google has,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.120
of course, Google Developer
groups being one of them,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.210
Women Techmakers being
another great example.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.530
We at the heart of it
are a technology company,

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.940
so we hope that our
products, our platforms

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.382
can help you be successful.

00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:33.590
Beyond that in the Google
for Entrepreneurs umbrella,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.360
our mission is really
about bringing together

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.550
startup communities, so working
with partners of all types,

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.890
whether that's physical
space, co-working,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.130
tech hub to accelerators
and educational curricula.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.260
We try to knit together
this global partner

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.700
community of about
50 organizations

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.670
who are supporting
entrepreneurs,

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.500
so we encourage you to get
involved with one of them.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.110
For example, Techstars is a
global accelerator running all

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.170
sorts of programs ranging
from startup weekend

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.310
to their vertical accelerators,
and you can find all these

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.111
resources on our website, which
is google.com/entrepreneurs.

00:03:07.111 --> 00:03:08.110
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.050
Is there anything
else that you'd

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.133
like to say about the
program that you don't often

00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:11.980
get to talk about?

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.479
MARY GROVE: I think that we're
based here in Silicon Valley,

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:16.640
but Google is truly
a global company.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.320
The internet has really
democratized access

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.330
to entrepreneurship.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.020
You can launch a company
from Sao Paulo, Brazil

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.540
and have users in Seoul,
South Korea instantly,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.120
and so what I would
say is we passionately

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.920
believe that entrepreneurship
is thriving all over the world.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.690
It's about getting more access,
getting more opportunity,

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.810
and helping companies really
go global from day one

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.860
and think about their
market opportunity

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.220
as not just their
city or their country,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.390
but really the whole world.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.910
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Mary,
thanks for joining me today.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.270
MARY GROVE: Thanks, Timothy.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.066
Thanks for having me.

00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:46.860
TIMOTHY JORDAN: For
more information
