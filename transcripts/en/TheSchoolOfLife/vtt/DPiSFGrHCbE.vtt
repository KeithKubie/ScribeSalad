00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.700
Is it better this way, or that way?

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.620
It's horrible whichever way.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.540
It's not very respectable, really

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.680
to feel frustrated with one's appearance.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.920
Mature and reasonable people

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.800
are not supposed to go around regretting

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.040
the shape of their nose or the way their hair falls.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.840
Yet, you gaze in the bathroom mirror and think:

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.060
Why?

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.200
In my brief existence on this planet does this have to be me?

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.860
For those unhappy with their looks

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.300
pictures are painful

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.740
each new image brings more bad news

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.940
yet, this isn't crazy.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.740
We care about our looks for a sound reason:

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.360
Because everyone judges us by them

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.580
Because they determine the first response

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.120
To deal with the challenges of our appearance

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.300
we need to develop a particular kind of wisdom

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.640
Here is a start to learning how to cope with one's looks

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.420
Personal appearance simply is one of the least democratic parts of life

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.760
It's a lottery and you haven't won.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.720
It's nothing to do with you, nor is it to their credit that it is them.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.160
It just is.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.240
A bold man would appreciate your hair like no one else will.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.280
It's the ugly who are at the best place to appreciate beauty.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.680
Something the beautiful should bear in mind when they're considering on who bestow their favors.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.680
People learn about love from their parents.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.240
And when they're grown up, often search for lovers who remind them a little

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.960
in some subconscious way of mum or dad.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.380
The good news is that often mum or dad were quite weird or ugly looking.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.900
That helps to explain the odd choices good looking people sometimes make.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.340
Thank god for ugly parents.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.160
The world is dominated by an often unfair money hierarchy

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.520
Against that, it's refreshing that there's also this strange looks hierarchy.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.020
It doesn't restore justice, but it thumbs its nose up at other forms of injustice just a little.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.960
However unfair the distribution of appearance is today,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.600
time will eventually bring justice.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.740
No one ends up happy with how they look.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.460
It's just a question of waiting.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.040
For some, this enchantment may start at 10.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.600
For others, it may take another 40 years. But it will happen, for sure.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.540
Rather then saying appearance doesn't matter

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.100
you can get better at noticing the less obvious but still real beauty in odder places.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.460
The trouble with our culture isn't so much that we love appearances

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.620
but that we focus on too narrow range of features and qualities

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.440
So, start to get interested in someone's august forehead

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.600
Note the melancholy sweetness of their eyes

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.700
Admire an expression of kindly acceptance

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.420
Point out serenity

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.500
A trusting face

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.520
A candid nose

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.420
There are so many good and attractive things we can see in people's faces

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.500
If we're alert to different types of beauty.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.380
And hopefully, someone, somewhere, will one day do the same for us.
