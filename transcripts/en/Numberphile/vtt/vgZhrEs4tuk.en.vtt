00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
We're talking about a problem involving putting numbers into boxes and other shapes.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.060
And the shape is an arrangement of boxes that looks something like this.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.580
And I've got a certain number of boxes in the first row,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.560
so I have four boxes in the first row, and two in the second row, and one in the third row.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.940
And the rule is that these numbers must be decreasing.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.500
And the second rule is that the boxes are left-justified.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.480
And that's it! That's the rule. A simple example would be this, here's a square.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.000
Three boxes in the first row, three in the second row, and three in the third row.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.880
The number of boxes in two rows can be the same.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.880
Another example of a shape would be something like this. This is something we call a staircase.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.660
Four, and three, and two, and one.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.000
Another shape that's kind of interesting, it turns out, for my purposes,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.880
is where I have two rows of the same length.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.320
This would be the shape (6,6).

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.700
Why don't we put numbers in them?

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.440
And so maybe I can even do it with these shapes and show you exactly what we do.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.100
So, in this first shape, we have seven boxes altogether, so I take the numbers 1–7.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.800
The rules are that the numbers must be increasing along rows and increasing down columns.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.660
So, 1-3-6 is increasing, 2-5 is increasing, and so forth. Those are the rules.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.480
This is called a Standard Young Tableau. Young is a person. Yes, that's right.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.020
While I'm at it, the word "tableau" just simply means "an arrangement of numbers in a shape,"

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.020
with no rules satisfying them.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.100
For example, I can just do an example of a tableau that's not a Standard Young Tableau.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.520
I'll just put the 1 here, and the 2 here, and the 3 here, and the 4 here, and the 5 and the 6 and the 7...

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.440
So, these numbers are not increasing along rows and increasing down columns.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.560
So that's just called a tableau.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.440
And we're gonna talk today about Standard Young Tableaux.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.300
Here, I'll make a Standard Tableau and actually, while I make it,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.520
it's sort of important to understand what I'm doing while I'm making it,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.960
because I have to put a 1 in the upper-left-hand corner, there's no choice about that.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.600
And then 2 has to go either here or here, I'll put it there.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.440
3 has to go either here or here at that point, I'll put it down here.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.500
Maybe 4 here, 5 here.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.020
And if I stop before I'm finished, you can see that what's happening is that I'm building the shape.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.140
The shape is the 3x3 square, but I'm building it up cell by cell.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.940
In terms of what I'm getting, it's a sequence of subshapes.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.800
So right now, what I've done, I've created a tableau of this shape.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.140
But I'll finish it up now, so 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.320
So that's a Standard Tableau of that shape.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.820
I'll do one here quickly. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.820
And here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.120
It's easy to do it because you just sort of build your way from the upper-left-hand corner

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.120
down to the bottom right hand corner in this case.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.500
—Are these hard to make? Are there lots of them?

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.480
Are they rare? Are Standard Young Tableaux common?

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.720
—Well, that's a good question, because what I really want to talk about is how many there are.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.780
The problem of computing the number of Standard Tableaux.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.760
What's kind of amazing is that we know very exact and precise answers to that question.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.620
So, I'll tell you, for example, let's take this shape.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.160
The number of Standard Young Tableaux—I'll abbreviate it as SYT—is 42.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.900
So, I could systematically write down all 42 tableaux,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.560
and I could convince myself that was correct,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.460
but there's a formula for it, and the formula goes like this, and I'll show you how you do it.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.520
It's equal to, let's see, there's nine cells in this shape.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:43.200
So it's 9×8×7×6×5×4×3×2×1, divided by—that's 9!—and by the way,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.040
that's the number of ways of just filling this shape with the numbers in any manner whatsoever.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.600
So the total number of fillings of this shape—

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.000
which is what we've called a tableau—

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.880
is 9!—it's this very large number—because

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.000
there's 9 choices for what to put here,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.800
and 8 for what to put there once you've decided on the first one,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.940
and 7 for what you put here once you've decided on these two, etc.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.440
So you get 9! quite easily.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.200
But if you require the rules to be satisfied,

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.020
then the number has to be reduced by something,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.800
and I'm gonna tell you what exactly it has to be reduced by.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.000
First of all, you take this shape, and we fill it up with a bunch of other numbers,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.300
and the numbers are constructed this way:

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.200
I put a 1 here, and then a 2, and then a 3, and then I go up, 4, and then 5,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.300
and then I go down, 4 and then 3, and then down, 2, and then up, 3,

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.800
and I divide this by the product of all those numbers.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.720
And the ratio of these two numbers is the number of Standard Young Tableaux of this shape.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.660
Now let's just compute it. So these cancel...

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.160
I've canceled everything and I see 3×2×7, which is 42.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.000
So that's how I got 42.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.040
—Now I guess the million-dollar question is what on earth are these numbers?

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.920
—That's the question, the big question! Well, there are two questions.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.940
One, where did these numbers come from? They just came out of the blue!

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.140
What's going on? And secondly, why is it true? And why is it true generally?

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:26.200
So what's gonna happen is that not only have I shown you a formula for computing

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.640
Standard Tableaux of shapes like this, but it's gonna work for any shape.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.500
So I have to tell you what these numbers are.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.060
These numbers are called the hook numbers.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.880
Hook numbers are the following: you have a shape—I'll do it sort of schematically first.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.680
Every cell has a hook number.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.400
You can see, for example, here. Every cell had a hook number.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.400
How did I get this hook number?

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.540
The answer is that I first of all computed the hook associated with that cell.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.000
And the hook is everything that you get by going down from it,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and to the right, and the square itself.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.040
So you get this sort of inverted-L-shaped thing, which we call a hook.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.140
So that's the hook associated with that cell.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.000
And so, for example, we can take this cell here. What's its hook number?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.360
Well, its hook consists of everything to the right and everything below,

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.400
and so there are three cells altogether, so the hook number is 3.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.220
This has hook number 4, because I have one, two, three, four.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.660
This has hook number 5, so I have one, two, three, four, five, etc.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.020
So that's what I was doing when I went through that crazy process of filling the square up with numbers.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.240
I was computing the hook numbers.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.780
Actually, so the main result now is that for any shape—the kinds of shapes I was telling

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:47.100
you about before, not just these special square shapes—the formula is exactly this.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:53.380
You take n!, where n is the number of cells, and divide it by the product of all the hook numbers.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.740
All right, so let's do one more example.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.580
Here's the shape. That's a (4,2,1) shape.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.060
Yes, exactly. Well first of all, n is 7.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.460
So the number of Standard Young Tableaux is going to be

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:13.440
7×6×5×4×3×2×1 divided by the product of the hook lengths.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.500
So, what are they? I'm going to start putting the hook lengths in each cell.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.100
This is what we call a corner cell.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.220
Maybe I should use that term now, because it's going to come up again.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.200
It's a cell with hook length 1. Its hook number is 1.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.620
And that's a corner cell, and that's also a corner cell.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.100
This one has hook number 2,

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.180
because the hook only goes to the right. There's two cells in it.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.180
This has hook number 4.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.180
This has hook number 3.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.640
This has hook number—what is it?—6.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.640
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:56.220
And so the formula says that I should take 7! and divide by 6×4×2×1×3×1×1.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.200
So let's do that computation. Cancel the 3's...

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.480
Cancel the 4's, cancel the 2's, cancel the 6's.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.440
And it looks like we get 7×5, or 35.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.680
The number of Standard Young Tableaux of this shape is 35.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.160
—I'm always surprised by how high these numbers are for such simple shapes.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.420
—You asked a good question before. If you fix the number of cells, which ones are the biggest?

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.000
Which ones give you the largest number?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.840
That's an interesting and rather difficult question

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.500
that people do know the answer to,

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.640
but it's too complicated to talk about today.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.000
—This video was filmed at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.080
in that room there actually, but the interview didn't stop here.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.600
If you'd like to go deeper into the world of tableaux and hook numbers,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.340
including some details about how to prove all this,

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:50.180
the interview continues over at our second channel, Numberphile2.
