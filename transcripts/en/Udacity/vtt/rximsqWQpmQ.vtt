00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So adding colors wouldn't increase latency,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but it would increase the bandwidth.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What bandwidth means is the amount of information

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that can be transmitted per unit time,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and it doesn't matter if there is a startup time.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The startup time is the latency, that's how long

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
it takes to start sending a message across.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That's how long it takes for the start of the message to be received.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The bandwidth is, once you've got some part of the message across,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
what's the rate that you can send information.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So this is going to be measured in terms of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
units of information divided by units of time.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So bandwidths can be measured in terms of bits per second.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
On the internet, this is often measured in Mbps,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
which is megabits per second or million bits per second.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I haven't yet explained what a bit is,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and in order to understand information,

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
it's important to understand what a bit is.
