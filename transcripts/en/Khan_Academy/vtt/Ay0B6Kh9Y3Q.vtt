00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.800
We're asked to simplify
9p to the 2/3, all of that

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.980
over the square
root of 4p cubed.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.230
So let's just do
this step by step.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.040
The first thing we
can do is say, well,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.640
if it's 9p to the 2/3, that's
the same thing as 9 to the 2/3,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.940
9 to the 2/3 times p to the 2/3.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.020
That's what this top part
can be simplified to.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.480
Now the bottom part, we
can rewrite the bottom part

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.170
right here.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.250
The square root of
4p to the third.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.660
And this is the exact
same thing as 4p

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.122
to the third to
the one half power.

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:41.080
This is the same thing.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.050
The square root
of 4p to the third

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.600
is the same thing as 4p to
the third to the 1/2 power.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.110
So given that, we can do
the same thing that we

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.800
did on the numerator,
we can say,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.470
well, this is the same
thing as 4 to the 1/2.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:00.440
4 to the 1/2 times p to
the third to the 1/2 times

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.080
p to the third to the 1/2 power.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.220
Let's see if we can
simplify this even more.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.550
So this is going to
be equal to-- let's

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.750
do the denominator first here.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.989
So what's 4 to the 1/2 power?

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:14.280
What's the principal root of 4?

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.710
Well, 2 squared is 4.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.110
So it's 2.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.940
The positive root is 2, and then
p to the third, and then that

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.930
to the 1/2.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.240
That's the same thing as p to
3 times 1/2, or p to the 3/2.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.670
p to the 3 over 2.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.210
9 to the 2/3.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.377
See, the cube root of
9 isn't anything easy.

00:01:34.377 --> 00:01:36.460
Well, actually, you could
think about it this way.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.400
You could say it's 9 squared.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.780
So we can view nine to 2/3.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.880
Let me do it this way.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.690
This is the best way
to think about it.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.000
This is 9 to the 2/3.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.260
One could write it.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.030
I'm kind of making
it unsimplified.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.850
But it will help us calculate
what it actually means.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.050
9 to the 2/3, the
same thing as 9

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.600
squared, 9 squared
to the 1/3 power,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.640
right, because 2 times
1/3 third is 2/3.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.310
And you have that, of
course, times p to the 2/3.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.240
And this is going to be
equal to 9 squared is 81.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:15.060
So it's 81 to the 1/3
power times p to the 2/3.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.470
Times p to the 2/3.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.810
Now instead of writing this
2 and this p to the 3/2

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.920
down here, Let me just write
it as negative exponents.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.032
Or even, let's try to
just write it like this.

00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:27.990
But 2 in the denominator
is the same thing as 1

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.187
to the negative 1, or 1/2.

00:02:30.187 --> 00:02:31.770
So this right here,
if I want to write

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.750
numerator, same thing as 1/2.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.380
That and that are
the same thing.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.700
And p to the 3/2
in the denominator

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.050
is the same thing as
p to the negative,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.450
p to the negative 3/2.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.040
So this whole
expression so far has

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.750
been simplified to
this right over here.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.790
And let copy and paste.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.900
I'll work on the next line now.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.820
So let me copy it, and paste.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.310
Bring it down right over there.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.660
Let's see if we can
simplify this even more.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.050
So let's think about 81.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.930
Let's see if we can write
it as-- we're essentially,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.707
when we take
something to cubed, we

00:03:09.707 --> 00:03:11.290
take the cube root
of something, we're

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.410
taking something
to the 1/3 power.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.621
Taking the cube root of it.

00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:17.120
So we have to find some numbers,
or maybe we could factor it

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.844
into things that
do have cube roots,

00:03:18.844 --> 00:03:20.010
and other things that don't.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.400
So 81 is divisible by 3.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.890
It's 3 times 27, which is 3
times 9, which is 3 times 3.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.220
So 81 is 3 to the fourth power,
or 3 multiplied by itself

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.970
three times.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.130
So we could rewrite
this 81 to the 1/3.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.040
we could rewrite it as 3
times 3 times 3 to the-- well,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.040
I'll write it like this.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.650
Times 3 to the 1/3.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.090
That's the same thing as 81.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.342
And then let's think
about this these p's.

00:03:53.342 --> 00:03:55.800
And I'm doing more steps than
I would do if I were doing it

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.383
on a piece of paper, because I
really want y'all to understand

00:03:58.383 --> 00:03:59.930
kind of what's going on here.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.750
So we have a p to the 2/3,
times p to the negative 3/2.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.610
So that's going to be times p
to the 2/3, 2/3 minus 3/2 power.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.110
And then so we did
the p's, and then

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.430
we just have the times 1/2.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.779
Times 1/2.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.800
Now this right over here,
this is the same thing.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.910
This is the same thing
as, we could just

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.180
do this as 3 times
3 times 3, times 3.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.860
So it's the same thing as 3
times 3 times 3 to the 1/3,

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.180
times 3 to the 1/3.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.900
We've done this multiple times.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.040
Times the 2/3 minus 3/2.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.420
Let's just work that out.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.240
Actually, three halves
is a larger number,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.590
so let's just say it's the
negative of 3/2 minus 2/3,

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.940
which is equal to the
negative if we use 6

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.980
as a common denominator.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.390
If we use 6 as a
common denominator,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:01.310
3/2 with 6 in the
denominator, is 9/6 6 minus 4

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.170
over six that's what
2/3 is equal to.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.620
So 9 minus 4 is 5/6, but then
we have this negative value.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.090
So it equals negative 5/6.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.990
So times p to the
negative 5/6 power,

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.200
times 1/2 times that
last 1/2 over here.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.740
Now 3 times 3 times 3, or 27 to
the 1/3, the cube root of 27,

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.060
is 3.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.170
So this right here
simplifies to three.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.320
And then 3 to the 1/3,
that's the cube root of 3.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.310
So we could say, 3
and then this right

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.830
here is the cube root of 3.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.190
The cube root of 3.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.520
So we get 3 times
the cube root of 3,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.486
times p to the negative 5/6.

00:05:44.486 --> 00:05:46.610
So sometimes you might want
to write the p out here

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.470
in front of the radical.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.761
That tends to be a simpler way.

00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:50.340
Actually, let me do that.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.880
So I'll write the p
to the negative 5/6, p

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.180
to the negative 5/6, then
I'll write the radical.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.770
So times the cube root of 3.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.450
And then all that times 1/2.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.350
or we could say all of
that multiplying by 1/2,

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.570
or just divide it by two.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.940
And we've simplified it
about as far as you can go.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.500
You could view it as 3/2.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.990
You could say 3/2 is 1.5p to
the negative 5/6 times the cube

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.995
root of 3.

00:06:18.995 --> 00:06:21.370
If you wanted to, you could
calculate the cube root of 3,

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.120
multiply that times 1/2, give
you some decimal number times

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.730
p to the negative 5/6.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.640
And that's about as simplified
as this thing I can get.
