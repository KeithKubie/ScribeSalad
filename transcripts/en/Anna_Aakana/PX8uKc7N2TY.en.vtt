00:00:00.326 --> 00:00:02.533
I used to wait tables
for like 4 years.

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.698
And I will always remember

00:00:03.698 --> 00:00:06.229
this one couple that
I served, cause they were just

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:08.061
on fire.

00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:10.275
(screaming)

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:11.506
Not literally, of course,

00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:14.352
but you could tell that
they were just unashamed,

00:00:14.352 --> 00:00:18.290
freaks in the sheets, because when
I asked, "Can I get you something to drink?"

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.774
Uh, I'll take a coke please.

00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:23.657
(gasp) You bad, bad boy~

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:24.969
But I love that memory

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:28.915
because..the lust was so..palpable

00:00:28.915 --> 00:00:32.230
you know, you could literally slice
the sexual tension in the air.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.850
And it always made me wonder,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.560
"If soda was so bad..

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.184
what else turned her on?"

00:00:38.184 --> 00:00:40.999
This is the second time I've worn this
shirt this week.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:44.662
(gasp) You dirty, dirty birdy.

00:00:44.662 --> 00:00:45.531
Hey.

00:00:46.698 --> 00:00:48.852
I didn't take a shower today.

00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:51.729
(Tssssss)

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.536
These vitamins have high-fructose
corn syrup in them.

00:00:54.536 --> 00:01:05.821
(sensual music)

00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:09.030
And like, everybody's weird, yeah we
can all accept that, we're all weird.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.565
It's just a matter of finding someone

00:01:10.565 --> 00:01:13.259
whose "weird" is compatible with yours.

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.938
And the way that these two interacted

00:01:14.938 --> 00:01:16.259
over soda..

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.730
was so adorable and hilarious.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.199
That it just goes to show,

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:23.938
no matter how freaky you are on the inside,

00:01:23.938 --> 00:01:25.698
there is someone out there..

00:01:25.698 --> 00:01:29.321
who just..gets you.

00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:31.029
It really gave me belief in love.

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:32.999
It did. (chuckles)

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:34.443
I'll see you next week.

00:01:34.443 --> 00:01:35.191
Stay awesome, Gotham.

00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:39.421
