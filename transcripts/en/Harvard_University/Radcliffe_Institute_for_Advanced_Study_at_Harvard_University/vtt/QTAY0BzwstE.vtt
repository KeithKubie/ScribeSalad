00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.600
- Good afternoon.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.780
Who would choose to
be LGBT and Nigerian?

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.840
Recent polls indicate that
more than 90% of Nigerians

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.280
support the legal ban
of same sex relations,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.500
and that 86% of Nigerians
say that the country will

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.410
be better off without members
of the LGBT community.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.640
Laws enacted in 2014
make homosexuality

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.020
a crime punishable by ten years
imprisonment with 14 years

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.990
for same sex marriage,
and ten years

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.960
for participating
or facilitating

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.640
a homosexual gathering.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.460
Nigerians truly believe that
LGBT is a Western concept

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.520
and that members of
the LGBT community

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.650
are purposefully and actively
choosing to act in this manner,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.360
and that their proclivities can
be undone by pressure, prayer,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.920
violence, imprisonment,
or the threat of death.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.890
I know of no openly
gay persons in Nigeria.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.330
Now, contrary to at
least one opinion,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.100
Nigeria is not a shit hole.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.920
[LAUGHTER] It is rather an
amazing and intriguing country

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.330
of approximately 200
million people from 300

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.870
different ethnic groups,
each with its unique language

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.580
and culture.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.440
Christianity and Islam are
the dominant religions,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.940
and Nigeria has
the fifth largest

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.910
Christian and Muslim
population in the world.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.940
Nigerian immigrants
are the most educated

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.450
of all immigrants in
the US, and Nigerians

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.580
have come first on the poll for
happiest people in the world.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.539
Nigeria is also a country with
immense natural resources.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.240
However, despite incredible
crude oil endowment--

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.900
failed leadership and
ruthless corruption

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.470
have left the vast majority
of Nigerian citizens

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.230
poor and vulnerable,
without access

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.200
to decent education, employment,
security, health care,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.910
electricity, or clean water.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:44.170
Uncertainty is tangible and
fear is a well traded commodity.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.400
In fact, the creation
and propagation of fear

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.430
is one of the more profitable
businesses of people in power--

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.200
such as the police,
educators, politicians,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.850
and many religious leaders--

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.560
in order to exert control
and extort resources

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.010
from everyday citizens.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.320
It is here, against this
complicated backdrop,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.600
that I wish to enter this matter
to explore how I may influence

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.830
the current narrative and
soften the hearts of Nigerians

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.382
towards the LGBT issue.

00:03:22.382 --> 00:03:24.490
It is also here
that my work gets

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.120
very uncomfortable
in attempting to give

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.870
honest voice to the silenced
parties in this matter

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.310
and smashing up against a
trifecta of draconian laws,

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.755
new sprung intolerance, and
a pervasive religious might.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.050
I was born and raised
in Lagos, Nigeria

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.860
by a very Catholic
white American mother

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.490
and an Episcopalian
Nigerian father.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.410
At age 17 I left Nigeria
to attend university here

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.490
in Boston, and I returned
to Nigeria 20 years later

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.910
when I married my husband--

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.510
a Nigerian American,
just like me--

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.780
who started a business in Lagos.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.120
I am an artist who
is passionately

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.269
engaged in creating performance
artwork that positively impacts

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.640
the society that I live in.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.500
Now, as Judy said, in 2014
I started a performance art

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.730
production company
called iOpenEye,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.270
which creates work that builds
awareness and challenges

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.530
the status quo where it limits
the potential for Nigeria.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.430
We are focused on women's issues
and our production, HEREWORD!,

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.980
if you haven't seen
it-- plug right here--

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.590
is happening next door at the
American Repertory Theater.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.000
I'm neither an academic
nor an intellectual,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.800
and I explore this
current subject

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.140
as a storyteller, a witness,
a mother, a concerned Nigerian

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.430
citizen, and a
citizen of the world.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.830
Who, indeed, would choose
to be LGBT and Nigerian?

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.150
Now, let's go back to
that Nigerian environment

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.170
where, for the average citizen,
uncertainty is tangible

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.260
and fear a well
traded commodity--

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.120
an environment lacking in
decent education, employment,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.380
security, health care,
electricity, or clean water.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.860
As such, and understandably
so, Nigerians flock

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.210
to places of worship, seeking
protection, prosperity,

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.460
and the promise of heaven.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.490
Religious leaders
promise abundance

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.790
and preach about an
ending world filled

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.840
with the anguish of
hellfire for nonbelievers,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.950
and a living world where demons,
witches, and homosexuals run

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:03.940
rampant--

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.120
snatching up hope, health,
and righteousness, right

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.270
where our children play.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.790
So though Nigeria's diverse,
chaotic, and complex,

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.310
there is one thing most
Nigerians agree on--

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.780
homosexuality is an abomination
and it must be eradicated.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.780
And yet, as I
explore this topic,

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.680
there are many Nigerian voices
that are muffled and muted.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.510
Citizens who are LGBT
and live with a portion

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.380
of their lives shrouded,
hidden, and disguised.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.780
Citizens who are supportive
friends, relatives,

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.330
and families of LGBT persons.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.840
As a teenager in Lagos,
I was aware of what

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.090
it meant to be homosexual.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.730
I understood it wasn't ideal.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.090
I had heard boys with
cousins in British boarding

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:03.380
schools use the term, homo, or,
fag, to belittle other boys.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.830
However, no one was
looking for homosexuals

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.080
to burn at the stake.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.270
No one felt threatened.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.130
No one was even discussing it.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.420
In fact, what we all heard our
parents whispering about was,

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.330
who in our neighborhood
had just embezzled funds

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.220
or stolen money?

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.790
Our parents shook their heads
and squeezed their faces

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:30.140
at the news headlines of corrupt
government officials or failed

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.180
government projects--

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.970
projects which ultimately
caused the misery

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.510
and death of many Nigerians.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.520
There are many--
there may even be--

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.250
there may have even been some
smirking when men they knew

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.460
took second wives
or fathered children

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.570
outside their marriages,
but certainly, homosexuality

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.070
was not a topic of
conversation or concern.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.340
So you can imagine my shock
when, after 20 years in the US,

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.420
I return to impassioned,
young, Nigerian graduates,

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.020
barely able to write a
decent application letter,

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.890
yet freely interpreting
verses from The King James

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.510
version of the Bible.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.260
These young fellow citizens
stood sure and convinced

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.550
about who and whom would enter
the kingdom of heaven, and why

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.590
and who would surely
burn in eternal hellfire.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.800
The guest list heaven
excluded non-christians,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.820
idol worshippers,
those not born again,

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.780
and unrepentant sinners--

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.710
including members of
the LGBT community

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.590
whose special sin was
tied to the destruction

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.430
of the city of Gomorrah.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.040
Critical thinking
had become seriously

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.770
impaired by a cocktail of
young energy and idle, vacuous,

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:57.270
minds spinning aimlessly
in a failed national system

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.330
of education.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.300
It was as if these
young Nigerians believed

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.770
that in the 2000 plus years
of Christian theology,

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:11.920
they were the first people
to really get the Bible.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.660
They parroted phrases
that conjured up

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.940
the devil, absolving themselves
of every responsibility.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.430
They fearlessly cast and
bound imaginary enemies

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:27.230
responsible for setbacks
they were yet to experience.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.400
No weapon fashioned
against me shall prosper.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.180
Any evil plan for me shall
be returned to sender.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.810
Any enemies shall burn 1,000
times in a pit of hellfire.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:43.940
It was the same story for
young Muslim fundamentalists.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.880
It was alarming.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:52.430
I mean, if we now prayed more
and read our Bibles more--

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.250
if we were now
holier than before,

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.590
why was evil so
much more prevalent?

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.020
And what had happened to
those fundamental teachings

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.680
of Christ-- you know,
sacrifice, selflessness,

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.360
and treating your fellow
human being as yourself?

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.520
Where was the love
thy neighbor, the log

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.800
in the eye thing,
the forgive one

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.100
another as your Father
in heaven forgive you?

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:21.480
It appeared that these had
been placed on the back burner,

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:27.240
and still, ever so
present was that fear.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.850
I wish to share a few
stories with you--

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:34.710
stories that helped to form
my interest in this project.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:39.210
Several years ago in Lagos,
a happening friend of mine

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:40.700
arrived at my home--

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.620
let me go back--

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:46.620
happening, friend of
mine arrived at my home

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.300
for a cup of tea and a catch up.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.970
She arrived big and bright,
directly behind her Gucci bag.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.960
The tea and conversation
was sweet and light

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.220
until she asked where I
had been and why I had not

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.960
shared that I was leaving town?

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.780
Now, she was right
to be suspicious.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:10.100
I had continued to be
purposefully vague.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.460
I went to a wedding
in Scotland, I said,

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:19.370
but she pushed on, hey, these
Nigerians and their destination

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:20.540
weddings.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.890
So whose wedding was it?

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.140
You know I know almost
everybody in this town who

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.369
can afford to pay
for a wedding abroad,

00:11:26.369 --> 00:11:28.660
or at least I know I know
somebody who would know them.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:35.030
Now, you can tell by now
that the relationship

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:39.890
between my friend and I
was, at best, still fluid,

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.950
so it should not surprise
you that, after noticing how

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.570
perfectly red the shoe soles
of her Louboutin shoes were,

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.970
I suddenly found
myself boldly stating

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:54.470
that I had been at the most
wonderful Nigerian gay wedding

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:58.325
in a villa, surrounded by
beautiful gardens in Scotland.

00:11:58.325 --> 00:11:58.824
Bam.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.390
She rose from my sofa--

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.580
what rubbish, she said.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.520
Why would you participate
in such insanity?

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.490
And by the way, where
was your husband?

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:17.270
I know you are half-American,
Ifeoma, but for God's sake.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.720
We locked horns-- she
threatened to leave.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.770
She ended the discussion with,
I am ending this discussion now,

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.180
because it's obvious
it's the devil that

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.505
is speaking through you.

00:12:30.505 --> 00:12:34.920
Now, at the time
of this argument,

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.700
my morally outraged
and churchgoing friend

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:43.560
was dating a very prominent,
married, public figure,

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.230
and toying with the
idea of seeing yet

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:50.760
another popular Lagos biggs
boy-- as we called them.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.600
You see, Nigeria's sweet
Brent crude oil was, then,

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.850
selling at a high $110
a barrel, so money

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.960
flowed for those with the
right kinds of connections, yet

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.560
there was still little or no
infrastructural development

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.120
in the country--

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.320
almost nothing for the
poor or average citizen.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.540
And yet, the places of worship--

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:20.430
churches and
mosques-- were packed.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:26.910
Then in 2014, President
Jonathan Goodluck

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:31.150
signed the Same-sex
Marriage Prohibition Act.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.430
It was smart strategy.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.060
His approval ratings
rose, boosting

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.280
his chances of a second term.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.930
The headlines read--

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.050
President signs ban
on same-sex relations,

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.990
dozens arrested for being
gay, US threatens sanctions.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.400
Attention shifted from queries
about a missing $20 billion

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.220
in the country's oil revenue.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.550
Nigerians, instead, united
in public conversation

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:03.570
about a gay agenda, the
rise of queer programming

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.600
on US television,
conspiracies to remove

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.780
prayer in the schools, the
audacity of David Cameron's

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.830
AIDS suspension threat
response, and Barack Obama's

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:18.910
massive mistake in endorsing
gays and gay marriage.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:22.570
Names like Ellen Degeneres
and Rosie O'Donnell

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:27.910
were tossed in
the mud with spit.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.420
Allow me to repeat that the
new law includes the following

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.230
provisions--

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.990
14 years imprisonment
for gay marriage,

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.070
ten years for attending
any gay gathering,

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.060
and ten years imprisonment
for same-sex, public, amorous,

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.040
show of affection.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:51.400
That morning, my same friend
texted me the news headlines

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.600
and the following comment--

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:59.790
I thank God that there are
still sane people in this world.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:04.940
Later that year I
attended Sunday service

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.170
at a large, popular,
evangelical church in Lagos.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:14.030
I love lively choirs and I
enjoy theatrical sermons,

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.680
even though it's
still uncomfortable

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.420
when I hear unfettered talk
of money in a house of God.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:25.700
The congregation of 1,500
upper middle class Nigerians

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.780
listened to the head preacher's
wife give a fervent sermon.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.780
It was a condemnation
of current trends--

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.900
the usual concern for the
corruption of our children

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:41.690
by reality TV, film, video
games, and social media.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:46.880
You know, the usual, world
spinning out of control--

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.290
hell in a handbasket stuff.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:54.530
Anyway, she cautioned the
congregation to be vigilant,

00:15:54.530 --> 00:16:00.500
to pray, and to minister to
Muslims, Hindus, and Jews who

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.970
needed turning to Christ.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:06.680
And most importantly,
she warned us all

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.440
to use our God given sense.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.830
After all, she said,
even a male dog

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:18.260
has enough sense not to
mount another male dog.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.560
Within the closing three
minutes of this pastor's speech,

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.840
she had managed to alienate
three major world religions

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.590
and insult members of the
global LGBT community.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.820
The offering plate went
round and the choir sang.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:42.040
Several months after the
same-sex marriage prohibition

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.780
bill was passed, I received
an invitation from the German

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:52.330
Consulate to attend a screening
of an independent Kenyan LGBT

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.350
film--

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.100
the first of its kind.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.660
The film had been banned
in several countries.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:03.040
We were a motley crew of about
30 people in the audience--

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.849
mostly young artists
and a few journalists.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:10.810
The screening was to be
followed by a group dialogue,

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:14.500
however, when that portion
of the event began,

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.099
nothing more than a
few vague comments

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:19.569
and one foggy hint
of a disgruntlement

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:21.930
trickled from the group.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.630
The German cultural attache
took matters into his hands,

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.530
walked to the front of the
room, and made a speech.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:34.060
He reminded us that legally,
the Consulate compound

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:39.310
was considered German
territory, and as such, we had

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.680
the full right to speak freely.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:49.430
I found the situation
confusing and embarrassing--

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:54.680
to be granted permission by
a foreigner to speak freely

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.985
in my own country.

00:17:56.985 --> 00:18:01.250
[INAUDIBLE] The matter
was now critical.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.190
We had lost our minds.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.120
We had lost sight
of our history.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.420
We had forgotten our
culture of embrace.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.210
We had replaced it with
something strange--

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:14.610
something intolerant.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:18.120
No one would choose to
be LGBT and Nigerian--

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.690
no one.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:22.820
Let me share my thinking.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:27.400
As the West discovers new age
philosophies of inclusiveness,

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.440
holistic living, and
natural medicines

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.110
from the rest of the
world, it embraces

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.150
these wins and
makes them its own.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:40.220
It documents and repackages
these ancient traditions

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:44.120
and philosophies and makes them
available to its citizens--

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.980
it progresses.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.090
I cannot help but think that
as the West sheds its old skin,

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:55.800
we Africans are all too eager
to abandon our useful traditions

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:00.060
and crawl into the discarded
remains of rejected Western

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.450
lifestyles.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.980
I have the following thoughts
about the 1980s and 1990s

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.960
in Nigeria--

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.780
the thick of the military era.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:19.060
Dry seeds of the US evangelical
movement blew across the world

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:22.960
like tumbleweeds in a
deserted Western town.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.480
And when the
hopelessness of ruthless,

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.630
corrupt leadership
was at its worst--

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:33.880
those seeds docked, split
open, drank of the desperation,

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.220
and sprung deep and
upward into full bloom.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.860
This is not a bad thing.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:46.360
Now, we just need enlightened
spiritual leadership.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.350
The matter is more
complicated than I imagined.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:54.610
I came to Radcliffe intending
to write a poignant play that

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.700
would speak to my
community like I have

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.490
been able to do with here word.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.790
I have since recognized
that, for safety reasons,

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:06.550
this project would
need to be a film.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.750
It's not easy.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.270
I had chosen to explore
the question from the place

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.220
I know best--

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.110
from women.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:19.250
From what is possible from women
in terms of social impact--

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:23.480
Nigerian women, friends,
sisters, mothers, grandmothers.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.870
I believed there was
equity in showcasing

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.290
to women the difficulties
faced by their peers

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.020
with LGBT children.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:39.110
However, my initial findings
have changed my thoughts.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:43.490
I have discovered that the vast
majority of mothers who do not

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:48.530
have LGBT children do not
consider, know of, or empathize

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.330
with those who do.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:53.390
And that those who
have LGBT children

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.480
are unable to come together
for many reasons, including

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.630
personal safety, the
safety of their loved ones,

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.450
and the stated law
which criminalizes

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:08.740
any gathering where gay persons
are present, such as this one.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.290
While here at
Radcliffe, I have been

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:16.000
able to return to Nigeria
twice and interview over

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.770
100 people in the streets,
markets, and churches in Lagos.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:24.010
I have had secret group
meetings with gay men and women,

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:25.510
and I have spoken to parents--

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.740
predominantly mothers--
of persons who are LGBT.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.580
And I've been humbled and
stunned by their stories.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.850
I've felt despair,
but I have already

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:42.730
encountered fellow Nigerians who
empathize and question the law.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:46.900
I've also met members of
the Nigerian LGBT community

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.140
with incredible hope
and dreams and dignity--

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:55.760
determined to find a way to live
their most authentic selves.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.620
I'd like to show you
a short film which

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.400
illustrates some of my
current work and findings.

00:22:15.163 --> 00:22:18.142
[CAR HONKS]

00:22:18.142 --> 00:22:18.642
- Hmm.

00:22:21.624 --> 00:22:23.490
- Personally?

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:24.110
- Not at all.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.870
Not at all.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.804
- No, not at all.

00:22:26.804 --> 00:22:29.550
- God forbid.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.950
- No, I don't know anyone.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.500
- No, I don't.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.310
What of it?

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:39.210
- I'm just hearing it
I've never seen it.

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:40.715
- No.

00:22:40.715 --> 00:22:43.890
- No, not at all.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.188
- Have a girlfriend.

00:22:48.512 --> 00:22:49.012
- No.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:52.912
- Yes.

00:22:52.912 --> 00:22:55.650
- No, I don't.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:58.195
- Well, not personally.

00:22:58.195 --> 00:22:58.800
- Not really.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.450
No, I don't.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.990
- I think I've seen some of
them in University of Lagos.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:05.240
- I rarely see them in movies.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.940
I don't know if that's
how they are in real life.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.895
- I don't know
anybody in Nigeria,

00:23:09.895 --> 00:23:13.510
but I know it's happening.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:16.260
- We know this is common
in the Western world

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.520
and it's creeping in fast
into our society here.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.380
I know that, presently,
the government

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:27.540
is trying to bring out
a law to imprison anyone

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.242
that is found to be homosexual.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.230
- It's not right in the
African culture, per se.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.680
Over there abroad it's
fine, but here It's

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.660
not in our culture to
practice lesbianism

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.290
and gayism or whatever, so the
government is right with that.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.030
14 years imprisonment, fine,
but would that solve the issue?

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.579
That's the problem.

00:23:51.579 --> 00:23:53.620
- I think the government
is taking the best right

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.100
steps in the right direction.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.500
- It's the law that is very
good of which it would safeguard

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.780
the citizenship of such acts.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.990
- When I heard about
it, I was very happy.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.490
- Good.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.150
Perfect.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.380
- So if you look at
Sodom and Gomorrah

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.460
you have to go biblical.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.910
These are those things that
ruined the society then,

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:21.720
so if you continue in
this in our society,

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.770
it will surely ruin us.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.500
- We have offenses
that is called sin,

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.670
and we have the one
that is so grievous

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:29.600
that is called wickedness.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.440
So homosexuality and
lesbianism, all these things

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.220
are wickedness.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.803
- You have a lot of lesbians on
gays in this world that we are

00:24:35.803 --> 00:24:38.920
right now, so definitely,
they cannot arrest everybody.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:42.040
- There are lots
more issues to be

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.310
tackled in this country
than that silly bill.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.710
- I don't see any
instance of my blood going

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.380
to lesbianism or gay.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:55.570
- I think if I should catch my
own blood brother in that act,

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.330
he knows what will happen.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.010
- This is family [LAUGHS]

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.337
- I'll kill her.

00:25:00.337 --> 00:25:00.920
I'll kill him.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.870
- Yes, I'm going to hand over
the child to the police myself.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.220
Yeah.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:22.840
- OK, I will reject
her first as a child.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.590
Secondly, I will go
and report her myself,

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.180
so they have to lock her up--

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.097
or him.

00:25:28.097 --> 00:25:29.440
That's it.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:34.880
- I would talk to the child,
try to talk the child out of it,

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.760
do all the praying I can,
and if it's not yielding--

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.400
the law.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.900
- I don't need to
report her, I know

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.838
how to take action on my own.

00:25:44.838 --> 00:25:46.290
I know how to take action.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:49.430
Be it a girl, I'll quickly
marry her off, and being a boy,

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:51.420
I will marry him off as well.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.872
It can never happen in my house.

00:25:53.872 --> 00:25:56.402
- No, it can't happen,
but if it happens,

00:25:56.402 --> 00:26:00.470
the parents will report.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.100
But it can happen
to some people who

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.340
didn't take proper
care of their child,

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:11.046
and if that happens you
have to go to your pastor,

00:26:11.046 --> 00:26:15.265
you go to the police, then
you go to those people who

00:26:15.265 --> 00:26:16.136
can counsel.

00:26:16.136 --> 00:26:19.600
- Recently, one of my
friends, when I was arguing--

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.380
we were talking and she just
said that one of her nieces--

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.790
that from the time
the girl was five--

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:30.965
that she doesn't like female
colors, as in bright colors.

00:26:30.965 --> 00:26:32.860
If they put on a
pink dress on her

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.430
she would be crying
until they remove it.

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.470
And what the parents want
now, to even crown it all,

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:42.300
they now took abroad, so I know
that she's going to be lesbian.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:46.340
If the parents were
sensible enough

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.290
they would have tried to
bring the girl out of this,

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.730
not take her to a society
and environment where

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:53.060
she'll be encouraged the more.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.230
- Because she has so
many female friends,

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:18.890
I was not bothered when would
you like to settle down.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:25.600
Eventually, the impression I had
was that, being the first son,

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:30.160
he wanted to achieve
something greater to help

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.210
to take care of his siblings.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:36.360
He's the first son and he's
living up to expectations.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.040
- He's stylish.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.590
- He's a fine boy, too.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:40.310
- Yes.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:41.044
- Handsome.

00:27:41.044 --> 00:27:41.710
- He's handsome.

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:43.170
- Black and lovely.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:49.042
[LAUGHS] Anything that
makes me happy he would do,

00:27:49.042 --> 00:27:51.920
and the same thing
I would do for him.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:57.340
That was why I was
at his wedding.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:01.510
It was something he
treasured, and that we're

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.700
all there for him.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.730
I don't think he
will ever forget it.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:15.550
You may not be gay, but you
cannot predict if your children

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.490
or grandchildren
will not be gay.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:19.420
What do you do?

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.490
Are you going to disown them?

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:23.200
Why crucify them?

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:28.120
They do not deprive
you of your pleasures.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.660
They do not steal from you.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.965
Why do you they bill
them as sinners?

00:28:35.965 --> 00:28:39.460
Why not drop it and let
them go on with their lives?

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.680
We are not all going
to live forever.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:46.300
Whatever it is, I think,
we should show them love.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.710
The most important
thing, really,

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.590
is for your children
to be happy.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.940
They've been born that way
and you cannot change it.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.550
- So as you can see,
there's a lot to unpack.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.970
I continue to be
humbled by the trust

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.130
that people have
placed in me, and I'm

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:34.330
cognizant of the need
to get the story right

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:38.560
and tell it in a way that
makes sense to Nigerians.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.130
As a Radcliffe Fellow, I've
been granted a safe space--

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.370
a supportive space--
to begin this inquiry.

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.640
I approach this subject with
the full knowledge and respect

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.810
for the risk this work poses
to my current body of work

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:56.350
and its growing audience
and amazing supporters.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.320
And I believe that
it is by being

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.840
in this difficult and
palpably dangerous

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.980
space that we will also
find love, tolerance,

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.580
and compassion--

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:13.060
the tolerance that I remember
from my childhood in Nigeria.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:17.740
We are all familiar with what
can happen when a leader uses

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:23.360
fear and false promise to stir
up the worst in the community.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.520
However, the resulting situation
presents an opportunity

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:34.030
to see clearly what lay latent,
and to embrace activism.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:38.650
This project has pushed
me to begin to think big--

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:42.220
to dream-- to fantasize.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.970
I imagine a room filled with
30 of the most influential

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.370
religious leaders in the world.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:51.430
I see that they are fully
committed to not leaving

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:55.270
the room until a viable
solution to the world's problem

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.730
of intolerance is resolved.

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:01.480
In the front row are five of
the most powerful Nigerian

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.170
evangelical pastors with
the largest congregations--

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:08.660
some with as many as
one million followers.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:12.960
I smile, for this is the
quickest way forward.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.920
I have started writing
and I shall make my film.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.220
It shall include a
heartfelt, honest story

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.740
of a typical Nigerian family.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.230
It may include this dream.

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:30.370
For the incredible opportunity
to work on this project,

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:35.990
I wish to thank the Radcliffe
Institute, the Associate Dean,

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:42.020
Judy Vichniac, Dean Liz Cohen,
and the entire Radcliffe team

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.090
with Rebecca and Sharon.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:48.200
I thank my nephew [INAUDIBLE],,
and my research assistants

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.150
Michelle, Liam, and Amanda.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:56.720
I thank Leonie Marinovich for
accommodating my last minute

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.840
request to edit this video.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.550
I thank the incredible HEARWORD!

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:05.930
Actresses-- Elvina Ibru,
Bimbo Akintola, Rita Edward,

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:09.000
and Odenike, and our
percussionist up there,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.670
[? McCann ?] Blessing--

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.180
all who illustrated a
portion of my writing today.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.670
I seriously thank my
sister [INAUDIBLE],,

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:19.850
who believes in almost
everything I do,

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:22.850
and I thank my wonderful
and patient husband, Tani,

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:24.200
and my four children--

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:28.280
Tayo, Daji, Aliya, and
[INAUDIBLE],, all of whom

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.610
are sacrificing my presence
in their lives to give me

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:34.100
this special time to create.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:38.080
I love you all and I
love my country, Nigeria.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.930
Thank you.
