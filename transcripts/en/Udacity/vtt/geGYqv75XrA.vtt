00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
Let's take a look at a few questions about complexity classes.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:10.410
Now I'd like you to look at these 3 statements and check which ones you think are true

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.770
and leave unchecked the ones you think are false.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.370
The first one is from a computational perspective, NP-complete problems

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.370
are the hardest ones out there.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:25.120
Second one is P=NP would imply that all NP-complete problems are solvable in practice.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.300
And finally, all NP-complete problems are solvable in polynomial time

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.530
on a nondeterministic RAM.

00:00:31.530 --> 99:59:59.000
Check whichever ones you think are true.
