00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:01.859
*sniff*
*sniff*

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:08.600
Oh yeah, there’s totally a bomb in there.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.349
Most people just assume we humans have a terrible
sense of smell.

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.280
But, that’s just wrong.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.240
Our sense of smell is super powerful, maybe
equal to dogs.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.630
Researchers at Rutgers are challenging the
idea that “dogs and rodents [are] some of

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.930
the best sniffers in the animal kingdom.”

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.150
They posit humans are right up there with
them.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.470
Throughout history, human smell has been consistently
downplayed.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.050
For example, you may have heard humans can
smell 10,000 scents…

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.140
Which is so wrong.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.350
10,000 is a rough estimate gleaned from experiments
done in 1927 with 6,561 scents (they rounded

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.500
up to 10,000)!

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.870
It was a guess and wasn’t even empirically
tested.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.149
Smell is difficult to quantify… unlike the
three colors of light, or specific wavelengths

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.550
of sound, smell doesn’t have a concrete
base to start and experiment with -- every

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.230
nose is different!

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.040
Things like humidity, shape, size, age, and
even language, individual experience, and

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.820
behaviors can all mess with nose sensitivity.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.080
So, scientists run test after test and determine
the odor detection thresholds -- measured

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.860
in parts per million.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.610
1ppm is one odor molecule in one million!

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.820
Drinking alcohol’s ODT (it’s actually
ethanol) is 10.0ppm, which is pretty high,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.790
with some things we can smell way less than
that!

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.630
For example, studies found humans can detect
as little as zero point zero four parts per

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.760
million of ammonia.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.439
That’s equivalent to dropping a shot glass
of ammonia in an olympic swimming pool...

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:43.210
Knowing 10,000 scents is way wrong, in 2014,
scientists ran a new set of studies and found

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.180
average humans can discern One Trillion scents.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.031
They did this by mixing 128 different scents
in groups, and then used math to find what

00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:56.530
they believe is the “lower limit” of our
sense of smell.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.170
To go back to sight and sound…

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.431
We know we can I.D. several million colors
and half-a-million tones, this means smell

00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:04.350
is more sensitive than both.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.119
Okay, bringing it back to dogs.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.160
It seems to me, we use dogs to sniff things
not necessarily because they’re the best

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.240
at sniff, but because they’re easier to
train to be sniffers…

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.760
According to the book Canine Ergonomics: The
Science of Working Dogs, dogs can’t easily

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.819
distinguish between the explosive C4, and
other concentrations of the main chemical

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.790
in it cyclbohexanone, but humans -- we can!

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.640
It smells like acetone and peppermint and
tests show our bottom odor threshold is zero

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.430
point 88 ppm!

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.940
Like two and a half soda cans in a swimming
pool.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.230
Plus, humans could talk it out.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.340
We could say, hey, I think I’m getting something
here… dogs can’t do that.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.349
Another study found, with the right training
we humble humans can track a scent through

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.280
a grassy field, while blindfolded!

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.201
They tested human’s ability to track a scent
and found not only could we do it, but their

00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:59.340
humans got better with practice and training.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.790
Which brings us back, again, to canines vs
humans.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.849
These researchers are saying we should stop
thinking canines better at smelling than we

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:07.849
are.

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.610
But why do we use them then?

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.500
Because we can train them more easily!

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.940
Slate reports, a 10-week training program
exposes dogs to explosive compounds “up

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.459
to 120 times a day, in amounts ranging from
1,000 pounds to 1 gram.”

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.580
Using behavioral training, when the dog identifies
the explosive amongst a bunch of other compounds

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.580
they get a treat.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.959
Over weeks and weeks, the dog is trained to
smell a compound, and on repeated training

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.190
they can learn around a dozen smells.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.569
You could do this with humans, but who would
want that job?

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.920
Obviously, more research is needed on smell.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.250
But if you walk away from this video I hope
you realize your sense of smell is on par

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.040
with other mammals -- which is to say… it’s
incredible.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.040
Are you smelling what I’m cooking?

But if smell is so powerful, could we smell
space?

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.140
What would space smell like?

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.869
Julian hit up the YouTube space in LA without
his glasses or beard for some reason to find

00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:19.089
out, here.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:20.159
Are you convinced?

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:24.689
