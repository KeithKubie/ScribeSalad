JEFF DUSEK: My
name is Jeff Dusek.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.320
I am a course two
Ph.D. candidate.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.200
My involvement in the class is
I'm actually a mentor for two

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.450
of the student project teams.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.760
So Sruthi is on one of the
teams-- team Beverly Ann.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.420
I also worked with team Art.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.650
And I took this course
last year and found it

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.560
to be an incredible experience.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.490
I have an interest in
assistive technology

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.410
that stems from
a grandmother who

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.140
was in a wheelchair growing up.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.950
And when I was
asked to be involved

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.620
in the course this
year, I was really

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.100
excited to be involved again
and in a mentor capacity

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.750
was really a great
privilege in my opinion.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.110
SRUTHI NURAYANAN: My
name is Sruthi Nurayanan.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.660
I'm course six
two, which is ECS.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.100
And in this class
this year, I was

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.700
working with Beverly Ann
on a grip sensor that

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.250
would help her detect when
her grip was slipping when she

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.541
was picking up certain objects.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.620
So I was interested in building
some sort of technology that

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.550
would actually go to
someone and help them.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.000
I hadn't really done
that before in a class.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.330
And this class was, I guess,
pretty well advertised.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.780
And I was interested in sort of
going forth and just building

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.720
something, even if it
was just for one person.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.156
And so that's why I
decided to take it.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.560
In terms of how my
expectations for the class

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.434
actually correlated with
what the class was like,

00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:40.850
I think that in
some circumstances

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.850
it really did end up
being what I expected.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.390
I got to build something,
which is really exciting.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.079
I learned a lot about
circuitry and fields

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.620
I'd never known
anything about before

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.560
but was really interested in.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.440
And all of that
was really what I

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.290
wanted to get out of the class,
as well as the joy from being

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.010
able to make someone something
that they're going to use

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.030
and that will help them.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.770
And so that made
me really happy.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.940
What I didn't think I would
get out of this class--

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.315
but I was surprised
to-- was sort

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:12.050
of the able to interact with
people with disabilities

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.020
and understand how they
interact with the world

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.090
and how assistive technology
can really help someone,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.400
even if it's just
in a very small way.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.380
So I learned a lot about that.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.662
And I'm glad I took
the class for it.

00:02:25.662 --> 00:02:26.370
JEFF DUSEK: Yeah.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.950
So as far as my
expectations for the course,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.640
one thing I really realized
taking this last year

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.680
is that this class and design--
and iterative design in general

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.210
really force you to
learn skill sets that

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.210
might not be something
that you come in with.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.360
So last year we worked on
kind of a robotic arm project.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.900
I'm a mechanical engineer.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.910
And so some of the
electronics and the coding

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.780
were not really in my
wheel house, if you will.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.400
So this year I was kind of the
mech-E person of the staff.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.300
So what I was hoping was to
be able to help teams that

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.450
needed a little bit more
mechanical design, who maybe

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.220
come from backgrounds in
electrical engineering

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.811
or computer science and stuff,
that might not have that skill

00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:12.310
set.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.470
And I think maybe
we pulled that off--

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.410
would say you have to hear
from the teams about that one.

00:03:22.775 --> 00:03:24.150
SRUTHI NURAYANAN:
So when we have

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.560
to collaborate with
our client, a lot of it

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.490
was just figuring out what
would help her out the most.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.310
Because she came and
told us immediately.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.940
She was, like, I
have this disease.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.140
And I have bad
grip because of it.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.787
And so we had to spend a
long time thinking about, OK,

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:42.620
what does that mean?

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.590
What parts of her hand
does she grip with?

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.080
When does her grip slip?

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.770
Why does it slip?

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.960
What can we do to
prevent it from slipping?

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.850
What device could we
even possibly make?

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.230
And so a lot of
the time was just

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.650
spent with her talking with
her about her experiences

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.650
with her disease and sort of
figuring out very, very slowly

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.920
what would actually help her.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.965
And then once we were
able to get to that point,

00:04:09.965 --> 00:04:11.340
it sort of snowballed
from there.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.330
We were, like, OK.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.600
We actually know what
the problem is now.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.782
So we can make this device.

00:04:15.782 --> 00:04:17.490
And then it was just
build, build, build.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.073
And then we got it
done and it worked.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.880
So for other students
or engineers who

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.770
want to collaborate with
clients with disabilities,

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.470
I think that it's a really
valuable experience,

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.220
and you should
definitely go for it.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.070
I learned a lot and was
able to help someone.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.830
And I think that in itself
made me really happy.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.390
But in terms of things
to keep in mind,

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.890
the client comes first.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.990
And you have to always
remember that you

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.110
are solving their
problem, not what

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.770
you think their problem is.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.610
And we had to spend
a really long time

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.250
actually getting to the
root of her problem, which

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.490
is why I think in the
end our product worked.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.860
So definitely listen
to the client.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.300
Try to get as much
critical feedback from them

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.310
as possible, even though
sometimes that's hard.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.040
Because they're just happy
that you're there helping them,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.870
even if you're not making
them the best thing that

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.890
you possibly could.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.360
And so definitely
listen to your client

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.570
would be the advice
I would give.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.120
So I think the group
work went really well.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.730
We were able to split it pretty
nicely into different sections

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.225
of work.

00:05:29.225 --> 00:05:31.100
In the beginning we were
all pretty much just

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.510
talking with Beverly Ann
a lot about her disease

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.890
and her problem.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.130
But once we were able
to analyze the problem,

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.560
we were able to pick
up niches of the design

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.710
that we were able to
split up pretty evenly

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.150
and work on and then
combine in the end.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.470
I think definitely figuring out
how to split the work evenly

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.560
is the hardest part.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.976
But once we were able to do
that, it went really smoothly.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.590
I would say for our team
in particular, none of us

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.470
had any circuitry
experience coming in.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.080
And we were making
a device that was

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.670
going to stay on
her at all times,

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.020
and it definitely required
a lot of circuitry.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.420
So the biggest problem
was just figuring out

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.330
what kind of technology we
even had available to use

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.760
and how we could use
that to our advantage,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.750
learning about how
circuits worked,

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.370
even at like a very basic level.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.690
All of that was just
so foreign to us.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.270
And so that was definitely
the hardest part to get past.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.250
JEFF DUSEK: Yeah,
so as a mentor I

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.140
might have a slightly
different perspective

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.520
on the teaching of the course.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.060
And I think a few things
are really important.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.257
I would say as far as design
and design for our client,

00:06:46.257 --> 00:06:47.340
there's really two things.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.550
I would say that
making sure that you

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.390
have a really good
contextual inquiry--

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.000
so really understand your client
and understand the problem.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.345
I think that's one thing
that this course does

00:06:59.345 --> 00:07:01.470
that's a little different
from most design courses.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.487
You're designing
for a single person.

00:07:04.487 --> 00:07:06.570
And so you really get to
interact with that person

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.950
and understand them and
understand their problem.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.810
And it's really
important to do that.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.310
And that's kind of the starting
point for everything you do.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.250
And so you really need to
get that contextual inquiry.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.660
And the second thing that I
learned taking the course,

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.730
but then also working
with the teams this year,

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.610
is just the value
of iterative design

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.060
and prototypes-- no
matter what fidelity they

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.610
are, so even paper things
or cardboard things.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.310
Sruthi's team with
Beverly Ann-- they

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.800
worked with a grip project.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.690
And so they used things
like putty to kind of map

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.360
where the hand grips in
particular and those sort

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:42.984
of things.

00:07:42.984 --> 00:07:44.900
And I think that's really
valuable-- is making

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.640
use of even kind of
non-technical prototyping

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.550
but to really better
understand the design space.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.290
SRUTHI NURAYANAN: For the
professors and educators

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.830
for this course who are going
to teach it in the future,

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.500
I think that the thing most
important for them to remember

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.230
is that I think the students
all have really good intentions

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.210
but don't necessarily
know how to act on them.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.175
Like in our case, we
were just really lost

00:08:09.175 --> 00:08:10.550
with some of the
electrical stuff

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.677
until we were able
to find resources

00:08:12.677 --> 00:08:13.760
that were able to help us.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.490
And so I think the one thing
they need to keep in mind

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:21.330
is that we definitely are very
lost in some of the things

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.780
we have to learn how to do.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.930
And so obtaining as many
resources as possible

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.180
is very useful for
us down the road.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.290
So for example, in
our case, we were

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.110
able to use the
Cypress Engineering

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:37.159
Lab, which has a lot of
resources for electrical device

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:37.960
development.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.130
But we didn't know about
it until mid November.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.140
So until then we were
sort of floundering.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.530
And eventually we were
able to get into the lab

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.031
and get a lot of work done,
but knowing that earlier

00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:48.030
would have been helpful.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.363
And so just find and exploit
all the resources you can get,

00:08:51.363 --> 00:08:52.863
because they all
pay off in the end.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.070
Take this class.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.060
I really, really enjoyed it.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.680
It's something that I
haven't gotten out of a class

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.021
before, because this
actually went to someone.

00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:09.270
It wasn't just something
that I built and then dropped

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.270
at the end of the class.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.790
It is actually going
to help someone live

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.270
their life in a better way.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.750
And that's just
incredibly rewarding.
