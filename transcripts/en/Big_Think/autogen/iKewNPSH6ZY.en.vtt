in science fiction sense but I remind us

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
in science fiction sense but I remind us
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.280
in science fiction sense but I remind us
that if we can build a computer smart

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
that if we can build a computer smart
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.930

they don't even have electricity or

clean running water so while we're

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150
clean running water so while we're
 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.300

hope we also take the bigger picture

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950
hope we also take the bigger picture
 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.410

without electricity and so we still

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229
without electricity and so we still
 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.800
without electricity and so we still
don't have anything but really primitive

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810

look forward to the day when everybody

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
look forward to the day when everybody
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.539
look forward to the day when everybody
has clean water and quality electrical

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549
has clean water and quality electrical
 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.640

over supply of quality electricity and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
over supply of quality electricity and
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.980
over supply of quality electricity and
then we can take these meetings about

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
then we can take these meetings about
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.810
then we can take these meetings about
the problems of artificial intelligence

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
the problems of artificial intelligence
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.890

however are there any viewers listeners

so keep in mind that if we unplug the

or the sewer system valves the thing
 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.330

will stop that we still control

electricity so this apocalyptic view of

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150
electricity so this apocalyptic view of
