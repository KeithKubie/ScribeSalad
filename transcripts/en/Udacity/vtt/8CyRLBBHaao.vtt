00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.310
The answer is, purchase tickets. The reason for

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.939
this, is that when you purchase tickets, you probably

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.580
want to immediately see the confirmation that you are

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.720
registered. To guarantee this, we need to have strong

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.200
consistency. And in order to have the term strong

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.017
consistency, we need to establish an ancestor relationship. The

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:22.150
other two, add social components and conference venus. Are

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.860
probably not so sensitive to be up to date.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.110
So there may not be, any need for strong consistency.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.480
So eventual consistency is probably a better choice for those.
