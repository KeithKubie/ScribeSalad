00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.850
Some questions in the practice
section and then later on in the topic

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.025
assessment will require Mathquill,
our equation editor.

00:00:07.025 --> 00:00:11.150
Mathquill can be used to type
the less than or equal to sign and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.610
the greater than or equal to sign.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.170
Your keeper probably has regular
less than and greater than signs,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.930
but not less than or equal to or
greater than or equal to signs.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.320
To type these signs using Mathquill
type a backslash and then

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.030
le for less than or equal to,
and then a space, or

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.252
backslash ge for greater than or
equal to, followed by a space.

00:00:38.252 --> 00:00:42.510
Backslash is not the same
thing as a forward slash.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.710
This is your backslash key.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.740
This is your forward slash key.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.850
This is the one that you want to hit.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:56.714
So to type a less than or equal to sign
you would hit backslash, L, E, space.

00:00:56.714 --> 00:00:58.210
Try it.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.820
Try also writing these inequalities.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.850
Don't forget to hit
the space bar at the end.
