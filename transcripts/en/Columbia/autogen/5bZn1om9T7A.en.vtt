00:22:43.059 --> 00:22:45.810 align:start position:0%
for in sexual acts on them and the

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:45.820 align:start position:0%
participants the peer educators had to
 

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.299 align:start position:0%
participants the peer educators had to
decide<00:22:46.210><c> what</c><00:22:46.749><c> risk</c><00:22:47.049><c> level</c><00:22:47.499><c> they</c><00:22:47.620><c> fell</c><00:22:47.860><c> under</c>

00:22:48.299 --> 00:22:48.309 align:start position:0%
decide what risk level they fell under
 

00:22:48.309 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
decide what risk level they fell under
so<00:22:48.940><c> if</c><00:22:49.389><c> something</c><00:22:50.169><c> was</c><00:22:50.440><c> not</c><00:22:50.799><c> at</c><00:22:51.009><c> all</c><00:22:51.159><c> risky</c><00:22:51.700><c> you</c>

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:52.090 align:start position:0%
so if something was not at all risky you
 

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:55.169 align:start position:0%
so if something was not at all risky you
want<00:22:52.269><c> a</c><00:22:52.330><c> super</c><00:22:52.509><c> cool</c><00:22:53.019><c> okay</c><00:22:53.499><c> sure</c><00:22:53.789><c> no</c><00:22:54.789><c> it</c><00:22:54.909><c> did</c><00:22:55.059><c> to</c>

00:22:55.169 --> 00:22:55.179 align:start position:0%
want a super cool okay sure no it did to
 

00:22:55.179 --> 00:22:56.999 align:start position:0%
want a super cool okay sure no it did to
pay<00:22:55.299><c> i</c><00:22:55.330><c> can</c><00:22:55.509><c> use</c><00:22:55.629><c> this</c><00:22:55.659><c> so</c><00:22:56.470><c> if</c><00:22:56.769><c> something</c>

00:22:56.999 --> 00:22:57.009 align:start position:0%
pay i can use this so if something
 

00:22:57.009 --> 00:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
pay i can use this so if something
wasn't<00:22:57.460><c> risky</c><00:22:58.029><c> than</c><00:22:58.330><c> it</c><00:22:58.509><c> was</c><00:22:58.659><c> green</c><00:22:59.169><c> light</c><00:22:59.470><c> go</c>

00:22:59.820 --> 00:22:59.830 align:start position:0%
wasn't risky than it was green light go
