00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:12.679
Hi. You must be Liam.

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.815
Hey buddy, how are you
feeling today?

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:22.288
I'm feeling fine Dr. Gupta.
Just fine.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.526
This is Marion Glass and she's
from the Make a Wish Foundation.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.862
Marion Glass.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.698
How are you feeling today Liam?

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.901
I'm fine, Marion Glass.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.169
Good.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:39.272
Well I have some news that might
make you feel a little better.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:43.142
We at the Make A Wish Foundation
make dreams come true

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:47.414
for little boys and little girls
who are very sick just like you.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.051
There are no children like me,
Marion Glass.

00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:53.619
Oh no, of course not.

00:00:53.652 --> 00:00:56.255
Of course not.
You're one of a kind.

00:00:56.288 --> 00:00:58.191
But we're going to make
any dream come true,

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.593
that you could ever have.
Okay?

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:01.894
Anything?

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:03.763
That's right, buddy.
That's right.

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:07.033
Would you like to play with
your favorite basketball team?

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.768
Oh!

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.138
What about be Superman
for a day?

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.608
I wish to drown a man.

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:21.447
What?

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.452
To drown a man in the bathtub,
to hold him down

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:29.823
while the last breath
escapes his body,

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:35.294
and then bathe in that water,
all the while signing la,

00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:38.832
la, la,
la, la, la.

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:42.936
Liam!

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:45.138
You said anything.

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:49.542
Well, surely we don't want
to hurt other people.

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:53.579
Now do we, kiddo?
Anything else?

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:56.783
Fly in a hot air balloon
or meet a celebrity?

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.921
My new wish is to lean over
the body of a dying man

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:05.892
and put my lips on his,
stealing his last breath.

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:08.961
Liam!

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:10.496
No one will get hurt.

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:14.200
No, absolutely not.
I don't even know where you're-

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:19.105
I wish to take all the
prosthetic legs in the hospital

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:24.911
and bind them together
with the dried flesh of the dead

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:29.749
into a webbed, massive creature.

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:34.887
Liam! I am so sorry, Miss Glass.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.623
It's all right. He doesn't
know what he's saying.

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:39.258
I wish to pee in your mouth.

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:40.993
What?
Both of you.

00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:42.228
Mine?

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:43.462
Especially you.

00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:44.730
Oh.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:46.766
I wish to pee in both
of your mouths

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.368
as I stand over you.

00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:51.837
I'll need a glass of water
and 10 minutes.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.139
Enough you little [bleep]!

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:54.607
Dr. Gupta!

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.578
No! You're reprehensible.
You are evil.

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:01.314
You are a devil child!

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:06.219
Dr. Gupta, he's not a devil
child, he's just a child!

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:08.421
You have no business
working in a pediatric ward.

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.489
What?
I'm going to report you!

00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:18.665
Shame on you, Gupta.

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:27.140
Shame on you, Gupta.
You really upset Marion Glass.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:34.880
This is insane.
You've made me question

00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:36.816
everything that
I've ever believed

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.087
about the essential goodness of
children.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.857
Wish granted...

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:52.999
[flat line]

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:06.846
I am dying though.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.010
Brothers and sisters,

00:04:41.013 --> 00:04:44.617
tonight the newest member
of our family

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.352
will feast for the first time.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.861
Ofelia, bring the new blood.

00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:12.178
Ah, brother Tyrell, welcome to
the first night of your new ...

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:13.913
And what are we wearing here?

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:16.916
I'm just wearing
what I got bit in.

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.651
Mm-hmm.

00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:22.655
Okay, do you have anything
black or like pants

00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:24.390
with laces up
the side of the leg?

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:27.927
just so you can
still see the skin.

00:05:30.195 --> 00:05:32.932
Oh no, that's not my style
so I ain't got none of that

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.667
in my closet
or nothing like that.

00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:43.142
Okay. Anyway, we will
tonight all feast.

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:02.428
Come on, man.

00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:04.230
Excuse me?

00:06:04.263 --> 00:06:06.031
I'm just saying,
you're over here licking

00:06:06.064 --> 00:06:07.433
and hissing and whatnot.

00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:08.868
If we're going to eat,
then let's eat.

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:10.603
Damn!

00:06:12.137 --> 00:06:15.441
Yes. Of course,
we will all feed.

00:06:16.408 --> 00:06:18.111
That's enough.

00:06:20.312 --> 00:06:22.014
Spread the meat.

00:06:26.752 --> 00:06:28.454
Okay.

00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:44.036
Did any of that
actually get in your mouth?

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:47.106
[crosstalk], no wonder
y'all is hungry all the time.

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:51.710
See and, uh uh, uh uh,
no, no, no, no.

00:06:51.743 --> 00:06:54.213
See, like why y'all got to hiss
when you're flashing your fangs?

00:06:54.246 --> 00:06:55.714
You know you can make
your teeth come out

00:06:55.747 --> 00:06:57.750
with y'all doing
all that nonsense. See.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.455
And can you two get a room?

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:03.923
Seriously, y'all live
in a damn mansion.

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:05.424
There got to be some other place
you can do that

00:07:05.457 --> 00:07:06.659
[inaudible].

00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:08.427
I mean are you two
even lesbians?

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.628
I just don't understand

00:07:09.661 --> 00:07:11.664
why everything got to be
all sexual and licky.

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:12.932
Girl, seriously man,

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:14.266
you got to get your hands
up off me for before I

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:16.335
[inaudible] you up.
[inaudible] is nasty.

00:07:16.368 --> 00:07:18.037
Creepy as
[inaudible].

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.405
Been touching my nipple
for 15 minutes.

00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:21.474
All this [inaudible]
that y'all is doing up in here,

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:23.209
this is just like
straight up gratuitous.

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:24.477
I got bit on purpose

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.146
so I could live forever
and see future cars.

00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:29.849
Yeah, Cyrus, these pants
are uncomfortable.

00:07:30.415 --> 00:07:32.618
And I actually have a boyfriend.

00:07:33.185 --> 00:07:35.120
And this song has been playing
for like two years,

00:07:35.153 --> 00:07:36.856
and it sucks.

00:07:37.756 --> 00:07:40.293
This just seems desperate.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.129
Okay. Desperate?
Really, Tristan?

00:07:43.862 --> 00:07:45.197
It's Christian.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.398
Really?

00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:47.700
His name ain't even Tristan.

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:49.368
So do you all feel this way
?

00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:50.636
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:51.871
Kinda.
Yeah.

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:53.606
Yeah.

00:07:55.774 --> 00:08:00.112
Wow! It's like you can't even
get good friends.

00:08:00.145 --> 00:08:01.480
No, you're not even ...

00:08:01.513 --> 00:08:03.015
Okay, and you're leaving now.
That's ...

00:08:03.048 --> 00:08:04.316
I mean you know what though,

00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:06.752
seriously, like you could
fix this place up.

00:08:06.785 --> 00:08:08.420
It'd be dope though, for real.

00:08:08.453 --> 00:08:10.222
Are cars going to be able to fly

00:08:10.255 --> 00:08:12.958
or is everything going to be
on a magnetic track?

00:08:12.991 --> 00:08:14.727
I mean that's what I want
to know. It's no big deal.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.662
This O-negative tastes
like pennies.

00:08:16.695 --> 00:08:19.265
Oh, I'm sorry about ...
Hey, hey! Come on now.

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:20.566
Nipple play is for private time.

00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:22.535
We talked about this like
20 minutes ago girl.

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:24.303
[crosstalk 00:08:21]
is just a dream.

00:08:24.336 --> 00:08:26.405
And when we wake up,
we dream about cars.

00:08:26.438 --> 00:08:28.841
This is such bull
bleep] you guys.

00:08:30.542 --> 00:08:33.712
Roommate meeting!
Roommate meeting!

00:08:33.745 --> 00:08:36.482
Gogo, what the hell?
I've got a hangover!

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:37.883
I don't give a
[bleep]

00:08:37.916 --> 00:08:40.386
about your hangover, okay
Brendan?

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:44.824
I want a roommate meeting,
and I want it now. Okay.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.560
Now somebody's been taking
[bleep]

00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:50.162
out of the refrigerator
and throwing in on the ground,

00:08:50.195 --> 00:08:51.931
and it's pissing me off.

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:54.066
Is this another one
of your stupid pranks, Jonald?

00:08:54.099 --> 00:08:56.769
No. And your pranks are stupid.

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:58.538
Is it you Monday?
What?

00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:01.473
Is said somebody's been taking
[bleep]

00:09:01.506 --> 00:09:03.075
out of the fridge
and throwing it on the

00:09:03.108 --> 00:09:04.310
[bleep] ground.

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:06.612
And I want to know who it is
because it's not funny!

00:09:06.645 --> 00:09:07.880
Well what I want to know

00:09:07.913 --> 00:09:10.382
is who keeps pulling
the sheets off my bed

00:09:10.415 --> 00:09:12.551
and hanging them
from the ceiling fan at night?

00:09:12.584 --> 00:09:13.886
Was that you, Monday?

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:15.120
What?

00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:18.157
Have you been taking everybody's
sheets off them in the night

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.225
and hanging them
from the ceiling fans?

00:09:20.258 --> 00:09:21.493
What? No.

00:09:21.526 --> 00:09:24.196
Well, clearly someone's
been doing that?

00:09:25.263 --> 00:09:27.199
Whoa! Who did that?

00:09:27.232 --> 00:09:30.102
Yeah, who the
[bleep] did that?

00:09:30.135 --> 00:09:32.037
Which one of you
just threw that bottle?

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.173
What are we even talking
about right now?

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:36.909
Did you [bleep]
throw that bottle Jonald?

00:09:36.942 --> 00:09:40.412
No, Gogo. [bleep]
you! I didn't throw it.

00:09:40.445 --> 00:09:42.247
Well did you
[bleep]

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.782
throw that bottle,
Brendan?

00:09:43.815 --> 00:09:46.485
Yeah! You would do that Brendan.

00:09:46.518 --> 00:09:49.455
Throw? No!
I didn't throw the bottle!

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:50.923
Well somebody threw that

00:09:50.956 --> 00:09:52.424
[bleep]
bottle,

00:09:52.457 --> 00:09:55.060
and you're the one who drew
dicks on everyone's forehead!

00:09:55.093 --> 00:09:56.795
Yeah! You did do that!

00:09:56.828 --> 00:10:00.766
But dicks are hilarious though!
This is just destructive.

00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:03.802
What about you, Monday?
Did you throw that bottle?

00:10:03.835 --> 00:10:05.104
What bottle?

00:10:05.137 --> 00:10:07.440
The [bleep]
bottle, dude!

00:10:07.973 --> 00:10:11.010
It just smashed against the wall
and you even said some

00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:12.344
[bleep]
about it!

00:10:12.377 --> 00:10:14.146
Well I didn't throw the bottle.

00:10:14.179 --> 00:10:16.649
Well obviously it wasn't Ping.

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:19.251
He's got the best grades
in the house.

00:10:23.088 --> 00:10:27.159
Good point, Ping. Come on, guys!
Let's cool with the profanity.

00:10:27.192 --> 00:10:29.328
You know
Ping's very religious.

00:10:29.928 --> 00:10:32.632
Come on!

00:10:43.341 --> 00:10:44.142
All right, listen up.

00:10:44.175 --> 00:10:45.377
The sheriff's department
is close by.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.645
We'll be safe there.

00:10:46.678 --> 00:10:47.813
Okay.

00:10:47.846 --> 00:10:49.982
Stay close.
I'll get you outta here.

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:54.253
Ahhh! Ahhh!

00:10:58.323 --> 00:11:03.128
Oh my god, they got Brad!
They got Brad! They got Brad!

00:11:03.161 --> 00:11:04.730
They didn't get us!
They didn't get us.

00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:05.964
Okay? We're still alive.

00:11:07.232 --> 00:11:08.600
All right, keep it together.
Yeah, okay.

00:11:08.633 --> 00:11:11.103
We've got to make it
to that sheriff's station.

00:11:11.136 --> 00:11:12.504
Okay.

00:11:12.537 --> 00:11:18.210
Oh my god.

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:30.322
We got to go through them.

00:11:30.355 --> 00:11:33.859
Just stay together, keep moving,
and don't get bit. Go!

00:11:45.537 --> 00:11:46.772
Are you getting this?

00:11:46.805 --> 00:11:47.973
Yeah, what is up?

00:11:48.006 --> 00:11:50.843
All right, let's go. Let's go.

00:11:52.277 --> 00:11:59.085
This is crazy.
What?

00:12:00.085 --> 00:12:01.286
Um ...

00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:06.025
Ain't that some
[bleep]?

00:12:06.558 --> 00:12:09.595
These are some racist mother
[bleep] zombies.

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:11.130
Why would you
even lock the door?

00:12:11.163 --> 00:12:12.431
I mean the window's
broken and ...

00:12:12.464 --> 00:12:14.533
Ah, oh!

00:12:14.566 --> 00:12:15.834
Oh, hell no.
That's ...

00:12:15.867 --> 00:12:17.570
No, no, no.

00:12:20.438 --> 00:12:21.673
Oh, come on!

00:12:21.706 --> 00:12:22.875
What is that?

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:24.309
They seriously wouldn't
let her eat us.

00:12:24.342 --> 00:12:25.511
That's ...

00:12:25.544 --> 00:12:29.314
Hey guys! Isn't this great?
These racist

00:12:29.347 --> 00:12:32.351
zombies are leaving us alone.
Come on, we're having a party.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:42.227
The beer is here.
And look who I brought.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:47.867
Come on

00:12:58.643 --> 00:13:00.346
man.
