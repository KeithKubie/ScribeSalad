00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.310
There are many approaches to software design.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.670
Some espouse a particular point of view as to how best to structure a system,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.820
such as object orientated design. Some of them are intended for

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.980
a particular class of application. That is the design of real time systems. And

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.730
some of them are structured to deal with only a part of an application,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.850
such as user interface design. All approaches to design however,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.420
include three aspects that may be compared, the design method,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.350
the design representation, and how that design is going to be validated.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.250
Let's first look at design method. A method is a systematic series of steps by

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.210
which you undertake to do your design and solve your problem. Typically,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.100
a design method suggests a particular way of viewing the problem. With object

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.840
oriented design, we view the problem in terms of a set of cooperating objects.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.880
Only later do we assign the services or functions that each of

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.980
those objects are going to be able to provide to the system. Other methods that

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.900
we may be mentioning during the course of the term include structure design, and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.020
role based design. The design method that is chosen acts as the discipline for

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.965
the participants, the designers and ultimately the implementers,

00:01:19.965 --> 00:01:25.429
forcing them how to organize their thoughts and and activities in certain ways.
