00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome back to the debugging course.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In the past units we have discussed how to reproduce bugs,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
how to track their origins, how to simplify them,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and how to find the defect that causes a failure.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Today we will consider the management side of bugs.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
There is how to track bugs,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
how to organize the debugging process,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
how to make sure that bugs don't reappear,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and how to find for a project where and why bugs occur.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And again, this scans with a dose of automation.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So we look and build tools that help us automate these things.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But first a little story from the trenches.
