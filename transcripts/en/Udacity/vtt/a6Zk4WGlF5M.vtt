00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.956
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So you've now seen these two equations that look pretty similar to one

00:00:03.956 --> 00:00:08.538
another several times. We have y equals Ax squared plus Bx plus C. And we have 0

00:00:08.538 --> 00:00:12.879
equals Ax squared plus Bx plus C. What I want to do with this quiz is make sure

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.512
that we understand the difference between the two of these equations. When do we

00:00:17.512 --> 00:00:21.343
use each one, and what purpose do they each serve? So I've given you some

00:00:21.343 --> 00:00:25.342
different options over here, four different options. And each one of these

00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:29.298
describes either this equation or this equation. So for each of these four

00:00:29.298 --> 00:00:33.538
things, please pick the equation that it describes. Which one of these graphs a

00:00:33.538 --> 00:00:37.828
parabola? Which one finds the x-coordinates of the x-intercepts of a parabola?

00:00:37.828 --> 00:00:42.677
Which one relates y to x? And which one can be solved? Please pick the equation

00:00:42.677 --> 00:00:45.347
for each that best fits this description.
