the great expense you would have to have
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.609
the great expense you would have to have
a lander then you'd have some kind have

water and so the surface of Europa is

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650
water and so the surface of Europa is
 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.800
water and so the surface of Europa is
frozen it's a crust of ice water ice but

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810
frozen it's a crust of ice water ice but
 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.480
frozen it's a crust of ice water ice but
below it is liquid water and it's kept

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
below it is liquid water and it's kept
 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.200
below it is liquid water and it's kept
liquid by the gravitational or what we

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210

this massive Jupiter Europa's orbital
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.429
this massive Jupiter Europa's orbital
period is 85 hours and I got to tell you

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
period is 85 hours and I got to tell you
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.139
period is 85 hours and I got to tell you
I mean imagine the moon going around the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
I mean imagine the moon going around the
 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.999
I mean imagine the moon going around the
earth every two days every three days

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
earth every two days every three days
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.679

instead of a month you'd have a three

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
instead of a month you'd have a three
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.479
instead of a month you'd have a three
day period it would be really short a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
day period it would be really short a
 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.619
day period it would be really short a
short month and so if this keeps like

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629
short month and so if this keeps like
 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.730
short month and so if this keeps like

keeps your opal warm so there's seawater
 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.110
keeps your opal warm so there's seawater
so it's people who have looked at what

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
so it's people who have looked at what
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.390
so it's people who have looked at what
it takes to be a living thing which

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400
it takes to be a living thing which
 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.220
it takes to be a living thing which
nowadays these people nowadays call

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230
nowadays these people nowadays call
 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.010
nowadays these people nowadays call
themselves we like to call ourselves

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020

itself astrobiology and astrobiologists

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320
itself astrobiology and astrobiologists
 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.960

have thought deeply about what it takes

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
have thought deeply about what it takes
 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.600
have thought deeply about what it takes
to be a living thing you've got to have

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610
to be a living thing you've got to have
 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.690
to be a living thing you've got to have
a membrane or a wall something that

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700
a membrane or a wall something that
 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.330
a membrane or a wall something that
separates you from what's not you and

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340
separates you from what's not you and
 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.400
separates you from what's not you and
you probably have to have a liquid a

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410
you probably have to have a liquid a
 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.340
you probably have to have a liquid a
solvent and the best solvent anybody can

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350
solvent and the best solvent anybody can
 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.280
solvent and the best solvent anybody can
come up with is water so with the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290
come up with is water so with the
 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.590
come up with is water so with the
gravitational action and the frozen icy

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600

crust Europa shoots geysers of water out
 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.930
crust Europa shoots geysers of water out
into space all the time so now it will

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940
into space all the time so now it will
 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.060
into space all the time so now it will
be possible instead of landing there and

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070
be possible instead of landing there and
 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.190
be possible instead of landing there and
building some exotic drill and declaring

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200
building some exotic drill and declaring
 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.780
building some exotic drill and declaring
the whole mission way too expensive to

the whole mission way too expensive to
 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.540
the whole mission way too expensive to
ever do you would build a much more

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550
ever do you would build a much more
 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.280
ever do you would build a much more

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290
modest spacecraft that would have to go
 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.660
modest spacecraft that would have to go
the extraordinary distance out to

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670
the extraordinary distance out to
 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.760
the extraordinary distance out to
Jupiter and get an orbit out there

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770
Jupiter and get an orbit out there
 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.900
Jupiter and get an orbit out there
around Europa but you would have it fly

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910
around Europa but you would have it fly
 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.720
around Europa but you would have it fly
through the geysers actually the orbit

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730
through the geysers actually the orbit
 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.760
through the geysers actually the orbit
be around Jupiter have it fly through

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770
be around Jupiter have it fly through
 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.630
be around Jupiter have it fly through
the geysers and like looking at bugs on

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640
the geysers and like looking at bugs on
 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.550
the geysers and like looking at bugs on
the windshield I mean it would be

the windshield I mean it would be
 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.830
the windshield I mean it would be
extraordinary if there are living things

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840
extraordinary if there are living things
 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.170
extraordinary if there are living things
there it would be a great it would be a

there it would be a great it would be a
 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.800
there it would be a great it would be a
worthy thing we may discover life now

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810
