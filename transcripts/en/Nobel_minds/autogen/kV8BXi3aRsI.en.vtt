passing it down the column a second time
 

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.810
passing it down the column a second time
we can enrich it a further thousandfold

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:14.820
we can enrich it a further thousandfold
 

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.399
we can enrich it a further thousandfold
which means we've got a millionfold

00:21:16.399 --> 00:21:16.409
which means we've got a millionfold
 

00:21:16.409 --> 00:21:18.919
which means we've got a millionfold
enrichment over two rounds of selection

00:21:18.919 --> 00:21:18.929
enrichment over two rounds of selection
 

00:21:18.929 --> 00:21:22.250
enrichment over two rounds of selection
and in principle using three rounds of

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.260
and in principle using three rounds of
 

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.899
and in principle using three rounds of
selection you could get a billion-fold

00:21:23.899 --> 00:21:23.909
selection you could get a billion-fold
 

00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:25.310

then you could go up to George's

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320
then you could go up to George's
 

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.960
then you could go up to George's
gazillion if you just increase the

pleased really that these folded
 

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.330
pleased really that these folded
fragments could express on phage because

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:35.340
fragments could express on phage because
 

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.529

that's what the system seemed to work

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:40.470
that's what the system seemed to work
 

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:41.470
that's what the system seemed to work
beautifully

a green heavy chain and a black light
 

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.880
a green heavy chain and a black light
chain so if we clone out those genes and

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:37.890
chain so if we clone out those genes and
 

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.010

we shuffle them all up we end up getting

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020
we shuffle them all up we end up getting
 

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.840

four possible combinations two of the

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:41.850
four possible combinations two of the
 

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.539
four possible combinations two of the

and the green whites now as you increase

00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419
and the green whites now as you increase
 

00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:51.289
and the green whites now as you increase
the number of b-cells that you that you

00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:51.299
the number of b-cells that you that you
 

00:22:51.299 --> 00:22:55.370
the number of b-cells that you that you
use you you decrease the probability of

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.380
use you you decrease the probability of
 

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.620
use you you decrease the probability of
finding the original combination and you

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:57.630
finding the original combination and you
 

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.510
finding the original combination and you
increase the probability of finding new

00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520
increase the probability of finding new
 

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.500
increase the probability of finding new
combinations so for example if you took

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:03.510
combinations so for example if you took
 

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.299
combinations so for example if you took
a thousand b-cells in principle which

00:23:05.299 --> 00:23:05.309
a thousand b-cells in principle which
 

00:23:05.309 --> 00:23:07.789
a thousand b-cells in principle which
were all different in principle you get

00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799
were all different in principle you get
 

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:09.470
were all different in principle you get
a million different combinations by

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480
a million different combinations by
 

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.690
a million different combinations by
combining them of which a thousand would

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700
combining them of which a thousand would
 

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.600
combining them of which a thousand would
be the originals and 999 thousand would

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:14.610
be the originals and 999 thousand would
 

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.100
be the originals and 999 thousand would
be would be new combos

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:17.110
be would be new combos
 

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.690
be would be new combos
so we were very interested in you combos

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:18.700
so we were very interested in you combos
 

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.650
so we were very interested in you combos
because actually in if we were to take

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:21.660
because actually in if we were to take
 

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.570
because actually in if we were to take
