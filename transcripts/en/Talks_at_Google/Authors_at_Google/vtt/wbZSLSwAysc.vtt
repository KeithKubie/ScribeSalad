KATE: Good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.710
Authors at Google New York is
pleased to welcome Simon

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.260
Winchester today.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.090
SIMON WINCHESTER:
Thanks, Kate.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.500
One day, about two years ago
now, I got a telephone call

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.560
from a friend of mine in London
who runs a company

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.200
called Touch Press, which you
may be familiar with some of

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.510
their products.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.660
They did an app on the elements,
which was actually

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.930
bundled with the first iPads,
and then they did one on the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.800
solar system, and they've done
all sorts of things since.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.960
And Max said, have you
seen the story in

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.890
today's Daily Mail?

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.300
As I'm sure you probably know,
especially if there are any

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.470
Brits in the audience, the
Mail is the most popular

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.990
English newspaper on the
web in the world.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.420
It is also probably the most
irresponsible and inaccurate

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.520
and ludicrously sensational
newspaper in the world as

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.440
well, but it's nonetheless
compelling reading.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.250
And they had a story, said Max,
on that particular day

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.440
about an amazing--

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.630
or Max thought he was
an amazing fellow--

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.280
called Alan Dudley who lives in
Coventry in England, which

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.250
is probably one of
the most dreary

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.310
cities in Western Europe.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.780
And he had amassed, according to
the Daily Mail story, what

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.490
was probably the largest
collection of skulls anywhere

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.600
in the world.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.720
Would I, said Max,
go and see him?

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.110
Because it was a possibility, he
thought, that we could turn

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.710
his collection into an app
that would be amusing and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.740
interesting and indeed
useful for the iPad.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.930
So I flew over to London and
rented a car and drove up to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.390
Coventry, and came to this
extremely ordinary street of

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.390
semi detached pebbled
ash covered

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.760
houses, utterly anonymous.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.530
And indeed, the first house I
went to, which I thought was

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.500
his house, wasn't.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.430
And even though the fellow was
next door, he had no idea who

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.370
Alan Dudley was.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.060
And I said, but he is the owner
of what is essentially

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.190
the largest collection of skulls
in the world, and he's

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.570
lived there for 35 years.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.060
And he said, well, I've never
met him, because the English

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.340
are very private people.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.139
So clearly, this obsession of
Alan's was very private.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.100
And anyway, I knocked on his
door and eventually saw this

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.495
astonishing collection of his.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.670
First of all, it never ceases
to surprise me the amazing

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.060
jobs that people have.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.650
His, and he had done this for
the previous 25 years--

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.970
Coventry is a great motor car
building city, and for the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.520
past quarter century, Alan has
been the person who selected

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.180
the veneers that are put
on the dashboards of

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.100
Jaguar motor cars.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.430
So if any of you have or aspire
to have a Jaguar, and

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.210
you sit down, and you see this
beautiful bold wood walnut

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.930
dashboard, that walnut
would have been

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.790
chosen by Alan Dudley.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.480
So that's what he does in
his daytime occupation.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.110
But for most of his adult
life, he's also, in the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.000
evening, collected skulls.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.080
And it began like this.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.450
I'll just show you his first.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.750
What happened was, when
he was about 18--

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.830
I mean, like most children,
in England anyway, and

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.700
increasingly because of PBS
people here, he had been

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.240
obsessed with David Attenborough
and wildlife, and

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.940
he had collected birds' eggs and
salamanders and newts and

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.090
tadpoles and frogs and things.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.550
But then one day, when he was
17 or 18, he saw beside the

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.240
road, slung across a fence, the
carcass of a fox, which

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.010
had clearly been knocked down
in a traffic accident.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.770
And he was suddenly seized with
the idea that perhaps he

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.370
should take this fox home and
stuff it-- that he should

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.440
become an amateur taxidermist.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.480
So he brought it home, an
enormous beautiful red thing,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.270
and looked at it more carefully,
and found it had

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.380
actually been badly hurt
in the accident--

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.760
ribs smashed, and a big gash
in its side, and it wasn't

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.030
amenable, really, to being
stuffed, at least not by the

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.730
skills he then had.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.970
And then he had the sudden
thought that probably most of

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.490
you in this room would
not have, and I

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.130
certainly wouldn't have--

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.339
he thought, well, why don't I
cut off its head and collect

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.310
its skull--

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.410
prepare its skull?

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.839
So he did that.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.080
And not much of what I'm going
to say is going to be terribly

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.810
macabre, other than obviously,
the subject as a whole, but

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.610
what he did was he took his pen
knife, and he scraped off

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.860
the fur, and he scraped off the
muscles and excised the

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.950
eyes and the tongue and so
forth, and came up with this,

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.920
which is the first skull he ever
collected, which is the

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.840
skull of a red fox.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.560
And I don't have a pointer.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.470
I'm sure I could be given one,
but I don't really need one,

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.250
because I just very briefly
will point out the salient

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.760
features of a skull.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.600
A skull is essentially composed
of about 26 bones.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.550
Two major parts--

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.910
the upper part, which is the
cranium, that holds the

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.410
brain-- the most important
function-- and most of the

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.600
sense organs.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.110
And then the lower part, which
is the mandible, which is the

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.150
lower part of the jaw.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.670
And when the mandible and the
cranium are brought together,

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.110
the creature bites,
and so forth.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.600
And the relevant
parts to see--

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.270
you can see the eye sockets
there, then beneath them,

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.400
sticking out-- actually, if you
look at this view, you see

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.540
them sticking out like wings.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.810
They're called the
zygomatic arches.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.390
We have them.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.770
All animals with skulls
have them.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.390
They're our cheeks--
our cheekbones.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.090
At the very top, you
can sort of see a

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.040
ridge at the very top.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.750
That's called the sagittal
ridge, and attached to that

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.060
are the muscles which cause the

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.300
mandible to open and close.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.880
So an animal like a tiger, which
has very powerful jaws,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.720
has a very well developed
sagittal ridge.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.485
Just below it, you
see these bulges.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.060
You can see it on the left hand
side of the screen there.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.760
That's the auditory bullae.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.060
That's what holds all
the material that's

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.220
connected with hearing.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.140
So an animal that hears very
well, like a hare a or rabbit

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.830
or a deer, will have
a very advanced and

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.960
enormous auditory bulla.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.070
So that's basically it.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.080
Zygomatic arches, cranium, brain
case, of course, most of

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.060
the top of it.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.200
And Alan was enraptured by this,
and quite rightly so,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.530
because I think you must agree
that once cleaned up, it is a

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.710
beautiful thing.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.070
So he decided to collect
more and more and more.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.110
And the first, just to give you
a very brief look at some

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.090
of the others to show that--

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.900
I think the next one was a newt
that he collected, which

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.210
is much the same,
except zygomatic

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.680
arch is much smaller.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.510
It doesn't want to hear very
much, so its auditory bullae

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.700
aren't particularly developed.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.320
On the other hand, it's got very
big eye sockets, because

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.070
newts need to see.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.850
And the teeth, very much smaller
and more numerous.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.110
But the basic structure
is the same.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.450
If you go to something that
looks wildly different, like

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:15.290
this fire fish here, I mean,
totally different.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.150
But yet, not different.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.510
When you look at it in a meta
sense, the broad structure is

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.500
essentially the same.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.730
So he had developed
this obsession.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.510
And in the early days, he was
doing what I described.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:35.220
He was scraping, in this case,
obviously, the scales off, and

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.680
the meat, and so forth,
with a knife.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.120
But that's unsatisfactory,
and you're likely

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.460
to damage the skull.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.880
So he experimented with all
sorts of ways of removing the

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.170
outer material and leaving
just the bones.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.940
And the traditional
way is to put in--

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.260
and this will sound
slightly macabre--

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.740
put the skull in among a lot of
maggots, and they will chew

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:57.510
the flesh away.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.320
Or domestic beetles do
much the same thing.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.890
But the problem with these
maggots and beetles, if you're

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:06.800
serious about skull collecting,
is that in their

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.470
frenzy of eating, they sort of
elbow each other out of the

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.740
way and do considerable damage
to the very delicate bones

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.770
that are inside a skull.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.910
For instance, within the nose
of an animal that has a very

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.820
well developed olfactory sense,
there are very, very

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.970
fine wafer thin bones, which
these hungry maggots will

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.190
displace in their frenzy
to eat away the flesh.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:37.900
And so he came up, in the end,
with the very, very basic but

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.799
rather lengthy process, which
will be guaranteed to remove

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:45.560
away the flesh without any risk
to the bones underneath,

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.830
and that's called cold
water maceration.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.520
Basically, you put the skull
into a bucket of cold water

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.470
and leave it for about six
months, and the bacteria in

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.710
the water and bacteria that
settle on the surface of the

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.420
water, they will do
the job for you.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.900
But unfortunately, the byproduct
of this is water

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.260
which becomes extraordinarily
smelly.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.570
I mean, it is really
disgusting.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:13.170
And the fact that in his mid
20s, his garden shed and his

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.480
bedroom was beginning to fill up
with buckets of very, very

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.560
smelly water with unpleasant
objects slowly rotting inside

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.510
them was one of the factors,
I think, which caused Mrs.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.070
Dudley to leave Alan.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:31.900
And so in his late 20s, Mr.
Dudley, selecting his veneers

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.200
in a heroic manner, was
nonetheless doing so as a

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.460
bachelor, his wife having gone
off with somebody else.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:43.730
And he was alone in his house
in Coventry with lots of

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.600
buckets of black water,
and lots of skulls.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.240
But he was an optimistic chap,
and he said, well, this at

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.740
least frees up a bedroom.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:58.010
And this was what he indeed used
to display his skulls.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:02.930
And this is the collection in
the bedroom of his very modest

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.280
house in Coventry.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.710
And as you can see, he did do
a bit of amateur taxidermy,

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.410
but his greatest interest was
in the skulls beneath.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.480
And there is the door
through which Mrs.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.320
Dudley used to come.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.420
And there, basically--

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.200
there are more out of the
field of view-- but the

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.190
central part of a collection
which is world class.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:30.090
I mean, mammals, there are only
58,000 species in the

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.510
tens of millions of species--
that's a hippopotamus in the

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.030
middle, incidentally--

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.590
which have skulls.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.620
And they're divided, these
chordates, into five classes--

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.340
the mammals, the birds, the
fish, the reptiles, and the

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.640
amphibians.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.160
And Alan has type examples of
sort of everything within

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.000
these five major classes
of chordates.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.190
So it is a world class
collection, and people come to

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.570
him offering him creatures
that he might

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.590
like to put in it.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:05.900
Most of his skulls these
days come from zoos.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.160
So what happens generally is
that if a zoo has got a

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.170
hippopotamus which isn't feeling
terribly well, they'll

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:16.950
ring up Alan and say, if you
bide your time a few weeks, we

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.385
can probably let you have
a hippopotamus skull.

00:11:18.385 --> 00:11:22.220
And so he will then go up and
get the hippopotamus and take

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.490
off its head, and put it in
obviously not a bucket, but an

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:29.160
enormous container of water, and
eventually it will turn up

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.150
in his collection.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.350
So you can see he's not
much of a prospect for

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.480
eHarmony and so forth.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.730
But nonetheless, he has made
this extraordinary

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:41.120
amassment of skulls.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.680
And this is the reason--

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.780
well, it's the ultimate reason
that we came to see him.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.590
But the proximate reason we came
to see him was because of

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.270
what the Daily Mail
story said.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.530
And the reason he was in the
Daily Mail was not simply

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.870
because he had got a marvelous
collection, but because he was

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.130
in trouble with the police.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.720
And what had happened was that,
you know, he's a kindly,

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.110
decent human being, but his
collecting zeal had very

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.210
occasionally got the better of
him, and he had collected, it

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.010
turns out, one or two things
that he ought not to have had.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.490
And this led to--

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:22.630
I think it was the morning of
the 28th of March in 2008, 7

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.950
o'clock in the morning,
hammering on his door, and he

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.490
went down in his dressing gown
and opened the door to find

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.970
four policemen standing there.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.330
Two uniformed policemen, in case
the situation got ugly,

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.010
which clearly it wasn't going
to do, because he's not that

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.460
sort of a chap.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:44.730
And a man who had come all the
way down from Edinburgh, from

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.650
essentially the wildlife police,
who are, for some

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.140
reason, based in
Scotland, where

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.360
there's very little wildlife.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.380
And someone from the
customs and excise.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.700
And they had been tracking the
internet and had noticed that

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.460
he had been trading, or
at least purchasing--

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.540
because he doesn't sell very
many of his skulls.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.840
He's not a trader, he's
a collector--

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.040
creatures that are banned
under the CITES, the

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.390
convention banning the
internet traffic

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:13.590
of endangered species.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.010
And I think the particular ones
that he was involved with

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:20.650
was a loggerhead turtle, some
particular type of penguin, a

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:26.300
Siberian tiger, and I think the
one that they were most

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:33.350
cross about was a howler
monkey from Ecuador.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.640
The chap in Edinburgh had seen
three trades that had occurred

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.100
recently in howler monkeys,
which are absolutely

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.110
protected, and two of them, the
policeman had noticed, had

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.810
bullet holes in their skulls,
where they had presumably been

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:52.220
hunted by Ecuadorians willing
to trade them.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:57.050
The one that Alan had got did
not have a bullet hole, but

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:00.160
nonetheless, simply by having
it-- by having bought it-- he

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.310
was, in the view of the
prosecuting authorities,

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.650
guilty of having transgressed
this law.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.910
So they said, I'm terribly
sorry, Mr. Dudley.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.110
We're going to have to arrest
you formally, charge you with

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.630
a breach of the CITES
convention.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:21.390
And so they put crime scene
tape over his bedroom--

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.220
the former Mrs. Dudley's
bedroom--

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.180
and they affixed to his leg--

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.520
I can probably show you this
immediately, yes, that.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.290
Not particularly
elegant device.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.810
Not a particularly elegant shoe,
either, but it's one of

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:41.690
these things that Martha
Stewart wore.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.750
And it was very carefully
calibrated.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.180
He had to wear it
until the trial.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.690
He wasn't allowed to leave the
city of Coventry, which I'm

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:55.460
sure was something that most
people would wish to do.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.980
But more specifically, it was
so finely calibrated he

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.720
couldn't go into his
own bedroom where

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.800
the collection was.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.050
So when we visited him, or when
I first visited him, he

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.490
would invite me into his kitchen
for a cup of tea, and

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.020
we'd go upstairs.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.530
But then, there was the yellow
crime scene tape over that

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.620
door, and he said, I'm afraid
I can't go in there.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.560
But on the other hand, you
can, and if you hand me

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.570
things, I can tell you
what they are.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:28.390
So he eventually did appear in
court, and he pleaded guilty,

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:31.200
because he clearly had bought
the howler monkey and the

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.150
penguin and the Siberian
tiger.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:41.260
But he was clearly not bent on
any profuse and profound bout

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:41.990
of illegality.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.140
And the judge--

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.820
well, the judge sentenced
him to prison.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.700
Two years, but a suspended
sentence.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:53.430
So, provided he didn't do
anything bad again, he'd be

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:54.100
free to go.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.010
And they fined him 2,000 pounds,
and they confiscated

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:01.190
the five offending animal skulls
and then let him go.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.240
And that, of course, was
in the press as well.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:10.660
So what we decided to do was
to first of all, in making

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.430
this app, look at
his collection.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.060
And although there's this
fancy title page, the

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:20.650
collection is, as I say, about
3,000 skulls, and they're

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.560
arranged in the five classes--
mammals, birds, fishes,

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.040
reptiles, and amphibians.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.670
So these are all sortable.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:31.000
We just chose the 300 or
so that we thought were

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.210
interesting and illustrative.

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.770
And the way each one is done
is that if you take any

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:38.880
particular one--

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:39.800
perhaps not a fish.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.940
How about this nice armadillo?

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:46.510
The skull itself is there
on the right.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:51.510
If you click it, you
can expand it.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.830
You can look at it in
3D, right to left,

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:55.900
if you've got glasses.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.520
Left to right if you haven't
got glasses.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.750
And also, the wireless
connection here, if it was

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:04.960
automatic, then it'll come up.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.290
But if you click on this little
star-- it may not--

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:12.190
that goes to Wolfram Alpha,
which will give you, if it

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.740
computes it correctly, a full
taxonomic description of

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.190
Cordylus cataphractus, which
is this armadillo.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.380
But I think perhaps, because I
haven't set up wireless, it's

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:20.900
not going to.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.560
But it ultimately does, and it's
very sophisticated and

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.430
very much in depth.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:30.070
So this is an enormously
potentially very, very useful

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.085
tour d'horizon of this
remarkable collection.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:40.420
I mean, some of these things are
just stunningly beautiful.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.220
I love this skull--

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.640
so delicate, so lovely.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.540
And you can see where
Alan's coming from.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:52.440
But the reason they asked me to
come along and be involved

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.750
in this project is not because
I'm particularly knowledgeable

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.460
about skulls, although oddly
enough, I did have some

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:05.590
intimacy with them, because when
I left school, like many

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:09.340
English people, I took a year
or so off between leaving

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.480
school and going up
to university.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.060
So I had about 15 months,
and I wanted to come

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.480
over to this country.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.680
So to earn the money to buy me
passage on a ship across the

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.090
Atlantic, I worked for a number
of months in a mortuary

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:24.710
in North London.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:28.990
And the principal job was
to cut up bodies.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.380
And one of them, you had to take
off the top of the skull

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.060
to weigh the brain
and so forth.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.950
But also, one of the teaching
hospitals in London had a--

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.250
not a scam going, but an
arrangement that if people

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.340
like me would remove the
pituitary from the back of the

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:47.110
brain and put them in a jar, for
every 100 pituitaries you

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.630
got, you'd be given, I think,
five pounds or something.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:55.220
So I became, as a consequence
of that, reasonably

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.150
knowledgeable of the human
skull, although not of these

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.850
animal skulls.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:04.750
But became quite interested in
why we as a species are more

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:08.840
interested in the skull than
in any of the other 220 odd

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.540
bones that make up
the human body.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.860
And it's axiomatic that right
from day one, of all the

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.415
various bones that you see
preserved in graves and

00:19:19.415 --> 00:19:23.510
middens and so forth, it is the
skull that occupies the

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:24.210
pride of place.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.110
I mean, it's not the femur,
despite it being the longest

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.680
bone in the body.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.280
It's not the ribcage, despite
that it protects the

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.510
heart and the lungs.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:36.590
It's not the pelvis, which, in
most creatures, is from which

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.360
life springs.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.390
It is the head.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:45.310
The thing that encased this
brain matter, which 5,000

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.212
years ago, no one really had
much of a clue as to

00:19:47.212 --> 00:19:48.030
what the brain did.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:51.730
But there was the assumption
that the personality or the

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:55.180
soul, if I can put it that way,
of its owner was probably

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.150
housed in the head.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.930
And so the head was given
particular veneration, and you

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:03.850
go to almost any grave site, and
it is the skull that is in

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:04.810
pride of place.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:09.600
So the Touch Press people came
to me and said, we're going to

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.010
photograph all these skulls.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.450
And incidentally, I should say
that the way it was done was

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:15.550
quite technically interesting.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.560
They had a photographer called
Nick Mann come over from

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.650
Chicago to photograph each of
these skulls on a black

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.810
turntable with a black
velvet background.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.440
And he turned them half
a degree at a time.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.370
So one rotation was 720 stops.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:35.900
And at each point, he would
photograph it in very, very

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:40.680
multi-pixelated form, and at
the end of the day, would

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.160
enable it, therefore, to be
turned and expanded in the way

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:43.920
you've seen.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.850
So we're not going to involve
you, Simon Winchester, in

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:51.910
this, but can you write a series
of essays on why we're

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:57.380
so interested in skulls, and
how skulls generally have

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.880
infiltrated human society
and human culture?

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.590
So I thought what I'd do now,
just very briefly, is to look

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:08.200
at a couple of areas in which
the skull has infiltrated

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.110
human society.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:14.640
And I'll start off with the
skull in art, because it's

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.090
more visually interesting.

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.750
So as you can see, incidentally,
where it says

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.320
human here-- this is a
classic human skull--

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.570
if you'll remember when I showed
you the armadillo and

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:28.530
the other creatures, that they
always show the creature from

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:29.960
which the skull came.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.020
There's a sort of type example
of an armadillo, type example

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.880
of a fire fish.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.470
Well, the type example
of the human, believe

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.670
it or not, is me.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.820
So I have one small distinction
that in an app,

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.310
I'm regarded as a typical
human, and I think it's

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:49.920
largely because more of my skull
is visible than in most

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.200
not so challenged as I am.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.620
But let us have a
look briefly.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.630
All sorts of artists, of
course, drew skulls.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.440
Leonardo, Durer--

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.010
Durer was very big on skulls.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.280
There on the right, there are
lots and lots of his.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.720
Then you get these extraordinary
things that look

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.700
almost like skulls anyway,
and are manipulated

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.620
to become more so.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.090
This is agate, I think,
from China.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.100
This is Van Gogh, and presumably
what happens if you

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.030
smoke too much.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:18.990
This is a beautiful thing.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.980
I think it's in the British
Museum in London, this

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:31.120
exquisite malachite skull with
these pyrite eyes and little

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:37.420
fragments of amethyst, and it's
got leather straps that

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.600
you put it on your face.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.200
It's very old, and it's
extremely beautiful.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.130
Incidentally, I should
make one remark

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.610
about skulls in art.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.060
You may notice, if you go
through this, and indeed the

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.430
book, that there is no mention
of what is probably the most

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:58.070
famous artistically rendered
skull, and

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.430
that is Damien Hirst's.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.430
It's called For The Love Of God,
mainly because his mother

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.690
said to him, for the love of
God, Damien, what are you

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:10.850
going to do next, after he had
produced the cow and the fish

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.310
in the formaldehyde
tank and so forth.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:16.100
And he said, what I'm going to
do is I'm going to buy a human

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.830
skull, and I'm going to cover
it in platinum, a very thin

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.350
skin of platinum.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:26.740
Then I'm going to stud that
platinum with 8,500 diamonds,

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:31.010
including a large pink oval
diamond over in the middle of

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.700
the forehead.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.970
And I'm going to create, quite
deliberately, the most

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.570
expensive piece of
art in the world.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.630
It had no other purpose
other than to

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.160
be very, very expensive.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:41.930
And I might say--

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.830
I'm sorry there are these many
parentheses in this, and there

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:44.950
shouldn't be.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:47.980
But when he went looking for
the skull, he went to an

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.100
antique shop in London.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.200
I mean, you shouldn't really be
able to buy human skulls,

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:56.520
for obvious reasons, but
he found a skull.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.920
But he was then told a
story, which is, I

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.790
think, quite amusing.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:04.420
An antique dealer in, I think,
Brighton, was making a big

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.740
deal of the fact that
he had a skull of a

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.950
former English King.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.750
I think it was Henry II.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:12.420
Beautiful thing, slightly
discolored, but in perfectly

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.600
good condition, and he wanted
several thousand pounds for

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.670
it, and someone eventually
agreed to buy for 3,000 pounds

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:21.580
the skull of King Henry II.

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.630
So he bought it, and the
merchant packaged it up.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.710
And as he was leaving the shop,
he noticed a similar

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:32.600
looking, but very, very much
smaller skull on a display

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.230
table just by the front door.

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:38.220
And he said to the antique store
owner, what is that?

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.170
And he said, oh, I'm interested
you asked.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:43.420
He said, that is also Henry II,
but when he was a baby.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:47.950
I'm so sorry.

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.190
Anyway, back to Damien Hirst.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:52.140
Damien bought this particular
skull, covered it with the

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:56.630
diamonds and platinum and so
forth, and auctioned it for 56

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.040
million pounds, I think.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.160
There were no takers, so he then
had to form a consortium

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.110
of his friends and buy it for
25 million pounds, which is

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:08.270
its ultimate shop value,
as it were, and

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:09.660
then put it on display.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:14.210
And we decided, obviously, that
it should be in this app.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:16.160
So we approached him, and
he said yes, sure.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.220
So I wrote an essay about Damien
Hirst, and it was a

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:23.050
slightly tongue in cheek essay,
because I'm not a great

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.910
fan of his.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:25.880
But only slightly.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.250
I mean, it was quite polite.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.070
I pulled my punches.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:32.700
And we photographed, using Nick
Mann's technique, under

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.010
very, very high security, armed
guards and all the rest

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:37.200
of it, this beautiful object.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:42.100
But then Damien saw the essay,
and saw the skull, and I'm not

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.990
quite sure which ticked him
off most, but he said, the

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:49.325
skull doesn't glitter enough
when it's turned Obviously, if

00:25:49.325 --> 00:25:51.040
it's got thousands of
diamonds, it should.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.310
And we thought it glittered just
as it had when you saw it

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:55.760
in real life.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.590
So they took the files back to
Chicago and wrote some complex

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.280
algorithms which you would know
more about than I do,

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.280
which added glitter.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.650
And every single one of these
diamonds had the requisite

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.530
amount of glitter added to it.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.960
And it was sent back to Damien,
and he said no, it's

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.170
still not satisfactory enough.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:19.065
And so we yanked the whole
thing, shortly, within, I

00:26:19.065 --> 00:26:21.720
think, 10 days before the
app was released.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.920
So we were cross with him, he
was cross with us, and so we

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.310
like Damien Hirst even less
than we had at first.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.140
So there's no Damien Hirst, and
if you're looking for one,

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.990
I'm sorry, but that's
the reason why.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:37.880
But anyway, moving along, this
is the painting that I find

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:43.380
most interesting in terms
of skulls in art.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.630
You probably recognize it.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:47.790
Painted in 1538 by
Hans Holbein.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.010
It's called The Ambassadors.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.820
And it is a portrait
commissioned by the chap on

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:57.580
the left, who's called Jean de
Dinteville, who was the French

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.320
ambassador to London, or the
Court of St. James, as they

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.810
call it, in the 1530s.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:08.620
And the chap on the right is
called Georges de Selve, who

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.080
was his great schoolboy
friend.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.950
They're both in their 20s, even
though they look as if

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:14.210
they're in their 40s, but
they're in their 20s.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:17.360
Very young, very wealthy
ambassadors, and they were

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.000
appointed--

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.520
he, Georges de Selve,
was, at the time,

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.080
ambassador to Venice.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:27.450
So they were brought together,
and this was at a time of

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:31.690
phenomenal turmoil in the
Christian church, as you

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:33.040
probably realize.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.060
And this specific--

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:38.110
I can expand this, but it's
not sufficiently good, I

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:40.520
think, on the screen to show
you-- but just by de

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.620
Dinteville's left hand
is that cylindrical

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.510
thing, which is a calendar.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:49.060
And you can see, if you look at
it carefully, the precise

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.230
date that this painting is
supposed to illustrate, which

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:54.350
is the 4th of April,
I think, 1533--

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.900
Good Friday, 1533--

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.840
which indicates that it is in
the mind of Holbein that he

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.140
wants to make this a
religious painting,

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.380
with a religious motif.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:10.820
And nearly everything in it
is displaying the kind of

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:16.976
turmoil, the schism, that had
already built in the church.

00:28:16.976 --> 00:28:22.590
The globe has, at its center,
Rome, suggesting that at a

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:25.870
point in this story, Rome
regarded itself as the center

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:26.650
of the world.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:29.440
On the other hand, the book, if
you look at it closely, is

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.000
the writings of Martin Luther,
who, as you remember, was very

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.890
much a Protestant.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:36.410
And what had happened, of
course, is that this painting

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:42.120
was created at the time that
Henry VIII in England, to

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.300
which Jean de Dinteville was

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:48.210
ambassador, had lately divorced.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:52.010
He had decided to marry Anne
Boleyn, and the Pope, Clement

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:56.760
VII, I think, had this big hissy
fit and decided that the

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.070
churches should split up.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:02.150
So the Church of England was
created, the dissolution of

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:03.620
the monastery was
about to happen.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.290
There was an awful
lot of ferment.

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.910
Symbols such as this lute, which
has a broken string--

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:12.620
you can't see it here, but
that's one of the artistic

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.970
symbols to suggest ferment.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:18.030
So although on the surface, this
looks rather an amusing,

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:21.680
rather sedate portrait of two
rather wealthy men, it

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.220
actually has a lot more
symbolism within it.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:29.740
And most significantly of all is
this smear at the bottom of

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:35.070
the picture-- this diagonal
crude smear, which people

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:38.270
understood what it was,
but it remains--

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:39.550
this painting is huge.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:42.530
It's seven feet by seven feet,
and it's on oak wood.

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.850
It's oil on oak, and
it stands in the

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.480
National Gallery in London.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.160
And after a while, it is the
smear at the bottom that is

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.350
the intriguing thing.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:56.060
It was asked for by the
commissioner, Jean de

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:56.600
Dinteville.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.500
He said, I want, as many
people wanted in their

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.260
commission portraits at the
time, a memento mori, a

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.540
reminder of the likelihood
of death.

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:08.200
Because however grand and
covered with ermine and mink I

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.355
might be, I am going to die.

00:30:11.355 --> 00:30:15.290
And so somehow, you must put
into this painting a reminder

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:17.130
to those who see this
painting in years to

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:18.260
come that we are human.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.370
All flesh is grass, and that
ultimately, I'll die.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.480
And very cleverly, Holbein
put in this.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.270
And you all know, I'm
sure, what it is.

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:29.310
But this device gives
you the ability to

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:30.880
demonstrate what it is.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:37.230
Because if you swipe this
painting slowly, you can see

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:41.320
that that smear, when seen from
a certain angle, turns

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.010
into a skull.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.450
The device as a whole--
the artistic device--

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:46.780
is known as an anamorphosis.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.000
It's the kind of thing you see
on your television screens

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.430
when you watch football
players.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.130
They project something which is
distorted if you see it on

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:57.340
the ground, but actually, not
distorted at all when you see

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.870
it on your television sets.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:02.690
So this is also a bit of 16th
century anamorphosis, so much,

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:07.060
much older, and I think a
thing of great beauty.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:14.440
And it's an illustration of
why these kind of devices,

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.670
although I loathe to say it--

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:20.530
my entire career has been based
on ink and paper and

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:21.680
books and so forth--

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.920
why this kind of a device can
lend an extraordinary new

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.210
dimension to the reading
experience.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.830
So the painting was initially
put at the top of a spiral

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:36.110
staircase, and so simply by
going up the spiral staircase,

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:40.180
you would see this smear change
into a skull, and as

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:44.590
you left it, it would return
to its original, rather

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.190
enigmatic state.

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:50.300
So there's an example of one
aspect of the skull in art.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.330
There are many others.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:54.870
But let's move on to another,
which is the skull in science

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.630
and pseudoscience.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:00.960
This was an area that interested
me a great deal.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:05.040
Skulls have been misused in
science a great deal,

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.000
particularly in America,
oddly enough.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.490
In the latter part of the 19th
century, the US Army collected

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:15.510
a huge number of skulls at Fort
Leavenworth in Kansas and

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:20.510
gave them or loaned them to a
researcher, who created an

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:24.610
entirely new field that he
called craniometry--

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:26.410
the measurement of skulls--

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:30.670
and came up with some ideas that
skulls can be classified

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:31.860
according to--

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.190
for instance, a very simple
classification is whether

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:39.410
they're brachiocephalic
or dolichocephalic.

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:42.560
If you look in dogs' world, for
instance, a greyhound with

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.510
its long pointed snout is
dolichocephalic, whereas a

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:52.110
bulldog with its smashed up
face is brachiocephalic.

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:55.520
And the researcher and
subsequent researchers came up

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.730
with the misguided idea, which
is why I talk about this as

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:03.680
pseudoscience, that within the
human world particularly, the

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.620
shape of a skull had some
hierarchical importance.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:11.400
And for instance, in the 1920s
and '30s, it was said that

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:15.070
Aryans principally have
dolichocephalic skulls,

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:18.380
whereas Jewish people have
brachiocephalic skulls.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.860
And this was seized upon by the
scientists, so called, of

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.680
the Third Reich, which was
another way of, if you

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.390
measured a person's nose and his
brain case and so forth,

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:30.110
you could come up with the idea
that he had a certain

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.790
amount or a large amount of
Jewish DNA, and consequently

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.990
was ripe for the concentration
camps.

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:39.670
And similarly, this happened in
the 1940s, '50s, and early

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:43.910
'60s in South Africa, when
craniometry was used as a

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:48.170
basis for determining the finer
subtleties of racial

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.410
discrimination during the
whole time of apartheid.

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:52.465
So those were the
sort of serious

00:33:52.465 --> 00:33:54.500
and unpleasant aspects.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.380
What I'm going to describe very
briefly here is not so

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.470
much a serious side, but a sort
of ludicrous side, which

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:04.530
is the whole science
of phrenology.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:06.160
This is based on
good science--

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.725
the discovery or the
assumption-- it wasn't so much

00:34:09.725 --> 00:34:14.040
a discovery-- in the late 19th
century by a couple of Germans

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:19.710
that certain parts of the brain
control certain parts of

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:20.820
what you do.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:25.310
Thinking, calculation, color
awareness, amativeness, in

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:29.190
other words, how sexually active
you are, at least in

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:31.340
your mind, whether you're
good at arithmetic, and

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:31.960
that kind of thing.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.900
And that you could draw a map
of the brain, showing where

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.780
these particular qualities
exist.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:41.199
That's more or less correct.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:45.850
What was incorrect, though, was
the thought that if you're

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:50.610
particularly good at let's say
arithmetic, or particularly

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:54.460
sexually arousable, then the
area of your brain where this

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:59.230
is located will expand
massively, and it will push

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:02.840
against the skull and cause
you to have a big bulge in

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:09.090
your skull over the part of
your head immediately over

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:10.200
that part of the brain.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:16.680
So it would then be possible to,
if you had very delicate

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:21.410
fingers, to run your hands over
a person's head and say,

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:25.360
oh, you have an amazing ability
to calculate, or you

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:30.750
have sexual proclivities which
perhaps go somewhat unchecked.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.920
And a man called Fowler, Lorenzo
Fowler, who drew this

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:41.670
exquisite porcelain model, set
up consulting rooms in London

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:46.970
and invited people to come and
have their proclivities

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:50.020
examined and mapped for two
guineas a time, a considerable

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:54.190
amount of money in the early
part of the 20th century.

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:58.040
I should say that it is complete
nonsense to suggest

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:02.110
that the head expands because
of what happens in the brain

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:02.780
underneath.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:08.190
I mean, there was a horrible
experiment which rather

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:11.440
illustrated this just a couple
of years ago in London-- also

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.540
reported hugely on the front
page of the Daily Mail,

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.610
because the word elephant
man, they could

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.200
get it into the title.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.980
Six young impoverished students
who lived in North

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:26.130
London had agreed to take part
in an experiment to be

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:29.380
injected with a particular type
of drug manufactured by a

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:30.500
German company.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.010
So they were paid 1,000 pounds
each, I think, to enjoy this.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:38.150
And they had what's called
a cytokine storm, a huge

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:45.090
allergic reaction which caused
their brain and many of their

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.340
internal organs to swell
gigantically.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.495
And it's disgusting.

00:36:50.495 --> 00:36:53.720
I mean, I've seen some pictures
of eyes bulging out,

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.940
and huge necks, these chaps
in incredible pain.

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:02.310
The Daily Mail immediately said,
one of the girlfriends

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:05.400
said, Mike looks like the
elephant man, so natural

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.360
headline for the Mail.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.430
But they were in trouble.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.390
I mean, they were given
massive doses of

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:13.990
antihistamine, and slowly it
quieted down, and they all

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:18.210
lived, and lawsuits, of course,
flew hither and yon.

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.980
But the point was that they
suffered pain for the same

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.840
reason as a meningitis
patient suffers pain.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.810
Because no matter how much the
brain may swell underneath,

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:32.300
the skull is a very, very solid
object and won't allow

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:36.350
anything to-- certainly nothing
so puny as the soft

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:39.250
gray matter of a brain-- to
push it out of shape.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:42.210
So there was enormous pressure
inside their heads, and that

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:46.030
was why it was so terribly
painful for them.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:49.820
So the basis of phrenology
is complete nonsense.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.590
And for instance, this
area of the--

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:56.520
in larger audiences, I would
point to that over the left

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.750
eye, where it says
calculation--

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:02.520
that if you have a bulge over
your left eye, you are

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.300
particularly clever
with arithmetic.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.310
And statistically--

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:08.860
I don't know what the statistics
are-- but I would

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.270
always notice that people would
wipe their hands over

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:13.960
their left eye as I'm
talking to them.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.270
And I would say to them,
I've caught you.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:17.320
I know what you're doing.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.520
And they would say, no, I
was just wiping my eye--

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.320
a tear or something.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.650
But people are still fascinated
by the thought that

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.400
bumps in their head might give
a clue to their character,

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.630
their soul, their amativeness,
their vitativeness, or their

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:31.950
color sense.

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:33.440
But it was nonsense.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:37.560
All we do know is that Lorenzo
Fowler made himself a great

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:38.180
deal of money.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:42.010
He published, I think, two
million copies of the pamphlet

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:44.460
showing this map, and left
behind this legacy, which

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.470
you'll find in many antique
shops, of these really rather

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:50.890
charming porcelain models
of the brain.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:55.780
The person, oddly enough, who
discovered or wrote that it

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.920
was fraudulent was another
doctor-- a 19th

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.170
century London doctor--

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:06.340
and that was Peter Mark Roget,
of Roget's Thesaurus.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:10.090
He, among many things, one of
them being he was one of the

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:14.110
first people to realize the
invention of a shutter that

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.420
would allow for motion
pictures to be taken.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.600
But he was also interested in
the brain, and he realized

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:25.160
that what Lorenzo Fowler had
come up with was nonsense, and

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.305
published a paper saying this
is all bunkum, and no one

00:39:27.305 --> 00:39:29.640
should take phrenology
at all seriously.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.360
And such was the standing of
Roget in London that he

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:36.180
managed to destroy Fowler, who
promptly left town and went to

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.450
live in Paris, I think, for
the rest of his days.

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:42.110
It's interesting that if you
look at Roget's Thesaurus

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:45.180
today, you'll see that he,
Roget, had the last word,

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:50.150
because it's listed now with
astrology and mesmerism and so

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:56.420
forth as just being the
stuff of charlatanism.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:00.560
So I'm looking at my watch, and
I will only talk about one

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.390
further example, and
leave a fourth for

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:04.660
perhaps another occasion.

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:10.090
But this refers to someone
probably you'll all recognize.

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:14.220
This fellow, who I always think
looks a bit like Hitler.

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:18.480
And this is Piltdown Man.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:22.140
This is one of the most
famous skulls ever.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:28.690
And the story of Piltdown Man
came about in 1908, when a man

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:33.370
called Charles Dawson, who was
a very flamboyant solicitor--

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:36.060
a lawyer who lived in Sussex,
south of London--

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.760
quite wealthy, very
self aggrandizing.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.300
If you see photographs of him,
he's wearing a tricorn hat,

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.140
which was a very unusual thing
to wear in the 20th century,

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:51.750
and velvet knee britches, and
extraordinary clothing.

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:55.250
He was a man of great ambition
and many interests.

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:58.100
And this was one that
got away with him.

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:03.130
He was out walking one day in
1908, and he walked beside a

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:07.270
quarry a couple of miles from
his house, near the village of

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:13.030
Piltdown, and found a number of
fragments of the cranium of

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:17.350
something that looked like if
not a human, then a humanoid.

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:20.420
It was a smaller cranium
than normal--

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:22.800
Henry II as a child, maybe--

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.740
and the point was that the
opening at the back, where it

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:31.330
connects with the spinal cord,
was of a size that suggested

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:35.810
that it had a much smaller brain
than a hominid of that

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.150
size should have.

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:41.560
So it was clearly, in his view,
a primitive hominid, but

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.110
it was, nonetheless, man-like.

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.100
1908.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:50.250
What, that's half a century
since Darwin had published On

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:51.910
the Origin of Species.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:56.530
The biological anthropological
world was in ferment about the

00:41:56.530 --> 00:42:00.080
origin of man-- the realization
that man had

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.480
descended, in some fashion,
from the ape world.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.100
Teilhard de Chardin in China
had found Peking Man.

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:10.120
Various links to antiquity
were being discovered.

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.520
But what was missing was
the missing link--

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.790
a creature that showed, beyond
all possibility of

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:22.340
contradiction, that we had
descended from apes.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.790
And so we wanted something that
was half man, half ape.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:29.450
In discovering this, Dawson
thought maybe

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:30.700
this could be it.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:38.950
So he took the fragments up to
London, to the head of the

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:41.000
geological department of the
British Museum, a man of

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.690
towering reputation and
rectitude called Arthur Smith

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:46.390
Woodward, and said,
have a look.

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:49.340
I found these in my quarry.

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.500
The quarry was gravel,
Pleistocene,

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.140
920,000 years old.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.780
So everything fitted.

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:58.410
In the very primitive view of
human evolution at the time,

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:02.170
this could be where the
missing link was.

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:04.350
And so the two of them then went
down to the quarry, and

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:07.740
for the next couple of years,
they looked around for

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.710
evidence that might create
a full skull.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:16.020
And in the end, they found a
jawbone, a mandible, and they

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.150
found a number of teeth.

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:21.530
And they put them all together,
and they fitted, and

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:25.290
they had one of these epiphanic
moments that in the

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:29.080
end caused Arthur Smith
Woodward, who, as I say, had

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.270
an extraordinary reputation,
to publish a paper and

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:34.470
announce, in 1912--

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:39.450
so four years after Dawson had
found the first pieces--

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.650
that they had found
the missing link.

00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:43.510
It was to be called Eoanthropus,
early man,

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:48.110
dawsoni, after Charles Dawson,
who had found it.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:51.270
And the world was set
alight by this.

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:53.790
The missing link had at last
been discovered, and the most

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:56.830
wonderful thing about it, at
least from the point of view

00:43:56.830 --> 00:44:01.720
of both Smith and Dawson, was
that, incontrovertibly, the

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.860
missing link was
an Englishman.

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:07.600
He was a Sussex country
gentleman.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.810
I mean, what could be better
and more satisfying for the

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:14.470
world of early geology, early
anthropology, than that?

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:17.230
And so, for many years, that
was the situation.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:20.910
This Piltdown man was
given pride of place

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:23.360
in the British Museum.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:29.380
And in due course, Woodward
died, and then Dawson died in

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.840
about 1920, I think.

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.390
Huge monument, still stands, put
outside where he used to

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:37.320
live, and by the quarry where
these fragments were found.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.310
And there, the matter
might have remained.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:43.090
Except, of course, it didn't,
because other

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:44.330
objects were found--

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:48.540
other allegedly missing links of
more provable veracity were

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:49.640
discovered.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:54.020
And then, in the 1950s, someone
realized that bones

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:57.010
that have been buried for a very
long time absorb from the

00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:59.770
earth in which they're
buried fluorine.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:03.370
So to find out if these were
real, because there was a

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:09.350
suspicion that there was
something awry about it, they

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:10.125
needed to be tested.

00:45:10.125 --> 00:45:12.560
And so the British Museum, with
some reluctance, agreed

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.550
that they could be tested
non-destructively, for the

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:17.800
presence of fluorine,
and they had no

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.150
fluorine in them at all.

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:22.170
And then the whole story
began to fall apart.

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:25.140
Because it turned out that the
cranium, which was quite old

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:31.120
but not very old, but from a
young child, was from Germany,

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.520
and had been purchased.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:38.535
The mandible was that of an
orangutan from Sarawak that

00:45:38.535 --> 00:45:41.440
had been stained with potassium
bichromate to give

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.750
it the appropriate color.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:46.830
And the teeth, when looked at
under a microscope, which they

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:51.430
hadn't been in 1912, all had
tiny fragments of metal,

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:54.730
showing that they'd been filed
down to the shape which

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:59.760
suggested that the creature
had a more exotic appetite

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.350
than a primitive creature
should have had.

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:06.410
And so one by one, the pillars
on which this creature's

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:11.170
existence as the missing link
had rested were knocked away,

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:13.910
and it was realized that it was,
in fact, a very clever--

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:17.780
actually not very clever, but a
very comprehensive forgery.

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:21.240
But the question was, who had
perpetrated the forgery?

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.890
Who had done such a thing?

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:27.630
Well, the initial thought was
one of Dawson's neighbors, who

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:31.540
was Arthur Conan Doyle, who
was always up to cunning

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:34.130
practical jokes and things,
and maybe it was him.

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:36.110
But no, there wasn't sufficient
evidence.

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:38.850
Teilhard de Chardin, who had a
sort of dog in this fight, was

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:42.270
thought possibly to have done
something, but no, that was

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:43.110
discounted.

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:45.390
Woodward, no one thought.

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:47.810
I mean, this was a man who
worked for the British Museum

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:49.370
for 42 years.

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:53.100
Didn't take a single day off in
his entire life, except for

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.970
one morning off, when he broke
his arm, and he went back to

00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:57.810
work that afternoon.

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:01.080
So he was a pillar of decency
and rectitude.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.620
Everything pointed to
Dawson himself.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:06.935
And so mercifully, his house
was still in existence, and

00:47:06.935 --> 00:47:08.090
there were relatives
living there.

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:11.150
And they went upstairs into a
lumber room, and they found

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:17.750
that his entire life, at least
the life of his pastimes, his

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:19.680
biological ambitions
and so forth, was

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.780
just a tissue of forgeries.

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:25.130
There were, I think, 32 objects
in there that were

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:26.070
complete forgeries.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:29.720
A Chinese brass urn, which was
neither Chinese nor brass.

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.520
An elephant's tusk--

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.410
I think it was a shovel or
something which had clearly

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:39.110
been cut with a band saw and
sanded down with sandpaper.

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:41.370
The whole thing was
just nonsense.

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:48.060
The New York Times realized the
analogy, he was the Jason

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:52.290
Blair of 20th century biology.

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:55.800
And this poor skull, Piltdown
Man, rather elegant creature,

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:59.570
was now taken off its pedestal
at the front of the British

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:03.162
Museum and moved to a storehouse
at the back, and

00:48:03.162 --> 00:48:07.750
can only be seen by special
application.

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.740
I won't tell the fourth story,
because we don't have enough

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.840
time, but I'll simply
say one thing, which

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:16.620
is that Alan Dudley--

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:20.420
I asked him once if there was
a fire which burned down his

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:24.450
house, which one object of all
these very beautiful objects

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:27.820
would he seize to protect?

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:31.510
And he said it would be this
rather strange thing--

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:35.950
a two headed cow, which he was
given many years ago, which

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.950
required an extremely big bucket
for the cold water

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:39.900
maceration.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.780
That, despite all the beauties
of the lizards and the birds

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:46.460
and the various penguins he's
got, is both legal and, in his

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.960
view, utterly beautiful.

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.870
So there we are.

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:53.950
I'm happy to answer any
questions if you like.

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:56.710
I could go on about this for a
very long time, but you've all

00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:58.970
got to go back to
work, I'm sure.

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:01.670
But thank you very much indeed,
and if I can answer

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:02.920
any questions, I'll
do my best.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.780
AUDIENCE: I noticed when you
showed us the fox's skull

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.960
earlier that there are these two
holes that are below the

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.190
eye sockets, but they're
not the nose.

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:17.730
And I couldn't help but
wonder what those are.

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:18.340
SIMON WINCHESTER: Let
me have a look.

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.880
And it's at this point that I
may have to say, but I'm not

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.200
an expert on foxes.

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.130
But that was a European fox,
I think, wasn't it?

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:27.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:29.070
You said it was the first one.

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:29.500
SIMON WINCHESTER: Yeah.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.930
It was indeed the first one.

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:36.260
OK, let me find him.

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:37.650
Oh, there he is.

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:39.110
European red fox.

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:39.770
What are those?

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:40.530
Oh, yes.

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:41.780
Very interesting.

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.520
What do you think they are?

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.760
I have no idea.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:53.500
They're jolly nice, though.

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:56.180
I mean, what are those things
on its mandible as well?

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:58.996
I mean, those little holes?

00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:01.310
All I can say is that this is
what makes the collecting of

00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:02.810
skulls fascinating.

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:04.220
But you would have
to ask Alan.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:07.000
I'm more than happy to give
you his email address.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.420
But yes, it has--

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:09.670
quite extraordinary.

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:16.240
What would you think
they might be?

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:19.310
I mean, that is his nose, and
you can see, when I was

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:22.710
referring to the very delicate
bones inside that can be

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:28.150
shoveled aside by these
very hungry maggots.

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:31.950
But those things, which you
can see right through.

00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:33.560
I know, I'm sure there's
something to do with--

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.590
here's a cop out.

00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:36.095
I'm sure there's something
to do with sinuses.

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:45.318
But yes, I mean, they lead right
into the eye sockets.

00:50:45.318 --> 00:50:46.960
I wonder if other animals
have them.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:51.570
Let's go something else,
and see if--

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:53.210
How about a black bear?

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:56.670
Yes he does.

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:57.920
They all have them.

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:02.175
Well, there we are.

00:51:02.175 --> 00:51:03.696
This is extraordinary.

00:51:03.696 --> 00:51:04.550
AUDIENCE: We don't have them.

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:05.010
SIMON WINCHESTER: We don't?

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:06.450
Are you sure?

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:08.060
Let's go and have a look
at a human, see if--

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:17.585
there's one in art,
isn't in science.

00:51:17.585 --> 00:51:18.835
In fact, there's me.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.520
Yeah, we do.

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.770
We do.

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:30.150
Well, you've foxed me.

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:32.060
But I shall find out
immediately.

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:33.870
You can press yours, but I
wouldn't if I were you.

00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:36.700
Something terrible may happen.

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.600
Something else that I
possibly can answer?

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.850
That would be nice.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.930
Right, well, in that
case, thank you so

00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:44.850
much for coming along.

00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:47.000
And I'm now going to, with
my wife, take part

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.100
in your lovely cafeteria.

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:48.860
So thank you.

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.110
It's lovely to have been here.
