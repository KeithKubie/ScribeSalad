demonstration is a simple demonstration
 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.989
demonstration is a simple demonstration
but it does take several weeks to follow

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:31.999
but it does take several weeks to follow
 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.670
but it does take several weeks to follow
it along and see everything that needs

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680
it along and see everything that needs
 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.020
it along and see everything that needs
to be seen but again it's basic sort of

particles particles in the environment

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100
particles particles in the environment
 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.139
particles particles in the environment
then I have here in this beaker a pile

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149
then I have here in this beaker a pile
 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.180
then I have here in this beaker a pile
of particles you might call it a dirt

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190
of particles you might call it a dirt
 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.020
of particles you might call it a dirt
sediment I can see some little granules

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030
sediment I can see some little granules
 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.270
sediment I can see some little granules
in there certainly a lot of sand and

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280
in there certainly a lot of sand and
 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.370
in there certainly a lot of sand and
then I see some much much finer material

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.380
then I see some much much finer material
 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.210
then I see some much much finer material
so it's a collection of very small

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220
so it's a collection of very small
 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.090
so it's a collection of very small
gravel and then sand and mud now in this

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100
gravel and then sand and mud now in this

four liter beaker i have approximately

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800
four liter beaker i have approximately
 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.260
four liter beaker i have approximately
two liters of water and all i'm going to

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270
two liters of water and all i'm going to
 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.110
two liters of water and all i'm going to
do is to dump the sediment here into the

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120
do is to dump the sediment here into the
 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.920
do is to dump the sediment here into the
water and then stir it and talk as we're

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930
water and then stir it and talk as we're
 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.860
water and then stir it and talk as we're
doing it so let's just get started by

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870
doing it so let's just get started by
 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.290
doing it so let's just get started by
dumping oh look at that you can see some

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300
dumping oh look at that you can see some
 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:46.150
dumping oh look at that you can see some
some of the particles in fact are very

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160
some of the particles in fact are very
 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.810
some of the particles in fact are very
small I sister this like this you can

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820
small I sister this like this you can
 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.550
small I sister this like this you can
see I don't know whether you can or not

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560
see I don't know whether you can or not
 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.690
see I don't know whether you can or not
but there is you can see some dust we

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700
but there is you can see some dust we
 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.860
but there is you can see some dust we
might call it particles that have enough

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870
might call it particles that have enough
 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.250
might call it particles that have enough
energy in the just by the air currents

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260

to move out of the beaker and into the

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960
to move out of the beaker and into the
 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.480
to move out of the beaker and into the
environment so those are very fine

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490
environment so those are very fine
 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.220
environment so those are very fine
particles indeed and let's see if or we

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230
particles indeed and let's see if or we
 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.390
particles indeed and let's see if or we
can see a lot more of those very fine

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400
can see a lot more of those very fine
 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.229
can see a lot more of those very fine
particles well we can see already that

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239
particles well we can see already that
 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:20.760
particles well we can see already that
the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770
the
 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.960
the
water has become dirty or muddy and I

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970
water has become dirty or muddy and I
 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.410
water has become dirty or muddy and I
have my trusty spoon here and I'm

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420
have my trusty spoon here and I'm
 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.350
have my trusty spoon here and I'm
beginning to stir the particles but

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360
beginning to stir the particles but
 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.440
beginning to stir the particles but
what's important here and we'll show you

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450
what's important here and we'll show you
 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.320
what's important here and we'll show you
some close-ups of this in a second is to

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330
some close-ups of this in a second is to
 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.290
some close-ups of this in a second is to
carefully note how I'm going to stir

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300
carefully note how I'm going to stir
 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.070
carefully note how I'm going to stir
this and right now I'm just moving the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080
this and right now I'm just moving the
 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.220
this and right now I'm just moving the
particles or go around making sure that

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230
particles or go around making sure that
 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.630
particles or go around making sure that
the particles disaggregate that as any

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640
the particles disaggregate that as any
 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.080
the particles disaggregate that as any
that is any clumps of particles have

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090
that is any clumps of particles have
 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.710
that is any clumps of particles have
fallen apart and all the particles are

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720
fallen apart and all the particles are
 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.880
fallen apart and all the particles are
loose and independent and I'm just going

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890
loose and independent and I'm just going
 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.150
loose and independent and I'm just going
to say that that's been achieved okay so

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160
to say that that's been achieved okay so
 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.250
to say that that's been achieved okay so
the basic part of this experiment is

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260
the basic part of this experiment is
 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.259
the basic part of this experiment is
started by stirring the sediment in this

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269
started by stirring the sediment in this
 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.970
started by stirring the sediment in this
water very very rapidly adding a lot of

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980
water very very rapidly adding a lot of
 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.820
water very very rapidly adding a lot of
energy to this system to make sure that

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830
energy to this system to make sure that
 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.330
energy to this system to make sure that
all the particles are off the bottom and

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340
all the particles are off the bottom and
 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.949
all the particles are off the bottom and
up into the water in suspension before I

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959
up into the water in suspension before I
 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.500
up into the water in suspension before I
stop stirring because what I'm going to

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510
stop stirring because what I'm going to
 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.900
stop stirring because what I'm going to
do is then stop stirring and then you

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910
do is then stop stirring and then you
 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.520
do is then stop stirring and then you
can imagine what's going to happen the

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530
can imagine what's going to happen the
 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.990
can imagine what's going to happen the
particles are going to be going to begin

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000
particles are going to be going to begin
 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.289
particles are going to be going to begin
to settle to the bottom question is

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299
to settle to the bottom question is
 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.800
to settle to the bottom question is
which ones will settle first if any and

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810
which ones will settle first if any and
 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.199
which ones will settle first if any and
how long will it take I'm also going to

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209
how long will it take I'm also going to
 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.660
how long will it take I'm also going to
stir this in a circular fashion very

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670
stir this in a circular fashion very
 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.509
stir this in a circular fashion very
rapidly and I will create a vortex a

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519
rapidly and I will create a vortex a
 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.670
rapidly and I will create a vortex a
spinning vortex kind of like a the

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680
spinning vortex kind of like a the
 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.670
spinning vortex kind of like a the
inside of a tornado in here that also

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680
inside of a tornado in here that also
 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.569
inside of a tornado in here that also
will play a role in what we see later on

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579
will play a role in what we see later on
 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:31.040
will play a role in what we see later on
so here we go I am now stirring

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050
 
 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.260
 
hey we're going to unite vortex for me I

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270
hey we're going to unite vortex for me I
 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.690
hey we're going to unite vortex for me I
can still feel that they're consistent I

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700
can still feel that they're consistent I
 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.890
can still feel that they're consistent I
mean at the bottom there's and

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900
mean at the bottom there's and
 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.230
mean at the bottom there's and
resistance but as I through this faster

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240
resistance but as I through this faster
 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.180
resistance but as I through this faster
and faster that resistance is

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190
and faster that resistance is
 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.520
and faster that resistance is
disappearing and now I think all the

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530
disappearing and now I think all the
 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.320
disappearing and now I think all the
particles are off the bottom and we can

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330
particles are off the bottom and we can
 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.550
particles are off the bottom and we can
stop stirring we just simply watch as

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560
stop stirring we just simply watch as
 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.270
stop stirring we just simply watch as
the water spins and spins and spins and

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280
the water spins and spins and spins and
 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.210
the water spins and spins and spins and
begins to slow down on the top we now

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220
begins to slow down on the top we now
 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.680
begins to slow down on the top we now
have a phone that has developed well the

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690
have a phone that has developed well the
 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.130
have a phone that has developed well the
water hits it's still slowly slowly

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140
water hits it's still slowly slowly
 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.150
water hits it's still slowly slowly
rotating but it's nearly come to a stop

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160
rotating but it's nearly come to a stop
 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.310
rotating but it's nearly come to a stop
some of the phone has now cleared to the

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320
some of the phone has now cleared to the
 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.940
some of the phone has now cleared to the
edges there is a little chunk of foam

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950
edges there is a little chunk of foam
 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.060
edges there is a little chunk of foam
that's still in the center that's

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070
that's still in the center that's
 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.620
that's still in the center that's
floating around and what else do we see

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630
floating around and what else do we see
 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.960
floating around and what else do we see
here well number one we can see that

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970
here well number one we can see that
 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.760
here well number one we can see that
there are a number of particles that are

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770
there are a number of particles that are
 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.700
there are a number of particles that are
floating which indicates that these

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710
floating which indicates that these
 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.240
floating which indicates that these
particles are likely to be less dense

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250
particles are likely to be less dense
 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.050
particles are likely to be less dense
than water and perhaps pieces of organic

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060
than water and perhaps pieces of organic
 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.180
than water and perhaps pieces of organic
matter pieces of wood or leave for
