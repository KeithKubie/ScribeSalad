00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.510
Teddy knows that a
figure has a surface

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.960
area of 40 square centimeters.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.790
The net below has 5 centimeter
and 2 centimeter edges.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.330
Could the net below
represent the figure?

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.730
So let's just make sure we
understand what this here

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.730
represents.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.030
So it tells us that it
has 5 centimeter edges.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.950
So this is one of
the 5 centimeter

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.860
edges right over here.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.430
And we know that it has several
other 5 centimeter edges

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.330
because any edge that
has this double hash mark

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.020
right over here is also
going to be 5 centimeters.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.380
So this edge is
also 5 centimeters,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.544
this is also 5 centimeters,
this is also 5 centimeters,

00:00:38.544 --> 00:00:40.710
and then these two over
here are also 5 centimeters.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.710
So that's 5 centimeters,
and that's 5 centimeters.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.210
And then we have several
2 centimeter edges.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.710
So this one has 2 centimeters.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.290
And any other edge that has
the same number of hash marks,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.170
in this case one, is also
going to be 2 centimeters.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.430
So all of these other
edges, pretty much

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.759
all the rest of the edges,
are going to be 2 centimeters.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:00.800
Now, they don't ask us to
do this in the problem,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.460
but it's always fun to
start with a net like this

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.080
and try to visualize the
polyhedron that it actually

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.680
represents.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.138
It looks pretty
clear this is going

00:01:09.138 --> 00:01:10.300
to be a rectangular prism.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.760
But let's actually draw it.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.220
So if we were to-- we're
going to fold this in.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.060
We're going to
fold this that way.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.710
You could view this as
our base right over here.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.040
We're going to fold this in.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.410
We're going to fold that up.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.280
And then this is
going to be our top.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.180
This is the top right over here.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.260
This polyhedron is going to
look something like this.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.940
So you're going to
have your base that

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.020
has a length of 5 centimeters.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.250
So this is our base.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.850
Let me do that in a new color.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.480
So this is our base
right over here.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.620
I'll do it in the same color.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.680
So that's our base, this
dimension right over here.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.790
I could put the double
hash marks if I want.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.670
5 centimeters, and
that's of course

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.650
the same as that
dimension up there.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.360
Now, when we fold up this
side-- we'll do this in orange,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.030
actually-- when we
fold up that side, that

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.670
could be this side
right over here,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.050
along this 2 centimeter edge.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.940
So that's that side
right over here.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.084
When you fold this side in right
over here, that could be that.

00:02:17.084 --> 00:02:20.370
That's that side
right over there.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.990
And then when of course we
fold this side in-- that's

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.680
the same color.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.846
Let me do a different color.

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:27.740
When we fold this
side in, that's

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.210
the side that's kind of
facing us a little bit.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.710
So that's that right over there.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.590
That's that right over there.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.430
Color that in a
little bit better.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.960
And then we can
fold this side in,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.460
and that would be that side.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.960
And then, of course,
we have the top

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.335
that's connected
right over here.

00:02:45.335 --> 00:02:49.894
So the top would go--
this would be the top,

00:02:49.894 --> 00:02:51.310
and then the top
would, of course,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.654
go on top of our
rectangular prism.

00:02:53.654 --> 00:02:55.570
So that's the figure
that we're talking about.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.750
It's 5 centimeters
in this dimension.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:05.420
It is 2 centimeters tall,
and it is 2 centimeters wide.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.830
But let's go back to
the original question.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.170
Is this thing's surface
area 40 square centimeters?

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.990
Well, the good
thing about this net

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.380
here is it's laid out all
of the surfaces for us,

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.640
so we just have to figure
out the surface area of each

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.660
of these sections and then
add them together, the surface

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.040
area of each of these surfaces.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.190
So what is the surface
area of this one here?

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.241
Well, it's going to be
5 centimeters times 2

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:28.740
centimeters.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.921
So it's going to be
10 square centimeters.

00:03:30.921 --> 00:03:31.920
Same thing for this one.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.810
It's going to be 5 by 2, 5 by 2.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.820
This one is 5 by 2.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.520
So these are each 10
square centimeters,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.670
and so is this one.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.900
This is 5 long, 5 centimeters
long, 2 centimeters wide.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.030
So once again, that's
10 square centimeters.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.210
Now, these two sections
right over here, they're

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.770
2 centimeters by 2 centimeters.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.940
So they're each going to
be 4 square centimeters.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.000
So what's the
total surface area?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.650
Well, 10 plus 10 plus
10 plus 10 is 40,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.480
plus 4 plus 4 gets us to
48 square centimeters,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.330
or centimeters squared.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.720
So could the net below
represent the figure

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.380
that has a surface area
of 40 square centimeters?

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.670
No.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.500
This represents a figure
that has a surface

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.192
area of 48 square centimeters.
