00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.310
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.340
Did you know that what we
call the First Amendment today

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.710
was actually the third amendment

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.900
in the original draft
of the Bill of Rights?

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.820
In fact, there were more
than 200 proposed amendments

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.330
which were whittled down to just 12.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.020
That's right, 12, not 10.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.640
So what were those two proposed amendments

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.450
that weren't ratified
along with the other 10?

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.330
The unadopted amendments.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.850
To learn more, I talked
to Fergus Bordewich.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.680
He's a writer and a historian,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.020
and the author of The First Congress:

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.350
How James Madison, George Washington,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.090
and a Group of Extraordinary
Men Invented the Government.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.260
These unadopted amendments
which weren't included

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.610
in the Bill of Rights
aren't nearly as well known,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.700
so what were they?

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.790
- [Fergus] Well, to put it in context,

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.070
there were more than 200
amendments originally proposed

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.050
during the First Congress.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.140
James Madison had the responsibility

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.650
of winnowing those 200 down
to a manageable number.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.900
He compressed them finally down to 19,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.290
then to 17, and finally, to 12.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.950
Twelve were approved
by the First Congress.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.800
Ten of them are the
ones that we today call

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.040
the Bill of Rights, but
nobody then referred to them

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.460
as the Bill of Rights.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.710
Madison and other members
of the First Congress

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.150
referred to them as adjustments
of the Constitution,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.487
alterations of the Constitution,

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:32.685
and sometimes as amendments,
but the term Bill of Rights

00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:36.180
only came into use in the 20th century.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.110
- [Kim] Really, I had no idea.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.520
- [Fergus] Members of the First Congress

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.483
often talked about the
lack of a Bill of Rights,

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.580
and they referred to Bills of
Rights that some states had,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.660
but the first ten amendments

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.030
to the Constitution were not
treated as a Bill of Rights.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.960
In fact, those who most
wanted a Bill of Rights

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.560
said this isn't one.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.900
- [Kim] Okay, so we end
up with 12 adjustments

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.400
to the Constitution, but
in today's Bill of Rights,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.770
there are only 10.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.700
So what were those other two?

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.000
- [Fergus] One of them had
to do with the apportionment

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.240
of seats in Congress, how
many seats would there be,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.900
and how many people would each

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.770
member of the House of
Representatives represent.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.030
That was one amendment.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.650
The other had to do with the
method of providing salaries

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.300
for members of the Senate and
the House of Representatives.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.690
- [Kim] All right, so we have the text

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.440
of these two unadopted amendments here.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.410
One says, after the first enumeration

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.780
required by the first
article of the Constitution,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.400
there shall be one
Representative for every 30,000,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.590
until the number shall
amount to one hundred,

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.650
after which the proportion shall
be so regulated by Congress

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.660
that there shall not be less
than 100 Representatives,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.240
nor less than one Representative
for every 40,000 persons

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.590
until the number of Representatives

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.360
shall amount to 200,
after which the proportion

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.270
shall be so regulated by Congress,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.610
that there shall not be less
than 200 Representatives,

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.423
nor more than one Representative
for every 50,000 persons.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.780
Okay, so it seems like
the general gist here is

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.350
setting up a proportional arrangement

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.350
about the House of Representatives.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.850
The other one's a little bit shorter.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.080
It says, no law varying the
compensation for the services

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.270
of the Senators and
Representatives, shall take effect,

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.200
until an election of Representatives
shall have intervened.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.200
So you can't change how much
Senators and Representatives

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.570
get paid without an election in-between,

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.720
so they can't raise their own salaries.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.359
So why did these two amendments

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.840
end up on the cutting room floor?

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.700
- [Fergus] Well, bear in
mind that both of these

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.040
were approved by Congress.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.420
Then they went out to the states,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.640
they had to be ratified by the states.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.340
The states ratified the other ten

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.920
that we're all familiar with.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.710
They almost ratified the amendment

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.930
having to do with the
apportionment of seats in Congress.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.560
That ratification fell short by one state.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.248
The other one having to do
with the salaries of Congress,

00:04:14.248 --> 00:04:16.785
although it was very uncontroversial,

00:04:16.785 --> 00:04:20.260
simply didn't generate enough
interest to be ratified.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.370
The two amendments which
failed to be ratified,

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.450
were the only two that

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.493
strictly do not have to do with rights.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.710
I don't think that there
was a very passionate

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.530
concern for them among the voting public.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.390
Did the Constitution need to be amended

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.850
in order to establish a process
for setting member salaries?

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:41.792
Well no, it didn't.

00:04:41.792 --> 00:04:44.320
We know that it did not.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.970
Was it necessary to
amend the Constitution to

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.930
set a principle of apportionment?

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.750
Well, apparently not.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.750
I think, by and large, Americans
and our Representatives

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.030
recognize principles
that rise to the level

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.030
of Constitutional amendment.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.763
With respect to these two amendments,

00:05:07.763 --> 00:05:10.730
neither of them really
has to do with rights,

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.300
and that's why we somewhat
misunderstand them

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.290
if we're always referring
to a Bill of Rights,

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.213
because these two are not rights.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.000
They're essentially more on the order of

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.710
Congressional housekeeping.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.180
There was virtually no
debate in Congress at all

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.256
about the proposed amendment

00:05:29.256 --> 00:05:32.822
that would enable Congress to

00:05:32.822 --> 00:05:35.280
provide salaries for members.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.245
Everybody thought this
is a pretty good idea.

00:05:38.245 --> 00:05:41.200
In point of fact, as we all know,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.903
in the 200 years plus since then,

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.980
Congressional salaries have been raised by

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.970
legislation when needed.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.200
It turned out that the amendment

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.110
absolutely wasn't necessary,

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.830
even though it was
finally ratified in 1992.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.060
Now, there was a great
deal of debate, however,

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.079
over the apportionment of seats

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:05.210
in the House of Representatives.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.950
In the first House of Representatives,

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.100
there were only 59 members.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.100
They represented districts
of widely varying size.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.640
For example, one
representative from Georgia

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.790
represented 16,000 people.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.870
A representative from the Maine
district of Massachusetts,

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.153
Maine was not a separate state
then, represented 96,000.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.820
The sharpest debate was
over how many individuals

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.600
would a given member
of the House represent.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.740
They had to come up with a number.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.843
It wasn't obvious what
the number should be.

00:06:41.843 --> 00:06:44.470
The debate really was over whether

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.140
each Representative would
represent 30,000 or 40,000.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.210
This doesn't sound important today,

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.750
but our country was much
smaller, obviously much smaller,

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.723
and these were fairly
big numbers for the time.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.660
Those who argued for each
Representative representing

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.130
30,000, wanted a larger
House of Representatives.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.910
It was a more populist kind of idea.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.390
The people who argued most
forcefully for it were

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.610
anti-Federalists, that's to say,

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.650
those were the people who

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.730
really didn't like the
Constitution at all.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.160
They didn't even want it.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.070
They wanted what they
saw as a more democratic

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.200
House of Representatives.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.210
More conservative members argued for

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.570
a smaller House of Representatives

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.430
based on the idea that
the larger it would be,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.203
the less manageable it would be.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.626
James Madison himself was
very hostile to the idea

00:07:43.626 --> 00:07:47.060
of a larger House of Representatives,

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.750
arguing that it would be
a step towards tyranny

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:54.320
because a body too large would
fall victim to demagogues.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.490
- [Kim] This is really fascinating,

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.741
because even if we had
gone with 30,000 or 40,000,

00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:01.700
today the House of Representatives

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.480
would have more than 10,000 people in it.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.480
But today, we only have 435
Representatives in the House.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.740
How did we get from there to here?

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.420
- [Fergus] Well, Congress did provide

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.910
for the incremental increase in

00:08:16.752 --> 00:08:19.390
the size of congressional districts,

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.470
knowing that population would increase.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.230
Everybody knew it was going to increase.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.920
Nobody in 1789 or 1790 could imagine

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.680
a country of two hundred million people.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.130
The outermost number
that they contemplated

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.950
in 1790 was about 200.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.200
We now know it's 435.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.340
Over time in the 19th century,

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.150
as we admitted more states,

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.280
we added more population
and more representatives.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.280
The politics of stopping it at 435

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.860
is frankly a little intricate.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.060
But at any rate, the number
continued to increase

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.620
through the 19th century
into the 20th century.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.030
There was no reapportionment
after the census of 1920.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:06.050
The Republicans who dominated
in Congress at the time

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:12.170
worried that reapportioning after 1920

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.509
would increase the number of Democrats.

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:16.580
It became a partisan issue.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.273
There was no reapportionment

00:09:18.273 --> 00:09:23.273
until later in the 1920s,
when it was stopped at 435.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.300
Since then, there's
basically been a consensus

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.700
that this is a manageable number.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.440
- [Kim] One of these
amendments actually reappeared

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.110
and was passed in 1992.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.980
Can you tell us a little
bit about the story

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.650
of this lost amendment?

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.400
- [Fergus] Yeah, it's a cute story.

00:09:44.665 --> 00:09:47.310
A student at the University
of Texas in the 1980s

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.920
was writing a paper for history class

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.920
and stumbled across this
long forgotten amendment,

00:09:57.361 --> 00:10:01.260
and wrote about it, and was given,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.810
I believe, a C grade for
it because his professor

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:09.333
considered the subject
irrelevant and inconsequential.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.253
His name was Gregory Watson.

00:10:13.674 --> 00:10:16.250
He was so, I think,
frustrated by the grade

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:21.250
but also inspired by the story
of this forgotten amendment

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.880
that he began to wage initially a one-man,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.053
a one-student lobbying campaign.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.970
Astonishingly enough, within a decade,

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.110
nearly every state
ratified that amendment,

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.300
all but four states.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.401
So it has now since '92,

00:10:37.401 --> 00:10:39.850
been an amendment to the Constitution.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.040
Frankly, a not very relevant one

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.320
because Congress has raised
congressional salaries

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.392
by ordinary legislation
for more than 200 years.

00:10:48.392 --> 00:10:51.810
They didn't really need
the amendment to do so.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.890
- [Kim] Looking back over the history

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.940
of Constitutional amendments,

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.020
you see that they kind of come in bunches.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.230
There are the ten that
come immediately after

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.320
the adoption of the Constitution.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.640
Then there are the
Reconstruction amendments

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.820
that come right after the Civil War.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.280
Then there are the
Progressive-era amendments,

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.240
ones like Prohibition or
women's right to vote.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.190
Then there's been kind of a lull

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.510
in Constitutional amendments

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:26.300
This 1992 amendment is the 27th and final.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.040
So are there more amendments coming

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.650
and if so, what might they be about?

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.630
- [Fergus] Well, it's very difficult

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.060
to amend the Constitution.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.970
That's one reason there are so few.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.660
There are other countries which have

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.470
immensely long Constitutions
and amend them all the time.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:47.990
We're extremely conservative
as a nation historically

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.440
in tampering with or
altering our Constitution.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.040
Let's look at a couple of recent ones.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.649
There was the Equal Rights Amendment,

00:11:55.649 --> 00:11:59.000
an amendment to guarantee,
across the board,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.440
equal rights to women,
which almost passed.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.220
I believe it fell short by only one state,

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.470
back in the 1970s.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:10.240
That came within a hair of being ratified.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.400
Another amendment that
had some vigor in it

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.810
in recent years was one to provide

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.280
a voting member for the
District of Columbia.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.050
The District of Columbia is not a state.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.160
It's a unique entity.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.348
The Constitution does not provide

00:12:27.348 --> 00:12:30.810
for the seat of government to be a state.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.760
So it's very tricky, legally
and constitutionally,

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.300
what is the District of Columbia.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.079
There was a proposed
amendment that would enable

00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:41.450
D.C. to have a voting member.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.240
I think both of these amendments,

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.640
which were proposed but were
not ratified, may return.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.030
I do think at some point, D.C. will

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.840
be given a status that enables it

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.260
to have voting representation in Congress.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.080
I'm not sure what the formula will be.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.840
There is a renewed
effort underway currently

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.730
to reintroduce the Equal Rights Amendment.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:09.730
I think as women increasingly
have a higher profile

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.900
and more influence politically

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.590
that the possibility of that

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.040
one day becoming an amendment

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.960
to the Constitution is foreseeable.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.570
- [Kim] One thing that we
haven't discussed so far

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.810
is that when the Bill of
Rights originally was passed,

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.000
it only applied to the federal government,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.670
not to the states.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.950
How does that intersect with
these unadopted amendments?

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:35.898
- [Fergus] Very important point.

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:40.700
James Madison, who did more

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.510
than any other member of Congress

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.483
to shape what we now
call the Bill of Rights,

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.380
Madison argued that these amendments

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.640
should also apply, and
especially the protections

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.520
of civil rights that we
find in the First Amendment

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.210
and others, that they
should apply to states.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.790
He argued vigorously
that they should be meant

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:04.810
to apply to states.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.269
He failed, he wanted that to be explicit

00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:09.680
in the Bill of Rights.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.550
It is not, because the
power of states rights

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.350
within Congress was
still so great in 1790,

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.560
that states would not accept it.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.330
When did that change?

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.670
The Reconstruction-era amendments,

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.670
designed initially to provide
rights for black Americans,

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.260
for African Americans
coming out of slavery,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.231
made clear that the Bill of Rights

00:14:34.231 --> 00:14:37.790
had to be applied across
the board in states.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.760
Was it, practically speaking?

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.610
No, it wasn't.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.930
In point of fact, those
Reconstruction amendments

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:47.820
were largely disregarded
and ignored for many years,

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.670
until the 20th century
civil rights movement,

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.440
particularly beginning in the 1950s,

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.990
began to put federal muscle

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.697
behind the enforcement
of those amendments.

00:14:57.697 --> 00:14:59.790
- [Kim] And here, we're
specifically discussing

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.730
the 14th Amendment and its
equal protection clause,

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.710
which was passed after the Civil War

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.770
to guarantee citizenship
rights to African Americans

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:12.030
but was really, as we know
from the Jim Crow laws,

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.140
something that existed on
paper but not in reality.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.580
It took the work of civil rights groups

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.320
and federal enforcement
to make these rights

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.095
that existed on paper, a reality.

00:15:23.095 --> 00:15:25.110
- [Fergus] Absolutely correct.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.310
It's really a modern notion.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.230
When I say modern, I mean
a 20th century notion,

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:34.290
that all Americans should expect to have

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.903
equal rights in practice under the law.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.250
In the 19th century, equal
rights were not enforced,

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.500
regardless of what the Constitution

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.870
or the Bill of Rights says.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.620
Without a federal
government committed to it,

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.250
they won't be enforced.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:54.540
- [Kim] So we've learned that

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.380
there were more than
200 proposed amendments

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.740
to the US Constitution,

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.694
that James Madison
whittled down to just 12.

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:05.420
Of those, only ten were ratified
at the time of the Framing.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.216
The unadopted amendments show us

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:11.320
just how important ratification
is to the amendment process.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.980
Even if an amendment is
proposed and passed by Congress

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.970
or a special convention of the states,

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.330
to become law, three-quarters
of the states must ratify it,

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.080
which is really hard to do.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.820
What do you think the next
Constitutional amendment will be?

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.120
The Equal Rights Amendment?

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.450
Representation for the
District of Columbia,

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.120
or something completely different?

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.840
To learn more about the Bill of Rights,
