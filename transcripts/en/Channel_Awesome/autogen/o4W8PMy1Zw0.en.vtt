when I saw it I wasn't ready to get it

when I saw it I wasn't ready to get it
 

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.080
when I saw it I wasn't ready to get it
because I think I was his age you know I

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:15.090
because I think I was his age you know I
 

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.990
because I think I was his age you know I
was about like maybe 15

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.000
was about like maybe 15
 

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.340
was about like maybe 15
seeing something like that I was not

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:18.350
seeing something like that I was not
 

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:19.810
seeing something like that I was not
ready to understand what the film was

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:19.820
ready to understand what the film was
 

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.450
ready to understand what the film was
trying to tell me but when I see it

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:22.460
trying to tell me but when I see it
 

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:26.040
trying to tell me but when I see it
years later it's something where now I

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.050
years later it's something where now I
 

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.290
years later it's something where now I
understand at age a little better and I

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:29.300
understand at age a little better and I
 

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.930
understand at age a little better and I
think part of the film is saying that

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:31.940
think part of the film is saying that
 

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.580
think part of the film is saying that
you know there is this pride issue when

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:33.590
you know there is this pride issue when
 

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.760
you know there is this pride issue when
you're often that age and I think I was

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:36.770
you're often that age and I think I was
 

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:38.170
you're often that age and I think I was
going through that as well so I wasn't

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:38.180
going through that as well so I wasn't
 

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.570
going through that as well so I wasn't
ready to catch on but now as an adult I

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:40.580
ready to catch on but now as an adult I
 

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.080
ready to catch on but now as an adult I
do catch on and it is a very tough film

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.090
do catch on and it is a very tough film
 

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:47.320
do catch on and it is a very tough film
to watch now because of it especially I

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:47.330
to watch now because of it especially I
 

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.820
to watch now because of it especially I
think it's very clever you start off

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:48.830
think it's very clever you start off
 

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.440
think it's very clever you start off
knowing what's going to happen to the

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:50.450
knowing what's going to happen to the
 

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:51.970
knowing what's going to happen to the
main characters at the very beginning

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:51.980
main characters at the very beginning
 

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.800
main characters at the very beginning
usually that that would give a lot away

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:53.810
usually that that would give a lot away
 

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.590
usually that that would give a lot away
but I think knowing that and watching

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:56.600
but I think knowing that and watching
 

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.970
but I think knowing that and watching
these characters and knowing they're

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:57.980
these characters and knowing they're
 

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.040
these characters and knowing they're
like they're fine they're just you know

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:00.050
like they're fine they're just you know

stories where people can push themselves
 

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.660
stories where people can push themselves
to death or make choices where they

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:16.670
to death or make choices where they
 

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.400
to death or make choices where they
should have backed off they should have

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:18.410

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.440
should have backed off they should have
dropped the sword they should have been

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:20.450

defeat there's a really great scene in

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:25.910
defeat there's a really great scene in
 

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.490
defeat there's a really great scene in
here where they find out that they've

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:27.500
here where they find out that they've
 

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.500
here where they find out that they've
lost the war and the boy just can't

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:29.510

and that really says a lot about him I

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:32.690
and that really says a lot about him I
 

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.410
and that really says a lot about him I
think that says so much about the

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:35.420
think that says so much about the
 

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.510
think that says so much about the
character because he isn't just I mean

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:37.520
character because he isn't just I mean
 

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.520
character because he isn't just I mean
it's understandable to be upset but he

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:39.530
it's understandable to be upset but he
 

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.070
it's understandable to be upset but he
isn't proud that the suffering is done

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:42.080
isn't proud that the suffering is done
 

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.350
isn't proud that the suffering is done
and that the people you know can now

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:44.360
and that the people you know can now
 

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.630
and that the people you know can now
sort of breathe again and he doesn't

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:46.640
sort of breathe again and he doesn't
 

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.310
sort of breathe again and he doesn't
have to hide and so I mean it's like he

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.320
have to hide and so I mean it's like he
 

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.140
have to hide and so I mean it's like he
just can't believe they lost I mean that

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:50.150
just can't believe they lost I mean that
 

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.470
just can't believe they lost I mean that
incredible dishonor that is there so I

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:53.480

think it's something where you kind of
 

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.280
think it's something where you kind of
see that aid very much but the the

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:00.290
see that aid very much but the the
 

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.260
see that aid very much but the the
passion of that age but also the

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:02.270
passion of that age but also the
 

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.140
passion of that age but also the
downside of where that passion can lead

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:04.150
downside of where that passion can lead
 

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:08.770
downside of where that passion can lead
and who it can really damage so it's but

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:08.780
and who it can really damage so it's but
 

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.870
and who it can really damage so it's but

these kids with this very distinct
strange thing that she doesn't

00:18:30.419 --> 00:18:30.429
strange thing that she doesn't
 

00:18:30.429 --> 00:18:32.159
strange thing that she doesn't
understand because apparently it's never

00:18:32.159 --> 00:18:32.169
understand because apparently it's never
 

00:18:32.169 --> 00:18:33.570

really happened before at least not that

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:33.580
really happened before at least not that
 

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.230

she knows of uh and trying to figure out

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.240
she knows of uh and trying to figure out
 

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.060
she knows of uh and trying to figure out
what's right what's wrong what's the

them develop and good God so many things

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:45.340
them develop and good God so many things
 

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.799
them develop and good God so many things
with that idea and I feel like it just

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:46.809
with that idea and I feel like it just
 

00:18:46.809 --> 00:18:48.779
with that idea and I feel like it just
takes advantage of everything that can

00:18:48.779 --> 00:18:48.789
takes advantage of everything that can
 

00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:51.330
takes advantage of everything that can
with that idea it's not an action film

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:51.340
with that idea it's not an action film
 

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.499
with that idea it's not an action film
it's not uh you know trying to show off

00:18:54.499 --> 00:18:54.509
it's not uh you know trying to show off
 

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:57.690
it's not uh you know trying to show off
you know any cool fighting scenes or

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:57.700
you know any cool fighting scenes or
 

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.769
you know any cool fighting scenes or
anything like that or any cool

00:18:58.769 --> 00:18:58.779
anything like that or any cool
 

00:18:58.779 --> 00:19:01.200
anything like that or any cool
transformations it's very much about

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:01.210
transformations it's very much about
 

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.360
transformations it's very much about
trying to raise kids and in this case

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:03.370
trying to raise kids and in this case
 

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:07.169
trying to raise kids and in this case
you know it's kids that have this see

00:19:07.169 --> 00:19:07.179
you know it's kids that have this see
 

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:08.399
you know it's kids that have this see
here's why I love it too you can't

00:19:08.399 --> 00:19:08.409
here's why I love it too you can't
 

00:19:08.409 --> 00:19:10.740
here's why I love it too you can't
really say disability you can't really

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:10.750
really say disability you can't really
 

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.320
really say disability you can't really
say anything's wrong or right it's just

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:13.330
say anything's wrong or right it's just
 

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.110
say anything's wrong or right it's just
they're different and it's trying to

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.120
they're different and it's trying to
 

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.480
they're different and it's trying to
utilize those differences to how it's

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:18.490
utilize those differences to how it's
 

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.610
utilize those differences to how it's
going to help them best and how it's

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:20.620
going to help them best and how it's
 

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.039
going to help them best and how it's
going to help shape and discover their

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:23.049
going to help shape and discover their
 

00:19:23.049 --> 00:19:27.269
going to help shape and discover their
identity and I think what makes that so

00:19:27.269 --> 00:19:27.279
identity and I think what makes that so
 

00:19:27.279 --> 00:19:29.100
identity and I think what makes that so
good in this film and so surprising

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:29.110
good in this film and so surprising
 

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.810
good in this film and so surprising
again without giving away too much is

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:30.820
again without giving away too much is
 

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.200
again without giving away too much is
that there's a very strong shift in the

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:34.210
that there's a very strong shift in the
 

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.169
that there's a very strong shift in the
kids like as they grow up you kind of

00:19:37.169 --> 00:19:37.179
kids like as they grow up you kind of
 

00:19:37.179 --> 00:19:39.450
kids like as they grow up you kind of
see them growing up in most films when

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:39.460
see them growing up in most films when
 

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.789
see them growing up in most films when
you see kids growing up they're sort of

00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:41.799
you see kids growing up they're sort of
 

00:19:41.799 --> 00:19:45.029
you see kids growing up they're sort of
set up their characteristics are set up

00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039
set up their characteristics are set up
 

00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:46.710
set up their characteristics are set up
very very young and then they just kind

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720
very very young and then they just kind
 

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.990
very very young and then they just kind
of let them expand as they get older and

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000
of let them expand as they get older and
 

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.269
of let them expand as they get older and
yeah you think it's how growing up works

00:19:51.269 --> 00:19:51.279
yeah you think it's how growing up works
 

00:19:51.279 --> 00:19:54.119
yeah you think it's how growing up works
but this film is very clever in that it

00:19:54.119 --> 00:19:54.129
but this film is very clever in that it
 

00:19:54.129 --> 00:19:56.340
but this film is very clever in that it
kind of finds this one moment to

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:56.350
kind of finds this one moment to
 

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.450
kind of finds this one moment to
suddenly

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:57.460
suddenly
 

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.370
suddenly
this very strong shift like this

00:19:59.370 --> 00:19:59.380
this very strong shift like this
 

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.320
this very strong shift like this
incident happens to one of the kids and

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:01.330
incident happens to one of the kids and
 

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.710
incident happens to one of the kids and
it very quickly kind of transforms them

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720
it very quickly kind of transforms them
 

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.830
it very quickly kind of transforms them
a little bit but you see it you see very

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840
a little bit but you see it you see very
 

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.200
a little bit but you see it you see very
slowly how the transformation sort of

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:10.210
slowly how the transformation sort of
 

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:13.139
slowly how the transformation sort of
leaves an impact on the kid and the rest

00:20:13.139 --> 00:20:13.149
leaves an impact on the kid and the rest
 

00:20:13.149 --> 00:20:15.750
leaves an impact on the kid and the rest
of the family and just that slow kind of

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760
of the family and just that slow kind of
 

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.779
of the family and just that slow kind of
change and what the kid is becoming and

00:20:18.779 --> 00:20:18.789
change and what the kid is becoming and
 

00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:21.090
change and what the kid is becoming and
through both physically and in identity

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:21.100
through both physically and in identity
 

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.210
through both physically and in identity
and it was very much you know majority

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:24.220
and it was very much you know majority
 

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.769
and it was very much you know majority
of the time you know the disc it was

00:20:25.769 --> 00:20:25.779
of the time you know the disc it was
 

00:20:25.779 --> 00:20:27.570
of the time you know the disc it was
this way this kid was that way and as

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:27.580
this way this kid was that way and as
 

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.889
this way this kid was that way and as
what we were getting and then the serve

00:20:28.889 --> 00:20:28.899
what we were getting and then the serve
 

00:20:28.899 --> 00:20:31.620
what we were getting and then the serve
change happens and people forget that

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:31.630
change happens and people forget that
 

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:34.980
change happens and people forget that
happens a lot with kids especially when

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:34.990
happens a lot with kids especially when
 

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.060
happens a lot with kids especially when
they're hitting like their teen years

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:36.070
they're hitting like their teen years
 

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.250
they're hitting like their teen years
there's sort of this very strong change

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:38.260
there's sort of this very strong change
 

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.220
there's sort of this very strong change
that happens some don't some stay very

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:41.230
that happens some don't some stay very
 

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:42.750
that happens some don't some stay very
similar they just you know it gets

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:42.760
similar they just you know it gets
 

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.490
similar they just you know it gets
smarter or add a few things take away a

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:44.500
smarter or add a few things take away a
 

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.289
smarter or add a few things take away a
few things but with some there can be

00:20:46.289 --> 00:20:46.299
few things but with some there can be
 

00:20:46.299 --> 00:20:49.110
few things but with some there can be
just this super out of nowhere change

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120
just this super out of nowhere change
 

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.299
just this super out of nowhere change
that happens and I never see that in

00:20:51.299 --> 00:20:51.309
that happens and I never see that in
 

00:20:51.309 --> 00:20:53.460
that happens and I never see that in
movies I always sort of see you see

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:53.470
movies I always sort of see you see
 

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:54.960
movies I always sort of see you see
where everything kinda comes from it's

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:54.970
where everything kinda comes from it's
 

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.019
where everything kinda comes from it's
this gradual of evolving of the

00:20:58.019 --> 00:20:58.029
this gradual of evolving of the
 

00:20:58.029 --> 00:20:59.820
this gradual of evolving of the
characters of the kid growing up and

00:20:59.820 --> 00:20:59.830
characters of the kid growing up and
 

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.649
characters of the kid growing up and
stuff like that but still kind of the

00:21:01.649 --> 00:21:01.659
stuff like that but still kind of the
 

00:21:01.659 --> 00:21:03.570
stuff like that but still kind of the
same character you know just now they

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:03.580
same character you know just now they
 

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.399
same character you know just now they
have to grow up and be tougher or

00:21:05.399 --> 00:21:05.409
have to grow up and be tougher or
 

00:21:05.409 --> 00:21:07.320

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.320
animation or motion it really feels like
it's moving and this is long before CG I

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:02.330
it's moving and this is long before CG I
 

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:04.580
it's moving and this is long before CG I
would actually almost even argue that

animes uh there's something about the

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:09.690
animes uh there's something about the
 

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.420
animes uh there's something about the
still shots and the angles they had to

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:11.430
still shots and the angles they had to
 

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:12.680
still shots and the angles they had to
get they had to be a little bit more

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:12.690
get they had to be a little bit more
 

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:14.120
get they had to be a little bit more
clever and they had to get that precise

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:14.130
clever and they had to get that precise
 

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.190
clever and they had to get that precise
angle and the precise shadows where it

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200
angle and the precise shadows where it
 

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.100
angle and the precise shadows where it
