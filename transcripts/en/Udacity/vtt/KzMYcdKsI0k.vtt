Okay. The answer is the sex cells, because those cells only have half of a

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.650
person's genomic information. And in addition, because

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.680
of recombination that information is in a different

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.178
order from the DNA in the rest of the cells. And so, we choose to

00:00:16.178 --> 00:00:18.391
use DNA from other cell types, if

00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:22.190
we want to really get Matt's full genomic information.
