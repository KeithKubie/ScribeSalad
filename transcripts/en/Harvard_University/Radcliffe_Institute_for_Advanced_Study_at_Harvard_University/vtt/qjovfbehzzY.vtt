00:00:00.954 --> 00:00:03.816
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:10.860
-Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.610
And thank you for your time.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.380
Thank you, Radcliffe Institute
and the generous donors

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.947
of my fellowship for the
wonderful opportunity.

00:00:21.947 --> 00:00:23.530
Thank you, Radcliffe,
also for funding

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.250
me for the exploratory seminar.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.230
Paul is not here.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.630
Thank you.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.170
It was a cherry on the cake.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.060
Thank you, Liz and Judy,
for your leadership

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.460
and stead in this
tremendous program.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.710
Thank you, Sharon and Rebecca.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.510
Thank you, Paul and
Asma, for all the help

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.760
you rendered to us.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.290
Thank you, Mervi, Katie, and,
yes, thank you, Margarita.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.040
Thank you, Michael
Fischer, for leading me

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.720
to this wonderful place.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.600
Thank you, fellow Fellows,
for your fellowship

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.850
and the great presentations
you've made thus far.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.320
I hope I don't return
you disappointed today.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.240
Thank you, Reginald, for all
the sacrifices you have made,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.370
and I'm making it public.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.310
Well, I've been thinking how
best to bring you, though.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.840
My job is significantly easy now
of what Judy has already said,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.850
how to bring this book in such
a short period of time to you.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.360
I'm reminded here of
an [INAUDIBLE] poet who

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.860
tells his beloved that, should
you like, I will tell you--

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.680
I will justify the title.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.070
Telling the entire tale
would take a lifetime.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.170
Let me then briefly
justify my title.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.730
And I'm reading
this because I'm not

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.560
a scholar of art and literature.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.320
Therefore, I find
prose very difficult.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.240
I'm very good at other things.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.150
The book Life in
the Himalaya reveals

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.670
Himalaya's past and
present in terms

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.610
of its natural and
cultural endowments

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.230
vis-a-vis contemporary
challenges it faces.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.080
I hope the book will bring this
important but much neglected

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.730
region into sharp
international focus.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.480
Life in the Himalaya
explores the mountain

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.850
in its four distinct stages.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.760
One, the natural
phase, which comprises

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.360
Himalaya's geobiological
consolidation and development

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.800
of human culture that symbolizes
moksha, or the salvation,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.400
salvation through human
expression of mountain temple

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.970
metaphor.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.790
It points to an
imminent human impulse

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.990
to reconstruct the
mountain and therefore

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.802
a yearning for ascension.

00:02:38.802 --> 00:02:41.010
The second phase, the cultural
phase, of the Himalaya

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.540
covers nomadic pastoral
communities for the last 15,000

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.620
years, and it reaches the climax
with commercial deforestation

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.810
during British raj, who
sowed the seeds of discontent

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.450
and conflict between the
people, the local communities,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.550
and the state.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.430
And then the third phase,
the mechanical phase,

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.020
which is marked by burgeoning
human population growth,

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.110
urbanization, and large-scale
infrastructure and dam

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.910
projects, which are causing
unprecedented ecosystem

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.500
degradation and
biological extinctions.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.590
And finally, the need for a
network phase, or networking

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.340
phase, which necessitates
information sharing

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.480
and institutional
cooperation in search

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.280
of the safe space
for the Himalaya.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.800
Now this is the
kind of a context.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.330
And before I get to
my slides, I also

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:43.010
want to read a para from
chapter two of my proposed book.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.500
This is titled "The
Lure Of the Mountain,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.390
Sacrifice and the
Moksha." "The Himalaya

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.150
predates the arrival
of humans on Earth,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.190
but celebration of its grandeur
is entrenched in the lore

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.250
and legend of the mountain.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.420
The Himalayan memoir
forms an integral part

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.560
of the shared
inheritance of Asia,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.570
where humans witnessed the
final phase of Himalaya

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.160
rise towards the end of
the Pleistocene glaciation.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.280
The grand spectacle that
unfolded before our ancestors'

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.270
eyes must have been an edifying
experience for the mind.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.529
Hindus often speak of such
experience in terms of Ananda,

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.510
which presages boundless sense
of fulfillment and peace.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.490
And it means much more
than joy and bliss.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.620
"The massive rock that
stands high above the ground

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.840
is not merely a
conglomeration of stone,

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.560
but to the worst
humanity, irrespective

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.170
of color, creed,
faith, and nationality,

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.200
it is a living magnet that pulls
the weak and the strong alike

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.720
towards it.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.700
The Himalaya's unequal vocal
exhortation by the visitor

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.130
goes beyond a simple description
of the scenic beauty,

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.080
the sparkling snowfields,
the flower tapestry

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.880
and the fragrance, the diversity
of life and its colors.

00:04:54.692 --> 00:04:56.400
The journey alone
elevates the experience

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.780
to a deeper understanding
and meaning of life."

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.130
The Himalayan legend
abounds in symbols

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.730
that underpin man's abiding
faith in the sacredness

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.880
and divinity of the mountain.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.970
Willi Unsoeld--" I'm not able
to pronounce it properly.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.540
It's Unsoeld.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.340
He was a Swiss-American,
the first American

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.500
to scale Mount
Everest in 1963, was

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.330
so enthralled by the divine
pull of Nanda Devi, which

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.650
is about 8,000 meters,
that he named his daughter

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.720
Nanda Devi after the mountain.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.830
Nanda Devi Unsoeld was
a proficient mountaineer

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.140
and accompanied her father
on several such mountain

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.650
expeditions.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.240
Sadly, during one
of the expeditions

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.610
to trek in Himalaya, young Nanda
Devi died on September 8, 1976,

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.620
at age 22.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.740
She had gone against
team physicians' advice

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.350
to go down to a lower level
because of the snowstorm.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.240
Nanda Devi was a
wildlife biology major

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.240
and had developed great
interest in conservation

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.020
of endangered species,
such as cats of the East.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.520
Even though she was averse
to mountain climbing

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.630
as a full-time vocation,
she felt almost mystical

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.150
about the climb she
was about to undertake.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.420
Before setting off for what
turned out to be her last time,

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.640
she told an interviewer,
which I quote here.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.300
"I can't describe it, but
there is something within me

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.740
about this mountain
ever since I was born."

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.730
Unquote.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.470
Willi Unsoeld buried his
daughter around Camp 4

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.280
at 7,300 meters under the
snows of her namesake mountain.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.920
There is no way to verify
if Willi Unsoeld had known

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.510
that in Garhwal Himalaya
Nanda is metaphorically

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.920
used for daughters.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.640
My wife, when addressed as
Nanda by her grandmother,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.400
caught me by surprise
some years ago.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.400
Now let me now go to my slides.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.810
So this has already been
talked, so I will not.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.130
So let me go to the beginning.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.760
Why Himalaya?

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.520
What do we need to
know about Himalaya?

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.930
What is so important
about Himalaya?

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:11.030
What we need to appreciate is
that Himalaya, once it emerged,

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.870
changed the way
the Earth operated.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.740
So emergence of
Himalaya was, we know,

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.170
considered as one of the most
significant geophysical events

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.200
in a billion years,
in 100 million years.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.410
So it was remarkable.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:34.010
And one of the significances
was that Himalaya,

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.910
just at the beginning
of Cenozoic,

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.300
it started a global
cooling effect.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.460
So Earth completely cooled.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.780
And the reason was that this
massive land surface, which

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.300
is just about 4% of the
world's land surface,

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.700
it contributes to 85%
of global sediment flux.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.610
So a lot of chemical
weathering of rocks

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:04.250
uses up silicate, which takes
up lots of carbon dioxide,

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.950
and then it is
buried under ocean.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.940
Therefore, once there
is huge carbon dioxide

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:15.660
withdrawal from the atmosphere,
then there's global cooling.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.430
Geologically, it is the youngest
and the tallest mountain.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.850
Biologically, it is the longest
bioclimatic elevation gradient.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.950
Hydrologically, this is the
most elaborate drainage network

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.270
of 10 basins.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.740
And it's a global
biodiversity hot spot

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:37.559
with most biodiverse biomes,
even more diverse than others.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.789
The least known
scientifically, unfortunately.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.415
There is high species and
human culture diversity.

00:08:42.415 --> 00:08:44.850
One thing which I
want to pause here.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.380
I was surprised while I was
researching for this book

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.870
that the entirety within
plateau, which is thousands

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:58.040
of squares of kilometers, has
just about five or six dialects

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.850
spoken in this entire
from west to east.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.470
But if you come down to the
southern declivity of Himalaya,

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.960
there are 800-plus
dialects spoken.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.040
In fact, there is a joke
in Arunachal Pradesh,

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.702
if you cross the
river, you'll not

00:09:11.702 --> 00:09:13.160
be able to understand
the other guy

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.340
on the other side of the bank.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.210
So so much of diversity.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.700
And so 10 major diverse systems.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.250
These also report as third pole
because it has the largest ice

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.700
fields outside of the
polar regions, 1,600

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.000
square kilometers.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.860
Then 1 and 1/2 million
people live in its basins.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.290
And we believe that it is
the warmest mountain, warmest

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.907
of the mountains on Earth.

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:40.829
And [INAUDIBLE] my home.

00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:45.240
And thirdly, it is also the
most militarized mountain

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.550
in the world.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.220
So the oldest
description of Himalaya

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.090
goes back to
Kumara-Sambhavan of Kalidasa.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.870
And I have absolutely no idea.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:05.320
2,500 years ago, how did
this guy, who was a poet,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.390
he says that this is the
only mountain on Earth

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.490
which sings to the eastern
and the western seas.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:15.640
And this is, of course-- then he
writes of all the great poetry.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.291
But this was in
fifth century BC.

00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:22.460
And when the first of
these satellite images

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.640
came and then people
realized, indeed, this

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.550
is the only mountain
which exactly--

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.595
if you go to the east,
then through Uttarakhand,

00:10:29.595 --> 00:10:33.650
you must then go down almost
touching the Pacific Ocean.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.640
And on the western
side through Hindu Kush

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.350
and the Suleiman ranges to
the Caucasus almost touch,

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.170
they do touch the western sea.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.650
I have no idea that how did he
do it, what kind of mechanism

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:46.690
he had to know it.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:50.890
So possibly I think poets
have that strange vision which

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.460
scientists lack.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.980
Ross, that makes you happy.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.180
Now going to the
birth of Himalaya,

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.960
I call it tectonic
serendipity because, as you

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.080
can see, about 225
million years ago

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.940
India was part of
this Gondwanaland.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:13.500
And this is the only Southern
Hemisphere craton or plate

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.640
which started a
northward journey.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:23.600
And it made a journey of
4,000 miles at varying speeds,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.070
from 4 and 1/2 centimeters,
4 and 1/2 centimeters

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.780
to 18 centimeters.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:34.090
And then docked itself here
just below the Eurasian Plate.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:42.260
And once it docked-- this
is the Eurasian Plate

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.270
and this is the
approaching Indian Plate.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.770
In between is the Tethys Sea.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.200
So slowly, when the Indian Plate
approached the Eurasian Plate,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.910
got docked under
it because it was

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.510
a denser plate, got submerged.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:57.220
And tectonic forces, then
this is how it got lifted,

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.980
and that's how
Himalaya were born.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:11:59.830
I'm simplifying it.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.820
Therefore, people suggested that
it was a continental collision.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.410
So sometimes
collisions are good.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.090
It's not bad.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.650
It's not such a bad idea.

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:18.630
So therefore, once
these tectonic processes

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:24.680
were completed, they led
to landform evolution,

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.350
but at the same
time there became

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.370
this huge wall,
this mountain wall,

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.460
became barrier to
moist winds, which were

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.600
coming from the Indian Ocean.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.580
Therefore, for the
first time-- one

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.510
of the most beautiful seasons
in India is called monsoon.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.150
There's nothing on this
world like monsoon.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.730
So first time
Indian subcontinent

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.590
experienced the
rainfalls of the monsoon

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.720
about 20 million to 10 million
years ago, there is a lot of,

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.220
you know.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.530
And once the elevational
gradient became high,

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.860
you had these glaciers.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.460
So you have monsoons,
you have glaciers.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.990
And then once you have glaciers,
there are perennial rivers.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:12.100
And once this stage is
set, the humans arrive.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.650
This is such remarkable--
and I will come to it--

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.180
I am not for a moment suggesting
that there is some design,

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.460
intelligent design.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.910
But what was
happening that nothing

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.420
was happening till Miocene?

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.180
What was happening, of course,
is that Himalaya, once it got

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:33.440
docked under the
Asian Plate, it became

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.930
a sort of international
biological highway.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:41.620
So by that time
it was still warm,

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.900
so you had large number of
species coming as far as North

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.430
America, going through, and
then crossing this Indochinese

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:55.550
plateau, and going up
to Japan and vice versa.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.280
So a kind of an
international exchange

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.720
happened because of Himalaya.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.850
That's part one.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:08.090
Part two is that recent
genetic studies now

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:14.420
confirm that the evolution and
being the Indian subcontinent

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.440
played an extremely
important role to the march

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.940
of human civilization.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.597
But for it, human
civilization wouldn't

00:14:21.597 --> 00:14:22.680
have progressed beyond it.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.540
This is a paper in Science
where they would clearly say,

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.600
I wanted to see that what
if India wasn't there?

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.720
How can we-- so I,
of course-- so this

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.440
is how it looks without India.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.520
So India is not here.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.272
So India still is not here.

00:14:43.272 --> 00:14:46.760
And now humans cannot cross
this Arabian Peninsula,

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.620
go north because it is Ice Age.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.260
Ice Age, which
lasted throughout.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.880
So there was no way.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.550
So what happened was
therefore, so we bring India

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.420
back here, OK?

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.500
So by magic India comes in.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:08.300
So once India comes here,
it forms a complete terrain,

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.410
terrestrial connectivity between
oceans which are separated.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:17.060
And then they proliferate
all over the world.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.970
I'm not again suggesting that,
if Indian Plate was not there

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.600
or Himalaya were not
there, human civilization

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.810
couldn't have progressed.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.390
But surely it
would have got, you

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.490
know, delayed by
25,000 years minimum.

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:30.990
OK?

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:34.270
So you can imagine where
it would have been now.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.700
I will go through this
quickly because this

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:40.680
is how a simple mountain
chain can be transformed

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.300
into complex physiography.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.940
I do not want, again, go
into geophysical details

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:49.700
but simply to tell you that--
imagine a mountain slope.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.270
OK?

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:53.040
So small pressure from below,
which is the tectonic force.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.130
And the river and
glaciers, they act as saws.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.450
And so this is
how it looks like.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:02.570
So a river cuts a
V-shaped valley,

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:05.730
and a glacier makes what is
called a U-shaped valley.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.340
So Himalaya is only
about V-shaped valleys

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.850
and U-shaped valleys.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.470
So from a simple structure it
became a complex topography.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.440
So you have at the end of, as
I said, at the end of Miocene

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.270
and Pleistocene, so you have
all kinds of species coming

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:28.880
from North America, China,
Europe, Mediterranean,

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.650
all places.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:33.300
And then agriculture
started about 4,000,

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.870
5,000, 6,000 years ago.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.670
So this is the kind of
profile that Himalaya

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:43.294
came to have in the
eastern and western side.

00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:44.710
There's a little
bit of difference

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.290
between east and west
because, as you can see here,

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:51.580
the western side is 34
degrees north latitude.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.490
This is 24 degrees.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.140
So there's a 10-degree
difference between latitude.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.280
Therefore, there is a
little bit of difference

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.630
between eastern and
western Himalaya.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.710
But general profile, this is how
the general profile of Himalaya

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:03.810
looks like.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.990
So coming to part two.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.800
I know I have to cover a lot of
ground, so I'm doing it fast.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.672
So these are some
of the drivers.

00:17:11.672 --> 00:17:14.130
Of course, there are global,
there are regional, and local.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.940
I will mostly
concentrate on some

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.099
of the local and
regional drivers.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:22.380
So the first one is this
burgeoning human population

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.300
that Judy talked about.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.579
So you have, in the Himalaya,
in the Himalayan region

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:32.130
across the countries, India,
Pakistan, China, or Tibet

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.080
or some.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.930
So 2.8 times to four
times there is an increase

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:37.915
in the last 50 years.

00:17:37.915 --> 00:17:40.140
So much population
growth in that region,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.270
which has a low carrying
capacity, expanding

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.740
agriculture, and
expanding settlements.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.010
Whether these are
mountain tops or valleys,

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.220
they are full of people.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.080
Therefore, that is
putting a lot of pressure.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.252
Now you make houses fine.

00:17:54.252 --> 00:17:55.710
But you look at
traditional houses.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.630
This was a paper which I
published some years ago.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.730
This is a traditional
kind of a village.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.930
So you have mostly traditional
stone masonry and wood

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:04.890
structures.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.470
The houses are much
broader than tall.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:11.600
Therefore they can withstand
earthquakes and things

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.110
like that.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:16.740
But you have today these
shanties coming up, which

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.350
are mostly reinforced cement
concrete structures, which

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:25.350
add to what is called the
urban heat island effect.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:30.720
And yeah, so other major
problem with the Himalaya

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.490
was that in about 2003,
first set of India reports,

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.170
forests of India
reports came, and they

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:40.380
started claiming that Himalayan
forests were increasing indeed.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.420
And if you can see
the Garmin data,

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.510
this is how the Garmin data is.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.970
So it's increasing.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.690
So as a regular
visitor to Himalaya,

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.690
I found this rather
disconcerting that agriculture

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.960
is expanding, human
settlements are expanding,

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.370
all kind of infrastructure
is expanding.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.980
Unless Earth is elastic, you
can't have forests expanding.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.110
So there must be
something wrong with it.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.410
So I started this work.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.700
This was almost
literally back-breaking.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.900
So you had almost 370
such pieces to exactly one

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.090
by one from east to west to do.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:18.030
And we did this.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.440
And what we found
was that there was

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.730
massive deforestation in the
Himalaya, across the Himalaya.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.640
And you can see, this is a
closeup picture you can see.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.170
In 1970, these
were dense forests.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.530
And you can see here.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:34.060
So camera doesn't lie.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.650
So most of these
dense forests were

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:40.250
converted into open forests,
so deforestation was going on.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.784
The second unfortunate problem
we found is that, as I said,

00:19:42.784 --> 00:19:44.200
it's in a highly
militarized zone.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.890
I have no time to go
to the politics of it.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:51.690
But simply to tell you that
no ecology, no ecologists,

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.330
no biologists, nobody
has even looked

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:57.310
at the impact of
roughly 10 million to 13

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:02.170
million individuals living
there in that mountain space.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.610
What kind of impact it's
having, nobody knows.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.500
But I'll just start.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.960
What impact it had
was that you must

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.600
be aware of China-Tibet
engagement in 1950s.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.240
So one thing which
China did to begin with

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.750
was to have a massive
road network built

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.390
in the entire region.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.450
And which culminated
recently in what

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:28.230
I-- this is a chapter in my book
called "First Train to Lhasa."

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.670
And therefore, this
was essentially

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.040
to sustain the military's
kind of infrastructure

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:34.950
which was there.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:38.390
And India wanted road for road.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:41.160
So because there
was a massive defeat

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.199
which India suffered in 1962
war at the hands of China.

00:20:45.199 --> 00:20:47.490
So there was a lot of pressure
on the Indian government

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.220
that we should have a
large number of roads.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:54.570
Be that as it may, so
roads infrastructure

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.097
started coming up.

00:20:56.097 --> 00:20:58.180
There's another chapter,
which I call "Streetcar."

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.400
At that point of
time in 1970s, we

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.110
had Mrs. Gandhi as
the prime minister.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:10.360
Her son was another very,
very nice gentleman.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:16.070
So he wanted to
revolutionize motor vehicle

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:17.150
industry in India.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.610
So he started a company called
Maruti at that point of time.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.620
Unfortunately, he did
not live to see that.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.460
He died in an air crash.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.400
But subsequently Maruti did.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:31.220
And Maruti changed the
complete landscape of Himalaya.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.340
Now this again,
nobody talks about it.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:39.750
You can see till about 1980,
you have about 25,000 cars

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.230
being manufactured in India.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:45.440
And suddenly after '80 you
can see this boom going up.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.770
And then what it had--
once you have roads,

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:51.710
once you have a nice little car
which can take four, five, six

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.700
people to close-by mountain,
then most of the people

00:21:54.700 --> 00:22:01.460
living in the towns and
cities near Himalaya,

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:06.210
so everybody on a weekend
would just put father,

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:10.080
mother, maybe two children,
just go, and go to Himalaya.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.740
And what it-- and
of course, as Judy

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.990
said, that this neoreligious
awakening in Himalaya.

00:22:20.046 --> 00:22:22.330
Pardon me by saying
so, but if Muslims

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.180
can go to hajj, why can't
we go to our destination?

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:29.000
So a massive movement of
people across the Himalaya.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.390
Fortunately, unfortunately,
most of our gods,

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.470
they chose Himalaya.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.436
We are pursuing them even there.

00:22:37.436 --> 00:22:39.180
We are not leaving them alone.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:39.720
OK.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.200
So the consequence
in scientific terms

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:47.060
was that now you had a lot of
vehicles going into the region.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:52.950
And this carbon black
and other pollutants

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.715
are increasing heavy.

00:22:54.715 --> 00:22:55.750
Now look here.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.340
You can see this is
Satopanth Glacier.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.270
Satopanth Glacier
is the glacier which

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:04.160
is very close to where from
Ganga or Ganges comes out.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.160
Now you have roughly
3.6 or 116 times higher

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.010
than Arctic and Antarctic
the black carbon levels.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:16.630
You can imagine in those
deep, high valleys of Himalaya

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.300
you have such huge
amounts of carbon black.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.140
And the consequence is that
the glaciers are now melting

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.230
because of carbon black.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:25.870
It absorbs the
light much faster,

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:28.735
and therefore the
glacier recession

00:23:28.735 --> 00:23:31.770
has started in a big, big way.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:36.590
So the fourth problem is what
I call in a chapter called

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:38.610
"Dam Rivers Damn Rivers."

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:43.440
So in that these are
a couple of works

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.470
which we published where
we find that Himalaya

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.810
is likely to have the highest
dam densities in the world.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:52.630
That means that for every
kilometer or every 14

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.710
kilometers, there's
going to be a dam.

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:56.890
Every 14 kilometers in length.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.660
And other places it is anywhere
between 57 to 70 kilometers.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:06.270
Once upon a time graph
talked about America

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.280
being a dam nation.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.760
But India and China are soon
going to replace America

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.800
as a dam nation, dam nations.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.913
So we have today, we have today
nearly 1,300 dams on two sides

00:24:18.913 --> 00:24:20.520
of the Himalaya coming out.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:25.620
So about 550 dams in India,
Pakistan, Nepal, and Bhutan

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.100
and then roughly about
750 across Tibet.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.070
So we're looking at
something called 1,300 dams.

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.100
You can imagine if somebody
after five or six years or 10

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.290
years took a satellite
picture, so Himalaya would look

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.280
like a moth-eaten Himalaya.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.360
Only small ponds and rivers
flowing through turbines

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.470
or [INAUDIBLE] inside.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:47.330
There's no water.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:50.320
You'll never see now those
waters coming through.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.800
So that's one.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.200
We were also interested
that, after all,

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.820
where were these dams located.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.051
What kind of conflict they had
with the biological diversity

00:25:00.051 --> 00:25:00.550
of Himalaya.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.400
And this is an
unrelated work which

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.160
we were doing at that time.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.340
This was purely
an academic work,

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.850
that how species are
distributed across the Himalaya,

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.040
does it mean that all
species occur everywhere.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.190
But what we found was that
across the taxonomic groups,

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:19.400
whether they are mammals and
fish or birds, butterflies,

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.540
and plants.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.275
So you have these mid-altitudes
or mid-elevations where you

00:25:24.275 --> 00:25:26.180
have maximum number of species.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.590
And when we superimposed hydro
projects or dams on them,

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:32.110
we found there was
a perfect overlap.

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:35.060
I'm sure that nobody had
designed it that way,

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:38.050
but it turned out to be this
was an unfortunate overlap.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:42.833
And therefore what
we-- so this is how,

00:25:42.833 --> 00:25:45.449
these are pictures of the dams.

00:25:45.449 --> 00:25:47.240
Then we got to look
at, OK, all right, this

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.865
is happening to
terrestrial ecosystems.

00:25:48.865 --> 00:25:52.020
What's happening to
the rivers themselves?

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:56.500
So what we found was
in summary that, if you

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.040
have more water in a river
at a given point of time,

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.260
you are likely to have
more number of species

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.740
in that river, fish species.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.950
If you decrease the quantum
of water yield in the river,

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.480
then the species
richness in that river

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.160
will significantly go down.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.070
That's part one.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:15.620
Part two is this was a recent
work which we published

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:21.150
about two months back that
some of the endemic species

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:24.280
are almost getting--
they are going

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.210
extinct from large
number of Himalayan

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:30.290
rivers because of dams
and also water withdrawal.

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.090
So whether it is
terrestrial ecosystems

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.370
or aquatic ecosystems
like rivers,

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:37.610
that is a problem everywhere.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:41.130
We did this study which we
use species [? relative to ?]

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:45.510
the models and predicted that
by the turn of the century

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:49.370
there would be just 10% of dense
forest left in the Himalaya

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:52.470
and nearly 25% of the endemic
species which are only

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:57.050
found in the Himalaya
would go extinct.

00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:03.240
Now part third of my talk is the
lead motive of my being here.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.330
So by 2001, 2002, 2003, there
was a lot of talk going on.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.164
There's a new term.

00:27:09.164 --> 00:27:11.580
And that started developing
these-- they called themselves

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.740
climate change skeptics.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.810
And they started saying
that, oh, it's all hogwash,

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:19.360
there's no truth in it,
there's nothing [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:24.420
And when the endorsement
came from the top, then

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.920
it makes it all
the more serious.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:35.830
So at that point of time,
we were investigating this.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:40.810
And we were surprised
to find these plants.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:44.350
I have to say 120, 130
years, or 100 years.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.100
So it wasn't that surprising.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.170
But what was surprising was
that they were not located

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.750
where they were known earlier.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.060
They were located at
much higher elevations.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.910
At that point of time we
cautiously suggested that

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.670
possibly, because they were
finding cooler temperatures

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:03.970
higher, about 500 to 800
meters, so they had migrated.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:05.770
But we didn't have any proof.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.970
So naturally a
professor can do nothing

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:13.340
more than look for a graduate
student that was a zealot.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.730
So a zealot joined, and
she said, I will do it.

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.620
So we got together.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.960
We were lucky, actually.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.040
We were looking for
a historical data

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.430
set that, can we go back
possibly 150 or 130 years

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:29.890
and then revisit
those areas and then

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:33.390
see, then see comparatively
that, was there any change

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:33.900
happening?

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.770
We were, as I
said, we got lucky.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:41.770
We had two data sets, one
of Smith and Cave, 1911,

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:46.250
and then also 1872 of Hooker's.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:50.770
We looked at 124 endemic
species, 121 sampling

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:54.630
locations, and 625 study plots.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:29:00.360
These are the kind of areas
which we visited and studied.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.874
Yeah, so OK.

00:29:03.874 --> 00:29:06.810
So these are the kind of species
that we were looking for.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:08.640
These are only endemics.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.111
We took only endemics because
if we had projected species

00:29:13.111 --> 00:29:15.610
elevation range shifts, then
people could have criticized us

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.234
that you know this
species grows there,

00:29:17.234 --> 00:29:18.890
there, there, everywhere.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:23.340
So we took only endemic species,
grown only in those areas.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.690
These are-- OK, I'll
will not go here.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:30.370
So, and what we find indeed
is that exactly there

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:35.900
was a climate-induced elevation
range that a large number, most

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.540
of these species, almost
90% of the species,

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:44.234
had moved almost
800 to 1,000 meters.

00:29:44.234 --> 00:29:48.730
And then we also were lucky
that we had historic temperature

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:50.410
data sets of the seasons.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.350
What we found,
interestingly, was

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:55.040
that those summers
were relatively warmer,

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.550
but it was winters that
were more warm than usual.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:00.800
So that was one key finding.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.830
And what we also found was that
the lapse rate-- the lapse rate

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:06.710
means that every 100
meters you go up,

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:08.920
how much temperature in degrees.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.870
So the historic
lapse rate, which

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:14.510
was 1872 which
Hooker had recorded,

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:17.440
was 0.82 degrees
Celsius per 100 meters.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.570
What we found was 0.42.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.820
So almost half.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.670
So lapse rate.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:28.000
And then, as I said, more winter
warming than what was recorded.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.460
So what we found
was that now suppose

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:37.130
a species has this kind of
a range prior to warming,

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.720
now it had like this.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.165
So the range, elevation
ranges, had shortened,

00:30:42.165 --> 00:30:44.510
and they had been pushed up.

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:48.300
Now the problem was
that we also found

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:52.480
that species richness per
hectare had decreased.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.310
This problem was because
those species which

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:59.350
had area available to them
to colonize, they could go,

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.080
but there's a limit to space.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.050
So those which did not
have, they went extinct.

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:09.830
So a large number of species
went extinct in the Himalaya.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:14.170
So now the last part of the
talk is the payback time.

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:14.910
Look at this.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:16.150
This is what's happening.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:18.810
This is the Mutri Glacier
from where Ganges comes out.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:22.020
This is the 1780 level,
and this is 2001 level.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.960
And these are glaciers
across the Himalaya.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.190
You can see all glaciers
across the Himalaya

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:28.790
are showing recession
and decrease.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.540
This is an interesting
photograph of 1921 and 2009.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:39.290
You can see again
glaciers disappearing

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:40.680
and now glacier lakes coming.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.880
In our own studies we
found that, for example,

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.610
in [INAUDIBLE] Himalaya
we found that not only had

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.950
the number of glacier lakes
increased in the last 30 years,

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:51.933
but the volume of glacier
lakes, the volume of water

00:31:51.933 --> 00:31:53.650
had also increased.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:57.380
Now does Himalayan change
mean a global problem?

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:58.191
I think yes.

00:31:58.191 --> 00:31:59.190
Now what does this mean?

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:00.370
Now look at this.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.090
These are some of
the recent-- well,

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:08.090
the data is old but
the emphasis is new.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:11.970
You have a lot of whatever
increase in sea level

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:16.100
will happen it will happen
because of melting of ice.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:21.370
And these studies show that,
for every 100-meter rise,

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:25.720
35 centimeters will be
contributed by the recession

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.600
of Himalayan glaciers.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:32.160
Therefore, about 40 million
years back, Himalaya

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:36.620
played a key role in bringing
temperatures of entire Earth

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.490
down by several degrees.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.860
Now it is possible that
the Himalayan glaciers

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.560
will raise sea levels
significantly globally.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.690
Therefore it must concern
coastal Americans as much.

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:53.600
Now the cumulative
impacts of all this,

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.460
again, using species richness,
species/area relationship

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.300
models, we found what
will happen in each case.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.560
And this is a
depressing scenario,

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.410
that a large number of
species will go extinct.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:07.350
But more importantly, what
is happening in the Himalaya

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:12.580
is that these lovely alpine
meadows are disappearing.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:15.340
They're disappearing fast.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.590
You can see this is, again,
a kind of a modeling study

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:21.470
which we projected
in 2050, 2070 using

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.110
these representative
conservation

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:24.790
pathways of carbon dioxide.

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:27.680
You can see the shrubs
are increasing in extent

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.440
and herbs are slowly
decreasing in extent.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.460
This is how it looks,
the scenario, by 2070.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.460
You'll have very few herbaceous
communities and mostly

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.700
the shrub communities.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.450
This is how the
Valley of Flowers

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:47.460
looked in 1970s and late 1970s.

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.760
This is how it looks today.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:56.340
So you can see, a large number
of shrubs and woody plants

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.250
getting into these alpine.

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:02.130
Now what it means is that
this kind of disappearance

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.470
of alpine meadows
in the Himalaya

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:09.425
is sharply bringing in
conflict the people who

00:34:09.425 --> 00:34:11.909
are dependent on
these first resources.

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:13.570
So most of their
traditional medicine

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:17.050
comes from these
herbaceous plants.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:21.051
And most of their
spices, condiments,

00:34:21.051 --> 00:34:22.550
which they use in
their daily lives,

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.803
they still come from there.

00:34:24.803 --> 00:34:29.080
I have taken one
example of yak here.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.389
Yak is at the base
of the pyramid.

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:33.870
Now there's nothing
yak cannot do.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:38.989
In fact, the Himalayan highlands
were colonized by humans

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:40.880
only after they
could domesticate

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.040
or partially domesticate yak.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:47.460
Because yak gave,
whether it is dung,

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.340
whether it is cheese,
whether it is meat.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.070
And at times when it
becomes extremely--

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:54.449
when there's no water,
it gives them the blood.

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:57.430
They drink its blood.

00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:02.050
So even after death, the bones
are made into these nice pipes.

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:03.400
You can see.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.680
And the fat is used for lighting
lamps, whether in monasteries

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.380
or in houses.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.760
Or this nice wool.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.860
Or the under fur and the long
fur is used in making tents.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:20.000
Or sometimes if you wish,
you can have a nice wig.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.780
And then the combs to
take care of that wig.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.980
So therefore, this
particular animal

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:33.440
is central to that culture,
is central to that habitat

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.750
and ecosystem.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:36.580
If the grasses are gone.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:39.080
Because yak does not
know, yak doesn't

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.460
know how to eat shrubs,
rhododendron and select shrubs,

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:43.390
it just doesn't know.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:45.540
It only knows eating grass.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.900
And if grass goes,
then yak goes.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.910
If yak goes, a whole lot
of cultural extinction

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:56.090
will happen, which would
be a sad tragedy on Earth.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:59.730
Therefore, some years
back, again, I've

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.440
been getting lucky
several times in my life.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.460
So when the editors
of Nature accepted

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:08.990
that I should bring
this to the world focus,

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:12.400
I wrote an op-ed in Nature.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.340
And that's how I brought
this world focus,

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.710
and that's how Michael
Fischer got in touch with me

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:20.130
and that's how I came to
The Radcliffe Institute.

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:23.780
Finally, I just want
to end this talk

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:30.360
by quoting Emily Dickinson
and daughter of New England.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.180
This is called "God
Made a Little Gentian."

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.390
You must have been
sort of surmising,

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:36.862
why am I talking about gentian?

00:36:36.862 --> 00:36:38.320
What has gentian
got to do with it?

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.320
This is what it has got.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.110
It says, "God made
a little gentian.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:43.490
It tried to be a
rose and failed,

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:45.510
and all the summer laughed.

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:48.510
But just before the snows,
there came a purple creature

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.910
that ravished all the hill.

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:54.790
And summer hid her forehead
and mockery was still.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:56.330
The frosts were her condition.

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:58.170
The Tyrian would not come."

00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:59.147
Tyrian is this color.

00:36:59.147 --> 00:37:00.730
We have been talking
about this color.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:04.250
"The Tyrian would not come
until the North evoked it.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:06.750
'Creator, shall I bloom?'"

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:09.710
So the problem is we can
keep on fighting whether it

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:13.355
is one degree Celsius, two
degrees Celsius, or half

00:37:13.355 --> 00:37:14.190
a degree Celsius.

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:18.870
We can keep on discussing it
between climate doomsday sayers

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:20.610
and skeptics and what you have.

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:25.460
The problem is, does
North evoke the frost?

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.120
If North is unable
to evoke frost,

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.910
we will not have gentians,
we will not have grasses,

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.030
we will not have yak.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:38.760
If we do not have that, then
our own survival is in danger.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.430
Thank you for your
patient listening.

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:43.780
[APPLAUSE AND MUSIC PLAYING]
