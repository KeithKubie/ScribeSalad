00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:01.860
- [Instructor] As we've
mentioned in previous videos,

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.186
Hinduism is a very diverse religion,

00:00:04.186 --> 00:00:06.948
with many different practices,
and even different beliefs,

00:00:06.948 --> 00:00:11.035
but there is a core
centered around scripture.

00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:14.954
And the most important of
these texts are the Vedas.

00:00:14.954 --> 00:00:19.491
Now the word Veda literally
means knowledge in Sanskrit,

00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:21.467
and they were written
during the Vedic Period.

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:23.536
It was called the Vedic Period
because this was the time

00:00:23.536 --> 00:00:25.336
that we believe the Vedas were written,

00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:28.323
and we have a whole video
on the actual Vedic Period.

00:00:28.323 --> 00:00:31.101
Now there are four Vedas: Rigveda,

00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:34.963
Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharvaveda.

00:00:34.963 --> 00:00:37.373
The first of these is the Rigveda.

00:00:37.373 --> 00:00:39.226
When I say first, it's
because it's believed

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:41.380
that it was written
before the other Vedas,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.713
as early as 3,500 years ago.

00:00:45.326 --> 00:00:46.963
The other three are also pretty old,

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:49.963
probably older than 3,000 years old.

00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:54.933
Now these four texts are
a combination of rituals,

00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:59.266
of hymns, of mantras, of
songs, and of philosophy.

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:02.455
For example Rigveda, Rig you can translate

00:01:02.455 --> 00:01:05.979
as meaning praise, so it's
knowledge of ways to praise,

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.812
praise the eternal, or praise God.

00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:13.563
Yajurveda you could view
as these prose mantras,

00:01:13.563 --> 00:01:17.562
knowledge of these prose
mantras, is Yajurveda.

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:21.251
Samaveda, this is knowledge
of songs or hymns.

00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:24.963
Atharvaveda, you can view
these as knowledge of

00:01:24.963 --> 00:01:28.755
things that you should do in your life.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:31.219
Now these four texts can be sub-classified

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.969
into the type of text
that they actually are.

00:01:37.275 --> 00:01:39.539
So what you see here is
the sub-classification

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.882
of the Vedas that's often referenced,

00:01:41.882 --> 00:01:44.149
that amongst these texts some of the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.755
verses are mantras, hymns, prayers,

00:01:47.755 --> 00:01:49.747
those are referred to as Samhitas.

00:01:49.747 --> 00:01:51.785
You have the things that are more rituals,

00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:54.214
ceremonies, these are Aranyakas.

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:56.551
And Aranyakas are also
things being referred to,

00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:58.529
things that you have learned, or rituals

00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:01.479
to do in the forest, maybe at the time

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.377
when the Vedas were
written these were things

00:02:04.377 --> 00:02:07.439
that people would go meditate
and do in the forest.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.648
You have the Upanishads, which means

00:02:09.648 --> 00:02:12.065
to sit close to, or sit near.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.143
And if you look at the Upanishads,

00:02:15.143 --> 00:02:19.415
it really is referring to
sitting close, or near a teacher,

00:02:19.415 --> 00:02:22.338
there's a lot of dialog
between student and teacher.

00:02:22.338 --> 00:02:24.135
And the Upanishads, in particular,

00:02:24.135 --> 00:02:28.286
really form the spiritual
core of Hinduism,

00:02:28.286 --> 00:02:31.375
it really focuses around
spiritual philosophy.

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:35.542
And amongst these four Vedas,
there are 108 Upanishads,

00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:40.336
and 108 is considered a very
auspicious number in Hinduism.

00:02:40.336 --> 00:02:43.247
Now you also have Brahmanas,
which are commentary.

00:02:43.247 --> 00:02:46.815
Now to be clear, there
are verses in the Vedas

00:02:46.815 --> 00:02:48.888
that can be many of these,

00:02:48.888 --> 00:02:50.654
that can be Aranyakas and Upanishads,

00:02:50.654 --> 00:02:54.237
so these things are
not mutually exclusive.

00:02:55.478 --> 00:02:59.510
Now in the Hindu tradition,
one of the unifying factors

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.517
are the Vedas and the sub-classifications,

00:03:02.517 --> 00:03:04.525
or sub-categorizations of the Vedas,

00:03:04.525 --> 00:03:08.416
these are often viewed
as divine revelations.

00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:09.614
Even though the Vedas themselves,

00:03:09.614 --> 00:03:12.941
some of the authors refer
to themselves as authors,

00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:15.777
as people who are
introspecting on these ideas

00:03:15.777 --> 00:03:18.787
and writing about them, it is believed

00:03:18.787 --> 00:03:22.549
by many Hindus that this
is divine revelation.

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.216
And the term for that is Shruti.

00:03:27.767 --> 00:03:30.645
And Shruti can also be
translated as what is heard,

00:03:30.645 --> 00:03:35.325
you could argue what is heard
directly from the divine.

00:03:35.325 --> 00:03:36.839
Now, in comparison to Shruti,

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:40.173
you also have this notion of Smriti.

00:03:40.173 --> 00:03:44.230
Smriti can be translated
as what is remembered.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.054
And there's a significant
number of Smriti texts,

00:03:47.054 --> 00:03:50.536
some of them that are
also held very closely,

00:03:50.536 --> 00:03:54.703
and meet the threshold of divine
scripture for many Hindus.

00:03:56.967 --> 00:03:59.453
Now the most famous of the Smriti texts

00:03:59.453 --> 00:04:01.703
are the famous Hindu epics.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.413
So this is an image from the Ramayana.

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.502
The Ramayana tells a story of Rama,

00:04:09.502 --> 00:04:11.719
who is one of Vishnu's incarnations,

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.386
going to save the
Princess Sita from Ravana.

00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:19.828
The Mahabharata is a story
of really a family feud

00:04:19.828 --> 00:04:22.894
between the Pandavas and the Kauravas.

00:04:22.894 --> 00:04:26.038
You see here the Pandava
princes, the five Pandava princes

00:04:26.038 --> 00:04:28.983
who are all married to Draupadi,

00:04:28.983 --> 00:04:30.661
it's an interesting
story in the Mahabharata

00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:35.606
how they did end up being
married to one princess.

00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:38.248
And the most significant
part of the Mahabharata,

00:04:38.248 --> 00:04:41.445
for modern day Hindus,
is the Bhagavad Gita.

00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:43.071
It is a subset of the Mahabharata,

00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:44.464
and the Mahabharata is quite long,

00:04:44.464 --> 00:04:45.861
it will take you a while to read it,

00:04:45.861 --> 00:04:48.350
but the Bhagavad Gita is quite short.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.652
And the Bhagavad Gita takes place really

00:04:51.652 --> 00:04:53.423
in the climax of the Mahabharata,

00:04:53.423 --> 00:04:56.636
when you have the Battle of Kurukshetra,

00:04:56.636 --> 00:05:00.798
where the Pandavas are fighting
their cousins the Kauravas.

00:05:00.798 --> 00:05:03.098
And one of the Pandava brothers, Arjuna,

00:05:03.098 --> 00:05:05.055
who's really considered
the greatest warrior

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:08.488
of the brothers, as he takes his chariot

00:05:08.488 --> 00:05:10.702
into battle, his charioteer ends up

00:05:10.702 --> 00:05:14.035
being Krishna, also an avatar of Vishnu.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.582
And the Bhagavad Gita is
really about the conversation

00:05:19.582 --> 00:05:23.493
between Krishna and Arjuna,
and it's all about Krishna

00:05:23.493 --> 00:05:27.112
reassuring Arjuna not only
his role in the universe,

00:05:27.112 --> 00:05:29.550
but it also becomes a
little bit of a layer

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.607
of the spiritual philosophy
discussed in the Upanishads.

00:05:33.607 --> 00:05:37.270
In modern day India, the
Bhagavad Gita is probably

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.437
the scripture that is most
cited by modern Hindus.

00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.103
So if you really want to
understand the spiritual core

00:05:45.103 --> 00:05:48.262
of Hinduism, the best place
to look are the Upanishads,

00:05:48.262 --> 00:05:50.668
and you also have the Bhagavad Gita,

00:05:50.668 --> 00:05:52.885
which even though it's
part of the Mahabharata,

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:56.349
which is considered Smriti, it is revered,

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.516
and is often considered to be
divinely revealed, by Hindus.

00:06:01.615 --> 00:06:02.821
Now this isn't a comprehensive listing

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:05.486
of all of the scripture
that is important to Hindus.

00:06:05.486 --> 00:06:08.863
Obviously you have the Vedas,
which are very ancient.

00:06:08.863 --> 00:06:12.110
Even these epics, their
events might have taken place

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.870
3,000 years ago, or maybe more;

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.618
their composition was
over 2,000 years ago,

00:06:18.618 --> 00:06:21.758
they were canonized
during the Gupta Empire,

00:06:21.758 --> 00:06:23.384
but there's many other texts.

00:06:23.384 --> 00:06:24.870
You have things that are believed written

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.342
during the Vedic Period, the Vedanta,

00:06:27.342 --> 00:06:31.509
which relate to things like
medicine and astronomy.

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:38.709
You have commentaries on
things like the Upanishads,

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:40.822
things like the Brahama Sutra.

00:06:40.822 --> 00:06:45.013
You have the Puranas, which
literally means the old things,

00:06:45.013 --> 00:06:49.180
and these are a whole collection
of old stories, epics, etc.

00:06:50.814 --> 00:06:52.701
So Hinduism, as I mentioned, it is a

00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:55.455
very broad religion, it
is a very diverse religion

00:06:55.455 --> 00:06:57.144
and you even see that in the texts.

00:06:57.144 --> 00:06:58.958
I'll now leave you with
a final excerpt from

00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.760
the Bhagavad Gita, and what's
interesting about this,

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.270
as I mentioned, is the
parallels that it gives

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.117
to what we see in the
Upanishads, and some of what

00:07:07.117 --> 00:07:11.284
we looked at on the first
video on Brahman and Atman.

00:07:12.245 --> 00:07:14.102
The man who sees me in everything

00:07:14.102 --> 00:07:16.364
and everything within me will not be

00:07:16.364 --> 00:07:20.468
lost to me, nor will
I ever be lost to him.

00:07:20.468 --> 00:07:22.372
So this is Krishna talking to Arjana,

00:07:22.372 --> 00:07:24.157
and Krishna's saying me, you could

00:07:24.157 --> 00:07:26.976
say God, or the Ultimate Reality.

00:07:26.976 --> 00:07:29.798
He who is rooted in
oneness realizes that I am

00:07:29.798 --> 00:07:34.311
in every being; wherever
he goes, he remains in me.

00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:38.020
When he sees all being as
equal in suffering or in joy

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.070
because they are like himself,

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.987
that man has grown perfect in yoga.

00:07:43.892 --> 00:07:46.356
And the term yoga, in
modern day, often refers to

00:07:46.356 --> 00:07:50.692
the type of stretching, and
exercising, and body postures

00:07:50.692 --> 00:07:52.774
that you might even
have at your local gym,

00:07:52.774 --> 00:07:54.303
but it's really a more general term

00:07:54.303 --> 00:07:58.138
of how do you connect to
that Ultimate Reality?

00:07:58.138 --> 00:07:59.725
And some of what you might
learn in a yoga class

00:07:59.725 --> 00:08:02.525
is one mechanism, leveraging the body,

00:08:02.525 --> 00:08:04.367
but there's other techniques,
through meditation

00:08:04.367 --> 00:08:06.511
and other things, other forms of yoga

00:08:06.511 --> 00:08:09.078
that are trying to get the individual

00:08:09.078 --> 00:08:11.427
to better recognize the illusion,

00:08:11.427 --> 00:08:13.093
the Maya around them, and get connected

00:08:13.093 --> 00:08:16.343
to the oneness of the Ultimate Reality.
