00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.700
Scientists discover that individuals with
more brain activity learn slower than those

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.080
with less brain activity.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.150
So stop thinking and learn! … wait what?!

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.710
Hi Everyone!

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.900
Crystal here for DNews exploring the idea
that over thinkers like me, may learn new

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.363
tasks more slowly and be less successful at
those tasks than those who don’t analyze

00:00:24.363 --> 00:00:27.220
and evaluate their every move.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.340
Scientists have known for a while that cognitive
control from the frontal cortex can have a

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.210
depressing effect on our ability to learn
new tasks.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.879
This is probably because that brain region
is responsible for problem solving, planning

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.559
and execution, and its “top down” regulation
of our behavior can lead us to make things

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.059
more complicated for ourselves than they really
are.

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.339
Children learn wayyy faster than adults because
they are not subject to this cortical control.

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.549
They CAN’T over think because their judgy
frontal cortex hasn’t been fully developed

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:53.549
yet!

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:57.559
This is one reason why kids are more creative
and frequently take risks that an adult probably

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:58.559
wouldn’t.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.339
When humans are exposed to a new task almost
our entire brain is active and desperately

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.019
trying to make sense and associations from
the new input.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.229
As we get better at the task and “figure
it out” this global network activity gets

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.990
pruned to only what we need specifically for
task performance (eg. motor and visual cortices).

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.579
How quickly this specification happens corresponds
to how “quickly” we learn the task.

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.340
Researchers at several universities, looked
at this process across the whole brain and

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.369
recorded which regions maintained their connections
and activity, and which ones didn’t.

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.359
These data were recorded as fMRI scans of
whole brain as subjects learned a simple musical

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:31.359
computer game.

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:35.020
The scientists were hoping to visualize the
changes that happened as people learned, but

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.149
what they didn’t expect is that subject
data would organize itself into two categories:

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.210
“fast” learners and “slow” learners.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.440
Those who learned the musical video game very
quickly showed rapid drop off of global brain

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.440
activation.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.520
The “slow” learners maintained more global
brain activity over the six week trial and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.149
showed prolonged involvement of associative
regions of the cortex.

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.409
This lead researchers to conclude that “over
thinking” - by maintaining vigilance, monitoring

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.960
errors, and frequently making associative
judgements - makes it more difficult for individuals

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.970
to “transform a task from slow and challenging
to fast and automatic”.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.190
More studies are needed to truly understand
this process but it very well could be that

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.380
analyzing your thinking about thinking about
what you are trying to learn isn’t doing

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.470
you any favors and making it harder for you
to be successful.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.330
So get out of your own way, stop second-guessing
and re-optimizing everything and just let

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.420
it happen!!

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.610
What do you think?

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:36.050
What task are you making more difficult for
yourself?
