00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, of course.
You know, I think the question is a given

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.590
that India is going to be a
superpower.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.289
Why it is a given is because it has a fundamental,
some fundamentals of

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:20.390
the particular establishment.
The political system, the democracy, the ability

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.690
for people to
innovate, grow, prosper.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.600
And they are such an empowered to be entrepreneurial
and create their

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.820
own value and contribution to the economy.
The question is when?

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.829
And what can we do to really make it was fast
as possible, and to have

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.019
systems and processes in place for it to be
more inclusive sooner

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.749
rather than much later.
I think that would be the key thing we all

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.609
should work towards in India
and in formulating policies.

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:59.989
And the government should be working on empowerment,
to have more

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.739
contributions from not just some sections
of the society, towards that

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.700
role of India of becoming a superpower, but
more importantly for

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.790
everybody to take part in that process as
soon as possible.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.250
Thanks.
