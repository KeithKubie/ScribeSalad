1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.400
We have evolved specialized defenses to particular environmental insults

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.050
including starvation,
dehydration,
cold and heat hypoxia,

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.040
fight or flight pain and tissue repair and blood clotting.

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.840
A few general comments about these,

5
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:23.460
the hostile environmental factors frequently encountered elicit the evolution of

6
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:27.630
defense mechanisms that protecting in specific adverse effects.

7
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.980
<v 0>The common defense mechanisms are actually modified extensions of homeostatic</v>

9
00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:38.480
systems that are always operating even when the environmental challenges
absence.

10
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.530
<v 0>This is particularly clear with defenses against starvation,
dehydration,</v>

12
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.760
and extreme temperature.

13
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.160
<v 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.390
<v 0>Many defenses also have specialized characteristics that are only expressed</v>

15
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.880
under conditions of environmental stress.

16
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.820
<v 1>First,
starvation,</v>

17
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.870
<v 0>our metabolism undergo undergoes quite normal homeostatic changes between meals,</v>

18
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.660
glycogen and lipid synthesis,

19
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.590
right after a meal or followed by Glucose neogenesis a few hours later before

20
00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:13.424
the next meal.

21
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.260
<v 0>During prolonged fasting,</v>

23
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:21.120
glycogen stores are depleted and life policies and live at oxidation or

24
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:26.121
activated to provide fuel glucose allocation shifts to the brain.

25
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.160
When starvation begins,

26
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:33.600
the liver start synthesizing ketone bodies that become the main fuel for most

27
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:35.190
tissues,
including the brain.

28
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.670
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.680
<v 0>And when starvation is extreme,</v>

30
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.510
the breakdown of protein and skeletal muscles starts to provide amino acids as

31
00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:44.344
fuel sources.

32
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

33
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.110
<v 0>That means that metabolic defenses against extreme food deprivation are the</v>

34
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:56.130
extensions of the fastening response that occurs normally between meals.

35
00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

36
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.540
<v 0>What about dehydration and volume depletion</v>

37
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.130
are cardiovascular and our renal systems are normally operating homeostatically

38
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.650
to maintain blood volume and vascular blood pressure.

39
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.380
<v 0>Angiotensin aldosterone promote renal sodium reabsorption.</v>

41
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.300
Vasopressin promotes renal water retention and the feeling of thirst.

42
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

43
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.780
<v 0>During dehydration,
adaptive changes in vascular tone,</v>

44
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:31.781
heart rate and renal reabsorption protect from bro protect us from blood volume

45
00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:34.820
was and a drop in blood pressure.

46
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.050
Urine and sweat become more concentrated to reduce water loss that can become

47
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.373
extreme.

48
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.690
These adaptive changes are extensions of normal homeostatic controls of

49
00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:52.691
electrolyte balance and blood pressure and the limit of adaptation to

50
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:56.150
dehydration is set by the urine concentrating ability.

51
00:02:56.151 --> 00:03:01.151
The ratio of osmotic pressure in urine to it is about four in humans,

52
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:03.820
but in Australia and hopping mice,

53
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.880
it's 26 they can produce a urine which is approximately six times more

54
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:12.250
concentrated than are most concentrated urine.

55
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.990
What about cold and heat?

56
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.450
Our core body temperature is nearly constant as it is in other mammals and in

57
00:03:23.701 --> 00:03:27.780
Burt.
Changes in ambient temperature,

58
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.750
stimulate thermogenesis or heat dissipation.

59
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.390
These normal mechanisms go into overdrive when environmental temperature changes

60
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.380
are extreme.

61
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.080
Cold stimulates the hypothalamus to activate antagonistic skeletal muscles

62
00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:45.090
causing heat to be produced by shivering.

63
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.760
Brown fat produces heat without shivering by uncoupled oxidative

64
00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:51.840
phosphorylation.

65
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.150
So newborn infants and young children have brown fat near vital organs in the

66
00:03:57.151 --> 00:04:00.000
artery supplying them.
So for example,

67
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:04.590
the arteries to the brain have brown fat deposits around them to keep Brene

68
00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:05.550
temperature constant.

69
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.550
Prolonged cold exposure causes beige a dipocytes to differentiate and they

70
00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:14.850
generate heat by uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation.

71
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:16.700
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

72
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.700
<v 0>so cold adaptation reduces heat dissipation by decreasing blood flow to the skin</v>

73
00:04:22.131 --> 00:04:23.120
and the extremities.

74
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.860
Adaptation to heat increases heat dissipation through increased blood flow to

75
00:04:27.861 --> 00:04:30.440
the skin and activation of sweat glands.

76
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.260
What about hypoxia?

77
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.400
This is an image a 19th century image of Tibetans.

78
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.070
Oxygen is needed for oxidative phosphorylation in Mitochondria.

79
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.230
Tissue's very in their sensitivity to oxygen deprivation.

80
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.540
Our fast twitch muscles generate ATP with quite collossus and they tolerate

81
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:57.340
short term oxygen shortage,

82
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.690
which is why in the hundred meter dash the sprinters actually don't need to

83
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:02.290
breathe.

84
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.550
They have enough stored up in their muscles so that they can make it through 10

85
00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:08.710
seconds without needing oxygen.

86
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.770
Neurons and cardiomyocytes rely only on oxidative phosphorylation.

87
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.460
They are exquisitely sensitive to oxygen deprivation.

88
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.080
That's why local ischemia causes myocardial infarction and stroke

89
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.600
oxygen tension declines with exercise and altitude.
The short term responses,

90
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.610
hyperventilation and allocation of oxygen to brain and heart longterm

91
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:39.720
acclimation to high altitude is mediated by production of era throw potent in

92
00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:44.520
the kidney and that increases red blood cells.
However,

93
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.020
responses to high altitude,

94
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:51.021
very Indians and Tibetans have higher hemoglobin concentration and percent

95
00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:56.700
oxygen saturation than people at sea level,
but interestingly Ethiopians do not.

96
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.800
There is then our fight or flight response

97
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.340
is activated when a quick response is needed.
For example,
during Predator attack,

98
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.680
it's controlled by the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic pituitary

99
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:16.760
adrenal axis.

100
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.530
It increases heart rate and respiration and it shifts blood from skeletal muscle

101
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.600
to skeletal muscle and brain.

102
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.033
<v 1>Okay.</v>

103
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.590
<v 0>Resources are mobilized.
Glucose,</v>

104
00:06:28.591 --> 00:06:33.090
fatty acids in oxygen and nonessential functions are suppressed,
digestion,

105
00:06:33.091 --> 00:06:36.150
anabolism,
growth and reproduction or all suppressed.

106
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.620
This is an exaggerated version of normal sympathetic control of homeostasis.

107
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.720
Pain is extremely useful.

108
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.710
It's a vital defensive reaction to any mechanical,

109
00:06:53.711 --> 00:06:57.700
chemical or thermal insult and it helps to avoid tissue damage.

110
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.870
The lack of pain perception that is congenital analgesia is a life threatening

111
00:07:04.151 --> 00:07:07.000
condition that is lethal without special measures.

112
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.583
<v 1>Okay,</v>

113
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.750
<v 0>so pain receptors,</v>

114
00:07:09.751 --> 00:07:14.751
nociceptors can be activated by both exogenous and endogenous stimuli and

115
00:07:16.651 --> 00:07:21.120
although acute pain normally occurs only with tissue damage,
secondary pain,

116
00:07:21.121 --> 00:07:26.121
which is mediated by c fiber nociceptors plays an important homeostatic roles,

117
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.060
a reminder to the body that something needs fixing.

118
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.940
C fiber nociceptors,

119
00:07:32.941 --> 00:07:37.941
monitor tissue homeostasis by sensing local Ph temperature and metabolites and

120
00:07:39.481 --> 00:07:44.481
the pain reaction is an exaggerated version of these homeostatic responses.

121
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

122
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.240
<v 0>Tissue repair</v>

123
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.780
is there to replace cells that are lost during injury that does it with

124
00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.640
increased flavor proliferation of tissue stem cells or parenchymal cells.

125
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:07.410
This is an enhanced version of normal tissue renewal in which tissue stem cells

126
00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:11.830
or continuously producing newly differentiated cells at a rate that's

127
00:08:11.831 --> 00:08:15.160
characteristic.
And varies greatly among tissues.

128
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:22.260
Tissue regeneration also involves remodeling the extracellular matrix and

129
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.280
angiogenesis,
and it is accompanied by inflammation,

130
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.900
so this is not inflammation as a reaction to disease.

131
00:08:31.901 --> 00:08:35.470
This is inflammation as part of the mechanism of tissue repair,

132
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:42.010
tissue regeneration and repair correspond to constitutive and inducible

133
00:08:42.011 --> 00:08:43.270
maintenance programs.

134
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.960
They decline with age and they create vulnerability for cancer.

135
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.493
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

136
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.540
<v 0>blood clotting is an extremely useful reaction.</v>

137
00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:00.070
It the blood clotting cascade is activated by vascular damage to prevent blood

138
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:05.160
loss and it promotes repair of damaged blood vessels.

139
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:11.570
The clotting cascade can be induced by inflammatory signals to prevent

140
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:13.980
dissemination of pathogens as well.

141
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.730
Although blood clotting per se normally occurs only after vascular damage,

142
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:26.270
it can be seen as an extension of hemostasis that operates normally to promote

143
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:28.050
vascular integrity.

144
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.440
Blood vessels cannot operate normally in the absence of platelets and other

145
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:36.600
components of the clotting machinery,

146
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.630
so in fact like these other functions,

147
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:43.740
blood clotting is built upon a homeostatic mechanism

148
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.750
to summarize defenses or physiological adaptations that extend normal

149
00:09:51.301 --> 00:09:52.920
homeostatic processes.

150
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:59.210
They are evolutionary modifications of processes that operate normally in the

151
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:00.810
absence of a stressor.

152
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.220
The exaggeration of every type of defense produces a characteristic associated

153
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:08.760
disease.
