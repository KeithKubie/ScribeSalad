RICK DOBLIN: Yeah,
thank you, thank you.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.140
Well, welcome everybody.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.190
Thank you for coming today.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.780
By way of
introduction, I'll just

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:17.820
say that when I was
18 years old, in 1971,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.920
I started taking LSD.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.960
And I was also a Vietnam
War draft resistor,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.110
I was in the last
year of the lottery,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.430
and I kind of identified myself
as a counterculture, drug-using

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.950
criminal.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.540
And so my arc of my life has
been to try to undo that.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.500
I don't really want
to be a criminal,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.130
I don't really want
to be counterculture,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.020
but I do really want
to be a drug user.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.010
So how do we do that
in our current society?

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.470
So I've had sort of two
strands of training.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.400
One strand has been in
psychedelic psychotherapy,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.510
and so I've trained
with Dr. Stanislav

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.930
Grof, who's the world's
leading LSD researcher.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.220
He's in his 80s now, but he
did work in Prague, and then

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.170
at Johns Hopkins in the '50s,
'60s, and '70s, early '70s.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.030
And so I've trained with him
in the holotropic breath work.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.360
And so I wanted
to be a therapist,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.190
a psychedelic
psychotherapist, and that's

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.930
where I was headed
for about 16 years.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.760
And then when I
graduated college in '87,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.900
after dropping out for 10 years
from trying to integrate my LSD

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.430
experiences, I couldn't really
get into any graduate schools,

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.525
because psychedelic
research was shut down.

00:01:34.525 --> 00:01:36.150
So I couldn't get
into graduate schools

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.160
for a clinical
psychology PhD program,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.410
because whenever I told
them I wanted to do MDMA,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.670
they were like, well, maybe
they're somewhere else

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.110
you would be more comfortable.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.400
So then I realized
that the politics was

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.810
in the way of the science,
and I felt like, OK,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.880
I really need to shift gears.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.350
I actually was sort of stuck.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.400
I didn't know what to
do, and I smoked some pot

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.300
and thought about it from
a different perspective.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.400
And then I thought, yes, OK,
I have a pattern in my life,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.560
I want too much too soon.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.740
And I thought, OK,
here I want the science

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.200
but the politics is in the
way, so then I should maybe

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.590
study the politics.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.290
So I thought, where
could I do that?

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.060
And I had read an interview
with a fellow named

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.011
Mark Kleiman, who was
a professor at Harvard

00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:21.510
at the Kennedy
School of Government,

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.270
and in the interview, he
had mentioned a lawsuit

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.550
that I'd been involved
with against the DEA trying

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.320
to protect the
therapeutic use of MDMA.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.820
So I contacted him
and I said, would you

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.910
be my mentor if I could get in?

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.090
And he said yes.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.072
So I've had one strand of
training in public policy,

00:02:40.072 --> 00:02:42.280
so I have a Master's and
PhD from the Kennedy School,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.450
and I feel like that's
doing psychotherapy

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.350
for sick public policies.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.420
So it's a combination of
individual psychotherapy

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.110
and sort of collective
psychotherapy,

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.980
and my sort of career
goal-- I'm 62 now,

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.800
I'm still not quite
doing what I exactly

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.200
want to do-- is to become
a psychedelic therapist

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.270
full-time, and we're predicting
that that may be possible

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.700
starting around 2021.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.650
So that's by way
of introduction.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.070
This, as you may see,
is the MDMA molecule

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.770
in the Google Doodle there.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.286
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:23.910
One day we hope that
we'll actually see

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.328
that on the Google homepage.

00:03:25.328 --> 00:03:27.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.790
If we succeed, maybe
that will happen.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.680
So I'm just going to briefly
talk about why this matters,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.592
and that's about
mystical experiences

00:03:35.592 --> 00:03:36.550
and cultural evolution.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.091
And then I'll talk
about the strategy

00:03:38.091 --> 00:03:41.670
to get there, which is
nonprofit MDMA PTSD research.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.730
And then I'll talk about
Burning Man just a bit,

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.827
about how we really ease
cultural transformations,

00:03:46.827 --> 00:03:48.660
and how that's played
a role, and what we're

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.380
trying to do at Burning Man.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.840
So I have previously
given a Google Tech

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.230
Talk at the Mountain View
campus six years ago--

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.550
bit more than six years ago--
and I watched it in preparation

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.180
for this talk.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.240
And it was really
interesting to watch,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.530
because at the time
that I gave that talk,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.750
we had not really gotten the
data from any of our studies.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.847
We were sort of talking
about what I thought

00:04:14.847 --> 00:04:15.930
was going to be happening.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.680
And now, six years later,
we're at the conclusion

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.347
of an international series
of phase two pilot studies,

00:04:23.347 --> 00:04:24.430
and we have a lot of data.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.410
So I will be sharing
some data with you today.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.091
And in preparation
for the talk, I

00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:31.590
was trying to think
about, you know,

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.400
I am interested in cultural
change, social evolution,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.390
and so I started
thinking, what is Google

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.480
doing in the way of long-shot
projects, or moonshot projects?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.810
And so I checked on
the website, and saw

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.690
that there's a series kind of
the more wide-ranging moonshot

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.750
projects about life extension,
self-driving cars, drones,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.350
for wind turbines and
for transporting goods,

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.730
Project Loon on the
internet, Project

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.500
Glass for hands-free
reality displays,

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.510
and artificial neural networks.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.620
So these were the sort
of moon-shot projects

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.350
that I could see that
Google was involved in.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.780
And what I noticed, though,
that these are all obviously

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.629
technological projects,
and there is something

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:18.170
that we're all
struggling with, which

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.850
is the emotions and
the spirituality,

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.210
and sort of the hate at
the heart of many people,

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.230
and the fear, and the
anxieties, and that's

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.390
what really threatens us.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.810
And how are we going
to really address that?

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.420
So I don't think that there
are technological solutions

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.660
to that.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.150
And this was sort of highlighted
by Albert Einstein, who

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.310
said, "It has become appallingly
obvious that our technology has

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.014
exceeded our humanity."

00:05:45.014 --> 00:05:46.680
He also said, "The
splitting of the atom

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.260
has changed everything
save our mode of thinking,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.650
and thus we drift towards
unparalleled catastrophe.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.670
We shall require a substantially
new manner of thinking

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.660
if mankind is to survive."

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.590
So what is that new
manner of thinking,

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.700
and why is that so important?

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.310
There's a little bit of a
clue in the UNESCO charter,

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.660
which was developed
shortly after World War II.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.750
"Since wars begin
in the minds of men,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.580
it is in the minds of men
that the defenses of peace

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.530
must be constructed."

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.610
And what is that?

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.940
How do we build
defences of peace?

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.880
And there is another clue,
speaking about moonshots,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.800
from Edgar Mitchell.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.590
And so what he said, looking
back on Earth from space, is,

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.500
"When we see our
fundamental unity

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.560
with the processes of
nature and the functioning

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.650
of the universe-- as I so
vividly saw it from the Apollo

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.370
spacecraft-- the old ways
of thinking and behaving

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.740
will disappear."

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.400
There's something about this
unitive cosmic experience

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.550
that does have
political implications.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.210
And this for me was really
confirmed in 1983, when

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.260
I read this book
by Robert Mueller

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.390
called "New Genesis-- Shaping
a Global Spirituality."

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.880
And Robert Mueller was the
Assistant Secretary General

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.840
of the United Nations.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.320
He was like the
mystic at the UN.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.290
He was there for 40 years.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.590
He's the one that started
the United Nations

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.750
University for
Peace in Costa Rica

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.800
because Costa Rica
abolished its army.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.980
And what he was
basically saying here

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:22.020
is that there is a context
where we have the United

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.430
Nations to mediate
conflicts between countries,

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.510
but really what we have is a lot
of religious-based conflicts.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.360
And what he basically said is
that mysticism is the antidote

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.710
to fundamentalism, and if we
have this global spirituality,

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.130
people will appreciate
other perspectives

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.210
rather than be scared of them.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.100
And nowhere in his book, though,
does he mention psychedelics.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.510
So I contacted him and said,
what about psychedelics,

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.740
and would you help me bring
back psychedelic research?

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.934
And he said yes.

00:07:54.934 --> 00:07:56.350
To my utter
astonishment, he wrote

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.970
me back a handwritten
note, and that started

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.010
a long relationship with him.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:06.450
And he eventually helped me
in this global-- World Health

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.030
Organization, when they were
trying to criminalize MDMA.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:16.080
And this idea of psychedelics
and mysticism and world peace

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.320
was sort of shockingly--
this is just

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.740
this recent issue of a
journal called "The Optimist."

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.730
The top is "How LSD May Bring
Peace to the Middle East."

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.820
And it turns out this is an
interview with Stan Grof,

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.789
and he's talking
about a conference

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.710
that he wants to organize that
we're talking about working

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.380
on together, that he calls
"A Light from Middle East The

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.690
Common Roots of the
Abrahamic Traditions,"

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.216
Islam, Judaism,
and Christianity.

00:08:42.216 --> 00:08:43.590
And what he wants
to do is really

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.510
bring, again, the
mystics together,

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:49.010
and help them try to
develop strategies to deal

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.160
with the fundamentalists.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.380
And what I really was able
to talk to Robert Mueller

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.390
about, and sort of give you
now a little bit of data,

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.200
in a sense, about this
psychedelic mysticism,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.070
is from the Good
Friday experiment.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.990
This is the best thing
that Timothy Leary ever

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.680
did, in my view.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.890
He was the faculty sponsor
for this at Harvard.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.490
It was in 1962.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.860
And it was a
scientific study trying

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.696
to evaluate whether people with
a religious tradition-- these

00:09:16.696 --> 00:09:18.070
were Christian
divinity students,

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.440
in a religious setting--
whether psilocybin

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.360
mushrooms-- extracted
psilocybin--

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.070
whether that would be promoting
of a mystical experience.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.770
And so they went into Marsh
Chapel at Boston University,

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.300
and they went through
a Good Friday service,

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:41.070
and half got psilocybin
pills and half got placebo.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.760
And this was actually-- they
did it in the downstairs chapel.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.820
That's me there giving
a little homily.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.711
And they had 10 people,
as well, that were

00:09:51.711 --> 00:09:52.960
part of the experimental team.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.834
Half of them got the
psilocybin, half of them

00:09:54.834 --> 00:09:56.810
got the placebo as well.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.650
And the minister
was Howard Thurman.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.220
So to give you an idea
of how non-controversial

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.060
this was in 1962, Howard
Thurman was Martin Luther King's

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.030
mentor.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:11.520
Martin Luther King got a
PhD at Boston University.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.220
He was an incredible,
dynamic preacher,

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.460
and he agreed to let
a bunch of people

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.660
take psilocybin in
the basement while he

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.920
was doing Good Friday services.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.060
And it was piped in, and we
have the original sermons

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:24.660
that he gave.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.070
They're up on our website.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.280
They were saved.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.650
And how do you tell if somebody
has a mystical experience?

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.820
So Walter Pahnke
spent a year surveying

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.560
the religious literature, and
he developed a questionnaire

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.520
of the mystical experience,
and this was extracted

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.020
from the different religions.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.320
So he wanted to do it where
even though it was Good Friday,

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.590
and it didn't have
anything to do with Jesus,

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.480
or any particular
religious tradition.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.210
This was sort of the essence
of the mystical experience.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.842
And the key part was
the sense of unity.

00:10:54.842 --> 00:10:57.050
That's what Edgar Mitchell
was talking about as well,

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.360
this internal and external,
that it's all together.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.600
We get there from
quantum physics,

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.250
in some ways, that a lot
of what we're understanding

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.140
is how we are all
intimately connected.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.930
There's this feeling
of this transcendence

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.750
of time and space.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.220
There is a sense of sacredness.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.770
There is a sense of
objective reality.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.599
There's a deeply
felt positive mood,

00:11:18.599 --> 00:11:20.890
and there's this sense that
it's beyond words, that you

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.600
can't really put it into words.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.250
This is like an
MC Escher drawing,

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.900
just doesn't make sense.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.080
And then there was
various questions

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.170
that operationalized
these definitions,

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.800
and then you could get a
numerical score on how deep

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.100
was your mystical experience.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.090
And I ended up realizing
in the middle '80s,

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.530
when I wanted to do psychedelic
research, when I needed

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.020
to do a thesis for
my undergraduate,

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.510
is that psychedelic
research was blocked--

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.990
and it had been blocked
for almost two decades--

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:55.160
but the real issue with mystical
experiences in the literature

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.190
is the fruits test.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.820
It's not how you
describe it, it's

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.720
what are the fruits
of the experience?

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.700
Are they positive,
are they opening?

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.332
And so I realized that I could
go back and ask the people that

00:12:08.332 --> 00:12:09.790
were in the study
what they thought

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.800
were the long-term
effects on their lives.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.390
And Walter Pahnke, who
had done the experiment,

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.442
actually had died in a scuba
diving accident in 1971.

00:12:17.442 --> 00:12:18.900
So I'm convinced
that he would have

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.420
done this long-term follow-up
if he would have been alive.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.650
So I was able to, through
all sorts of detective work,

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.820
find 19-- identify 19
out of the 20 people,

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.610
and I interviewed 16 of them.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.510
And one of them
told me this thing,

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.110
"We took such an infinitesimal
amount of psilocybin,

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.470
and yet it connected
me to infinity."

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:44.180
So I re-administered the same
questionnaires to these people,

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.900
and there's a lot
of data, but I just

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.850
wanted to show you
that this point here.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.370
60 or above was considered
a full mystical experience.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.830
And so this was
the original data,

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.320
and then this one here is my
long-term, 25 years later.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.610
And you can see
the placebo group.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.800
It's almost identical,
even after 25 years.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.290
And this is in the midst of the
Reagan escalation of the drug

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.450
war, so if there was
any time, culturally,

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.980
for people to
disavow the validity

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.620
of their prior
psychedelic experience,

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.620
this would have been it.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.590
And yet they affirmed it.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.660
And what, more importantly,
they said to me--

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.640
and this was through all
of these interviews--

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.800
that the mystical experience
had political implications,

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.470
and it fundamentally
increased their tolerance

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.680
of other religions, it
deepened their equanimity

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.410
in the face of life crises,
it promoted greater solidarity

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.260
and identification with foreign
peoples, minorities, women--

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.720
this was all men in this
experiment-- and nature,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.272
and it reduced
their fear of death.

00:13:43.272 --> 00:13:44.730
So we're starting
to see that there

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:48.580
is some kind of long-term effect
from this mystical experience.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.980
The modern research that is
taking place with psilocybin

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.860
here in New York at
NYU, at Johns Hopkins,

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:02.000
and also at UCLA, has
been going on for a while.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.160
And what Roland
Griffiths has done

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.172
is he's sort of updated the Good
Friday experiment, in a sense.

00:14:08.172 --> 00:14:10.130
What he's done is he's
taken people who are not

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.010
religious professionals,
and he has taken them

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.100
in a setting that is
not a religious setting,

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.940
in a clinical setting,
given them psilocybin,

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.740
and find that they still
have mystical experiences.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.590
And many of them rank them as
the top five most important

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.630
experiences of their life.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.360
They also have done these
personality tests with people,

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.650
and personality is
considered to be pretty fixed

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.640
once you're an adult, and
what they found surprised

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.360
them, is that there
was long-term changes

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.170
in people's
personalities related

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.000
to the mystical experience.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.860
And that was in the
dimension of openness.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.990
And this is-- Katherine MacLean
has written this paper she

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.160
was part of their team.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.940
"Mystical experiences occasioned
by the hallucinogen psilocybin

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.900
lead to increases
in the personality

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.074
domain of openness."

00:14:55.074 --> 00:14:56.990
And again, this is
starting to be a little bit

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.690
more modern evidence, again,
about how social change could

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:04.380
be impacted by these
psychedelic-induced mystical

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.810
experiences.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.330
They use the NEO
Personality Inventory.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.190
There's five
domains, six facets,

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.270
but the openness to
experience is the one

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.700
that was really changed.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.150
I think when you talk about
rigidity and fundamentalism,

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.410
people are not open
to new experiences,

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.290
they're not open to new ideas.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.690
And that's what she
found was changed.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.670
And her paper said
this. "Consistent

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.270
with participant claims
of hallucinogen-occasioned

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:31.760
increases in aesthetic
appreciation, imagination,

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.440
creativity, we found significant
increases in Openness following

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.287
a high-dose psilocybin session.

00:15:37.287 --> 00:15:38.870
And what I've written
down below there

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.880
is that we have found similar
changes in openness on the NEO

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.950
with our MDMA research with
post-traumatic stress disorder

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.990
patients, and we're
working on getting

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.110
those papers published as well.

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.820
So there does seem to
be something going on.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:57.880
And it's also, when we talk
about spirituality, we all

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.240
should have the right to
explore our own consciousness,

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.540
to explore our connection
to the religion,

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.100
and to our meaning
of the universe.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:12.320
It's not just idle curiosity,
it's a fundamental human right.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.170
And this was an article
from the MAPS Bulletin.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.480
This is the first
articulation by a donor,

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.120
by a foundation, that their
support of our research

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.850
was part of their
human rights mission.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.016
This is the Pritzker, Nick
and Susan Pritzker Family

00:16:25.016 --> 00:16:28.930
Foundation, from the family
that own the Hyatt hotels.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.790
And their foundation
is focused-- The Libra

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.730
Foundation-- on human rights.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.540
And so, there is
this sense that this

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.680
is a broader issue
as well, in terms

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.500
of our own personal freedoms.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.570
And how do we get there though?

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.412
Because we're stuck
with prohibition,

00:16:42.412 --> 00:16:43.370
at least at the moment.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.060
Now, we see that
prohibition is eroding.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.940
It's a great thing
to see the rise

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.860
of the interest in
marijuana legalization

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.910
and the concerns about
over-incarceration.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.660
And here is the
strategy that explains

00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:00.110
why trying to do psychedelic
psychotherapy research

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.440
is really part of changing
cultural attitudes.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.339
This is a chart showing the
attitudes of American voters

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:11.140
over the last 40 plus years on
the legalization of marijuana.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.950
And what it shows is
that, starting in 1970,

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:14.890
it's down around 12%.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.859
And just a few years
ago, it crossed

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:19.099
the line and more
than 50% of the public

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:21.050
is in favor of legalization.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.406
But what's most interesting
to me about this

00:17:23.406 --> 00:17:27.280
is this long period
here from around '76

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.130
to around '96 here-- almost
20 years-- where it's flat.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.450
Nothing's going on.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.070
And somehow, things
start changing again.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.620
And they start moving up.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.630
And what is it that happens
around 1996 that starts

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.130
to change people's attitudes?

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.040
Medical marijuana.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:48.210
California and Arizona passed
medical marijuana laws in 1996.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:52.270
And polling has been
done-- exit polling,

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.947
after people have voted
on marijuana initiatives

00:17:54.947 --> 00:17:55.780
in different states.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:59.570
And what we've found is that
the single most important factor

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:01.490
about whether
somebody is in favor

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.700
of the legalization
of marijuana is not

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.251
if they use
marijuana themselves.

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.750
You would think
that marijuana users

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.875
don't want to be criminals.

00:18:07.875 --> 00:18:11.050
But it's if they know a medical
marijuana patient personally.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:12.480
That changes their attitudes.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.960
Because there's so
much propaganda.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.460
People don't know
what to believe.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.960
Even people that
smoke pot sometimes

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.590
think it's not good
to make it legal.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:21.130
But this is the theory
of social change

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:24.250
here, that the medicalization
changes attitudes,

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.730
brings a more accurate
risk-benefit analysis

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:27.280
to people.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.780
They know people
who have benefited.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.340
And then, they start
changing their attitudes

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.410
towards legalization.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.664
So that has led us now to this
idea of, how do we do this?

00:18:35.664 --> 00:18:38.080
And we're thinking about, how
do we integrate psychedelics

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.340
into our culture?

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.290
And I want to point
out that it's not new.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.820
If we go to the beginnings
of Western culture

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.250
with the Greeks, the
longest running mystery

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.250
ceremonies that we're
aware of, for 2,000 years,

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.050
was the Eleusinian Mysteries.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.800
And they were wiped out by
the Catholic Church in 396.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.650
And Albert Hoffman,
who invented LSD

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.390
and first synthesized
psilocybin,

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:05.300
did some studies with
Greek scholars and others.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.300
And they noticed that, in
the Eleusinian Mysteries,

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.994
they drink a potion
called kykeon.

00:19:09.994 --> 00:19:11.910
And then, they walk a
certain number of hours.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.520
And then, they
have this ceremony.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.560
And they've timed how long
it takes to do the walk

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.440
and how long it takes what
they know was in the potion.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.130
And it's at the
peak of the trip,

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.630
you're at this place
for the ceremony.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.280
So that's from our
Western culture.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.910
And when we think
about the Greeks

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:32.590
and we think about the people
that started our culture-- so

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.120
Plato, Aristotle, Pythagoras,
Cicero, Sophocles,

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.710
they all participated in
these mystery ceremonies.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:41.320
So even though it's
1,600 plus years ago,

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.980
it's not something new that
we're trying to bring back.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.220
And there is a lot of-- I
can understand a bit how

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.660
religion and superstition has
a lot of misinformation in it.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.650
And so we did have
to separate a bit,

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:57.260
so the rational mind could move
ahead unfettered by all this.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.160
But now, we need to
bring it together again.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:05.950
So I happened to be at Google in
December out in Mountain View.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.980
And I was walking actually.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.710
One of our donors is there.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.950
And before I left, I
wanted to get some Google

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.724
Frisbees for my kids.

00:20:13.724 --> 00:20:15.390
And we were walking
to the Google store.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:18.370
And we passed this
sign on the campus.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:19.391
And I did a double take.

00:20:19.391 --> 00:20:20.890
You can't see what
I was looking at.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.770
But here, I noticed
that there was a Google

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:26.100
Department of World Peace.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.690
And it was room 2021.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.540
And for us, that's meaningful.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.490
So the ultimate moonshot,
obviously, is world peace.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.900
I'm really glad to see
that Google is involved.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.460
It turns out, as
far as we can tell--

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.510
and I'm sort of embarrassed
to say that I was in a hurry.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.926
So I didn't go to
see if there was

00:20:41.926 --> 00:20:43.830
that room that actually exists.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.830
But the MAPS donor is
going to check it out.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.570
But I've searched
on the internet.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.340
It seems to be a joke.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.390
But I hope it's not.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.730
And I did think that the
2021 room was incredible.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.370
Because our drug
development plan

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.140
shows that MDMA will
be approved by the FDA,

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.660
if all goes to plan, in 2021.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.030
So maybe there is some secret
Google plan to support MAPS

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:10.490
and to make psychedelics
into legal medicines.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:11.800
And it makes sense.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.130
Because this is an article
from the "Washington Post."

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.180
They talked about MDMA
as the peace drug.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.600
So OK, that fits with the
Department of World Peace.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.750
And here we are in the Pentagon.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.200
So actually, this is Dr. Richard
Rockefeller, Michael Mithoefer,

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.762
our lead psychiatrist.

00:21:26.762 --> 00:21:28.470
And you're not supposed
to take pictures.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:31.290
So I did it pretty quickly.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.356
But we were speaking with
senior members of the Navy--

00:21:34.356 --> 00:21:36.230
the Navy Surgeon General,
Assistant Secretary

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.240
of the Navy, and
others-- about trying

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:43.300
to do MDMA research
with Marines with PTSD.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.200
Eventually, they decided they
would be much more comfortable

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.550
if we started working
with veterans instead

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.200
of active-duty soldiers.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.660
But we are working on
the MDMA peace plan.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.850
And this is what we're
hoping will happen in 2021,

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:00.020
that we'll be able to sell--
GMP means Good Manufacturing

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.950
Practices-- medical-grade MDMA.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.550
We'll have programs
to train therapists.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:09.490
And also, we're going to have a
network of psychedelic therapy

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:10.202
clinics.

00:22:10.202 --> 00:22:12.160
So one day, you'll be
able to go to Google Maps

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.880
and press, where is the
nearest psychedelic clinic?

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.010
And you'll get--

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:18.620
And we anticipate that,
actually, the model here

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.060
is the hospice movement.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.670
In 1974 was the first hospice.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.210
30 years later, there was 3,500
of them, all over America.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:30.340
So it takes 20, 30 years for
new cultural things to roll out.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.760
But we anticipate
that there will

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.644
be these psychedelic centers.

00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:35.060
And they will
eventually be places

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.601
where people go to
therapy but, also,

00:22:36.601 --> 00:22:39.920
can go to have these
personal growth experiences.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.670
So OK, how do we now
medicalize psychedelics?

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.140
And the journey
actually, for me,

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.700
began from a political
point of view

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.740
in 1984, when the DEA first
tried to criminalize MDMA.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:55.180
From the middle '70s to the
early '80s, MDMA was legal.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.284
It was used under
the code name Adam.

00:22:57.284 --> 00:22:59.700
It was distributed through
underground psychedelic therapy

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.200
networks.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.142
Over a half a million doses
were used in that context.

00:23:03.142 --> 00:23:04.600
And the government
had no knowledge

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.580
that that was going on.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.045
But some of those people
took MDMA, said, wow,

00:23:08.045 --> 00:23:08.920
this is a great drug.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.290
More people should have it.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.940
It should be more
widely available.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.540
And we're going to
name it Ecstasy,

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.230
and we're going to
sell it in public.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.061
And that was, eventually,
obviously going

00:23:18.061 --> 00:23:19.060
to doom the whole thing.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.220
Because it was done in
more public settings,

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.490
people knew about it, and
it was the Reagan era.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.920
So in the summer of '84, the
DEA moved to criminalize.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.140
And we had been
preparing for years ahead

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.890
in anticipation of this.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.250
And we had great DC law firms
working pro bono for us.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:36.410
So I walked to the
DEA headquarters.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:40.271
So that's the picture
of me spying on the DEA,

00:23:40.271 --> 00:23:41.910
right before I
walked in the door

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:45.090
to totally surprise
them with this petition,

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.530
which they eventually granted.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.120
And we did get a DEA
administrative law judge

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:49.770
lawsuit.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:50.800
We won the case.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.170
The judge said, MDMA should
be therapeutically available

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:55.130
still.

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:58.180
And the head of the DEA
administrator rejected it.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.770
We sued him in
the appeals court.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:00.700
We won a couple times.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.940
Eventually, the DEA
lawyers figured out

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.940
how to reject our application
and still satisfy the courts.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.440
And then, it felt
to me like there's

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.630
no way else but through
medicine, through the FDA.

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:13.870
So in '86 is when
I started MAPS.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:17.882
And our strategy-- I call
it the Aikido strategy.

00:24:17.882 --> 00:24:19.340
Because what you're
doing is you're

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.472
using the momentum of your
opponent against them.

00:24:22.472 --> 00:24:24.430
You're not actually even
directly hurting them.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.050
And in this case,
what we're using

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.480
is the fact that
MDMA, LSD, marijuana,

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.730
these are all demonized drugs.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.460
And governments
all over the world

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.610
have spent hundreds of millions
of dollars trying to show

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.490
what's bad with these drugs.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.100
Now, some of their
interpretations

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.370
are a little bit skewed.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.610
But the point is that
there is an enormous amount

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:45.090
of information on this drug.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:49.200
If you go to Medline and
you put in MDMA or Ecstasy,

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.950
there's over 5,100
papers on MDMA or Ecstasy

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.920
at a estimated cost
of over $300 million.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.826
And the risks are
well-characterized.

00:24:57.826 --> 00:24:59.450
We know about the
mechanisms of action.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.400
And over 1,100 people
have been given

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.560
MDMA in clinical settings.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.680
Only about 150 by us, a
little bit less than that.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.330
And the rest are
by people trying

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:10.540
to understand risks and
mechanisms of action,

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.770
things like that, that
we've not had to pay for.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.140
But there's a lot of
safety information.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.650
And now, is this
really so demonized?

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.880
Last Sunday, in the
"New York Times,"

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.980
the "Sunday Review"
section, the cover article

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.800
was about "A Drug to Cure Fear."

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.810
And this was the
illustration that they

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.090
used in the "New York Times."

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:32.980
And it was about propranolol,
which is a beta blocker.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.490
It reduces anxiety.

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:38.200
And they tried to have
people talk a little bit

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.810
about their trauma, while under
the influence of propranolol

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:44.300
and see if that would
help them get over--

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.360
every time they remember
it again-- being fearful.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.810
And this article said, "A
2015 review of PTSD treatment

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.340
studies published in
'Biological Psychology'

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.040
found that propranolol
administered

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.800
with six brief
trauma reactivation

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.800
sessions significantly
improved PTSD symptoms

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.850
compared with a placebo."

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:05.500
So they're starting
to show evidence

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.040
of this drug-assisted
psychotherapy.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:13.730
But MDMA is likely to work a
lot better than propranolol

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.270
in these models.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:17.650
And at the end of the
article, Richard Friedman--

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:21.550
who's here in New York-- the
final paragraph of the article

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:23.580
was, "I see nothing
wrong with doing

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.720
all we can to rid ourselves
of pathological anxiety,

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.530
including using drugs to
alter our painful memories."

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.570
He's not actually a fan of MDMA.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:34.470
So he would probably
be upset if he

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.870
saw that I was using him
to endorse MDMA research.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:41.890
But the principle is this
idea of psychotherapy

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.790
combined with a drug is
getting more and more accepted.

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:47.507
And people see that as
potentially helpful.

00:26:47.507 --> 00:26:49.340
And the public attitudes
have been changing.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.110
This was about 15 years ago.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:56.820
This was the first image in the
media of positive connections

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.050
to Ecstasy.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.560
This was an Israeli newspaper.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.170
We had a project in Israel.

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.700
And this was, like, the
helicopters in the background,

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.260
like a soldier in
a blood Red Sea,

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:09.730
holding onto an Ecstasy
pill as a life saver.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:12.440
So when you see the
images in media,

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.310
this really started
saying, wow, this

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.200
is the first positive one ever.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.830
More recently, Oprah-- who
to her shame, I would say,

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:25.930
10 years before this, 2001,
she had a show on MDMA.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.040
And she showed doctored,
fake images of MDMA

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.940
supposedly causing
holes in the brain.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.880
They just took a SPECT scan.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.380
And they just said,
every place that

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.838
has activity below
a certain level,

00:27:36.838 --> 00:27:39.970
they'll just show as a hole.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.860
So in 2001, though, "O
Magazine" published an article

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:43.690
about MDMA.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:46.170
This was the illustration
that they used.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:49.170
And it was, Can a single
pill heal your pain?

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:52.780
So this is, of course,
propaganda on the other side.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.684
But we'll accept it.

00:27:54.684 --> 00:27:56.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.360
And this, more recently,
was in October.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.070
This is the "Canadian
Medical Association Journal."

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.880
This is all about
psychedelic drugs.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.460
And again, you're
starting to see,

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.470
we've had incredibly good
publicity over the last 10,

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:12.430
15 years as culture is ready
to look at psychedelics again.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:13.434
And so, how do we do it?

00:28:13.434 --> 00:28:14.850
The first thing
that we need to do

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:18.630
is we need to get
medical-grade MDMA.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:23.000
I had MDMA manufactured in
1985 by Dave Nichols at Purdue

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.010
University for our research.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:30.090
It was $4,000 for
one kilogram of MDMA.

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:32.070
MDMA is an incredibly
stable molecule.

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:37.590
So 31 years later now, we're
using that exact same MDMA

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.050
in our research.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.070
And he had a good yield.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:41.360
He had more than a kilogram.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.960
We have 960 grams left.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.760
But it's not medical-grade.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.250
It's not something that
we can use in Phase 3.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.500
So we did a international search
for pharmaceutical companies.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.700
And we made a deal
with this Shasun.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.080
They're making us one kilogram
of medical-grade MDMA.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:02.260
To make it and put it
into capsules is $400,000.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.180
And it's not any better or
purer than what we already have.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.960
It's just more documentation,
more paperwork,

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.730
more standardization.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:11.199
So this is the first step.

00:29:11.199 --> 00:29:13.490
And the production-- I just
got an e-mail the other day

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.140
that they've finally
got permission

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.790
from the home office in
England to buy the precursors.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.900
So we're on the road
to having the world's

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.640
supply of medical-grade MDMA.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.749
AUDIENCE: Where is all the
MDMA on the street coming from?

00:29:25.749 --> 00:29:26.540
RICK DOBLIN: Well--

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.720
AUDIENCE: Can you
repeat the question.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.928
RICK DOBLIN: So the question
is, where's all the MDMA

00:29:29.928 --> 00:29:31.640
on the street coming from?

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.448
Well, if I knew, I
wouldn't tell you.

00:29:33.448 --> 00:29:35.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.170
But it's coming from
underground chemists.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.714
Some of them are really
interested in purity.

00:29:39.714 --> 00:29:41.380
And others are just
interested in money.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:45.160
So there's Erowid, which is
a website about psychedelics.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.650
We started a
project-- actually, it

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:51.330
was the number 10 employee
of Microsoft-- Bob Wallace

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:54.450
said, a lot of this MDMA that's
being sold as Ecstasy is not

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:55.680
really MDMA.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.910
So we have an Ecstasy
pill-testing program.

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.100
He donated over $100,000.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:05.540
And it turns out that more than
half of the Ecstasy or Molly

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.721
doesn't have any
MDMA in it at all.

00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:09.220
So you have to be
really wary of it.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.720
But there are people that supply
underground therapy networks.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.020
And so, there is some pure
stuff out there as well.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.570
But it's all
underground chemists.

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:21.054
The same place that LSD
comes from and all of that.

00:30:21.054 --> 00:30:21.970
So we're getting that.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:23.690
And then, just to give you
a little bit of a sense.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:25.190
What is our therapy method?

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.470
It's not one-dose miracle-cure.

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:32.220
The therapy method is basically
a 3 and 1/2 month process.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.530
And it's weekly
non-drug psychotherapy.

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:36.120
Those are the vertical lines.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.660
And the triangles are
the MDMA sessions.

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:44.370
So one month apart, there is
three of these MDMA sessions

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:45.860
in a 3 and 1/2 month process.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.480
So a lot of emphasis on
preparation, on integration.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.550
And in our current
studies, we break the blind

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.949
after the second session.

00:30:52.949 --> 00:30:54.740
And then, those people
that had the placebo

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.704
could go through it
again as open label.

00:30:56.704 --> 00:30:58.370
Meaning, they know
they're getting MDMA.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:03.450
So it's both comparing people
against a controlled group.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.590
And then, also people
are their own controls,

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.050
once we give them MDMA.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:08.430
So that's the basic experiment.

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:11.840
And we have developed
a treatment manual

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.240
to try to standardize, what
is our therapeutic approach?

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.305
For research,
everything that you can,

00:31:17.305 --> 00:31:18.730
you need to standardize.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:24.000
This is based on a non-directive
approach from LSD research.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.590
We are now getting ready to
negotiate with FDA and what's

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:31.800
called the End-of-Phase 2
meeting, where you summarize

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.600
all of your data, and
you submit the data,

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.130
and you ask for permission
to go to Phase 3.

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:39.060
Phase 3 is what really counts
to make a drug into a medicine.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.290
Phase 2 are these small,
pilot, exploratory studies.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:47.230
So we have 105 people
so far with PTSD

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:48.690
that have been in our studies.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.150
And we have data that I'll show
you from around 95 of them.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.830
We're wrapping up
all of these studies.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:55.220
We hope, in April,
to submit to FDA.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.610
And the first thing
that FDA wants to know

00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:59.270
is about the safety.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:01.610
So in the scientific
literature, the concern

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:05.610
is that Ecstasy users might
have reduced cognitive functions

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:06.370
in certain ways.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.330
And some studies
have shown that.

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:11.360
But it's really hard to
piece apart Ecstasy users.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.500
They've done all
these other drugs.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.244
They don't sleep.

00:32:15.244 --> 00:32:16.410
There's all sorts of things.

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:20.320
So is it really from MDMA?

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.760
So we've done
neurocognitive studies

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.510
with people in our
clinical contexts.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.890
And we've combined two of the
different studies together.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.820
You need to have two
independent studies

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:34.470
to satisfy the FDA that it's
not just a fluke from one study.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:38.730
And so, the blue lines
are before the experiment

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:39.417
at baseline.

00:32:39.417 --> 00:32:40.750
And then, the red line is after.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.240
So what you can
see is that there

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.240
is no change in
neurocognitive functioning,

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.130
either from the active
doses or the placebo

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:50.150
or the comparator,
which is low doses.

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:52.670
So we have a very
good safety profile,

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.310
in terms of
neurocognitive function.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.180
This is, now, body temperature.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.180
You may have heard about
how people go to raves,

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.430
they dance all night,
they overeat and die.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:04.340
And that does
happen occasionally.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:05.850
It's called hyperthermia.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:07.680
And so, we monitor
everybody's temperature.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.020
And so, people's temperature
tends to go up during the day.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.170
And we give MDMA at
10:00 in the morning.

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:15.710
And by 6:00 at night, it's
an eight-hour session.

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:18.280
Then, people can rest.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.360
And the therapists leave.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.550
And so, this is the temperature.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.510
And it doesn't go
up hardly at all.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:25.230
There is no risk.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.890
This is the variation of bars
so you can see the range.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:31.140
But there is no concern
about temperature overheating

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.390
in a clinical setting.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:33.360
This is blood pressure.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.050
MDMA increases blood pressure.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:38.220
You can see, again here,
that there is minimal rises.

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.720
And this is the range.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.860
That's systolic, and
here is diastolic.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.500
Again, that's the range.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.590
So we've got really good
safety data on neurocognitive,

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:49.510
on temperature,
on blood pressure.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:51.680
And then, what about
psychological effects?

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:55.160
So the kind of adverse effects
that people are reporting

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.790
are anxiety, jaw clenching.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.960
And this is displayed
from low dose

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.750
to the full dose--
125 milligrams.

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:04.510
So jaw clenching is one of
the big ones, no appetite.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:07.060
The reason I've highlighted the
ones under the 30 milligram,

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.690
is just to show
that muscle tension,

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:11.999
fatigue happened at the
low doses more even,

00:34:11.999 --> 00:34:13.290
sometimes, than the high doses.

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:15.719
So none of this is problematic.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.230
There has not been a single
drug-related serious adverse

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.620
event in all of these 1,100
people, not just our studies.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.380
So we have conclusively,
in our view--

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.429
and we believe the
FDA will agree--

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:26.845
have demonstrated safety.

00:34:26.845 --> 00:34:28.969
And they keep giving us
permission to do protocols.

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:30.052
So that's another example.

00:34:30.052 --> 00:34:32.368
As do regulators
around the world.

00:34:32.368 --> 00:34:34.409
So now, I'm going to switch
to the efficacy data.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:35.694
It's a little bit, again, dry.

00:34:35.694 --> 00:34:37.360
But I just want to
give you a few quotes

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.579
emotionally of what people say.

00:34:39.579 --> 00:34:40.370
This was a veteran.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.360
"I feared I was losing
in my effort to live.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.050
I went through
three MDMA sessions

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:46.750
and it gave me my life back."

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.560
Another one, "I'm 100%
different than what

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.949
I was when I started."

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:54.489
And then, this was a woman who
was sexually abused as a child.

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:57.340
And she said, "since I've
been cured of PTSD, I only

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.900
suffer from one thing with
PTSD, and that's the survivor's

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.390
guilt. I got heled, while I am
surrounded by people who don't

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:05.860
know that they have any hope.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.020
Who, until this medicine is
approved, probably don't."

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.832
There are a lot of good
therapies for PTSD.

00:35:11.832 --> 00:35:13.290
But there's large
numbers of people

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:15.590
who are chronic
treatment resistant PTSD.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:17.410
Right now, the
Department of Defense

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:21.920
is giving disability payments
to 600,000 vets for PTSD

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.122
at a cost of around $6 billion
a year, which is outrageous.

00:35:26.122 --> 00:35:27.330
And that's going to continue.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:30.030
So when we think about the
cost of war, $6 billion a year.

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.997
That's going up.

00:35:30.997 --> 00:35:32.580
These people, a lot
of them are young.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.650
They're going to be living
for another 40, 50 years.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:39.310
And so, the enormous burden
of PTSD on our society

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:41.070
and on those people
that have it.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.500
So this is a summary chart.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:46.530
The key point is that we know
about statistical significance.

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:49.887
But with clinical
research, more and more,

00:35:49.887 --> 00:35:51.720
people have moved to
looking at effect size.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.520
The FDA really looks
at effect size.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.680
Because you can have
statistically significant

00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.250
results, even if you have
clinically marginally

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:02.250
significant effects.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:05.990
So effect size is about the
magnitude of the effect.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:10.870
And we have got the
good fortune of the FDA

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:15.010
director of psychiatry products,
who's recently retired.

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:17.550
And he reviewed our protocols
for the last 15 years.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.591
And he says, he likes the
way we're doing things.

00:36:19.591 --> 00:36:21.870
So he's now acting
as our consultant.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:24.770
So we now have hired.

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.820
Basically, MAPS is a nonprofit
pharmaceutical company,

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.810
trying to develop
psychedelics into medicines.

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:31.560
So that's how I think
of what we're doing.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.450
We're primarily doing FDA
drug development research.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:38.930
And what he said is that the
drugs that the FDA approves,

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:41.490
they almost never cure
anything in psychiatry.

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.120
They're all palliative
for symptoms.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.830
And they almost all have
a very small effect size

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:47.570
of around 0.3.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:51.420
And so, what we have
is a large effect size.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.115
And these are their effects.

00:36:54.115 --> 00:36:54.740
They're over 1.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:58.290
So other than just
one small study, where

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:00.260
some of the placebo
people actually did better

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:04.980
than the full-dose MDMA people,
we have large effect sizes.

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:08.770
And then, when you combine it
all, this is our combined data.

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:10.790
We've just got these
the last few days.

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:13.170
So what it just shows
is the baseline,

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:14.950
then at the primary
endpoint, which is

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:17.060
the end of the blinded portion.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.940
And then, the people
at the top in the blue,

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.690
which are in the
placebo group, we

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.520
give them the chance
to get MDMA afterwards.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.830
So the 12-month follow-up
is after everybody

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:28.470
has gotten MDMA.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:29.970
And you can see
that they all end up

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:31.880
pretty much the same place.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.950
And that there's a
significant difference, when

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:38.130
we look at the primary
outcome blinded portion of it,

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:40.000
and a large effect size.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.500
This is just to show you another
way of looking at the data.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.510
The comparator doses-- we
tried, for double-blind,

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:48.800
to use low dose MDMA
compared with full dose.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.730
And so, there is a little bit
of a decrease in their scores.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:55.330
It's called the CAPS scores,
the Clinician Administered PTSD

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:56.240
Scale.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.100
That's the measure developed by
the VA, used by FDA to evaluate

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.950
the severity of PTSD.

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:04.480
And the active doses
are, again, much larger.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:07.170
So we believe that, based
on this data-- and this

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.630
is putting it all
together from the baseline

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:10.720
to the 12-month follow-up.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.810
The point is that the
benefits last over time.

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:15.630
They don't just fade away.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:18.000
It's not just the
psychedelic afterglow

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.090
and, then, it fades
as reality comes back.

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:22.500
There's something
fundamentally changed.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.740
And that's what's
really exciting to us.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.050
And it's not after daily MDMA.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.740
It's only after a few doses.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.930
Some people do relapse.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:32.760
This is a slide of
just three people.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.990
The FDA gave us permission to
give one more session of MDMA

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:39.870
to people that had their
PTSD symptoms come back

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:41.330
after the year follow-up.

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:44.520
And of these three people, when
we gave them an additional MDMA

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.670
session, their
symptoms all went down.

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:49.574
The red line there is
moderate to severe PTSD.

00:38:49.574 --> 00:38:51.740
That's what they had to be
above to be in our study.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:52.921
They're all below that.

00:38:52.921 --> 00:38:54.920
And then, at the one-year
follow-up, two of them

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.600
were still lower at that.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.980
But one had relapsed.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:00.220
So I don't want to give the
wrong impression that you

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.810
give MDMA to somebody,
it fixes them

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:03.280
for the rest of their life.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.520
People who have
PTSD have usually

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.610
had a history of trauma.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.910
They're more vulnerable
to more life shocks.

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:10.160
But it does last.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.450
And the averages that
I've showed you before

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:15.500
include the people
that relapsed.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.160
This was now the study in vets.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.360
The point here I want to
make is that we were shocked,

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:24.170
in that we were doing 30
milligrams, 75 milligrams, 125

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:24.670
milligrams.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:27.080
And I thought that there would
be a dose response curve.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:30.980
But it turned out that the
red is the 75 milligrams.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:34.950
The medium dose actually did
better than the full dose.

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:38.320
And when those of us--
underground therapists

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.380
tend to work at the
125 milligrams dose.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.430
This was a real surprise.

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:48.410
And we also are starting to
understand research and memory

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:49.710
reconsolidation.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:51.690
And so, this helps
us understand that.

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:55.530
That when you have a memory
and you bring it back,

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.520
it's not like a book
and you look at it

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.440
and you put the
book on the shelf.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.856
You sort have to
reprint the book.

00:39:59.856 --> 00:40:01.650
You reconsolidate the memory.

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:04.140
And so, if you have
a traumatic memory

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:07.080
and it's associated
with fear, if you're

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.460
recalling the memory
when you're feeling safe,

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.690
when you reconsolidate
the memory,

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:15.240
you have memory for the
autobiographical details.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.050
But the emotional
tone is now overlaid

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:20.190
by that feeling of safety.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:23.370
And at the 75 milligrams,
people stay more grounded.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:25.070
They stay more in
their biography.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:28.890
At the 125, people have
more spiritual feelings.

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:33.710
They have more body feelings
that are pleasurable.

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:37.760
But they're a little bit
away from their trauma.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.340
So this is helping
us to understand.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.548
And now, the Rockefeller
family-- Richard Rockefeller

00:40:41.548 --> 00:40:42.950
was a major ally.

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:45.030
He died in a plane crash.

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:48.040
To honor Richard, his
family has funded research

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.640
at Rockefeller University
with animal models,

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.050
looking at MDMA and
memory reconsolidation.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:55.160
So we're starting
to understand that.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.370
This is to show-- this
is the depression data.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.320
So a lot of people
that have PTSD also

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.920
have co-morbid depression.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:04.670
And depression also
goes down as well.

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:08.980
And this is, now, a key
point-- difference between MDMA

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:11.850
and psychedelic research
with classic psychedelics.

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:14.280
What has found from
the '50s and '60s

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:20.270
and is also the case with
the current research--

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:22.460
with psilocybin
and cancer patients

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:26.830
or with psilocybin and
alcoholics or tobacco addicts--

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:28.620
the depth of the
mystical experience

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.970
is correlated with
therapeutic outcome,

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:34.810
the loss of the fear of death,
the sense of connection.

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:37.150
We do the same
questionnaire with MDMA.

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:40.400
And so this shows that
the mystical experience

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.480
is pretty good, pretty
strong, even with people

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.050
who get MDMA, which
is not known for being

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:50.180
as spiritual in some ways
as the classic psychedelics.

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.000
And so, we show that
the comparator doses

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.410
have relatively low scores
on the mystical experience

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:56.000
questionnaire.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.900
The active doses
are much fuller.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.960
But this is the key
point here, which

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.270
is this is a chart
showing the relationship

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:08.100
between the drop in CAPS scores
and the mystical experience.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:08.860
And it's flat.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.250
What we're showing is
there is no correlation

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:14.780
between mystical experience
here and therapeutic outcome.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.160
That's the
fundamental difference

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.560
between what we're doing
in the psilocybin research.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.170
And that also explains that we
have a non-directive approach.

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.900
We're not trying to help people
have a mystical experience.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.600
We're trying to just help them
emerge whatever is coming up

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.310
and, particularly,
focusing on peacefully

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:32.460
looking at their trauma.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:35.220
So what we've learned is, there
is safety in clinical settings,

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:38.980
the large effect size, the
cause of the PTSD is irrelevant.

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.690
We've worked with veterans,
firefighters, police officers,

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:45.860
women survivors of child sexual
abuse, adult rape and assault,

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:47.310
workplace accidents.

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:49.640
The cause of the PTSD
doesn't really matter.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.220
We can enroll anybody.

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:54.450
And that the double-blind--
as you should not

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:57.500
be surprised to learn--
didn't really work.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.840
People can tell if they've
got an inactive placebo--

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.290
--or if they get the MDMA.

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:06.610
But the low doses of MDMA had
an anti-therapeutic effect.

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:08.100
So that was a big problem.

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.340
And what our FDA
consultant has said

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:13.702
is that we can't really solve
the double-blind problem

00:43:13.702 --> 00:43:15.160
and that we'll just
have to compare

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.230
with an inactive placebo.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:18.770
So what we're
proposing is Phase 3

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:21.410
will be inactive
placebo with therapy.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:24.810
So it's basically therapy
with an inactive placebo

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:26.280
versus therapy with MDMA.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.920
That's going to
be our comparison.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:31.740
We'll use three MDMA sessions
with 12 non-drug sessions.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:35.110
We'll give everybody the
75 milligram dose first.

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:37.420
And then, on their second
and third sessions,

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:40.160
we'll have a discussion between
the therapists and patients.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.820
Do they want to have the same?

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.507
Or do they want to
have it stronger?

00:43:43.507 --> 00:43:44.590
They won't know the doses.

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:47.256
They won't know even if
they've got the placebo or not.

00:43:47.256 --> 00:43:49.880
But they'll just say, I want it
the same or I want it stronger.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.004
And that's how we'll do it.

00:43:51.004 --> 00:43:53.370
And then, because the
double-blind problem

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:55.680
is an issue, what
means more important

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.160
is the independent raters.

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.950
So the therapists don't
say, how are you doing?

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:01.260
And you're doing much better.

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.468
Because that could be biased.

00:44:02.468 --> 00:44:04.270
So we have a group
of [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:07.660
liability-trained
outcome-measure experts.

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.640
And they will do this
all by telemedicine.

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:13.522
And they'll be randomly assigned
to which person they review.

00:44:13.522 --> 00:44:15.230
So they won't know,
is this the baseline?

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:16.063
Is this the outcome?

00:44:16.063 --> 00:44:17.554
Is this the 12-month follow-up?

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:19.720
And this is what we're going
to be proposing to FDA.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.510
We're anticipating 400
subjects, $22 million.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:26.070
And I don't know how
many of you might

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:27.470
know a program called HSPICE.

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:32.040
It's used to produce computer
manufacturing computer chips.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.250
The developers of it--
Ashawna Hailey and Kim Hailey.

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:38.450
Ashawna was on our
board of directors.

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:41.710
And after he sold his company,
made a whole bunch of money,

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:43.980
he went into studying
consciousness

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:47.290
and did all sorts of stuff, got
very involved in psychedelics.

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:51.500
He died, left us $5.3
million in his will.

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.150
And we're using that
for the Phase 3 studies.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:57.830
And Dr. Bronner's from-- I don't
know how many of you have read

00:44:57.830 --> 00:44:58.600
the label on--

00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:00.460
--Dr. Bronner's--

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:01.425
AUDIENCE: All one.

00:45:01.425 --> 00:45:02.550
RICK DOBLIN: Yeah, all one.

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:06.260
Dr. Bronner was traumatized
by the Holocaust,

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.150
sort of driven crazy.

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:10.730
But his thing was we all
need to love each other.

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:11.530
We're all together.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:12.610
We're all one.

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:16.510
And his grandson, David
Bronner, went to Harvard,

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:18.730
is a really smart guy and
has built the business up

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:20.090
with his brother Mike.

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:23.070
And they are very
charitable oriented.

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:24.480
It's a benefit corporation.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.270
David's on our
board of directors.

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:28.680
They've pledged $1 million
a year for five years,

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.879
starting next year.

00:45:29.879 --> 00:45:31.420
And the reason is
because, this year,

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:36.370
they want to help legalize
marijuana on the 2016

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:37.200
elections.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:40.620
And one of the
other tech people--

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:43.060
he wanted to stay
anonymous at the moment--

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.064
has pledged $1 million
after we agree with FDA.

00:45:45.064 --> 00:45:47.230
And I said, why is it that
you want to be anonymous?

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:48.540
And he said, well,
business reasons.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:50.998
And I said, what would it take
for you to not be anonymous?

00:45:50.998 --> 00:45:53.000
He said, if you can
get 1,000 people,

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.550
I would come out
with all of them.

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:58.280
So if any of you know people
that are ready to come out,

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.630
we're starting to
gather a list of people

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:03.970
who make contributions that
the world would recognize

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:05.640
and, then, who would say, yeah.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.490
Well, psychedelics have
been important in my life.

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:10.280
Now, what I've
learned more recently

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:13.740
is that, once you make a drug
into a medicine-- I thought,

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.690
MDMA is in the public domain.

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:16.690
There is no use patents.

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:18.150
We actually hired
patent attorneys

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.444
to develop an
anti-patent strategy.

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:21.610
And I'm actually doing that.

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:24.680
I'm on the board of directors
of a company that is genetically

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.220
screening marijuana
strains and putting them

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:30.910
in the public domain, so
nobody could patent them.

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:33.890
So there will be hundreds
of marijuana strains

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:36.310
that are genetically
characterized

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:37.260
in the public domain.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.170
But it turns out
that Reagan-- who

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:44.100
I've demonized in my mind in so
many different ways-- in 1984

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:44.890
a law passed.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:45.540
He signed it.

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.070
And what it said was, there
are certain incentives

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:50.370
for developing drugs
that are off-patent.

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:53.760
And what that means is that
you can get data exclusivity.

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.800
It means nobody can use
your data for five years

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.510
to market it as a generic.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:00.480
But other people
could do the research

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.160
to make the drug
into a medicine.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.480
They could sell it too.

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.680
So right now, there's
a possibility that MAPS

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.500
and Heffter or
Usona-- which is going

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.530
to work on the
psilocybin-- that we'll be

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:12.150
the ones that do the research.

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:13.550
And then, we may
have this period

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:16.320
of five years-- in
Europe, it's 10 years--

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.680
where we're the only
ones marketing this drug.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:23.200
And so, if we make the drug for
$50 and we sell it for $200,

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.910
we can use this money to
pay for more research.

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:27.780
So now, the story that
I'm telling donors

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.910
is that we have a
sustainability plan,

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:32.110
that, unlike most
non-profits-- like Feeding

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:35.352
the Hungry, there's always
going to be more work to do,

00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:36.560
more money you have to raise.

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:41.140
But we have this opportunity
to make MDMA into a medicine

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.450
and then not need to ask
donors for as much money,

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:45.610
because we'll be having
some income stream.

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:48.600
At the same time, we don't
want to really monopolize it.

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.350
So if anybody does want to
make MDMA into a medicine other

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:52.800
than us, we will help them.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.830
And so we make our
protocols public.

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:55.840
Our data is public.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.630
All of this is trying
to encourage others.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:00.670
But so far, we haven't seen
anybody step into it yet.

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:04.250
And so we have formed
a benefit corporation.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:07.920
Selling MDMA and
making money-- it's

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.100
not something that you can
keep inside a nonprofit.

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.520
It's something that's taxable.

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.150
But a lot of people talk about
legalization of marijuana.

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:16.705
And they say, we don't
want big tobacco.

00:48:16.705 --> 00:48:19.327
Or we don't want big
alcohol marketing marijuana.

00:48:19.327 --> 00:48:20.660
They're going to market to kids.

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.285
They're going to do
all sorts of stuff.

00:48:22.285 --> 00:48:25.230
So having drugs that have
an abuse liability marketed

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:28.160
by profit-maximizing
corporations

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.530
is kind of worrisome from
a social point-of-view.

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:33.070
So we've started a benefit
corporation, wholly owned

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:34.740
by MAPS, no investors.

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:36.980
And it's not to
maximize profits.

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:40.610
It's to maximize social
change and social benefit.

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:44.010
And so that's what
we're showing here.

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:47.580
Now, you need to evaluate
the benefit corporation

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.130
to public benefit.

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:50.870
How do you tell that
you're really having

00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:52.290
this benefit corporation?

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:54.857
And there are no third-party
standards, unfortunately,

00:48:54.857 --> 00:48:56.190
for the pharmaceutical industry.

00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:59.480
So we're creating our own
with some ethicists at UPenn.

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:04.005
And the challenge now is to
quantify the various principles

00:49:04.005 --> 00:49:05.130
that we're operating under.

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:07.349
So we're working
on that right now.

00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:09.140
There's a few more
things that we're doing.

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:11.860
We're also working on
MDMA-assisted psychotherapy

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:14.640
for autistic adults
with social anxiety.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.070
And this is a study at UCLA.

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:18.540
It's a small pilot
study with 12 subjects.

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:20.740
We just have data
right now from eight.

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:25.090
But as you can see, this is the
Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale.

00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:26.420
It's working great.

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:30.150
And this is something that, in
a sense, Google helped develop.

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:31.840
Its crowd-sourced
drug development.

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:36.300
What that means is that somebody
who had autism went to a rave,

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:37.770
took Ecstasy, and said, wow.

00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:38.780
Now, I can feel.

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.510
Now, I can read body language.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:42.710
And they posted their
story on the internet.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:45.640
And then, before long,
other people said, oh yeah,

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.030
that happened to me too.

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:51.640
And then, there was
about 50 or 100 accounts,

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:54.260
stories on the internet
of people with autism

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.420
saying MDMA helped them.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.300
And so, a woman--
Alicia Danforth--

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.000
contacted as many as she could.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.205
And her PhD dissertation
was talking to these people

00:50:02.205 --> 00:50:04.330
through this sort of
crowd-sourced drug development

00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:05.200
idea.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:08.610
And then, we used that
as data to the FDA.

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:10.710
And so, this is really
encouraging data.

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:13.010
We're also doing a study with
life threatening illness,

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:14.885
people who have life
threatening illness that

00:50:14.885 --> 00:50:15.850
are scared of dying.

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:17.434
And there was research with LSD.

00:50:17.434 --> 00:50:18.850
There is research
with psilocybin.

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:22.980
And our research with MDMA
is now at San Anselmo.

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.670
This is Dr. Phil Wolfson.

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:26.860
It's a double-blind
study, 18 participants.

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:30.250
We've already enrolled five.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:32.690
This was a front-page "San
Francisco Chronicle" article

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:34.670
about it.

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:38.880
And this is a study
that just happened.

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.170
We just got approval
for this on Tuesday.

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:43.760
This is the first
study in association

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.640
informally with VA therapists.

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.484
And when the VA was think-- as I
said, the Department of Defense

00:50:49.484 --> 00:50:52.150
wasn't so excited about us doing
work with active-duty soldiers.

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:56.870
But the VA, they were thinking,
well, where do we blend MDMA?

00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:00.200
And they had a program that
was called Cognitive Behavioral

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.680
Conjoint Therapy,
where "conjoint" means

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:04.030
couples therapy.

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:08.340
And they thought, OK, MDMA--
hug drug, love drug, couples.

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:09.630
Let's work it there.

00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:11.280
So they introduced
us to the person

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.150
that was the VA therapist
who was working with this.

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:16.270
And we've decided to blend.

00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:19.690
We're going to pay for the study
as a sort of prime the pump

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:20.650
with the VA.

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:23.590
But what we wanted to do was
give both members of the couple

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:24.750
MDMA.

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:28.040
And on Tuesday,
the FDA said yes.

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:31.230
And this is the first
instance that this modern wave

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:34.541
of psychedelic research-- it
began in 1990 with the DMT

00:51:34.541 --> 00:51:35.040
research.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.581
And it's always been
single patients.

00:51:36.581 --> 00:51:39.810
So now, we have a chance to
actually give two people--

00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:42.500
and that will hopefully help
us move, eventually, also

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.550
to look at group psychotherapy.

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:46.300
Now, we're also doing
work with marijuana.

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.867
I just want to say
that right now it's

00:51:48.867 --> 00:51:50.700
more difficult to do
research with marijuana

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:52.940
than psychedelics.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:56.000
The reason is that we have our
own supplies of psychedelics.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.800
But there is
marijuana everywhere.

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.320
But the only
DEA-licensed marijuana

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.150
is owned by the National
Institute on Drug

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:04.880
Abuse, the agency that's
about what's bad with drugs.

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.130
And if you want to look at
what's good with marijuana,

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:09.250
they don't really want
to give it to you.

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:11.660
So we have tried for six years.

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.300
And we finally have been
able to get permission

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:18.620
for a study of marijuana
for PTSD in 76 US veterans.

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:20.410
Marijuana is a
palliative treatment.

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:22.250
It helps people not
have nightmares.

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:23.680
It helps them be
present, focused.

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.054
But it doesn't
solve the problem.

00:52:25.054 --> 00:52:28.154
People need to take
marijuana every day.

00:52:28.154 --> 00:52:29.820
But it still is helpful
for some people.

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:32.250
And so, we're sort of
becoming the experts in PTSD,

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:35.420
as well as experts in MDMA.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:40.970
And so, Sanjay Gupta did a
series of stories on marijuana.

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:45.550
We were a big focus of
"Weed 3," our project.

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:47.620
Basically, this is
just to show that we're

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.750
comparing some
groups that get THC,

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:52.160
some groups that get CBD
containing marijuana,

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.590
and one group that gets
both, and then one that

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:57.100
gets a placebo.

00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:01.250
And we got a $2.1 million grant
from the state of Colorado

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:02.310
for this study.

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.670
The state of Colorado has
taken in over $100 million

00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:07.060
in taxes for marijuana.

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:09.810
And they put out $9 million
for marijuana research.

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:12.010
And they were willing
to give us $2.1 million.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:13.840
This is a protest.

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:16.800
We're also suing the DEA.

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.582
Covington &amp; Burling
is a big DC law firm.

00:53:18.582 --> 00:53:20.290
They've agreed to take
the case pro bono.

00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:21.990
We're trying to
break the monopoly.

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:23.660
And this is a
protest that we had

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.530
on the lawn of the
DEA headquarters

00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:28.915
saying, give us a
license to grow pot.

00:53:28.915 --> 00:53:30.790
Basically, it's the same
with the MDMA story.

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:33.964
We won the administrative
law judge lawsuit.

00:53:33.964 --> 00:53:36.380
But then, the head of the DEA
rejected the recommendation.

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.430
So we're continuing to try.

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:41.060
And now, we get to Burning Man.

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:44.500
What are the potential
reasons for backlash

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:46.640
that would block our progress?

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:51.670
And it used to be, the
initial backlash in the '60s

00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:53.760
was about political reasons,
about these hippies,

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:57.490
the counterculture, the Beatles
doing LSD, against the war,

00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:59.770
make love not war.

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:01.440
The backlash was political.

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.600
But that has faded now.

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:04.690
And so now, the main
reason of backlash

00:54:04.690 --> 00:54:07.340
would be parents worried
about their kids.

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:10.390
And an example is,
at Burning Man,

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:11.830
at festivals where
people do lots

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:14.910
of psychedelics, a bunch of
people are not prepared for it.

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:18.160
And what happens is they end
up either getting tranquilized

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.430
or getting arrested.

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:21.260
And so, we've started
the Zendo Project

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:24.330
to do psychedelic
harm-reduction at festivals

00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:25.570
all over the world.

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:27.990
And we've picked some of the
more well-known ones, Burning

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:32.220
Man, Boom Festival in Portugal,
Envision in Costa Rica.

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:35.250
And we provide psychedelic
therapists and psychologists,

00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:37.900
psychiatrists, to
help people, as a way

00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:42.410
of trying to reduce the
costs and reduce the fears.

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:44.180
This is complicated
by the fact that there

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:46.263
is a law against harm
reduction with psychedelics.

00:54:46.263 --> 00:54:48.760
It's called the RAVE
Act, Reducing America's

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:51.440
Vulnerability to Ecstasy.

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.010
You can't have too much
Ecstasy in America.

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:55.130
So it's a problem.

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:58.280
But we're working
politically to get that over.

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.670
This is our training
group at Burning Man.

00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:03.050
We had 180 people
wanted to get training

00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:06.880
in how to help people go
through a difficult trip.

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.810
To locate where we
were-- so the Burning

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:12.760
Man Organization is worried.

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:14.910
But they let people do
stuff-- all sorts of stuff

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:16.260
obviously-- in their villages.

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:17.620
So we do this in our villages.

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:19.290
We're not formally connected.

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:22.920
But we're getting more and
more connected informally.

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:25.625
And so we had to put
a flag up for people

00:55:25.625 --> 00:55:26.750
to recognize where we were.

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:29.750
And so to have our own
Zendo flag at Burning Man,

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:33.270
it felt like I was an
explorer, planting my flag,

00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:34.810
like we had our
own little country.

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:38.860
I felt so accepted to have
our little Zendo flag there.

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:42.540
And this is to show
you what's possible.

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:45.870
This just took place-- Burning
Man on the Washington DC Mall.

00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:47.460
This took place in November.

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:51.390
We aligned ourselves with the
local Burning Man community.

00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:55.270
And we actually-- you can't
just have a party on the Mall.

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:57.380
You have to be upset
about something.

00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:58.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.910
You have to protest something.

00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:05.870
So this, we timed it for the
Drug Policy Alliance Conference

00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:06.930
in Washington, DC.

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:09.390
So this is a protest
against the drug war.

00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:11.140
We actually did though have DJs.

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:12.840
We had dancing all night.

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.640
We had the Zendo team there.

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:19.040
This was right between the
White House and the Washington

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.100
Monument.

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:22.450
And the most exhilarating
moment for me

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:26.610
was around 4:30 in the morning,
dancing with David Bronner.

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:28.270
It was like we
thought, we did it.

00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:29.245
We got the permits.

00:56:29.245 --> 00:56:30.120
Everything's working.

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.030
There's over 1,000
people at the burn.

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:36.870
And at that moment, the
DJ put on Jimi Hendrix

00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:40.080
playing the national
anthem from Woodstock,

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.990
and playing it so loud
that you could hear

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:43.950
the music in the White House.

00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:46.540
And we thought, wow, here's
from counterculture Woodstock.

00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:48.850
Now, we're doing Burning Man
with a permit, completely

00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:50.861
legally, on the Washington Mall.

00:56:50.861 --> 00:56:52.360
And the little
temple structure that

00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:57.690
burned, once it burned down, it
burned to reveal a jail cell.

00:56:57.690 --> 00:57:00.260
And then, the jail
cell burned down too.

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:03.810
And so, now, this
is our 30th year.

00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:07.040
In April is our
30th anniversary.

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.567
We're asking people
to have dinners.

00:57:08.567 --> 00:57:10.650
We're looking at, what
happened with gay marriage?

00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:11.360
How did that work?

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:12.610
What happened with gay rights?

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:13.400
People came out.

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.514
People didn't they
knew gay people.

00:57:15.514 --> 00:57:16.930
People, the same
thing, don't know

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:18.787
they know people who
have done psychedelics.

00:57:18.787 --> 00:57:20.370
So we're asking
people to have dinners

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:23.090
in home private settings
and invite their friends

00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:25.500
and just tell stories
about what psychedelics

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:26.310
have meant to them.

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:28.664
So some of you may be
interested in considering that.

00:57:28.664 --> 00:57:30.080
And then, we're
asking at the end,

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.660
for people-- if they
want to donate--

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:34.210
to help us have
a legal drug deal

00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:38.720
and contribute to our
$400,000 cost for the MDMA.

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:43.990
And we're also having a
conference in Oakland in 2017.

00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:45.580
It's the third
iteration of this.

00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:47.080
We're having
psychedelic researchers

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:49.650
from all over the world,
psychedelic science.

00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:51.320
You're all welcome
to come to it.

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:52.650
And this is the final slide.

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:54.310
This is what I want
to leave you with.

00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:56.980
In 2010, I got a call
from the Pentagon.

00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:59.880
And it was from a
brigadier general.

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:02.560
She was the highest-ranking
psychiatrist in the military.

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:04.670
She was in charge
of PTSD research.

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:07.240
And she heard about
our study with MDMA.

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.030
And she called and
said, what's going on?

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:10.890
We have a terrible
problem with PTSD.

00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:14.010
And so we have since shared
information with her.

00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:15.510
And she's been
willing to go public.

00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:19.160
She's now no longer in the DEA.

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:22.490
But she works here in
New York for the mayor.

00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:24.509
And she said this.
"When it comes

00:58:24.509 --> 00:58:26.050
to the health and
well-being of those

00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:28.330
who serve, we should leave
our politics at the door

00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:30.570
and not be afraid
to follow the data.

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:33.670
There is now an evidence
base for this MDMA therapy

00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:36.660
and a plausible story about what
may be going on in the brain

00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:38.420
to account for the effects."

00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:40.989
So you can see that
our society is really--

00:58:40.989 --> 00:58:42.530
I think-- opening
up to psychedelics.

00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:44.650
We have a chance to
integrate medically and then

00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:47.787
broaden, hopefully,
into more legalization

00:58:47.787 --> 00:58:50.120
and then, hopefully, have
millions and tens of millions,

00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:51.578
hundreds of millions
of people have

00:58:51.578 --> 00:58:53.950
these spiritual experiences.

00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:58.202
And before you know it, world
peace and the Google Department

00:58:58.202 --> 00:58:59.910
of World Peace will
hopefully participate

00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:01.880
in some way or another.

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:03.346
Thank you very much.

00:59:03.346 --> 00:59:05.692
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:10.808 --> 00:59:11.307
Yeah.

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:18.010
OK, so any questions?

00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:19.730
Julie, yeah?

00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:24.010
AUDIENCE: Dr. Doblin, thank you
for mentioning this openness

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:27.450
issue with psilocybin that Dr.
McLean showed and that openness

00:59:27.450 --> 00:59:29.352
being important for
changing behavior.

00:59:29.352 --> 00:59:31.560
But this is the first I've
heard about openness being

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:33.340
measured in MDMA protocol.

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:35.590
So I was wondering if you
could talk a little bit more

00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:36.170
about that.

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:37.340
RICK DOBLIN: Yeah.

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:41.016
Well, the psilocybin research
and the MDMA research,

00:59:41.016 --> 00:59:42.140
we learned from each other.

00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:46.690
So we saw that there was
a benefit in openness.

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:49.160
So we started using
the NEO in our studies.

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.700
And it's been a
long time, trying

00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.120
to get the papers written.

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.850
But we now are using
the same personality

00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:57.489
measures that were used there.

00:59:57.489 --> 00:59:59.030
And we're getting
really good results

00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:01.900
in both the Boulder study and
also in the Charleston study

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:03.820
with veterans.

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:05.280
So it's a good collaboration.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.100
So the psychedelic researchers
are really not competing.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.030
There sort of is a
competition in my mind, who

01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:12.190
gets their drug approved first.

01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:13.690
But we're trying
to help each other.

01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:14.940
AUDIENCE: Healthy competition.

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:17.220
RICK DOBLIN: A healthy
competition, yeah.

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:18.000
Yeah?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.875
AUDIENCE: We've all
heard songs about popping

01:00:19.875 --> 01:00:21.680
Molly in the club.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.620
So do you think that
hedonistic attitudes

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.510
about how MDMA is like the
perfect way to spend the night

01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:31.500
can coexist peacefully with
therapeutic mindsets about--

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:32.900
RICK DOBLIN: Yes, I do actually.

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:36.640
So I think that the problem
with hedonistic approaches

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.920
is that people are
really looking only

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.820
for the good experiences.

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:42.490
And they're missing
out on the fact

01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:44.320
that difficult
experiences are ones where

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.540
people can grow from as well.

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.530
And that's a danger.

01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:49.930
And so we've talked to
different people who

01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:52.930
have said that they took MDMA
in recreational settings,

01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:54.602
and then past trauma came up.

01:00:54.602 --> 01:00:56.560
And within one week, we
had two different women

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.720
talk to us about this.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.320
And one woman said,
I was with friends.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.130
And they were sympathetic.

01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:03.400
And we went off into a corner.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.775
And I talked about
what happened.

01:01:04.775 --> 01:01:05.730
I worked through it.

01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:08.310
And then I was able to feel
better and go back to a party.

01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:11.000
And another woman said, I
was with a bunch of people.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.390
We were all going to have fun.

01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:14.765
And I thought I would take
everybody down by telling them

01:01:14.765 --> 01:01:15.560
about the serious stuff.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.080
So I tried to stuff my feelings.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.520
And now, it's weeks later
and I'm feeling worse.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.180
So I think there's problems with
this, quote, "hedonistic use."

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.870
But I would say that
the celebratory use--

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:29.150
like is a lot of Burning
Man and other things--

01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:32.270
that that can be very
healing and very spiritual.

01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:35.050
So I think we tend to
denigrate recreational use.

01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:37.310
It's somehow lower.

01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:41.040
But I think that it's
people's attitudes.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.660
When you open up
your mind, and if you

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:45.090
say I only want a
good part, I only

01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:47.620
want the happy spectrum
of what's going on,

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:49.722
you're setting yourself
up for disaster.

01:01:49.722 --> 01:01:51.680
And I think that a lot
of the young people that

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.770
use it hedonistically, it's
they don't know any different.

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:56.990
They don't know that
it's a therapeutic drug.

01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:59.080
They only know of
it as a party drug.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.470
So I think, as we develop
the therapeutic use

01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:03.920
and as psychedelic
clinics set up,

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:07.160
people will be able to have a
deeper understanding of what

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.720
these drugs really do.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.500
And also, as the rules
about harm reduction change,

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:14.940
hopefully we'll have
people at big festivals,

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.569
at even big clubs-- I mean,
they already have medical staff.

01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:19.110
And if you could
have somebody that's

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:22.060
trained to help people if they
have a difficult experience,

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:23.360
then I think we'll have a lot.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.830
But I do think that,
culturally, we're

01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:29.650
past the point where tragedies
from the hedonistic use

01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:31.026
will doom the medical use.

01:02:31.026 --> 01:02:31.900
That was a big thing.

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.670
And I think now, the data
about the medical use

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:38.850
is so compelling and the need
is so great that, now, I'm

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:39.830
not worried about it.

01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:42.100
But I do think we need to
redefine recreational use

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.810
and not just think
of it as totally

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:48.500
negative and hedonistic
and casual and reckless.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.200
Yeah?

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:49.825
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:02:49.825 --> 01:02:50.548
Can you--

01:02:50.548 --> 01:02:51.689
RICK DOBLIN: Oh.

01:02:51.689 --> 01:02:53.980
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much for
coming and speaking to us.

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:55.880
And I have a question
in a similar vein,

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.939
where the data definitely
speaks for itself.

01:02:57.939 --> 01:02:59.480
And it makes total
sense that there's

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:03.340
good medical use and really
[INAUDIBLE] to work out.

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:07.185
But at some point, politically,
some aspiring politician

01:03:07.185 --> 01:03:10.490
may think, oh, this is
something that I can just

01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:12.237
go after and say,
hey, drugs are bad.

01:03:12.237 --> 01:03:12.820
It's terrible.

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:14.210
And this is what's
going to get me elected.

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:16.300
So what do you really
think is that critical mass

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.240
that we have to reach
to really be able to be

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.270
that this is mainstream?

01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:22.580
And it won't be politically
savvy to say, no, MDMA,

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:24.410
LSD, psilocybin is terrible.

01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:26.490
And you guys should keep
your kids away from it.

01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:27.824
And you shouldn't be doing this.

01:03:27.824 --> 01:03:29.573
RICK DOBLIN: Yes,
that's a great question.

01:03:29.573 --> 01:03:31.540
And there are people like
that saying that now.

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:32.706
But there are less and less.

01:03:32.706 --> 01:03:34.950
I think the critical
turning point

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:39.039
is going to be when FDA says yes
to making these into medicines.

01:03:39.039 --> 01:03:40.080
And that'll be six years.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.450
So I think it's perilous,
you could say, between now

01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:43.210
and then.

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:45.910
Another turning point
is going to be sooner.

01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:48.560
In this coming year, when
we negotiate with FDA

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.250
and the Heffter people
negotiate about psilocybin

01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:53.500
and move to Phase
3-- once they say,

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.000
yes, you can go to Phase 3,
that's a strong endorsement.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.750
And then, I think it will
not be possible to block

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:02.032
what we're doing, at least
until it gets to the point

01:04:02.032 --> 01:04:02.990
where we have the data.

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:05.760
And then, the question is,
does it become approved?

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.300
But I think this idea
of politicians saying,

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:10.710
let's ramp up the
drug war-- that there

01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:13.900
is rare bipartisan
anything in Washington.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:18.470
But there is a fair amount
of bipartisan recognition

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:22.620
that mass incarceration has
been a disaster for America

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:25.890
and has been incredibly
racist, incredibly destructive.

01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:29.030
And you know, the
Chinese say, crisis

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:30.720
is danger and opportunity.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.300
So right now, the fact
that heroin and phentynol

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.475
are now used by more
and more white people

01:04:36.475 --> 01:04:37.850
and there is more
and more deaths

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:41.920
from opiate addiction, that is
changing people's attitudes.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.820
And now, there is a more
compassionate approach,

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.550
in a lot of places,
towards treatment

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:48.180
instead of incarceration.

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.260
So I think those
voices that are saying,

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:54.230
ramp up the drug
war-- they don't

01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:55.600
have as much power anymore.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.420
But I am sensitive to
the potential backlash.

01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:05.270
But I feel fairly hopeful that
we will be able to continue.

01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:08.850
But it is still risky.

01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:11.750
And the other part of
it is the veterans.

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:15.380
So when you talk about
healing people that

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:18.080
are held in high
esteem by our culture--

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.320
I'm not trying to say I'm
pro-war and everything

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.960
the military does is great.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.270
But by healing
veterans-- veterans

01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:28.370
are a counter-force to
the police, to the DEA.

01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:32.460
And in fact, in our study, we've
said, for political reasons,

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:34.920
we're going to change
the title of the study.

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.860
It's going to be
Veterans, Firefighters,

01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.084
and Police Officers.

01:05:38.084 --> 01:05:38.785
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:38.785 --> 01:05:40.910
We didn't think we'd get
any firefighters or police

01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:41.409
officers.

01:05:41.409 --> 01:05:44.130
But of the 26 people,
we've got 22 veterans,

01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:47.830
three firefighters-- including
one who was here at 9/11.

01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:51.394
And we had one police
officer volunteer.

01:05:51.394 --> 01:05:53.060
And so, when you think
about it, there's

01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:56.580
very few jobs in America that
are as traumatizing as being

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:58.340
a police officer.

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:01.250
And because of
the drug war, I've

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:03.810
not had much compassion
for the police.

01:06:03.810 --> 01:06:07.250
I felt like, I'm the prey
and they're the hunter.

01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:10.820
But to try to get out
of that kind of mindset,

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:14.640
I think showing to the police
even that MDMA therapy can

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.160
help them in their
own-- there is just

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:21.200
a lot of terrible situations
that police have to see.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.220
So we're doing what
we can to cross

01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:25.370
those divides and
undercut arguments

01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:28.950
that we need to protect the kids
or we need to protect America

01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:33.130
by ramping up the drug war.

01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:35.412
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was
wondering, how broad

01:06:35.412 --> 01:06:37.296
is the term "psychedelic"?

01:06:37.296 --> 01:06:40.450
In the sense of, what are
some of the differences

01:06:40.450 --> 01:06:43.228
in the mechanisms and effects
when you talk about LSD

01:06:43.228 --> 01:06:45.550
or psilocybin or MDMA?

01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:47.540
RICK DOBLIN: Yeah,
great question.

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:51.130
So I would say that
there is a group of drugs

01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:52.950
that we call the
classic psychedelics.

01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:56.300
And those are like LSD,
mescaline from peyote,

01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:59.130
mushrooms, ayahuasca, ibogaine.

01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:02.110
And there's been
incredible research

01:07:02.110 --> 01:07:05.124
now with brain scans with
people under the influence

01:07:05.124 --> 01:07:05.790
of psychedelics.

01:07:05.790 --> 01:07:07.910
So we have not just
psychedelic psychotherapy,

01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:10.250
but psychedelic
neuroscience is happening.

01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:12.240
And so there's two
different things

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.090
that happen with the
classic psychedelics

01:07:14.090 --> 01:07:16.930
and then what's happened with
MDMA and drugs like that.

01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:20.370
And the difference is that,
with the classic psychedelics,

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:23.400
there's a network in the
brain called the Default Mode

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.250
Network.

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:26.240
And that's more
or less identified

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.570
as the ego structures.

01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:30.140
So it's like, when you're not
doing anything in particular,

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:31.806
you're kind of scanning
the environment,

01:07:31.806 --> 01:07:33.770
you're looking for
what's important to you

01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:35.830
for your different
hierarchy of needs,

01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:38.210
but you're kind of ego-focused,
centered in yourself.

01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:40.140
And there's actually
so much information

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:41.879
that we're perceiving
all the time,

01:07:41.879 --> 01:07:43.420
but we don't pay
attention to it all.

01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:44.680
It would be overwhelming.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:47.920
So the Default Mode Network
filters out everything

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.760
that you think is not important.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.186
Like there's noises of
the air conditioning.

01:07:52.186 --> 01:07:54.560
There's noises that we're not
really paying attention to.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.570
So what the classic
psychedelics do

01:07:56.570 --> 01:08:00.080
is they weaken the
Default Mode Network.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:04.210
And they permit a flood
of perceptions to emerge.

01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:08.570
The woman, Amanda Fielding--
she heads the Beckley

01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:09.540
Foundation in England.

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:11.150
She funded this research.

01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:13.530
And what I'm so
proud of her for is

01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:17.109
that she thought, since the
'60s, from her experiences

01:08:17.109 --> 01:08:20.350
with LSD, that LSD must increase
blood flow in the brain.

01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:22.649
It must increase your activity.

01:08:22.649 --> 01:08:23.800
But actually it doesn't.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.760
It decreases activity in
these Default Mode Networks.

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.600
MDMA doesn't really do that.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.600
What MDMA does is
it reduces activity

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.790
in the amygdala, which
is the fear processing

01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:35.770
part of the brain.

01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:39.630
And it enhances activity in
the frontal cortex, where

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:41.490
you put things in associations.

01:08:41.490 --> 01:08:44.170
So you have a reduced
fear about trauma.

01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:47.890
And then, when you're
able to recall the memory,

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:50.149
you can really set
it in to the past

01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:52.819
instead of constantly
intruding on the present.

01:08:52.819 --> 01:08:56.403
And MDMA doesn't
dissolve the ego the way

01:08:56.403 --> 01:08:57.569
the classic psychedelics do.

01:08:57.569 --> 01:09:00.140
But it helps people feel
so grounded and centered

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:03.870
in themself that, then, they
can see the wider world.

01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:08.010
Stan Groff has talked
about it as, you're

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.840
transparent to the transcendent.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.439
And that's more like MDMA.

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:14.439
You become transparent
to the transcendent.

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:17.200
Whereas LSD sort of
dissolves everything that

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.390
keeps you feeling separate.

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:22.510
Yeah.

01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:23.394
Great.

01:09:23.394 --> 01:09:24.600
Any questions?

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.399
OK, I guess that's it.

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:27.479
OK, thank you very much.

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:28.306
It was great.

01:09:28.306 --> 01:09:31.836
[APPLAUSE]
