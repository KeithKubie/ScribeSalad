00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.600
As a reminder, what's now examined as one of the OCL Postcondition Constraints,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.680
specifying what happens when a user moves the handle.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.820
Remember, there are direct and indirect effects.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.370
And this, in here, we're talking about the direct effect.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.129
This particular constraint says that when the handle is moved,

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.960
we expect the handle position to be in a different place.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.880
This says just what we would expect.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.420
After the user moves the handle, the handle is in the expected position.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.750
Note several things about the specification.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.260
For the first, because it's a direct effect, it's very simple.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.370
And that's exactly the kind of thing we like to have in an event handler.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.020
Event handlers have to be very fast, because there's lot's of events, and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.900
therefore, they have to do simple things and we'd hope that the OCL expression,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.560
which is specifying that, is similarly simple.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.380
Second it doesn't say anything about what is happening to the viewport.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.980
That's an indirect effect.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.480
This is the responsibility of that display association.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.390
And we will get to how we're going to deal with that in awhile.
