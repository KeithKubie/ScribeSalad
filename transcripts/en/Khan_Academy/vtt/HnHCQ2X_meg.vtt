00:00:00.326 --> 00:00:02.427
- [Voiceover] Carlos has
taken an initial dose

00:00:02.427 --> 00:00:04.563
of a prescription medication.

00:00:04.563 --> 00:00:06.758
The relationship between the time,

00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:09.276
between the elapsed time t, in hours,

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:12.225
since he took the first dose
and the amount of medication,

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:14.977
M of t, in milligrams, in
his bloodstream is modeled

00:00:14.977 --> 00:00:17.078
by the following function.

00:00:17.078 --> 00:00:21.558
Alright, in how many hours
will Carlos have 1 milligram

00:00:21.558 --> 00:00:25.459
of medication remaining
in his bloodstream?

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:29.279
So M of what t is equal to, so
we need essentially to solve

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.421
for M of t is equal to 1 milligram.

00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:35.091
Because M of t outputs, whatever
value it outputs is going

00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:36.713
to be in milligram.

00:00:36.713 --> 00:00:37.987
So let's just solve that.

00:00:37.987 --> 00:00:40.601
So M of t is, they give us a definition,

00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:44.722
it's model is an exponential
function, 20 times e

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:48.193
to the negative 0.8 t

00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:50.712
is equal to one.

00:00:50.712 --> 00:00:54.392
So let's see, we can
divide both sides by 20

00:00:54.392 --> 00:00:57.741
and so we will get e

00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:01.165
to the negative 0.8 t

00:01:01.165 --> 00:01:03.551
is equal to one over 20,

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.671
one over 20.

00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:11.082
Which we could write as 0.05, 0.05.

00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:12.673
I have a feeling we're gonna
have to deal with decimals

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:14.093
here regardless.

00:01:14.093 --> 00:01:16.971
And so how do we, how do we solve this?

00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:20.103
Well one way to think about
it, one way to think about it

00:01:20.103 --> 00:01:22.011
if we took, what happens
if we took the natural log

00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:23.149
of both sides?

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.353
And just a remember, a
reminder, the natural log

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:29.546
is the logarithm base e.

00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:30.999
So actually let me write
this, let me write this

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:32.983
a little bit differently.

00:01:32.983 --> 00:01:35.676
So this is zero and

00:01:35.676 --> 00:01:40.676
that is 0.05.

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:45.678
So I'm gonna take the natural
log of both sides, so ln, ln.

00:01:45.678 --> 00:01:49.232
So the natural log, this
says, what power do I have

00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:54.232
to raise e to, to get to
e to the negative 0.8 t?

00:01:54.232 --> 00:01:58.318
Well I've got to raise e
to the, this simplifies

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:02.265
to negative 0.8 t.

00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:04.414
Once again natural log this thing...

00:02:04.414 --> 00:02:09.405
let me clarify ln of e
to the negative 0.8 t.

00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:13.071
This is equivalent to if
I were to write log base e

00:02:13.071 --> 00:02:16.973
of e to the negative 0.8 t.

00:02:16.973 --> 00:02:19.038
What power do I have to raise e to, to get

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:21.257
to e to the negative 0.8 t?

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:24.053
Well I have to raise it to
the negative 0.8 t power.

00:02:24.053 --> 00:02:26.712
So that's why the left-hand
side simplified to this

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:29.452
and that's going to be
equal to the natural log,

00:02:29.452 --> 00:02:31.297
actually I'll just
leave it in those terms,

00:02:31.297 --> 00:02:34.515
the natural log of 0.05,

00:02:34.515 --> 00:02:39.303
the natural log of 0.05

00:02:39.303 --> 00:02:42.458
all of that and now we
can divide both sides

00:02:42.458 --> 00:02:46.742
by negative 0.8 to solve for t.

00:02:46.742 --> 00:02:49.172
So let's do that.

00:02:49.172 --> 00:02:54.172
So we divide by negative 0.8,

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:58.118
divide by negative 0.8

00:02:58.118 --> 00:03:01.077
and so t is going to be equal
to all of this business.

00:03:01.077 --> 00:03:03.121
On the left-hand side now we just have a t

00:03:03.121 --> 00:03:05.362
and on the right-hand side
we have all of this business

00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:07.568
which I think a calculator
will be valuable for.

00:03:07.568 --> 00:03:09.641
So let me get a calculator out.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.120
Clear it out and let's start with 0.05.

00:03:16.123 --> 00:03:17.733
Let's take the natural log, that's

00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:20.450
that button right over
there, the natural log.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.805
We get that value and we want
to divide it by negative .8.

00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:26.147
So divided by,

00:03:26.147 --> 00:03:31.147
divided by .8 negative.

00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:35.254
So we're gonna divide by
.8 negative is equal to,

00:03:35.254 --> 00:03:38.361
let's see they wanted us to
round to the nearest hundredth

00:03:38.361 --> 00:03:41.484
so 3.74,

00:03:41.484 --> 00:03:44.921
so it'll take 3.74,

00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:47.786
seven four hours for his dosage

00:03:47.786 --> 00:03:50.491
to go down to one milligram
where it actually started

00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:51.871
at 20 milligrams.

00:03:51.871 --> 00:03:54.019
When t equals zero it's 20

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.641
after 3.74 hours he's down

00:03:57.641 --> 00:03:59.521
in his bloodstream to one milligram.

00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:03.397
I guess his body has metabolized
the rest of it in some way.
