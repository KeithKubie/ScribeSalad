00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.060
In my lab we study how people and animals move and in particular how the nervous system interacts

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.840
with the biomechanics of the body in the environment to produce useful movement

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.300
and in particular we study balance control as well as walking.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.040
My parents were born in China and went to Taiwan where they grew up

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.780
and then came to the US for graduate study.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.600
As a child we spoke Chinese at home. I spoke English at preschool and then when

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.100
I was five we moved to Italy and I learned Italian,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.820
so I've been speaking multiple languages and doing a lot of translating

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.840
throughout my life and I think that actually translates really well to what I do today

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.500
in bridging seemingly different disciplines.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.080
I have a number of students and postdocs, they come from all sorts of disciplines,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.640
from neuroscience from mechanical engineering, from robotics and biomedical engineering.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.540
In college I chose mechanical engineering partly because I wanted to be an astronaut

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.900
and was interested in space exploration and aeronautics and things like that.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.000
I met a graduate student in robotics who pointed me to a biology professors lab

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.980
where I ended up spending two or three years doing research studying

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.780
actually how insects move and the principles that we found have actually been used

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.260
to develop six-legged robots that are able to walk on complex surfaces.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.760
But I ultimately decided I wanted to work on something a little bit more directly applicable to human movement

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.620
and particularly to rehabilitation.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.360
Now with the advent of robots that you can buy off-the-shelf, we can actually think

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.640
about using robotics to assist people with gait or balance impairments.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.960
A lot of my insights about human movement come from the fact that I like to do a lot of different sports

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.000
so this understanding of how muscles work together in groups

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.660
both because of the way neurons act together as well as how they act on the biomechanics

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.500
has been one of our major contributions to science.
