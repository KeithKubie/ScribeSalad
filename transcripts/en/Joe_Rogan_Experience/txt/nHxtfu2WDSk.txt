Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Joe, you did it. You might be right about this racist shit, by the way, because the only other ones that don't have to pay taxes. The, the, the golf league. The PGA and that. The NHL

Speaker 2:          00:12          Peter [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:16          Hold on. There's another fellow. Well Dad is fucking creepy. You should be pissed. Yeah. Doug Golf guys don't have to pay tax like the most money. Right? Wow. That's dark. That's dark, dark racism. Wow. I think it's racism. I'm crying racism for the NBA and I don't even watch basketball. Yeah. The idea that you could get away with that Scientology thing, that that could be, we need to start our own fucking religion. That's what needed to do. God dammit. That's how you're really good tip blockchains. That's how you're really locked down. That's the quote right there. When this dog and religion, God dammit. Well, they have so much money that they can get away with it. Like Scientology is a number to land owner in Los Angeles. They own more buildings and property real estate in Los Angeles. Then like almost anybody,

Speaker 1:          01:07          hey freakiest thing is, you know how to rope off everything at a time square when, uh, when the ball is going to drop or whatever. Yeah. And there's a certain time you can't go past the barricades. One night I was there and the guy said, why are you a member of the Church of Scientology? And I said, yeah. And he let me in through the barricade. Real Story. Dude. Real Story. He probably just wanted to fuck you.

Speaker 2:          01:30          [inaudible] handsome guy. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:45          take a cod podcast. [inaudible] press a button. You gotta keep the ball moving. What is the, wow, what are you supposed to say? Amazing. He probably loved you, dude. The Scientologists friends I could give me goosebumps are really good song. Didn't give me goosebumps. Like the other day I was driving home and radar love came on. You know that song you've ever heard that song? Oh God. It's like a one hit wonder band from the sixties or seventies pull that, pull that out. Brian is the greatest driving music of all time. And when I was 18 years old, I had this girlfriend that moved to western Massachusetts. I was living in Boston, I was living in Newton and she moved to like an hour and a half away and he's to have to drive to go visit her. And My cars were always pieces of shit, so it's always a death drive. Then one time I broke down in the snow storm halfway to visitors. Fucking huge disaster. But uh, I had a cassette and I would play this song radar love because it's all about driving. It's all about driving when you're exhausted and just keeping your foot on the gas. And this song came on the other day and my whole body tangled like I'm driving and I heard it come on, like as I change the channel, it was right with a drum starts beating

Speaker 4:          03:11          right here, right here.

Speaker 3:          03:16          And that's right when I hit the channel and that was in the car and I was driving and it was late at night. Any, first of all, my whole body started tingling and it brought me immediately back the beans, some half retarded, 18 year old driving my piece of shit. Audi Fox that could fall apart at any minute. Wheels could fly off and go in the fucking oncoming lanes. Listen to this shit though. Their boys in my head that Mikey d some dude did this to it's half as as I'm shifting

Speaker 5:          03:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          04:18          red. That's a powerful fucking song. They have loved radar love. She sends it out and he gets in the car and fucking guns it over there. That's fucking beautiful. Thank you for introducing that to me. It's tingly. It gives me tingles. So tell me man we were, we were talking about this but we got off track, up subject. What did you do the entire year that you were in? Solid.

Speaker 4:          04:40          Sorry, what was your day? Did all to wake up cause cause it was weird. They would feed us like at m 4:00 AM was breakfast, right? Does that wake you have a feed you breakfast and eat and pass back out. Right. And then you get up again, like really nine or 10 and hour and 10 o'clock we'll be lunch. That's what need you to tell it. [inaudible] weird schedule, pick the lunch. And then from that point on I will just read, I would read from 10:00 AM until like 11 at night and I'll take an hour break to work out. Wow. I mean I read the second year I kept track of with 117 books. Wow. But um, I, there's not any way I could ever have way more. But you went out of books, you know, you run out of books. It's so boring. I only came out of my cell every other day for an hour, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          05:22          And then just like a just fucking board dude. What is it like to not talk to people for so long? I mean you talked to, I mean it's just weird dude. It's like a, as far as anybody, it's like a fucking time warp because when you're in there, the day goes by real slow with like the months go by quick and then when you get out it's just like, it's like a, it was all a dream. You didn't move. You weren't even in there. It's weird. It fucks with your head and then like, oh it was whoa man, they under fed us so bad. Do they fucking on the Fed is bad. Yeah. And last thing real bad, uh, I was trying to calculate how much protein, I thought that was good in a day and it was like 20, 30 grams, dude, Whoa, here's, here's, I know it was bullshit.

Speaker 4:          06:03          And this is in Vegas, especially if it's anything goes better in Vegas. We only got a piece of fruit like twice a week. So like we've got like an orange like twice or three times a week. That's it. But it's weird cause Mayweather was there, right? So may when I got there to his, his like two months sends fucking, he started bitching at the, at the, at the judge like they're not feeding me enough to give me shit for you, blah blah blah. All of a sudden Bam fruit every day. Big Portions, all this shit for all of you. Everyone. Right. Cause I know why. I know why. Because they were scared that maybe whether it's camp was going to have the, the people that feed us, you know, investigating. Yeah. You know, and guess what, the second he left went away. Wow. No Shit. I swear to God. And I told the, I told one of the cool, God's aim and come here. I say notice motherfucker. They as soon as me with her started bitching at court, now we've got bigger trades and we got fruit everyday and he started chuckling and he laughed and walked away. Blight. It's like they knew, they knew what was up. They were undefeated on the fuck out of us.

Speaker 3:          06:58          Yeah. My Brother Sam is the cherries and the brother wrote it. Yeah. Big, big part of it that keeps sticking with me was that he was like this really normal quiet kind of kid and then he got hit in the head. He got like hit by a car and he got really fucked up and when he recovered he became this reckless fucking maniac. He became Kennison. So you know, a big part of what made him so amazing might've been an accident. Like that happens sometimes. Like there was a story recently about a guy who got hit in the head. He had some sort of head injury and then he came out of it and he could play music. Like there's weird things that happen sometimes, right? I went to school with a girl that had a head injury in that she got huge tits and I'm not trying to be funny.

Speaker 3:          07:42          I wish I was lying to you. This chick was flat chested is fuck. Got a head injury her freshman year. By the time she was a junior, her tits were fucking ginormous and should become like this sex fucking crazy chick like, and I went to grammar school with her. I knew she wasn't a sex fiend and I bumped into like when she was a senior and she was fucking nuts. I was a junior. I was like, Jesus, just to fucking kids and just wondering to fuck. Just, just, you know, like if this guy doesn't fuck me, y'all gonna fuck me. I'm like, ah. I don't think I had injury. Think it was, now that you said that, well, think about Shannon and reusable and now she won't talk to me now. She made up, I, my buddy of mine bumped into her and she goes, I don't talk for that mother fucker. She wasn't talking about slow because she wasn't, you wouldn't bug her. I don't know what it was. And I, and I still mad in the freshman. That's the girl I got left back over. Oh Wow. In the seventh grade, from meeting her pussy and shit like that, she wouldn't let me bang. I just dry humped and suck the titties and stuff like that.
