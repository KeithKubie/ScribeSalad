00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:01.840
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.370
start with some point
that's not on the plane,

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.420
or maybe not necessarily
on the plane.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.890
So let me draw a
point right over here.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.460
And let's say the coordinates
of that point are x 0 x sub 0,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.500
y sub 0, and z sub 0.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.100
Or it could be specified
as a position vector.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.570
I could draw the position
vector like this.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.930
So the position vector-- let
me draw a better dotted lines.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.670
The position vector for this
could be x0i plus y0j plus z0k.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.280
It specifies this
coordinate right over here.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.930
What I want to do
is find the distance

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.400
between this point
and the plane.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.400
And obviously, there could
be a lot of distance.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.490
I could find the distance
between this point

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.530
and that point, and this
point and this point,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.000
and this point this point.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.791
And when I say I want
to find the distance,

00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:50.360
I want to find the
minimum distance.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.130
And you're actually going to
get the minimum distance when

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.930
you go the perpendicular
distance to the plane,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.640
or the normal
distance to the plane.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.540
And we'll, hopefully,
see that visually

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.650
as we try to figure out how
to calculate the distance.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.040
So the first thing we can
do is, let's just construct

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.060
a vector between
this point that's

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.350
off the plane and some
point that's on the plane.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.600
And we already have a point
from the last video that's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.480
on the plane, this x
sub p, y sub p, z sub p.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.570
So let's construct
a vector here.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.080
Let's construct this
orange vector that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.650
starts on the plane, it's
tail is on the plane,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.560
and it goes off the plane.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.440
I want to do that in orange.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.950
It goes off the plane to
this vector, to this position

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.880
x0 y0 z0.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.350
So how could we specify this
vector, right over here?

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.859
Well, that vector, let
me call that vector,

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.150
well, I'll just call that
vector, what letters have I'm

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.810
not used yet?

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.090
Let me call that vector f.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.350
Vector f is just going to
be this yellow position

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.260
vector, minus this
green position vector.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.215
So it's going to
be, this x component

00:01:59.215 --> 00:02:01.340
is going to be the difference
of the x-coordinates,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.923
it's y-coordinate is going the
difference of the y-coordinate.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:08.370
S So it's going to
be x0 minus x sub p.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.730
I subtracted the
x-coordinates, i.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:19.790
Plus y0 minus ypj plus-- we'll
go to the next line-- plus z0

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.600
minus zp minus zpk.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.410
So fair enough.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.630
That's just some vector
that comes off of the plane

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.990
and onto this point.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.440
But what we want to find
out is this distance.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.620
We want to find out
this distance in yellow,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.590
the distance that if I were
take a normal off of the plane

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.190
and go straight to
the point, that's

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.390
going to be the
shortest distance.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.230
And actually, you can
see it visually now.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.170
Because if look at-- we can
actually form a right triangle

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.970
here-- so this base of the right
triangle is along the plane.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.970
This side is normal
to the plane.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.970
So this is a right angle.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.620
And you can see, if I take
any point, any other point

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.560
on the plane, it will form a
hypotenuse on a right triangle.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.130
And obviously the shortest
side here, or the shortest

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.720
way to get to the
plane, is going

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.080
to be this distance, right here,
as opposed to the hypotenuse.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.900
This side will always be
shorter than that side.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.190
So given that we know
this vector here,

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.500
how can we figure
out this length here?

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.450
How can we figure out
this length here in blue?

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.550
Well, we could figure out
the magnitude of this vector.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.439
So the length of
this side right here

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.230
is going to be the
magnitude of the vector,

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.615
so it's going to be the
magnitude of the vector f.

00:03:34.615 --> 00:03:35.990
That'll just give
us this length.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.661
But we want this blue length.

00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:38.910
Well, we could think about it.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.770
If this was some angle-- I know
the writing is getting small.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.370
If this was some angle theta, we
could use some pretty straight

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.530
up, pretty straightforward
trigonometry.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.900
If the distance
under question is d,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.232
you could say cosine of theta
is equal to the adjacent side

00:03:59.232 --> 00:04:00.065
over the hypotenuse.

00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:03.990
Or is is equal to d-- d
is the adjacent side-- is

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.400
equal to d over the hypotenuse.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.070
Well, the hypotenuse is the
magnitude of this vector.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.000
It's the magnitude
of the vector f.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.320
Or we could say the
magnitude of the vector

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.660
f times the cosine of
theta-- I'm just multiplying

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.290
both sides times the magnitude
of vector x-- f is equal to d.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.112
But still you might say, OK,
well Sal, we know what f is.

00:04:30.112 --> 00:04:31.070
We can figure that out.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.400
We can figure out its magnitude.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.370
But we don't know what theta is.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.490
How do we figure out what theta?

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.020
And to do that, let's just
think about it a little bit.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.020
This angle, this angle of
theta, is the same angle.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.150
So this distance here
isn't necessarily

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.110
the same as the length
of the normal vector.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.170
But it's definitely going
in the same direction.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.560
So this angle here, is
really the same thing

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.150
as the angle between this
vector and the normal vector.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.420
And so you might remember
from earlier linear algebra,

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.380
when we talk about the dot
product of two vectors,

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.960
it involves something
with the cosine

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.450
of the angle between them.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.920
And to make that fresh
in your mind, let's

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.270
multiply and divide both sides.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.660
Let me multiply and divide
the left side of this equation

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.724
by the magnitude of
the normal vector.

00:05:19.724 --> 00:05:21.390
So I'm obviously not
changing its value.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.716
I'm multiplying and
dividing by the same number.

00:05:23.716 --> 00:05:26.340
So I'm going to multiply by the
magnitude of the normal vector.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.750
And I'm going to divide by the
magnitude of the normal vector.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.930
So I'm just essentially
multiplying by 1.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.590
So I have not changed this.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.110
But when you do it in
this, it might ring a bell.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.450
This expression up here,
this expression right here,

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:48.370
is the dot product of the
normal vector and this vector

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.840
right here, f.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.200
So this right here
is the dot product.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.580
This is n dot f, up there.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.930
It's equal to the product
of their magnitudes

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.330
times the cosine of
the angle between them.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.640
So the distance, that shortest
distance we care about,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.410
is a dot product between this
vector, the normal vector,

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:17.342
divided by the magnitude
of the normal vector.

00:06:17.342 --> 00:06:18.050
So let's do that.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.330
Let's take the dot product
between the normal and this.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.260
And we already figured
out, in the last video,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.744
the normal vector, if you
have the equation of a plane,

00:06:25.744 --> 00:06:27.660
the normal vector is
literally, its components

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.850
are just the coefficients
on the x, y, and z terms.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.390
So this is a normal
vector right over here.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.590
So let's literally
take the dot product.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:47.120
So n dot f is going to be
equal to A times x0 minus xp.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.520
I'll do that in pink.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.950
So it'll be Ax0 minus Axp.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.380
And then plus B times
the y component here.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.190
So plus By0.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.910
I'm just distributing
the B, minus Byp.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:09.190
And then plus-- I'll
do another color here,

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.820
that's too close of a color--
plus C times the z component.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.205
So plus Cz0 minus Czp.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.040
And all of that over the
magnitude of the normal vector.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.160
So what's the magnitude of
the normal vector going to be?

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.640
It's just the square
root of the normal vector

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.070
dotted with itself.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.664
So it's just each of these
guys squared added to themself,

00:07:34.664 --> 00:07:36.080
and you're taking
the square root.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.160
So it's the square
root-- maybe I

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.400
can do a nicer looking radical
sign than that-- of A squared

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.720
plus B squared plus C squared.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.480
Now, what is this up
here simplified to?

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.890
Let me just rewrite this.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.750
So this is the
distance in question.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.230
This right here is
equal to the distance.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.130
But let's see if
we can simplify it.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.280
So first, we can take all
of the terms with the x0.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.790
These involve the point
that sits off the plane.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.750
Remember, x0, y0, z0
sat off the plane.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:17.880
So this is Ax0
plus By0 plus Cz0.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.830
And then what are
these terms equal to?

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.810
What are these terms?

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:29.330
Negative Axp minus
Byp minus Czp?

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.320
Well, if you remember
here, D in the equation

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.169
of in the equation
of a plane, D,

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.549
when we started
in the last video

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.506
when we tried to figure out
what the normal to a plane is,

00:08:38.506 --> 00:08:42.860
D is-- if this point
xp sits on the plane--

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:49.860
D is Axp plus Byp plus Czp.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.770
Or another way you
could say it is,

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:57.182
negative D would be
negative A-- and it's just

00:08:57.182 --> 00:08:59.640
the difference between lowercase
and uppercase here, right?

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.410
We're saying that lowercase is
the same as this uppercase A.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:10.052
So it's negative Axp
minus Byp minus Czp.

00:09:10.052 --> 00:09:12.010
I'm just using what we
got from the last video.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.701
This is what D is so negative
D will be this business.

00:09:15.701 --> 00:09:17.450
And that's exactly
what we have over here.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:21.920
We have negative Axp
negative Byp negative Czp.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.460
So all of this term,
this term, and this term

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.500
simplifies to a minus D. And
remember, this negative capital

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.480
D, this is the D from the
equation of the plane, not

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.680
the distance d.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.404
So this is the numerator
of our distance.

00:09:39.404 --> 00:09:41.070
And then the denominator
of our distance

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:47.470
is just the square root of A
squared plus B squared plus C

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:47.995
squared.

00:09:47.995 --> 00:09:48.620
And we're done.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.090
This tells us the distance
between any point and a plane.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.280
And this is a pretty
intuitive formula here.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.680
Because all we're
doing, if I give

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.770
you-- let me give
you an example.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.406
Let's say I have the plane.

00:10:01.406 --> 00:10:09.490
If I have the plane 1x minus
2y plus 3z is equal to 5.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:10.900
So that's some plane.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.250
And let me pick some point
that's not on the plane.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:18.640
So let's say I have the point,
I don't know, let me say I have

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.789
the 2, 2, 3.

00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:23.580
And let me make sure
it's not on the plane.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.260
So it's 2 minus 6 is
negative-- yeah, so this won't.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.110
Let me just pick a random 1.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.740
So this definitely
is not on the plane,

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.830
because we have
2 minus 6 plus 3.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.230
That gives us negative
1, which is not 5.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.290
So this is definitely
not on the plane.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.050
We can find the distance
between this point and the plane

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.100
using the formula
we just derived.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:53.935
We literally just evaluate at--
so this will just be 1 times 2.

00:10:53.935 --> 00:10:55.060
Let me use that same color.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:03.100
1 times 2 minus 2
times-- I'm going

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:09.050
to fill it in-- plus 3
times something, minus 5.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.590
All of that over, and I
haven't put these guys in.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:12.650
Let me do that right now.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:19.150
So 1 times 2 minus 2
times 3 plus 3 times 1.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.430
This 1 minus 5, you're
kind of bringing it over

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.750
to the left hand side.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:27.910
All of that over
the square root of 1

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.720
squared, which is
1, plus negative 2

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.860
squared, which is 4, plus
3 squared, which is 9.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:42.120
So it's going to be equal to,
let's see, this is 2 minus 6,

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.520
or negative 6.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.660
And then you have plus 3.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.570
And then minus 5.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:48.650
So this is what?

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.100
This is 5.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.770
2 plus 3 is 5 minus 5.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:53.880
So those cancel out.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.490
So this is negative 6.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.360
So it's equal to negative
6 over the square root of 5

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.950
plus 9 is 14.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.800
Over the square root of 14.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.960
And you're done.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.710
So hopefully, you
find that useful.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:11.780
And hopefully, we can apply this
in the other example problems.
