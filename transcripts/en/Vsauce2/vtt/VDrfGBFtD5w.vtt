00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.750
Teenagers in Hong Kong have invented a door
handle coated with titanium dioxide that when

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.090
activated by LED light kills 99.8% of all
the bacteria.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.709
And Engineers in Binghamton have invented
a bacteria-powered paper battery that folds

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.650
like origami and costs five cents.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.650
&nbsp;

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.650
Vsauce!

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.570
Kevin here - this is Mind Blow.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:30.810
The Thync Mood Regulator is a wearable headset
that allows you to control your moods.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.201
Transcranial direct current stimulation has
been around for over a hundred years and a

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:39.800
team of engineers, doctors and neurobiologists
have created a consumer model.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.070
The wearable device is intended to induce
mental relaxation or temporarily increase

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.800
alertness by using neural signaling.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.780
It was just released this month and it’s
not intended to diagnose or treat any medical

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.920
condition.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.050
The Handii Hackberry is a 3D printed open
source robotic hand.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.500
The Japanese company has made the blueprints
and source code freely available and it features

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.860
a flexible wrist, grasping and picking action
differentiation and only costs $300.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.640
Pembient is hoping to prevent the extinction
of rhinos by 3D-bioprinting their horns.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.820
The western black rhino went extinct in 2011
due to poaching for its valuable keratin.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.660
The horns that Pembient are printing are indistinguishable
from the real thing even down to the molecular

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.250
level, and they hope to significantly lower
the value of Rhino horns by introducing the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.700
product to the market later this year.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.110
Researchers from Columbia University have
created the world’s thinnest lightbulb.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.430
By using a graphene coating that can withstand
temperatures as high as 2500 degrees celsius

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.210
they’re able to build a filament that’s
atomically thin but able to generate visible

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.210
light.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.210
And they hope to build circuits that use photons
instead of electrons to pave the way for large-scale,

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.310
flexible, atomically thin, transparent light
emitters.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.020
Another team at Columbia University built
a miniature car powered by the air’s natural

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.070
humidity.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.830
Using microscopic moisture-sucking spores
they were able to build a turbine engine that

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.290
rotates as water evaporates.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.319
Evaporation is a stronger force than wind
or waves and has previously been untapped

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.219
from an energy perspective.

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:22.269
The team believes this breakthrough could
someday lead to generating energy via natural

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.599
evaporation.

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.609
Project Soli makes your hand a controller.

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.819
Google released this video a few weeks ago
highlighting how the system works.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.780
Radar has very high positional accuracy which
allows it to track minute movements better

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.299
than a camera, and it’s unique in that it
can transmit and receive information through

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.610
solid materials.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.069
The chip has already been built, and the team
is currently testing how it can be integrated

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.209
into consumer products.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.279
Engineers at Harvard have developed a soft
robotic glove to help the disabled grasp objects.

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:59.719
Designed for sufferers of ALS, muscular dystrophy
and stroke, the glove is soft and lightweight.

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.510
And it’s powered by pumping water into the
fibrous joints.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.269
Currently it’s activated by voice command
or switch but the team is working to improve

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.620
the device so that it can detect when to grasp
based on the user’s arm movements.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.309
A group of chemists and engineers have invented
a neural lace.

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:21.849
Small enough to be injected, brain cells have
been found to grow around and connect to the

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.010
lace, successfully creating a mechanical connection
into a biochemical system.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.439
The Neural Lace has only been tested on mice
as of now, but could someday be used to treat

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:36.650
parkinson's or create a wireless connection
between a brain and the internet.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.019
Scientists from Australia have proven that
at a subatomic level - future events affect

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.079
the past.

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:48.109
They shot helium atoms at a sensor and then
randomly inserted a grate into where the helium

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.549
atoms had just been.

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.549
When they checked the data they found that
the helium atoms reacted as though they had

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.699
passed through the grate even though the grate
had been placed after they were shot, proving

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:05.010
for particles time moves backwards and quote
“reality does not exist if you are not looking

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.010
at it.”

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.010
[Terminator] Vsauce!

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.069
I've come to protect Kevin from the T-1000.

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.069
Uhh…Terminator?

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.230
I was just finishing Mind Blow.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.220
[Terminator] Come with me if you want to live.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.370
Okay well I gotta go because I would like
to live - so check out these miniature star-shaped

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:39.289
robots being 
developed 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.229
to perform surgery.

00:04:42.229 --> 00:05:18.500
And always - thanks for watching!
