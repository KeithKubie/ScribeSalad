00:00:01.792 --> 00:00:04.709
(mysterious music)

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.933
- The war took a lot from this place.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.253
We all started from this wilderness,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.120
and it has to remain on us

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.373
otherwise we lost our
identity, we lost part of us.

00:00:27.725 --> 00:00:30.392
(intense music)

00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:36.310
I am part of the next generation of women

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.523
that has to make sure
that this place survives.

00:00:41.518 --> 00:00:44.185
(intense music)

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:03.201
- It's difficult to explain to somebody

00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:05.993
who did not know what was here,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.333
but myself, I knew what was here.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.303
(urgent music)

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.760
We are in Gorongosa National
Park in Southern Africa.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.343
Very close to the Indian Ocean.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.910
Tourists, they used to come
from all over the world,

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.853
and animal populations used to be huge.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.543
War in Mozambique was very terrible.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.823
One million people died.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
When a country faces war, nature
is first to face challenge.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.400
Animals have been poached to buy firearms

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.833
and equipment to feed soldiers.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.783
90% of animal population disappeared.

00:02:21.897 --> 00:02:26.662
Our mission of this park is to restore

00:02:26.662 --> 00:02:28.211
the Gorongosa ecosystem.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.730
Not only nature but also
to develop human beings.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.450
- As a woman, especially
in the science field,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.393
in the beginning it was really bad.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.810
I remember very well my
first time in the field

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.690
and the rangers would say,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.300
no I'm not going with you to the field

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.233
because you're a woman, you're
a girl, you won't make it.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.070
I've been tracking these
elephants for two months so far.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.043
So it's quite recent.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.373
I can't see footprints
but it's very fresh.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.853
There's not even dung beetles in it yet.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.353
They went into the forest.

00:03:46.448 --> 00:03:49.680
There's other women extremely brave

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.130
that do patrols every day, the rangers.

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:00.347
Take one!

00:04:00.572 --> 00:04:04.572
(foreign language conversation)

00:04:10.325 --> 00:04:14.342
I became a ranger because I wanted

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:18.825
to work and move ahead with my life.

00:04:22.474 --> 00:04:27.457
Some of the training
was difficult for women,

00:04:28.674 --> 00:04:31.416
but I wanted the job.

00:04:37.224 --> 00:04:40.649
I pushed through and realized

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:43.874
I could do anything a man could do.

00:04:59.784 --> 00:05:04.783
Before I came here there
were many poachers.

00:05:12.514 --> 00:05:14.830
The animal population used to suffer a lot

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.488
because of the steel wires and traps.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.354
We find them and remove them.

00:05:25.803 --> 00:05:27.702
We are protecting all the animals

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.402
that are here at Gorongosa National Park.

00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:44.325
You know she works with a very big animal.

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:46.522
Which animal is really, really big?

00:05:47.214 --> 00:05:48.430
Elephants!

00:05:51.847 --> 00:05:55.250
- What would happen to us
if girls are not educated?

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.990
What will this world be?

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.823
I mean.

00:05:59.316 --> 00:06:00.816
Who wants to work with elephants?

00:06:01.083 --> 00:06:02.558
Raise your hands.

00:06:03.645 --> 00:06:06.811
So you should have many
questions for her today!

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.970
- The girls club is a platform

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.310
where girls can talk
and share their ideas,

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.073
share their challenges.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.560
I didn't have a very smooth childhood.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.580
Not because my parents were not good, no.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.400
On the contrary it was just,

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.473
we were poor and we had
many, many difficulties.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.390
It's just what many other African girls

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.820
are also going through.

00:06:42.053 --> 00:06:44.687
I'm from Beira.

00:06:44.708 --> 00:06:47.049
I grew up there. I studied there.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.660
But it wasn't easy.

00:06:50.095 --> 00:06:55.094
No one paid for me. I couldn't
even buy the school uniform.

00:06:56.981 --> 00:06:59.122
I used teeny tiny pencils.

00:07:02.202 --> 00:07:04.250
There are lots of challenges.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.591
But the most important
thing is not to quit.

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:08.190
I never gave up.

00:07:09.093 --> 00:07:12.926
(singing in foreign language)

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.150
It's important to remind them

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.360
that there's another door for them.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.760
That they can be something.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.179
They can break that
circle and they can fly.

00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:24.843
(laughs) Yeah.

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:27.334
(in foreign language)

00:07:27.334 --> 00:07:30.334
(children clapping)

00:07:32.791 --> 00:07:35.850
(Dominique laughs)

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.200
It's important to do
something in my country

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.550
because otherwise who will?

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:44.837
(dramatic music)

00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:00.054
Do you see?

00:08:00.054 --> 00:08:02.554
They've just gone into the forest.

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:12.714
(gasps)

00:08:12.714 --> 00:08:14.203
We have ellies.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.673
Don't charge, be nice.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.620
That's a nice bull.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.293
Yeah, it's gonna go to the water.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:28.853
It's okay.

00:08:30.366 --> 00:08:32.653
Here they are. Hi.

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:38.740
Look at that one resting
the trunk on the others,

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.193
on the younger, you see that?

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.250
The biggest thing that connects me

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.183
with elephants is their empathy.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.623
They do anything to protect their family.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.860
They're capable to
forgive even when humans

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.923
have done so many bad things to them.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.240
The elephant population is recovering,

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.190
we're seeing an increase in the numbers

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.933
and I am seeing a lot of
new babies being born.

00:09:21.911 --> 00:09:24.563
Gorongosa is growing and is thriving.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.173
The park has a new vision and a new model.

00:09:34.375 --> 00:09:37.020
(Radio chatter)

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.620
Some of our initiatives
are already being taken

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.283
and adapted to other parks in Mozambique.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.293
So yes, Gorongosa can act as
a role model for other places.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.803
People need nature.

00:09:56.367 --> 00:09:59.337
And people must take care of nature.

00:10:01.778 --> 00:10:03.593
Gorongosa don't cry.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.883
We are going to plant what is needed here.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.550
We are taking care of you.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:19.730
People are now looking and
feeling connected again

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:23.095
with nature because of
Gorongosa, especially for girls.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.690
They want to be biologists.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.340
They want to be conservationists.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.657
Now we have women rangers
for our communities,

00:10:34.657 --> 00:10:36.077
from the buffer zone.

00:10:40.001 --> 00:10:43.668
It is a gate, you know,
for all these women.

00:10:49.517 --> 00:10:51.184
They're seeing this chance

00:10:52.022 --> 00:10:53.855
and they're taking it.

00:11:22.827 --> 00:11:25.410
(upbeat music)
