housing communication and the way energy
plays into this so you talk about

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:00.570
plays into this so you talk about
 

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.860
plays into this so you talk about
networks and collaboration and also this

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:03.870
networks and collaboration and also this
 

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.780
networks and collaboration and also this
idea of how you're delivering power to

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:05.790
idea of how you're delivering power to
 

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.220

gaps that need to be filled in terms of
 

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.720
gaps that need to be filled in terms of
making those connections where do we

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:14.730
making those connections where do we
 

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:19.580
making those connections where do we
where should we be focusing and this

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:19.590

and you ask why can't we do that but it
 

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.350
and you ask why can't we do that but it
is a learning curve so one of the big

is a learning curve so one of the big
 

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:14.580
is a learning curve so one of the big
gaps is getting to the place where your

China come to Puerto Rico it'll be
 

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:55.609
China come to Puerto Rico it'll be
cheaper it'll be a lot cheaper and you

cheaper it'll be a lot cheaper and you
 

00:50:55.619 --> 00:50:57.500
cheaper it'll be a lot cheaper and you
don't have to built the entire thing

00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:57.510
don't have to built the entire thing
 

00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:59.150
don't have to built the entire thing
there you can just finish the assembly

00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160
there you can just finish the assembly
 

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.430
there you can just finish the assembly
there and bring it into the United

there and bring it into the United
 

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.809
there and bring it into the United
States and it will be cheaper but but it

00:51:05.809 --> 00:51:05.819
States and it will be cheaper but but it

most people went without power for about

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:20.910
most people went without power for about
 

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:23.660
most people went without power for about
six months so they wanted the electrical

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:23.670
six months so they wanted the electrical
 

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:25.700
six months so they wanted the electrical
grid back up that's one thing and the

before which was weakened inefficient
now it'll be tough and inefficient and

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880
now it'll be tough and inefficient and
