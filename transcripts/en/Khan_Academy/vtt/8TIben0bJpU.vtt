00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.840
I'm going to start
with a fair coin,

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.850
and I'm going to
flip it four times.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.320
And the first question I want to
ask is, what is the probability

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.800
that I get exactly
one head, or heads?

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.960
This is one of those
confusing things, when you're

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.840
talking about what
side of the coin.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.592
I know I've been not
doing this consistently.

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:31.300
I'm tempted to say,
if you're saying one,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.883
it feels like you should do the
singular, which would be head.

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:36.177
But I've read up a little
bit of it on the internet,

00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:38.260
and it seems like when
you're talking about coins,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.980
you really should say one
heads, which is a little bit,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.672
it seems a little
bit difficult for me.

00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:43.880
But I'll try to go with that.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.770
So what is the probability
of getting exactly one heads?

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.270
And I put that in
quotes to say, you

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.990
know, really, we're just to
talking about one head there.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.370
But it's called heads when
you're dealing with coins.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.810
Anyway, I think you get
what I'm talking about.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.310
And to think about
this, let's think

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.120
about how many different
possible ways we can get four

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.730
flips of a coin.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.269
So we're going to have one
flip, then another flip, then

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.120
another flip, then another flip.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.460
And this first flip
has two possibilities.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.810
It could be heads or tails.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.790
The second flip has
two possibilities.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.230
It could be heads or tails.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.865
The third flip has
two possibilities.

00:01:15.865 --> 00:01:17.800
It could be heads or tails.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.860
And the fourth flip
has two possibilities.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.340
It could be heads or tails.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.250
So you have 2 times
2 times 2 times

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.730
2, which is equal
to 16 possibilities.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:37.060
16 possible outcomes when
you flip a coin four times.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.970
And any one of the possible
outcomes would be 1 of 16.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.617
So if I wanted to
say, so if I were to

00:01:42.617 --> 00:01:44.200
just say the
probability, and I'm just

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.824
going to not talk
about this one heads,

00:01:45.824 --> 00:01:48.225
if I just take a, just
maybe this thing that

00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:49.350
has three heads right here.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.000
This exact sequence of events.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.660
This is the first flip, second
flip, third flip, fourth flip.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.480
Getting exactly
this, this is exactly

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.080
one out of a possible
of 16 events.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.020
Now with that out of
the way, let's think

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.850
about how many possibilities,
how many of those 16

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.370
possibilities, involve
getting exactly one heads?

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.509
Well, we could list them.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.950
You could get your heads.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.000
So this is equal
to the probability

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.500
of getting the heads
in the first flip,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.460
plus the probability of getting
the heads in the second flip,

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.520
plus the probability of getting
the heads in the third flip.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.890
Remember, exactly one heads.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.870
We're not saying at least
one, exactly one heads.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.280
So the probability in
the third flip, and then,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.840
or the possibility that you
get heads in the fourth flip.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.694
Tails, heads, and tails.

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:45.360
And we know already
what the probability

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.120
of each of these things are.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.270
There are 16 possible
events, and each of these

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.710
are one of those
16 possible events.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:02.370
So this is going to be 1 over
16, 1 over 16, 1 over 16,

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.401
and 1 over 16.

00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:06.150
And so we're really
saying the probability

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.067
of getting exactly one
heads is the same thing

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:10.316
as the probability of getting
heads in the first flip,

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:12.010
or the probability
of getting heads--

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.010
or I should say the
probability of getting heads

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.140
in the first flip, or
heads in the second flip,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.692
or heads in the third flip,
or heads in the fourth flip.

00:03:18.692 --> 00:03:21.150
And we can add the probabilities
of these different things,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.150
because they are
mutually exclusive.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.600
Any two of these things cannot
happen at the same time.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.521
You have to pick one
of these scenarios.

00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:30.020
And so we can add
the probabilities.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.360
1/16 plus 1/16 plus
1/16 plus 1/16.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.500
Did I say that four times?

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.170
Well, assume that I did.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.810
And so you would get 4/16,
which is equal to 1/4.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.210
Fair enough.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.090
Now let's ask a slightly
more interesting question.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.960
Let's ask ourselves
the probability

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.855
of getting exactly two heads.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.900
And there's a couple of
ways we can think about it.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.540
One is just in the
traditional way.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.340
[? We ?] know the
number of possibilities

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.580
and of those equally
likely possibilities.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.260
And we can only use
this methodology

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.830
because it's a fair coin.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.100
So, how many of the
total possibilities

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.649
have two heads of the total of
equally likely possibilities?

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.420
So we know there are 16
equally likely possibilities.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.680
How many of those
have two heads?

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.610
So I've actually, ahead
of time so we save time,

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.320
I've drawn all of the 16
equally likely possibilities.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.610
And how many of these
involve two heads?

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.380
Well, let's see.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.220
This one over here has two
heads, this one over here

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.770
has two heads, this one
over here has two heads.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.530
Let's see, this one
over here has two heads,

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.000
and this one over
here has two heads.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.500
And then this one over
here has two heads,

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.490
and I believe we
are done after that.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.890
So if we count them, one,
two, three, four, five,

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.630
six of the possibilities
have exactly two heads.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.050
So six of the 16 equally likely
possibilities have two heads.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.300
So we have a-- what
is this-- a 3/8 chance

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.102
of getting exactly two heads.

00:05:13.102 --> 00:05:15.310
Now that's kind of what
we've been doing in the past,

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.059
but what I want to do
is think about a way

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:19.630
so we wouldn't have to write
out all the possibilities.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.550
And the reason why
that's useful is,

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.279
we're only dealing
with four flips now.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:24.820
But if we were
dealing with 10 flips,

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.210
there's no way that
we could write out

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.543
all the possibilities like this.

00:05:27.543 --> 00:05:29.935
So we really want a different
way of thinking about it.

00:05:29.935 --> 00:05:31.310
And the different
way of thinking

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.087
about it is, if we're
saying exactly two heads,

00:05:35.087 --> 00:05:36.920
you can imagine we're
having the four flips.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.630
Flip one, flip two,
flip three, flip four.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.660
So these are the flips,
or you could say,

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.400
the outcome of the flips.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.370
And if you're going to
have exactly two heads,

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.870
you could say, well,
look, I'm going

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.010
to have one head in
one of these positions,

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.430
and then one head in
the other position.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.360
So how many, if I'm
picking the first,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.960
so I have kind of a heads
one, and I have a heads two.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.240
And I don't want you to
think that these are somehow

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.940
the heads in the first flip or
the heads in the second flip.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.620
What I'm saying is
we need two heads.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.320
We need a total of two
heads in all of our flips.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.900
And I'm just giving one
of the heads a name,

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.810
and I'm giving the
other head a name.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.830
And what we're going to see in a
few seconds is that we actually

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.330
don't want to double
count, we don't

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.570
want to count the
situation, we don't

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.090
want to double count this
situation-- heads one,

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.050
heads two, tails, tails.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.330
And heads two, heads
one, tails, tails.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.800
For our purposes, these are
the exact same outcomes.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.490
So we don't want to
double count that.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.690
And we're going to have
to account for that.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.750
But if we just think
about it generally,

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.540
how many different spots,
how many different flips can

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.480
that first head show up in?

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.000
Well, there's four
different flips

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.140
that that first head
could show up in.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:57.650
So there's four possibilities,
four flips, or four places

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.700
that it could show up in.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.490
Well, if that first head takes
up one of these four places,

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.550
let's just say that first head
shows up on the third flip,

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.090
then how many different places
can that second head show up

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.120
in?

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.410
Well, if that first head is
in one of the four places,

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.790
then that second head can only
be in three different places.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.200
So that second
head can only be--

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.000
I'm picking a nice
color here-- can only

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.287
be in three different places.

00:07:24.287 --> 00:07:26.370
And so, you know, it could
be in any one of these.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.828
It could maybe be
right over there.

00:07:27.828 --> 00:07:29.750
Any one of those three places.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.350
And so, when you think about
it in terms of the first,

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.460
and I don't want to say
the first head, head one.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.876
Actually, let me
call it this way.

00:07:35.876 --> 00:07:38.682
Let me call it head A
and head B. That way

00:07:38.682 --> 00:07:40.890
you won't think that I'm
talking about the first flip

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.160
or the second flip.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.640
So this is head A, and this
right over there is head B.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.790
So if you had a particular,
I mean, these heads

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:50.760
are identical.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.610
These outcomes aren't
different, but the way

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.690
we talk about it
right now, it looks

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.160
like there's four places that
we could get this head in,

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.710
and there's three places where
we could get this head in.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.060
And so if you were to multiply
all of the different ways

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.740
that you could get, all
of the different scenarios

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.440
where this is in four
different places,

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.940
and then this is
in one of the three

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.500
left over places, you get
12 different scenarios.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.670
But there would only be
12 different scenarios

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.520
if you viewed this as
being different than this.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.400
And let me rewrite it with
our new-- So this is head A,

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.310
this is head B,
this is head B, this

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.289
is head A. There would only be
12 different scenarios if you

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:35.640
viewed these two things as
fundamentally different.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.559
But we don't.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.110
We're actually double counting.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.140
Because we can
always swap these two

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.799
heads and have the
exact same outcome.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.750
So what you want to do is
actually divide it by two.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.000
So you want to divide it by
all of the different ways

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.792
that you can swap
two different things.

00:08:50.792 --> 00:08:53.000
If we had three heads here,
you would think about all

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.370
of the different ways you could
swap three different things.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.953
If you had four heads here, it
would be all the different ways

00:08:57.953 --> 00:08:59.720
you could swap four
different things.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.890
So there's 12
different scenarios

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.740
if you couldn't
swap them, but you

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.760
want to divide it by all
of the different ways

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.110
that you can swap two things.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.810
So 12 divided by
2 is equal to 6.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:15.420
Six different scenarios,
fundamentally different

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.650
scenarios, considering
that you can swap them.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.310
If you assume that head A and
head B can be interchangeable.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.180
But it's a completely
identical outcome for us,

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.390
because they're
really just heads.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.280
So there's six
different scenarios,

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:37.000
and we know that there's a total
of 16 equally likely scenarios.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.670
So we could say that the
probability of getting exactly

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:43.520
two heads is 6
times, six scenarios

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.300
and-- Or there's
a couple of ways.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.050
You could say there
are six scenarios that

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.920
give us two heads,
of a possible 16.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.670
Or you could say there are
six possible scenarios,

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.790
and the probability of each
of those scenarios is 1/16.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.680
But either way, you'll
get the same answer.
