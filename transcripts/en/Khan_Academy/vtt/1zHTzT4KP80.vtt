00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.800
We're on problem number 10.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:15.830
Problem 10-- if 2x minus 2,
times 2 minus x, is equal to

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.200
0, what are all possible
values of x?

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.140
If I multiply two numbers,
right, I multiply two

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.780
expressions equal to 0, that
means one or both of these

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.090
expressions are going
to be equal to 0.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.960
And if you've solved for roots
of a quadratic using

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.150
factoring, you'll be familiar
with this notion.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:41.100
So either 2x minus 2 is 0, and
or, actually, either of these

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.670
could be equal to 0,
or both of them

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.340
could be equal to zero.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.280
Let's just solve this.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.100
So add 2 to both sides, 2x is
equal to 2, x is equal to 1.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.475
And here, if we just add x to
both sides, we get 2 is equal

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:58.520
to x, or x is equal to 2.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.500
So x could be 1, or
x could be 2.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.910
So choice D, 1 and 2 only.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.580
And you could try
them out, right?

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.170
If x is 1, this becomes 0 times
1, which is of course 0.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.790
If x is 2, this becomes
2, right?

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.560
2 times 2 minus 2 is 2.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.050
Times 0, which is 0.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.820
And 0 doesn't work.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.800
That might have been your
temptation, but if you put 0

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.240
in here, you get minus 2--
because this term will go

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.720
away-- you get minus 2 times 2,
which is minus 4, so that

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.030
doesn't work.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.090
You just have to set each of
these expressions to 0.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:42.450
Next question, problem 11.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.540
If x to the third is equal to
y to the ninth, what is x in

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.010
terms of y?

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.470
So what we can do here is we
just want to get rid of this

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.770
cubed power.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.660
So how do we get rid
of the cubed power?

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.052
Well, we could take the cube
root of both sides.

00:02:01.052 --> 00:02:03.396
If that doesn't make sense to
you, I'll show you how.

00:02:03.396 --> 00:02:07.050
x to the third-- let me give
this some breathing room-- is

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.990
equal to y to the ninth.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.400
I'm just writing the same thing
a little bit bigger.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.000
What we do to one side of the
equation, we can do to the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.850
other side of the equation.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.220
If I want this exponent to be
1, I just have to take it to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.800
the 1/3 power.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.650
How do I know that?

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.100
Well, if I take something to an
exponent, and then take it

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.300
to another exponent, I
essentially just multiply the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.220
two exponents, right?

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.810
That's an exponent rule.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.380
And you can review that in
the exponent videos.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.540
If you multiply 3 and 1/3, you
get 1, so that's why I'm

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.550
raising to the 1/3 power.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.840
And that, of course, is
the same thing as

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.830
taking the cube root.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.200
Excuse me, I just had some
chicken, I need to drink some

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.740
water or something.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.780
But of course, if I do something
to one side of the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.230
equation, I have to do
it to both sides of

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.290
this equation, right?

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.330
If I take the cube root of one
side, for the equation to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
hold, I have to take the cube
root of the other side.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.820
So x to the third to the 1/3,
well that's just x to the

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.020
first, or just x, right?

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.180
Because 3 times 1/3 is 1, so
x to the first is just x.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.710
And that equals what?

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.590
y to the 9 times 1/3.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.520
Well what's 9 times-- 9 times
1/3 is equal to 9 divided by

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.130
3, which is equal to 3.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.830
So x is equal to y to
the third power.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.730
That's just this 3.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.680
And that is choice C.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.040
Next problem.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.180
I will switch colors
for variety.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.480
And there's something
that I have to draw.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.120
OK.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.450
So they drew-- let's see if
I can pull this one off.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.580
Let's see if I can pull drawing
this figure off.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.960
So it looks like a
line like that.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.140
And a line like that.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.430
And a line like that.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.410
And then it has almost
a mirror image

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.270
of a line like that.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.520
Line like that.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.920
Close enough.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.870
And they're asking us, in the
x-y coordinate system above,

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.080
which of the following line
segments has a slope of

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.780
negative 1?

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.682
So what is a slope
of negative 1?

00:04:26.682 --> 00:04:32.720
A slope of negative 1 means that
as we move to the right

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.610
1, we move down 1.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.760
That's a slope of negative 1.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.190
And if you're familiar with
slopes a lot, just intuitively

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.740
you know that it looks
something like this.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.595
Slope of negative 1 looks
something like that.

00:04:49.595 --> 00:04:52.420
And if we look at the lines
that they drew, all the

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.690
choices, the ones that are
moving up are definitely not

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.550
our answer, right?

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.230
This one is moving up, so this
one can't be the answer.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.720
This one is moving up, so this
can't be the answer.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.460
This one's moving up, so this
one can't be the answer.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.630
So all of these lines-- the
yellow ones that I haven't

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.590
scratched out-- all of these
have negative slopes.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.730
And we just have to figure out
which one could be negative 1.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:20.530
If we look at this slope here
between point O and point A,

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.330
they mark off that this is
1, 2, 3, and this is 1.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.950
So for this line, we
went over 1, right?

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.630
We moved over 1, but
we went down 3.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.920
So this line has a slope
of negative 3.

00:05:38.435 --> 00:05:44.320
And similarly, they draw-- this
goes out 1, 2, 3-- this

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.310
line, we have to go 3 for it to
go-- we have to move in the

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.200
x-direction positive 3 for
it to move down 1.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.970
So this has a slope of 1/3.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.060
And you can kind of tell that
it goes down very gradually.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.320
Right?

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.840
Actually negative 1/3, sorry.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.520
The rise is negative 1,
and the run is 3.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.640
Run is just how far you move
in the x-direction, right?

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.240
The rise is negative 1,
which is right there,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.920
and the run is 3.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.970
So we know that this
isn't the answer.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.780
So just by deductive reasoning,
we know that this

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.640
is probably going to
be our answer.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.720
And it also looks like it
has a slope negative 1.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:32.700
And if you were to actually look
at it, points D and C,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:39.655
this is about-- if I
just look at it by

00:06:39.655 --> 00:06:41.620
inspection-- 1 comma 3.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.830
And this looks like the point
3 comma 1, right here.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.500
So what is the change in
y over the change in x?

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.670
Well, the change in y is 3 minus
1, so that equals 2.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.700
And the change in x is 1 minus
3, which is minus 2.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.760
Which is minus 1.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.490
Remember, when you calculate
slope, you always have to use

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.430
the first-- if I use 3 the first
time of the numerator, I

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.720
have to use 1 the first
time in the denomator.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.665
So 3, minus 1, over 1, minus
3, is the slope,

00:07:13.665 --> 00:07:15.030
and it's minus 1.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.910
But if you're really good, you
should just be able to look at

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.440
it and say, well that's the
closest thing to negative 1,

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.290
because it's not too steep
and not to shallow.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.540
Next problem.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.290
Oh, and so that is choice
D, C, E-- choice E.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.820
Problem 13.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.010
Kyle's lock combination
consists of

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.430
three two digit numbers.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:47.530
The combination satisfies the
three conditions below.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:08:03.620
One number is odd, one number
is a multiple of 5, and then

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.590
one month is the day of the
month of Kyle's birthday.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.950
So what do we know about
that number?

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.030
Well, it's a two digit number,
so it has to be

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.940
between 01 and 31, right?

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.240
In order for it to be a
birthday, it can't be-- OK.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.810
If each number satisfies exactly
one of the conditions,

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.360
which of the following
could be the

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.280
combination to the lock?

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.809
So one number can't satisfy two
of these conditions, and

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:34.470
then you have another number
that satisfies none.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.470
Each of them has to
do one of them.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.720
So let's look at the choices.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:50.720
Choice A is 14, 20, 13.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.540
Let's see, which one could
satisfy the odd?

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.270
Well this number is odd.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:58.830
So let me see, if this condition
is satisfied by this

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.410
number, it's odd.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.985
What number is a
multiple of 5?

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.830
So this condition-- well that's

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.950
satisfied by this number.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.670
And what number is a
day of the month?

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.980
Well, this looks pretty
straightforward.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.260
One number is a day
of the month.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.450
Well, 14 could be a
day of a month.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.000
And in general, in any SAT
problem, and I'm seeing this

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.790
pattern more and more as I go
through all of these practice

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.310
tests, is when they have a
problem where they want you to

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.550
go through every choice, the
answers tend to be one of the

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.750
first few choices, because they
don't want you to waste a

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.890
lot of time.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.250
So you should feel pretty
comfortable if you did this

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.790
and you got choice A.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.680
And if you want to see an
example of what won't work,

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.220
I'm guessing B won't work.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:10:00.070
Choice B says 14, 25, 13.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.100
Actually, that doesn't look
like it could satisfy.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:06.380
If each number satisfies exactly
one of the conditions,

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.300
which of the following
could be the

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.550
combination to the lock?

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.780
Oh, exactly.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.570
So why can't this one be?

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.600
Because this condition that one
number is odd, it can only
