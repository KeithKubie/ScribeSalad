00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.300
Captain Kidd was a Scottish sailor famous
for the legend of his buried treasure.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.160
People have searched for his treasure in places
ranging from Long Island and Nova Scotia to

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.440
Vietnam and the Japanese island of Takarajima
which literally translates to "Treasure Island".

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.490
But despite being recognized as the only known
pirate to have buried treasure some believe

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.619
he wasn't even a pirate at all was falsely
accused of piracy - so the idea of pirates

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.879
burying treasure might have almost no basis
in reality.

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.440
What The Fak?

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.489
The Facts And Knowledge On Real Historic Pirates.

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.399
Edward Teach was known for his intimidating
stature and long black beard which earned

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.359
him the nickname Blackbeard.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.969
He'd intimidate enemies by tying lit fuses
under his hat and to his beard but in reality

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.140
he was much less violent than many other pirates.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.430
After taking a royal pardon to stop pirating
it turned out he was still doing it.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.270
So after his capture in 1718 he reportedly
had one of the most drawn out and epic deaths

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.270
ever.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.190
It's said he was shot five times and received
twenty sword cuts before a fatal blow to the

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.330
neck finally felled the infamous Blackbeard.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.170
Then his head was cut off and hung from the
ship to collect the reward for his death.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.170
It's thought that pirates may have worn eye
patches to keep one eye adjusted to the dark

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.080
for moving from the light above deck to the
darkness below deck.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.890
Captain Benjamin Hornigold was at one time
Blackbeard's boss.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.230
He commanded a ship called Ranger that was
the most heavily armed ship in his region.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.930
He wasn't the most ruthless of pirates and
once took over a ship just to steal hats.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.670
Apparently his men had gotten drunk the previous
night and thrown their hats overboard and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.080
they needed some new ones.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.740
Hornigold lost his captainship when he refused
to attack English or Dutch vessels.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.820
He then became a pirate hunter in 1718 for
Governor Woodes Rogers which he died doing

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.530
in a shipwreck during a Hurricane.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.860
And he appears in Assassin's Creed IV: Black
Flag

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.969
The word "pirate" (English and French) is
from the Latin and Spanish pirata, originally

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:14.709
the Greek peirates (one who attacks) and peiran
(to attempt or try).

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:21.769
Bartholomew Roberts aka Black Bart captured
470 vessels making him the most successful

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.930
pirate during the Golden age of piracy.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.790
He did not intend on being a pirate but when
the slaveship Princess he worked on was taken

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.659
by pirates he was forced to join and his ability
to navigate made him invaluable to the captain.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.629
When he was given the command of his first
ship he said "that since he had dipped his

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.409
hands in muddy water, and must be a pirate,
it was better to command a ship than be a

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.409
common man".

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.300
He was buried at sea by his crew as a final
wish and was never found.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.749
The association of pirates with hook hands
and peglegs may have arisen from so many crew

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:59.010
members losing limbs during battle and while
on the ship but many that needed amputations

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.040
didn't survive the surgery.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.400
Hooks and peglegs were popularized by fictional
works such as Treasure Island and Peter Pan.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.859
Francois L'Olonnais was one of the most feared
and vicious pirates of his time with acts

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:17.950
like reportedly ripping out a captives heart
and gnawing on it to intimidate his enemies.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.900
In 1667, his ship was destroyed and the majority
of his crew were massacred by the Spanish.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.780
L'olannais covered himself in blood and sand
and played dead until they left, then disguised

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.700
himself as a Spaniard, made his way to the
city where they were celebrating his death

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.629
and convinced slaves to help him escape where
he got new ship and men and resumed pirating.

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.930
L'Olonnais was eventually captured and an
account from one man said he was hacked to

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.829
pieces, cooked over a fire, and eaten because
the Spanish despised him so much.

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.749
Calico Jack, real name John Rackham, earned
his nickname from the calico clothes he wore.

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:01.029
He had two female crew members Mary Read and
Anne Bonny.

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:05.799
Jack had an affair with Anne Bonny who was
to be whipped for adultery but together they

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.919
stole a ship and escaped.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:14.040
Mary Read cross-dressed as a man, joined Jack's
crew, was almost killed by Jack for showing

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.160
too much interest in Anne Bonny until Read
revealed she was actually a woman.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.840
Jack was captured and hanged in 1720 with
his dead body gibbeted on display to deter

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.840
other criminals.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.020
And he was responsible for the classic skull
with crossed swords Jolly Roger.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:48.760
And here are so more famous Jolly Rogers...

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.340
Henry Every was known as The King Of Pirates.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.840
He's thought to have had the most profitable
haul in pirate history when he led a small

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.180
pirate squadron to overtake the Ganj-i-sawai
- the flagship of a 25 ship convoy of Grand

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.620
Mughal vessels containing Â£600,000 in metals
and jewels.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.240
And amazingly he's one of the few famous pirates
thought of have escaped alive with his treasure

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.470
- one story saying he disappeared to Madagascar
with all of his loot and lived like a king.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.670
The other story is that he died penniless
after squandering all his money.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.710
The well-known pirate voice is an impersonation
of West Country English and Robert Newton

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.000
who was born in England not far from the birthplaces
of many famous pirates played both Long John

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.530
Silver and Blackbeard in early Disney movies.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.880
Henry Morgan, the man whom Captain Morgan
rum is named after was actually privateer

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.110
and not a pirate.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.210
A privateer is basically a legal pirate.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.100
Morgan was allowed to attack enemy ships and
ports in exchange for sharing the loot with

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.780
the crown and he was even knighted by King
Charles II.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.220
Although known as one of the greatest pirates
ever Morgan would've been offended to be called

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.220
one.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.441
Parrots and monkeys were considered trophies
of the exotic places pirates visited and were

00:06:07.441 --> 00:06:10.550
often sold for high prices back in Europe.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.530
Madame Cheng was the most famous female pirate
of all time.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:20.970
She commanded over 300 Junks or chinese sailing
vessels with a crew of over 20k men women

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:21.970
and children.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.390
She started out as a prostitute that was captured
by pirates, married one of them and took over

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.390
his fleet.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.680
She created a code that went like this.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.270
Disobeying her or any superior meant immediate
beheading

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.550
No one could steal from the public fund or
anyone that supplied the pirates

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:44.340
All booty was presented for group inspection
- the finder kept 20% and the rest went into

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.000
the public fund
Actual money was given to the squadron leader

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.060
to help unsuccessful ships
And pirates could choose to marry female captives

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.940
with the ugliest, unchosen ones then being
released.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.840
She was never defeated and eventually retired,
opened a gambling house, and died at the age

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.840
of 69.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.280
I'm gonna leave you with this pirate.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.350
Who was he and what was his nickname?

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.180
Before we go here's last video's winner.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:20.090
And as always, thanks ye for watchin'.
