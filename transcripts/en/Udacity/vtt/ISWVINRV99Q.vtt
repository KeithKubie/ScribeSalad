00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.333
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So finally, how can we factor x squared minus 8x plus 15? Think about the

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:08.673
values that you just got for a and b, and how they fit in the form of binomials

00:00:08.673 --> 00:00:13.616
that are multiplied together to give quadratic expressions. This is a little bit

00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:16.805
tricky. So just give it a couple tries if you need to.
