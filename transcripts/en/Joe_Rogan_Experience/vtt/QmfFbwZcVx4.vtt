1
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.090
Oh,
hey fella,
what do you got there?

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.570
What does that legal marijuana and your hands do you want a closer look?

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.810
You activist you,
I'm such a radical man.

4
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.830
The streets are not safe when I'm out on the loose radical seem like a regular

5
00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:22.670
guy.
Regular guy with the irregular amount of stress.

6
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.760
The walrus right there,
dude.
You don't mind mind putting it there?
No,
no,

7
00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:28.820
not at happy to come back and see it.
No,
it stays on the desk.
Yeah.

8
00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:33.110
That thinks this means as much to us as anybody except for you.

9
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.340
Well,
it's nice to see it.
This is my,
uh,
this is my happy place.

10
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:41.840
This is my safe place.
I got to travel across the country to be safe.
But uh,
it's,

11
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.020
it's certainly a pleasure to be here.
Getting a joy.
Always have to.
Thank you.

12
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.350
All right.
Listen brother,
I think you too.
I was texting Whitney today.
I said,

13
00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:53.090
you're a hero.
You're a legitimate hero for people.

14
00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:57.390
Don't know what this is all about.
I'll give everybody in the back story.
Um,

15
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.570
Phil used to work at marine land.

16
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:04.571
He was an orchid trainer and he also trained a walrus named smooshy and smooshy

17
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:09.530
is still allegedly in captivity at marine land.
All those,

18
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:13.640
no photographic evidence,
but you're pretty sure she's still there.

19
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.750
I was told that she is still there and she's in good shape.

20
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.740
And I'm hanging onto that.
Since you came on the podcast the first time,

21
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:25.790
which was how many years ago?
No,
so six years ago,
I think.
2013.

22
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:30.791
So He's been living this lawsuit life for six years,

23
00:01:32.781 --> 00:01:37.520
trapped in a lawsuit with a gigantic corporation with incredible amounts of

24
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:42.260
money that's been trying to crush them.
And um,
they've made up stuff.
Well,

25
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:45.080
tell me what's,
what's happened you give,
give me your,

26
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:48.680
your perspective on how it all went down.
Back in 2012,
I made,

27
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.350
I was forced to make a very difficult decision.

28
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.340
I elected to speak out against the conditions of which,
uh,

29
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.490
marine lands animals were living in.
Um,

30
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.280
I did so knowing the risks,
knowing that marine land was allotted Tejas company,

31
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.570
but I did so on account of the fact that the animals were suffering incredibly

32
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.213
<v 0>okay.</v>

33
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.840
<v 1>Uh,
before quitting,
I had an agreement with marine land that,
look,
I'm leaving.</v>

34
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.600
This is long before I'd spoke up,
I'd spoken out,
I'm leaving.
But you know,

35
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.940
we have to establish that I can maintain this relationship with the walrus

36
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.010
because I imprinted on her.
It's important to stress that,

37
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.580
that she thinks I'm her mom.
She was a baby,
she was a baby when she came in,

38
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.440
so she was wild caught and you can imagine,

39
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.740
probably witnessed her mother gets slaughtered.
That's the,
uh,

40
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.780
that's the method of collecting babies,
um,
by the,
by the captors in Russia.

41
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.990
And,
uh,
so she comes in traumatic at the age of,

42
00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:46.920
we estimate about 18 months of age,
which is pretty old.
In fact,
uh,
for,
uh,

43
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.870
in our experience I'm marine lines experience of,

44
00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:52.400
of acquiring these wild caught baby walruses.
Um,

45
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.660
and through a sort of traumatic experience with her that I was there with her.

46
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.220
This anomalous thing happened where her brain circuitry

47
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.000
<v 2>opened up and much like in the wild,
where in the case of hurt animals,</v>

48
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.620
the babies,
uh,
become familiar with the mother's sound scent.
Look everything,

49
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.440
all the senses are acute there.
They're aware of who they have,
where they are,

50
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.830
so that they can find each other amidst these thousands of animals.
Well,

51
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:19.060
this happened to her,
so the brain circuitry opens.
Suddenly I'm imprinted on her.

52
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.670
I wasn't prepared to leave marine land unless it was of the understanding that I

53
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:29.200
can continue to help her because historically my relationship with her,

54
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.560
uh,
you know,
had everything to do with her health and wellbeing.

55
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.530
I quit with the understanding with marine land.
This was to be the case.

56
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.480
I'd been gone for a month.
I come back on announced they don't want to let me in.

57
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.680
They're hiding something.
I get in,
I see her.

58
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.680
She's in terrible shape.

59
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.860
I snap a few photos.

60
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:58.300
I leave now amidst this terrible shape.
What do you mean?

61
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.590
She was amazing?
She was bone dry.
She hadn't eaten in my,

62
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:05.740
having been gone a month was the longest she and I've ever actually been

63
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.603
physically apart.

64
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.110
I'd been trying to wean my presence off of her so that other trainers could be

65
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:15.380
able to maintain a healthy,
you know,
healthy diet for healthy lifestyles.

66
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.060
She was amazing because she wasn't eating because there's trust.

67
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.370
I wasn't there for that month,
I can't say,
but she was certainly not eating.

68
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.580
She was super skinny.
Um,
they had her,

69
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.910
of course on a bunch of drugs which include psychotics,
Valium,
antidepressants.

70
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.740
Um,
I,
when I saw her,
my jaw hit the floor.

71
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.810
It's important to note that during this,
um,
some newspapers had been calling.

72
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:40.240
They wanted to know why I quit.
If we back up a little bit,

73
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.420
it should be noted that in 2007,
my relationship with Smu,

74
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:47.680
she sort of took off in the early sort of Internet viral days and whatnot.
Um,

75
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:51.880
we made front page of like CNN and uh,
Jimmy Kimmel did a piece and uh,

76
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.700
so there was sort of that backstory of the,

77
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.420
I guess you would call it a fluff celebrity type thing,
but nonetheless,
might,

78
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.430
having left started,
people started asking questions.

79
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:03.730
I started fielding calls from this newspaper who was looking,

80
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:05.740
it was keen on doing an investigation of marine land.

81
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.970
So I wasn't going to participate.
I had no interest.
Again,

82
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.060
stressing the marine lines,
La Tejas history.
And also look,

83
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:16.420
I've got this relationship with a walrus that I sort of have to maintain.

84
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:20.110
I have to re,
I have to keep this relationship with marine land healthy enough.

85
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:24.100
So once I'd realized they weren't holding on to that end of the bargain,

86
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.110
you know,
the panic sets in,
I'm a first time mom,
it should be stressed.

87
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.240
Uh,
so I,
I basically call the newspapers and I said,

88
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.220
you put my face,
my name on it doesn't matter.
You just print it.
Let's go,

89
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.080
let's,
let's get the story out.
Story gets out.
Well,

90
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.270
marine le as expected starts their lawsuits.
It's like a,

91
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:52.750
it's almost like a scorched earth.
They take a scorched earth,
uh,

92
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.780
sort of a method.
And this was when the original owner was alive.
Yes,
yes.

93
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.310
No longer alive.
He died

94
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.000
<v 3>during this last year in,
uh,
in June.
In fact,
so,
uh,</v>

95
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:06.170
years into this litigation.
So I'm okay.

96
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.760
<v 2>They sued me.
They sued me for 1,000,005.
They sued my girlfriend.</v>

97
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:14.510
They sued other activists.
They sued newspapers.
They,
they're suing everybody.

98
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.770
The mistake they made is in all of their absurd allegations that they've yet six

99
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:27.110
and a half years into into litigation yet to prove any of it.
They cannot.

100
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.010
It's never going to happen.
It doesn't exist.
It's a fictitious lawsuit.

101
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:33.650
It's full of lies and bullshit.
Bottom line.

102
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.160
The mistake they made is they sued me for plotting to steal smooshy.

103
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.410
That's where the headlines take off and Oh,

104
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.300
they also called me the Kanye west of animal training.
Yeah,
I remember we went,

105
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:47.460
that's how I got your attention on the Internet and this is what I know.

106
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.040
That's not how you got my attention.
I still tweet.
I say,
yeah,

107
00:06:50.041 --> 00:06:54.120
but the Kanye west part didn't get my,
well,
no.
You said they called you.

108
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.130
The tweet was,
I said,
Joe,
you just say when I'll book a flight to come to la.

109
00:06:58.131 --> 00:06:59.780
I sent you the link to the,
to the story.

110
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:03.230
The headline was Kanye west of animal training being sued for plotting to steal

111
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:04.190
of Waller's.
You wrote,

112
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:07.850
they called you though what and then you slid into the DMZ and said,
dude,

113
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:10.670
if you're ever in La,
I said,
you just say when?
Well,
I started reading

114
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.840
<v 3>the story when I started.
I have,
you know,
I wrote a um,</v>

115
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.900
a piece of long time ago on my blog and I'm um,

116
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.270
I talked about it in one of my comedy specials that I had a crazy experience

117
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:29.810
with dolphins once,
um,
when I was really,

118
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:32.090
really high and I had this,
um,

119
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.390
I mean it sounds silly to even talk about,

120
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:40.100
but I almost feel like I kind of understood that they are like us,

121
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.140
but they just don't alter their environment.

122
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.990
What I realized like when they were playing with us,

123
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.780
when they were jumping by the boat and they were looking at you,

124
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.230
they're looking at you while they were jumping around with the boat and I was

125
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:55.520
like,
they're playing and they're looking at you like a person would like a water

126
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:56.510
person interacting.

127
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.890
<v 2>There's almost a language at this point.</v>

128
00:07:57.891 --> 00:08:01.010
There's some level of bridged gap in the communication.

129
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:04.820
When you get to see that they're expressing themselves in interest in you and

130
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:06.160
whatnot and scoping you.

131
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.530
And when you get really close and establish a relationship with these animals,

132
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:11.990
that's when things start getting real squirrely because you start to find that

133
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.250
happy medium language.

134
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.670
<v 3>All of a sudden you are starting to sort of speak,
so to say.
Yeah,</v>

135
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.390
well I started getting really weird,
um,

136
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.480
feelings about seaworld and an animal captivity like this.

137
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.160
Why do we need that in this day and age?
Like this isn't the dark ages.

138
00:08:33.161 --> 00:08:38.161
We shouldn't be putting whales and orcas and dolphins putting them in these

139
00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:42.850
tanks,
these fucking water swimming pools.
They're fucking swimming pools.

140
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.770
And you have these things that are probably as smart as us and some different

141
00:08:47.771 --> 00:08:47.921
way,

142
00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:52.720
like we're so prejudiced in that we only think of intelligence as something that

143
00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:56.010
can manipulate its environment.
That's our problem.
Like

144
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.250
<v 1>we like,
look at them.
They're a bitch ass world.
They don't have any houses.</v>

145
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:02.400
They can't write a letter.
They,
they're fucking stupid man.
Stop it.

146
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:06.810
They're stupid.
But dolphins apparently have a cerebral cortex.

147
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:09.870
It's something around 40% larger than a human beings.

148
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.670
They have super complex languages.

149
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:16.671
Their emotional intelligence is the mystery and it appears that it's far beyond

150
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:20.950
anything.
We ourselves can understand that same as orcas.
They've got that,
uh,

151
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.120
they've got another part of the brain in the front,

152
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.570
which is its function in that the front of the cerebral Cortex,

153
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.710
that function is to,
um,
as for communication and for,
and for,

154
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:36.270
it enhances their emotional capacity to a point where we don't really know the

155
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:39.060
depth of which they are,
the power of their emotion.

156
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:42.540
But we know that they stay with their families for their lifetimes.

157
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:45.320
The males born,
uh,
from,
from the mothers will,

158
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.580
will rarely leave the mother's side.

159
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.580
Quite literally the distance of an Orca itself.

160
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:53.760
They only time that mail will go on is when it's matured and it will go to

161
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.960
procreate and then back to the mother.
And it will live its entire life as such.

162
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.700
And the sad fact about that is in my experience,
uh,

163
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.580
working with male Orkos caught from the,
one of which caught from the wild,

164
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:09.930
a big bull Orca is,
he's a mama's boy.
You can see something was missing.

165
00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:11.910
He was traumatized from something.
And of course,

166
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.160
even myself as a regarded whale expert in the capacity of working at a fricking

167
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:19.470
place like marine land,
even,

168
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.310
I would have never known this information when I started this.

169
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:26.310
This is not information that was available to us back in.
I started in 2000.

170
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.180
It makes sense now.
This animal's traumatized from birth.

171
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.400
His will to live is just gone.

172
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.450
It's at and the male,

173
00:10:36.451 --> 00:10:41.130
it appears to me and in my experience,
the male sex of,

174
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.420
uh,
well I've worked with seals,
I've worked with sea lions,

175
00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:49.650
I've worked with a wall versus a Dolphin's,
Belugas and orcas.

176
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.900
All of them die younger.

177
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.990
The males die younger and I think,

178
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.830
well definitely in the orchids and the dolphins cases is they just don't have

179
00:10:58.831 --> 00:11:02.820
that will to live without that strong maternal figure in their life.

180
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.360
This is what I tried to explain to people that don't see it and they think that

181
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:10.520
the,
the dolphins get treated well or the orchids get treated well.
This is what,

182
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:15.650
imagine if someone stole your son and put him in an air box at the bottom of the

183
00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:22.530
ocean and dolphins and whales and fish just came by and stared at them.

184
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:23.880
Imagine.

185
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.530
And he lives his life like that with no contact other than with his,

186
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.070
his dolphin handlers or whoever's taking care of him.

187
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.600
And he just lives in this box,
missing his family,
missing his loved ones,

188
00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:39.390
missing his life,
confused,
lost,
and with,

189
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:44.190
with a language that is,
especially with orcas and dolphins,

190
00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:47.730
they have a language.
It's so complex.
We haven't been able to really decipher it.

191
00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:52.050
We don't understand how it works.
You know,
John Lilly spent,

192
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.010
they spent I

193
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.990
<v 3>think,
decades working on trying to get dolphins to speak human noises.</v>

194
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.490
He had a bunch of studies that he did and um,
he even had an I sore.

195
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.470
It's a crazy story.

196
00:12:05.471 --> 00:12:09.330
I'm sure you've heard of the woman who lived with the Dolphin.
She,

197
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.310
she'd try to establish a relationship with the dolphin where she,

198
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:14.890
they made an apartment that was half under water,

199
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.690
but the dolphin always wanted to fuck,

200
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.080
so she just jerked the dolphin off and when she jerked the dolphin off,

201
00:12:20.081 --> 00:12:22.690
that was the only thing that calmed him down and then she could do her work.

202
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.890
So for her it was just like a technicality.
I just got a jerk.
This dolphin off,

203
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.510
it's a in the animal,

204
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:33.340
they wants to be rubbed all the moral stuff that's attached to that as all in my

205
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:36.410
own head.
She's like,
I'm just going to be a scientist.
And they were like,

206
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.830
get that fuck.
What?

207
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.270
Think they were also injecting ketamine into the dolphins or something as well.

208
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.290
Do not know if they were doing that in two dolphins,

209
00:12:44.291 --> 00:12:49.291
but I do know that they did some experiments with Lsd and that John Lilly,

210
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.470
who was one of my personal heroes,
he's the creator of the flotation tank.

211
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.310
This is all John Lilly's stuff.
He was a pioneer in interspecies communication.

212
00:12:57.311 --> 00:13:00.970
He would take acid and think that he was communicating with dolphins.

213
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.360
Did you know you're on the cover of one of his books?
What?
Yes,

214
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.640
we are talking about your face.
It,
I mean it's,

215
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.850
it's a spitting image on,

216
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.870
in one of his books to Lily's books.
Do this.
Happy to look this up.

217
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.470
Maybe the superior single time travel are shit.

218
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.250
They are you man.
I'm sorry I was,

219
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.660
that's fucking tired man.
That's fucking weird.

220
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:30.160
Yeah.
Wow.
So that's a pro.
I can't read that.
What does it say something?

221
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.090
The human bio computer bio.
Yeah.
I didn't read that one.

222
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.860
I read the deep self though.
The diff self's really interesting.
Um,

223
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:42.340
and the deep self.
I think the deep self is the one that also has,
um,

224
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.000
diagrams on how to build a tank.
He was trying to get people to build tanks.

225
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.680
He was like,
listen man,
I found some shit out.
You got to try this.

226
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.970
The last time I was here,
uh,
not the last time.
Two Times ago.
You actually,
uh,

227
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.710
sent me to crash.
Yeah.
Man.
Crash and have to crash the float lab.
Yeah.

228
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:01.630
And He,
uh,
you know,
I thought I'd be in there for an hour.

229
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:04.090
It turns out I was in there for a couple and when I came and I'm like,
dude,

230
00:14:04.091 --> 00:14:06.580
I was waiting for the knock.
He's just like,
oh no man,

231
00:14:06.581 --> 00:14:08.260
it's just letting you stay in there.
I'm like,
Oh shit,

232
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:12.300
I'm looking at the time crashes.
A lick of legit hippie.
The Oh yeah.
Oh yeah,

233
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.970
he's great.
He's great.
He's the mad scientist behind float lab.
Yeah.

234
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:20.530
That's why those things are so well engineered.
When I met him I was like,
what?

235
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.790
I was like,
cause I tanks before that,
when I,
I,

236
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:28.320
I first got a tank in like 2002,
somewhere around there,

237
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.790
2000,
two,
2003.
And um,
it was uh,
it was great,

238
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.780
but it was like,
it would break,
things would go wrong.
It flooded my basement.

239
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:43.120
It was like there was disasters.
It wasn't.
And then,
um,
my friend who was a,

240
00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:46.630
a tank technician,
there's actually tank technicians.
He said,
listen,

241
00:14:46.631 --> 00:14:48.250
you got to go check out this guy in Venice.

242
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.070
So some mad scientists down there in Venice was just making these over
engineered

243
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.720
<v 1>float tanks.
And he goes,
they look like walk him meat lockers.
Right.
I was like,</v>

244
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.780
why is she showed Rod,
you had like a pod installed it.

245
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.230
It was a very good tank.
It's just,
uh,
it just,

246
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:07.430
it wasn't as well constructed.
Also wasn't nearly as expensive.

247
00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.570
It's just he went the distance,
he went the distance and he still keeps,

248
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.340
keeps coming over here.
I've got to change things.
I got it.
We're upgrading,

249
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:13.830
we're doing that.

250
00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.670
It's like he's always gone to him and trying to enhance the experience for

251
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:19.130
everyone.
I mean,
yeah,
he's always trying to make it better.

252
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:20.660
He's the front of the line.

253
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.410
And when I first started working with him,

254
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:29.090
like when I first started having him on the podcast and I hired him to build me

255
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:32.570
a tank and all that channels,
like there was no tanks.
There was,

256
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.560
it was real rare that you'd find tank centers now.
They're fucking everywhere,

257
00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:38.510
man.
Everywhere.
I'll say this,

258
00:15:38.511 --> 00:15:42.290
the experience I had in his tank versus the one that I,
there's a local place,
uh,

259
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.750
from where,
uh,
where I'm from,
uh,

260
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.900
was hands down at different experience because he really isolates you there.

261
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:50.780
Whereas these,
this was like a pod that they bought and installed in her room.

262
00:15:50.781 --> 00:15:51.351
I mean it was great.

263
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:55.490
Please is super insulated so there's no fucking noise getting in that thing.

264
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.500
And he gave me the tour of the whole backstage to her.

265
00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.420
I was all back to checking shit out.
I was like,
wow,

266
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.590
he's got a serious complex there.
It's hard to appreciate.

267
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:07.130
But when he first started making tanks like that,
which again,

268
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:12.030
I think I bought one of his tanks in 2005,
I think somewhere around then,
dude,

269
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.480
there was no one making anything like that.
He was,

270
00:16:14.481 --> 00:16:16.580
he's making these super high end,

271
00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:21.140
crazy fucking double wall insulated tanks and you get in there,

272
00:16:21.141 --> 00:16:23.570
it's just,
yeah,
Justin,

273
00:16:23.571 --> 00:16:27.780
nothing and you just want to get swollen.
Oh,

274
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.830
you just get taken into the eye.
This,

275
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.970
it's a good place to think about the subject that we're talking about today.

276
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.060
We got to stop doing that with dolphins and orchids.

277
00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:40.760
It's going to be thought of the same way we think about slavery today.

278
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.640
It's her that it's horrific.
We can't understand that.

279
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:48.850
We can't believe that compassionate human beings would be willing to isolate the

280
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.380
members of a super social,

281
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:56.420
highly intelligent animal species and just put them in swimming pools.

282
00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:00.980
It's fucking barbaric.
It's crazy.
It's torture.
It's,

283
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.690
it's what's sad here is,
you know,

284
00:17:02.691 --> 00:17:06.350
we're a years removed from the documentary blackfish and you know,

285
00:17:06.351 --> 00:17:08.120
that was really impactful.
I mean,

286
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:10.740
arguably a responsible for the paradigm shift that we're,

287
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:14.410
that we're experiencing here in North America and other places of course.
Um,

288
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.230
but maybe it's time for people to revisit it.
I know seaworld,
uh,

289
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:21.800
their stock and their value is sort of going up now.
Granted,
they,
you know,

290
00:17:21.801 --> 00:17:24.110
they changed their numbers.
They skew it,
they have free beer day,

291
00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:26.690
they pump the numbers up,
you know,
they have all these different promotions,

292
00:17:26.691 --> 00:17:29.660
whatever.
I mean,
everything that comes out of these,
these facilities,

293
00:17:29.661 --> 00:17:34.200
these assume it to be all bullshit by the way,
that it's all bullshit,

294
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.920
but not enough people questioned them on it.
But as we speak,

295
00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:39.410
while we're a mid sort of a paradigm shift here and,
uh,

296
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.660
I mean I can speak to it because I mean,

297
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.710
I'm very happy to say that we have very effectively decimated marine land and

298
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:49.890
we'll talk more about that.
But,
uh,
over in China,
this is now a burgeoning

299
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.750
<v 2>a business.
And I,
and I did,
we discuss this a year and a half ago and it's,</v>

300
00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.930
it's tenfold now.
It's happening very quickly.

301
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.230
And I'm sure you're familiar with the whale jail situation in Russia.

302
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:02.580
Have you seen that?
No,
I am not.
They've got a enclosed in this bay.

303
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.500
They've got over a hundred,

304
00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.850
a wild caught belugas and orcas.
So there's about 10 orchids,

305
00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:13.650
if I'm not mistaken.
And uh,
some activists flew a drone over it.

306
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.980
This got worldwide attention,
a lot of outcry,
a lot of anger,

307
00:18:19.981 --> 00:18:23.110
of course.
Um,
so what happened was Jim,

308
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.760
he showed it to us right now for the folks that are listening and we're looking

309
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:31.530
down at the what looks like swimming pools with,
uh,
I guess those are Belugas,

310
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:36.850
those have all been sold.
Those are essentially sold and ready to go to China.
Uh,

311
00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.800
but on account of the fact that the activists got this and created a real

312
00:18:40.801 --> 00:18:44.550
worldwide stink,
um,
all the negative press that came of it,

313
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.300
they've now resolved that they want to try to,
well,
they've,

314
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.800
they've hard considered,
uh,
releases.
Um,

315
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:58.340
the governor in the area signed a intent to release agreement with the world,

316
00:18:58.441 --> 00:19:01.170
sang with the whale sanctuary project,
uh,

317
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.570
who sent a team to assess the animal's health and whatnot.

318
00:19:03.571 --> 00:19:05.820
And this was all of like three weeks ago.
It's not a long time ago.

319
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.920
And they assessed that all these animals should be released.

320
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:10.860
It's a couple of issues.
There's a couple of things that,

321
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.310
that are becoming conflicting.
A,

322
00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:19.200
it's going to require a lot of costs if it's done responsibly be,

323
00:19:19.201 --> 00:19:23.970
it appears.
Okay.
So what's happened is,
as we know,

324
00:19:23.971 --> 00:19:26.880
Russia's not exactly a democratic environment.

325
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:32.370
Only one person makes the decisions on account of what becomes of these whales.

326
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.130
Whereas there was some PR stunts to say,
Hey,
we're going to,

327
00:19:35.131 --> 00:19:35.941
we want to release them.

328
00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:38.490
We want to do this to sort of mitigate the global outrage.

329
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.840
The captors have propagandize this entire effort to,

330
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:48.080
to free these whales as a means for the west to undermine the Russia's Russia's

331
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.000
economy.
So the whale trade economy,

332
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.890
here's where marine land comes into play in a,
in a theory at this point,

333
00:19:55.891 --> 00:19:59.100
but it has these very intense implications.

334
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:03.990
What we know about what marine lend is doing currently in their transition from

335
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.150
brilliantly successful business to virtually decimated.
Thank you.

336
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:14.640
Um,
is there shipping their whales out?
We know too,

337
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:19.020
um,
are going out.
If it's not this week,
it'll be very soon.

338
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.790
I'll be shocked if they're not out.
I'm in La,

339
00:20:20.791 --> 00:20:22.200
so I can't say that it's happening right now.

340
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.920
I think it may very well be happening this week.
They're going to Spain.

341
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.780
We know that five other permits have been,
uh,

342
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.620
requested to send these animals now to the states.

343
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.000
So it was that they're liquidating their,
the intent.
Yeah,
they're,

344
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.410
they're going through liquidating.
But the issue is

345
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.210
if in fact Russia kept catches wind,
that marine land is sent,

346
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.620
sending their whales,
let's use the worst case scenario to China.

347
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:52.260
It validates the Russian captors propaganda and concerns.

348
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.500
Suddenly what we're concerned is going to happen is those animals,

349
00:20:56.501 --> 00:21:00.610
suddenly Putin says,
forget it.
Sell them,
ship them out.
That's,

350
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.290
that's a scenario.
But why would he do that?
Because again,
the,

351
00:21:04.291 --> 00:21:07.900
the captains of propaganda is that the west wants to cripple the Russia's

352
00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:10.570
economy there.
They're wild whale sale economy.

353
00:21:10.571 --> 00:21:14.110
So if it's marine land is selling whales to China from Canada,

354
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:17.410
then suddenly the captains have a point,
they'll say to Putin,
look there,

355
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:18.510
they're selling whales.

356
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.580
Why is it such an outrage that Russia's doing it when marine lands doing it?

357
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.330
So there's that concern.
The other one,

358
00:21:25.331 --> 00:21:28.570
and this just came up within the last 20 hours,

359
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.950
is it appears rather than go the most responsible route,

360
00:21:32.951 --> 00:21:35.410
which we know is going to be a costly endeavor,
but you know,

361
00:21:35.411 --> 00:21:38.530
we're game and we're ready is a,

362
00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:42.400
they're now considering just dropping the nets and saying see you later.

363
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.770
And letting all the animals go,

364
00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.660
here's what we suspect they're going to let the orcas go because they were

365
00:21:49.661 --> 00:21:52.030
captured illegally.
Uh,

366
00:21:52.031 --> 00:21:55.090
there's some gray area as to whether the Beluga whales I've been captured

367
00:21:55.091 --> 00:21:56.110
illegally or not.

368
00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:01.000
So I think it'll probably start with the archis rather than move them to where

369
00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:03.560
they were at the same time of year,
uh,

370
00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:08.050
when they were captured so that they can be next to their po,
their trends,
uh,

371
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.490
transient pods or their,
their,
their,
um,
their pods.
They just want to drop this,

372
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.850
this net and say,
see you later.
Well,
that's as irresponsible as it can get,

373
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.680
but that's crazy.

374
00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:22.540
It's like making someone a slave for how many years are the years somewhere on

375
00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:26.230
the planet.
But imagine there,
hope you can imagine it would be,
oh,

376
00:22:26.231 --> 00:22:30.040
see it didn't work.
Oh,
Jesus.
There's a lot of,
there's a,

377
00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.800
this is a big issue.
Uh,
we're on it.
There's a,

378
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.770
there's a great team of activists over there.

379
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.980
Would it be accurate to say that maybe what these groups are doing right now is

380
00:22:42.431 --> 00:22:46.540
recognizing that there's probably going to be some radical changes in the way

381
00:22:46.541 --> 00:22:49.540
these things are permitted?
What's legal,

382
00:22:49.541 --> 00:22:51.880
what's not legal and what people were tolerating.

383
00:22:51.881 --> 00:22:53.800
It's just not the same as it was 10 years ago.

384
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.630
Catch them and selling as fast as you can.

385
00:22:55.631 --> 00:22:58.780
I just get out while you can because there might come a point in time when not

386
00:22:58.781 --> 00:23:00.130
only could they not sell it,

387
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.550
but they might be responsible for doing exactly what you said and bringing it

388
00:23:03.551 --> 00:23:06.920
back to the area where it's family would be in,

389
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.420
which would be an incredible cost,
would be an incredible cost.

390
00:23:10.421 --> 00:23:14.940
It would be an undertaking unlike any other rescue,
uh,
that we know of.
And uh,

391
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.280
how much would something like that cost?
I can't even imagine.
I mean,

392
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.910
I would be the wrong person to ask.
I can't put a figure on it.

393
00:23:21.911 --> 00:23:26.410
I just know that it would take a lot of time.
Uh,
it'd be a lot of dedicated.
Uh,

394
00:23:26.411 --> 00:23:28.990
I mean we would need the pod.
Yeah.

395
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:32.290
You'd have to figure the vessels that would be able to bring the whales out.

396
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.230
I mean,
and you'd have to be able to somehow know that,

397
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.700
get it close enough to the other worlds without freaking them out.

398
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:42.220
It's a whole thing.
But it's possible.
I mean,
that's the important part.
Fuck man.

399
00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:43.030
The whole,

400
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:47.000
it's just one of those things I really think as people we're going to look back

401
00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:48.530
on and we're going to go,
man,

402
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.210
how did we in 2019 not know that that was insane.

403
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.720
Does that is not a chicken,
you know what I'm saying?
I mean,

404
00:23:56.721 --> 00:23:59.550
that's not like something you could just keep in a cage.
That's that.

405
00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.820
So let's back up to,
uh,
as you know,
at for well over four and a half years,

406
00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:07.700
five years now,
I've been advocating for bill s two or three,

407
00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:09.430
which is a ban against,
uh,

408
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.490
which is a national connect Canada wide band against a whale and Dolphin and

409
00:24:13.491 --> 00:24:16.650
porpoise captivity.
So that would include no more breeding,
no more important,

410
00:24:16.651 --> 00:24:20.360
no more export,
any of that.
Okay.
During these,
this,
this,
by the way,

411
00:24:20.361 --> 00:24:24.530
is going down as the longest bill ever researched in Canadian history because

412
00:24:24.531 --> 00:24:28.400
it's been a lot of issues from a opposition.
Uh,
one,

413
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.320
one senator in particular,
in fact,

414
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:35.030
that if I can have a moment to just give a senator Don Plett a big goal.
I,

415
00:24:35.031 --> 00:24:36.260
when you piece of Shit,

416
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:40.120
which camera do I look at to that I when you piece of Shit,
sorry,
I should,

417
00:24:40.121 --> 00:24:44.180
I should be more humble.
But was that the other guy,
the lawyer of Nissan?
No,
no.

418
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:48.620
This is the senator that has put every possible,
um,

419
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.140
block in front of the passage of this bill.

420
00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:53.990
He's tried to kill it silently forever.
I mean,
this is an epic,

421
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.710
epic story we've had to,
as activists and the community at large,
and again,

422
00:24:57.711 --> 00:25:01.220
I have to stress how much you've had a hand in this is I've had to,

423
00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:06.050
I've had to have these campaigns where we literally flood the Senate servers to

424
00:25:06.051 --> 00:25:09.460
the point of crashing it on that on a couple of,
uh,
incident,
uh,

425
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.620
instances where they were going to kill the bill very silently through a sort of

426
00:25:12.621 --> 00:25:17.090
procedures he's got as his role is a,
it's called the Senate whip.

427
00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:20.480
So he's actually yields a lot of influence in power.
He,
he,
uh,

428
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:23.780
creates the committees where people do the studies and everything.
He sets the,

429
00:25:23.781 --> 00:25:25.430
uh,
the dates for the committees.
I mean,

430
00:25:25.431 --> 00:25:30.020
he had this thing studied for like 17 straight months.
It was absurd.
Again,

431
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:34.700
longest tenure in a,
in a Canadian legislative history,
it appears.

432
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:38.480
But this guy was,
you know,
doing his,
his,
uh,
so he used to kill it.

433
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.990
Do you think that,
what do you think,
like why was he doing that?

434
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:49.040
He's one of these guys who looks at this bill and he sees it as a activist,

435
00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:51.580
sort of left wing,
um,
liberty,
you know,

436
00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.820
liberal sort of fluff bill.
He doesn't see that it's necessary.

437
00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:59.900
He went to marine land as an invited guest.
Uh,
he's very,
uh,

438
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.510
publicly declared his friendships for John Holder.

439
00:26:02.511 --> 00:26:06.770
I don't want to speculate as to whether there's been any,
uh,
money exchanges,

440
00:26:06.771 --> 00:26:10.400
but I know he's certainly very interested in killing this bill and by virtual

441
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:14.630
loan of activists pressuring and exposing all of his,
his efforts,

442
00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:17.630
we actually saved this bill on a number of occasions,

443
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.850
the most notable of which was just a few weeks ago where,
uh,

444
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.770
in the House of Commons,
it appeared this bill was going to die.

445
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:29.720
And literally at the 11th hour I packed up,
we drove to Ottawa.

446
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.110
I had a tweet storm set up.
We put pressure on.
I tweeted,

447
00:26:33.111 --> 00:26:38.030
individual senators are rather individual members of,
uh,
of parliament and,
uh,

448
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.590
I promise them,
and you know,

449
00:26:39.591 --> 00:26:42.890
this is a sensitive time in Canadian politics for Justin Trudeau,

450
00:26:42.891 --> 00:26:44.430
the of the PR of the Liberal Party.

451
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:45.150
<v 1>I,</v>

452
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.930
I them if this bill dies on account of the fact that what was happening was the

453
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:51.930
liberals were going to propose amendments to the bill last second that would

454
00:26:51.931 --> 00:26:54.480
send it back to the Senate for further review.

455
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.000
At which point we know Don Plett was waiting in line to kill it.

456
00:26:57.001 --> 00:26:58.320
There was nothing we could do at this point.

457
00:26:58.321 --> 00:27:01.890
This was going to be his to kill the fact that this was being facilitated by

458
00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:04.020
liberals was really infuriating thing.
But nonetheless,

459
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.200
we applied an incredible amount of pressure.
I drove my ass down there,

460
00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:09.240
I got there and I stood in front of every,
which one of them,

461
00:27:09.241 --> 00:27:12.180
and I looked them all in the eyes and just like,
I'm gonna make you famous.

462
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:16.620
I'm going to make you famous and I'm going to make you famous and,

463
00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:20.760
and make you famous.
And,
uh,
I don't want to speculate if that's what,
if,

464
00:27:20.761 --> 00:27:24.060
that's what saved the day,
although it was mentioned in the House of Commons,

465
00:27:24.061 --> 00:27:27.840
that special interest pressured them at the last second,
but in a,

466
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:32.580
in a last illegal,
can you say that to someone?
I'm going to make you famous.

467
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.120
I think it's,
it's my most of my most effective tool.

468
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:41.160
It's like a scene from a like,
um,
what's that?
What are the,

469
00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:44.730
what was the cowboy movie where Val Kilmer played a

470
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:51.060
doc holiday member?
Tombstone?
Yeah.
Sounds like a line in tombstone,

471
00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:56.280
right?
Oh No.
You know what it's from,
uh,
the one with a Bon Jovi Song.

472
00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.270
You know,
those,
those,
you know,
shot down in a blaze of glory.
You know,

473
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.600
you know those,
those,
uh,
those cute guys in the it,

474
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.590
was it the eighties or nineties that are all like did a western movie together?

475
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:11.880
Yes.
It's from that.
And we'll make you famous.
Oh Shit.
Sorry.

476
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.440
I knew I had heard it from somewhere.
I think it's from that.
I'd hope.

477
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:20.420
I'd hope that was my line.
But nonetheless,
it's what member Emilio Estevez does.

478
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.460
This was arguably the campiness cheesiest of the cowboy movies,

479
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.360
right?
Is it the campaign just today?
I didn't see it.

480
00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:35.320
I don't know if they're all handsome devils.
Um,
sorry.
So,

481
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:39.480
so I show up and show up.
Literally they,
the right before the meeting starts,

482
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.270
the entire committee stands up and leaves the room.
We're now,
we're,

483
00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:47.790
we're there and we're prepared for this to die.
I'm there for a funeral.
Uh,

484
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:48.840
they come back in,

485
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.440
the conservative members of the committee proposed there amendments,

486
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:55.510
the liberals,
which outweigh the,
uh,
uh,

487
00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.440
the Conservatives are,
you know,
they're all voting.

488
00:28:58.441 --> 00:29:00.690
So they're just knocking these things down,
knocking them down,

489
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:03.510
knocking them down,
and then suddenly it comes to the liberals time to propose,

490
00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:06.780
uh,
their amendments.
First guy comes up and he says,

491
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:11.310
I'd like to withdraw my amendment noted on the record,
sits down.
Okay,

492
00:29:11.311 --> 00:29:16.080
we'll go to number two.
I'd like to withdraw.
My amendment sits down.

493
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.660
Number three,
I'd like to withdraw.
My amendment were like,
Holy Shit,

494
00:29:18.661 --> 00:29:20.760
I'm looking back.
You know,
I've got some,

495
00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:25.850
we've got some people there that obviously have the same interests as me and you

496
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:29.670
know,
I don't even know exactly what's going on at this point.
I just know that,

497
00:29:29.671 --> 00:29:34.170
uh,
their faces are indicative that this,
we might win this thing.

498
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.230
And the fourth,
uh,
remember parliament stands up,

499
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:42.070
he withdraws the amendment and we save this thing in the last second.

500
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:46.210
<v 2>And I absolutely know it was a pressure campaign because like I said,</v>

501
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.700
I was going to come on this podcast.

502
00:29:48.701 --> 00:29:52.840
I'd already had this date written for some time and this was going to have

503
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:56.590
political implications that I don't know that the liberal party could have

504
00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.250
sustained.
It's a really bad time.
I think this came from the top down,

505
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.520
whereas efforts to kill it came from the bottom up.
This came from the top down.

506
00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:04.354
You're not killing that bill.

507
00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:09.400
I think people are understanding what dolphin captivity really is,

508
00:30:09.401 --> 00:30:12.640
what orchid captivity really is the thing.
They're understanding that now,

509
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.660
and I think it's just one of those things that exists because it's always

510
00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:18.700
existed,
but if it didn't exist now,

511
00:30:18.701 --> 00:30:22.930
there's no fucking way anybody would ever let you do it if there was no captive

512
00:30:22.931 --> 00:30:23.920
dolphins and orchids,

513
00:30:23.921 --> 00:30:28.540
if someone just went around and kidnapped him with what scientists know now

514
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:32.400
about their social structure and their community do,

515
00:30:32.401 --> 00:30:37.000
they're so complex,
the way they teach,
they have fucking dialects,
right?
It's,

516
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.990
they have dialects.
Orchids have,
uh,
um,

517
00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:42.843
they have,

518
00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.450
they share languages in different regions and actually have a different accent

519
00:30:46.451 --> 00:30:50.230
of sorts.
I mean,
it's,
uh,
it's really remarkable stuff yet,
right.

520
00:30:50.231 --> 00:30:54.580
It would be a global outrage if today as day one someone said,
hey,

521
00:30:54.581 --> 00:30:56.510
look at this thing.
Let's put this in this box.
I mean,

522
00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.720
because we have a more ready,
well,
because we have them in,

523
00:30:59.721 --> 00:31:02.390
there's some legacy businesses that have been around for a long time.

524
00:31:02.391 --> 00:31:05.800
That's a great way of putting it.
Um,
you know,
they have the means to fight.

525
00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:08.440
They know now that,
look,
this is not going so well.
If you can,

526
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:11.830
you can see it in all the advertising these days.
Uh,
uh,

527
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:15.340
seaworld almost rarely shows any orchids in their commercials,

528
00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:19.540
although it seems that the industry is sort of switching to baby walruses.

529
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.530
In fact,
they're there.
They're the new ORCA is,

530
00:31:23.531 --> 00:31:27.190
they're sort of the new brandable cute.
Um,
yeah,
it really is.

531
00:31:27.191 --> 00:31:28.930
It's happening all over.
It's happening in Canada as well.

532
00:31:28.931 --> 00:31:33.190
The Vancouver aquarium is running with it.
Um,
yeah.
And same as seaworld.

533
00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.370
If you go to their,
their Twitter,
it's,
you know,
I can't say that present day.

534
00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:41.290
It's,
it's like literally the case today.
But uh,
yeah,
a lot of baby walrus stuff.

535
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.370
It's where it's going.
It's just,

536
00:31:42.371 --> 00:31:44.710
they know that they can run with that at least for the time being.

537
00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.220
What's crazy and all this is here,

538
00:31:48.221 --> 00:31:52.240
this bill is passing now we know it's going to pass.
It's a,
it should be,

539
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:56.980
it should get royal assent come second week of June,
uh,
shy of some,

540
00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:00.810
some catastrophe.
This thing will become law.
Um,

541
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:04.030
that's why marine land is trying to get rid of these whales as quickly as they

542
00:32:04.031 --> 00:32:07.750
can.
They got to get them out of here because at least now they can just,

543
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:11.050
well it sounds like to,
to uh,
export permits have been approved.
So there,

544
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:15.860
so to Beluga whales are going to Spain,
um,
you know,

545
00:32:15.861 --> 00:32:18.790
but now granted that's being facilitated through the Vancouver Aquarium.

546
00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.680
This becomes an ugly mess here because when it comes to zoos,

547
00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.910
they're all part of these associations.
Okay.
And these are,

548
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.910
these are industry voices.
Anything that's if at anytime you're told,
well,

549
00:32:27.911 --> 00:32:32.170
this is an Aes that a accredited facility,
you know,
most schools for instance,
or,

550
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.050
or general people would say,
oh,
well it's a credit,
it's a good place.
No,
no,
no,
no,

551
00:32:35.051 --> 00:32:39.120
no.
What that means is these places facilitate,
uh,

552
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:43.580
animal transfers,
one not to other member facilities.
It's really just a club.

553
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:46.400
And this club protects,
uh,

554
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.930
the interests of these parks and keeps any type of oversight,

555
00:32:50.931 --> 00:32:52.610
lack their lobby groups basically.

556
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:56.720
So what's happened is now through the Vancouver Aquarium Marineland,

557
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.730
so marine line is sending these whales to Spain,

558
00:32:58.731 --> 00:33:03.440
but they're claiming them to be Vancouver Aquarium,
uh,
uh,
whales,

559
00:33:03.441 --> 00:33:04.820
which is not true.

560
00:33:04.821 --> 00:33:08.720
They were never on these animals inventory or rather this facility's inventory

561
00:33:08.721 --> 00:33:10.430
lists.
There's never been any knowledge of any of this.

562
00:33:10.431 --> 00:33:14.300
But what's happened is because of Vancouver aquarium is accredited and has an

563
00:33:14.301 --> 00:33:17.070
affiliation with the A's headache.
So in Canada,
we call it [inaudible].

564
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:20.720
The Canadian Association of Zoos and aquariums and marine lands is in fact not,

565
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.050
uh,
they no longer have their accreditation.
They did,

566
00:33:24.051 --> 00:33:27.590
they didn't have the best of relationships.
Shortly after all of our revelations,

567
00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:28.993
um,

568
00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:33.770
it's all just written now it's just the industry as a whole is breaking all of

569
00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:37.160
its own rules to facilitate getting these Beluga whales.

570
00:33:37.161 --> 00:33:41.150
Marineland has 51 of them.
Okay.
There's five born every year,

571
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.940
but they always have 51 and they don't,

572
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:48.350
they haven't shipped an Orca out in nearly a decade at this point.
Um,
I mean,

573
00:33:48.351 --> 00:33:50.840
you do the math at what's going on.
Exactly.
So they're dying.

574
00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:56.030
They're always have 51.
They don't ship them anywhere else.
I can attest that yes.

575
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.180
Uh,
when I was there and in my experience,

576
00:33:59.181 --> 00:34:03.110
and you don't have to watch my words because I know Marine Lens lawyer Andrew

577
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:06.530
Burns is listening.
Hi Andrew.
I'll see you next week.
Um,

578
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.780
in my experience,
uh,
yeah,
you're for as many animals are born,

579
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.150
you're just about losing as many.
So you'll lose two old ones.

580
00:34:14.151 --> 00:34:16.250
You'll lose three young ones.
Not all the ones that are boring.

581
00:34:16.251 --> 00:34:19.580
It would be successful just about half are.
Um,
so,

582
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:22.360
so what's happening now is the industry wants that bloodline.

583
00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:24.890
There's 51 captive orchids,
whereas you know,

584
00:34:24.891 --> 00:34:27.170
there's a lot of controversy in importing animals from other places at the

585
00:34:27.171 --> 00:34:28.100
states,
can't,
in fact,

586
00:34:28.101 --> 00:34:30.560
they can't bring them in from Russia without a public concert period.

587
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.420
It might still be the case with Canada.

588
00:34:32.421 --> 00:34:36.200
So actually the public might actually be consulted about the import of these

589
00:34:36.201 --> 00:34:40.160
five belugas that um,
marine land is seeking permit for it to export.

590
00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.830
So that's something that certainly has activist level.
I'll be,

591
00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:47.570
I'll be helping to guide towards the proper resolution.

592
00:34:47.571 --> 00:34:49.640
But yeah,
that's all happening.

593
00:34:49.641 --> 00:34:54.380
It is a race right now to get rid of marine lens animals.
And uh,

594
00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.080
I've had,
it is a wild time.

595
00:34:57.081 --> 00:35:00.230
It's a wild time to be inside the doors at marine land is,

596
00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:03.230
I can imagine in the fences.
Uh,
and it's,

597
00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:07.820
it's a most wild time for me to be on the outside because I've never in the last

598
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.190
six and a half years of litigation and just have my advocacy and being sort of

599
00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:15.590
an,
you know,
basically being engaged in war with marine land.

600
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:20.620
I've never seen them work harder to suppress me and to try to silence me than

601
00:35:21.681 --> 00:35:24.660
they are now.
Uh,

602
00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:28.400
as breaking news just today,
marine land had built this fence,

603
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:31.010
aptly named fills fence around the park.

604
00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:36.050
And just today we found out they blacked it all out with tarps because come,

605
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.400
uh,
this Saturday,
uh,

606
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:42.460
May 18th and certainly I'm inviting everyone to come join me.
Uh,

607
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.060
I'll be joining as an,
as a guest,

608
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.470
a big demonstration outside the marine land and we're going to protest it,

609
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.470
uh,
as they're,
as they're anticipating,

610
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.080
because on account of my coming on this show,

611
00:35:55.290 --> 00:36:00.290
they worked very hard to try to keep me from a coming be speaking of anything,

612
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.020
see,
certainly not promoting this event.
So I certainly hope that this event is a,

613
00:36:04.021 --> 00:36:06.810
is a,
is a,
well,
it's,
how did they try to do that?
Well,

614
00:36:06.811 --> 00:36:08.070
because we're in litigation,

615
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:13.050
what happens at in litigation is you come to a point where you start to

616
00:36:13.051 --> 00:36:15.000
negotiate.
And so

617
00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:20.820
there's things that they want from me.
There's things they really want from me.

618
00:36:20.821 --> 00:36:24.900
They want my silence.
The problem is

619
00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:32.010
they're never going to silence me.
It's not an option.
I've said it before,

620
00:36:32.011 --> 00:36:35.490
I'll say it again.
They can offer me $1 million to shut up,
go away.

621
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:40.590
It's not going to happen.
I'm not going to delete my Twitter.

622
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:45.870
I'm not going to delete any of my tweets that have the word marine land in them

623
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.050
is this request,
these,

624
00:36:49.051 --> 00:36:52.110
this is layers and layers and there've been layers of requests.

625
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.250
Basically they'd hoped that I wouldn't come here.

626
00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:00.170
They'd hoped something could be worked out in our litigation.
We have a,

627
00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.480
so now I've chased marine lines.
So back when marine lands owner was still alive,

628
00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.130
I put forth a huge campaign to try to get him to be examined legally by my

629
00:37:08.131 --> 00:37:12.120
lawyer.
Much like I've,
uh,
had to sort of submit myself to.
Um,

630
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.960
but as these lawsuits and litigation continues to reveal itself as just a

631
00:37:18.511 --> 00:37:21.380
perfect method of abuse,
you know,
that they're just,

632
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:27.250
the only resolve these things appear to serve is to exhaust both parties and

633
00:37:29.521 --> 00:37:33.630
have them come together with a resolution.
So after six and a half years,

634
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.870
a marine land seems intent on a resolution.

635
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.350
They don't want to go to examinations.
So while we were in.

636
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:43.830
So while I was there to be examined a couple of weeks ago,
my lawyer said,

637
00:37:43.831 --> 00:37:46.440
take a walk.
And the two lawyers began their talks.

638
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.310
We put off the examination because we believe that there could be some good

639
00:37:50.311 --> 00:37:52.170
faith that could be shown between parties.

640
00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:54.403
<v 4>MMM.</v>

641
00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:57.050
<v 2>It became quite evident that it was not the case.</v>

642
00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:02.030
And when we were to resume our examinations,
which was to be last week,

643
00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:06.230
marine land on account of the fact that I was coming on this show through an

644
00:38:06.231 --> 00:38:09.710
absolute tirade and said,
we are not doing this.
Now,
bear in mind,

645
00:38:09.711 --> 00:38:14.330
this is a court ordered examination date.
I've got a,
uh,
a trial,

646
00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:18.260
a coordinator who is trying to nudge this thing forward because I mean,

647
00:38:18.261 --> 00:38:21.200
that's something that's a,
that's a motion I had to win in the litigation itself,

648
00:38:21.201 --> 00:38:23.720
is to try to get someone to look at this thing so that it can actually move

649
00:38:23.721 --> 00:38:26.930
forward.
Like,
let's get someone to manage it.
So we're,
we're in case management.

650
00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:31.400
So that case management judge has issued a very aggressive schedule.

651
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:34.850
It's in back in February.
We had a court date of which thank you very much.

652
00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.110
I A handedly Marineland at to pick up,
uh,

653
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.960
just a little more than $12,000 of my legal bill,

654
00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:45.640
which is really on this particular motion in this event.
Uh,

655
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:49.880
kind of a drop in the Pan,
but,
um,
nonetheless a,
uh,
uh,

656
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.730
a sound victory in court.

657
00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.110
<v 0>Um,
you know,</v>

658
00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.030
<v 2>we have a case conference call next week.</v>

659
00:38:57.031 --> 00:39:00.900
Now I don't know where this stands because now Marineland has breached the

660
00:39:00.901 --> 00:39:05.520
court's order.
So we went,
they didn't show up the examination.
I got,

661
00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:10.440
uh,
a fourth a what's called a certificate of non attendance.

662
00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:13.380
It means the person that was supposed to be examined that they didn't show up,

663
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:16.520
a marine lands owner,
John Holder,
who's now passed away,
uh,

664
00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:19.560
didn't show up to two of his examinations knowing full well that I'd have to

665
00:39:19.561 --> 00:39:23.400
pick up the 1700 bucks to cop to just to be there to get the certificate.

666
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.110
And he's just not going to show up.
No big deal.

667
00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:28.260
That doesn't seem to be any punitive damage at their and they,
they uh,

668
00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:31.220
I mean we're almost seven years into this thing and there's still like

669
00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:32.730
brutalizing me.

670
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:33.940
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

671
00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:37.750
<v 2>But we're at a point where they're actually in a very uncomfortable position of</v>

672
00:39:37.751 --> 00:39:38.950
having to keep this thing.

673
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:43.000
If you don't want this litigation to be on the public record and transcripts and

674
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:47.170
evidence and everything,
you have to stop.
It seems to me the courts,
uh,

675
00:39:47.171 --> 00:39:50.830
appear to facilitate resolutions of that sort.
They like settlements.

676
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:55.270
I was promised to trial on day one.
It's what kept me going.

677
00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.350
They're lying about me.
They're lying about everything.
Everything they're saying

678
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.870
and they're trying to exhaust you financially.
Well of course they are.

679
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:08.340
I mean that's the premise.
You counter suing them as well.
I'm counter suing.

680
00:40:08.341 --> 00:40:12.030
The premise of my counter suit is so that they couldn't merely drop my,
my,

681
00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:16.200
the lawsuit against me over a period of time and then that just be it and that I

682
00:40:16.201 --> 00:40:18.870
would,
I would then have to actually file a motion to get some costs back.

683
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:22.830
I'd be lucky to get 50% and everything in the early days.
My lawyer said,

684
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:26.960
let's sue him back.
And so we did.
I'm suing them for abuse of process.
They're,

685
00:40:26.961 --> 00:40:31.320
they're using the court's time,
resources.
Uh,
they,
I mean even for that matter,

686
00:40:31.321 --> 00:40:35.190
we can extend that to the police and other,
uh,
you know,
uh,
departments,

687
00:40:35.191 --> 00:40:39.540
organizations,
uh,
they're exhausting.
Uh,
these things as in bad faith,

688
00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.300
they're doing it because they just want to try to,
basically,

689
00:40:42.301 --> 00:40:44.910
they want to take away my right to free expression,

690
00:40:44.911 --> 00:40:49.200
which is a Canadian chartered,
right?
I mean,
I'm protecting my own history here.

691
00:40:49.201 --> 00:40:52.530
I mean,
this is insanity.
I can't even believe that after six and a half years,

692
00:40:52.531 --> 00:40:57.210
I'm still here at risk of being silenced.
That the fact that,
I mean,
look,

693
00:40:57.211 --> 00:41:01.530
full disclosure,
I'm out of money.
The last time I was on this show,
we raised,

694
00:41:01.531 --> 00:41:05.940
I mean,
and again,
thank you so much.
60,
maybe almost 70,000.

695
00:41:05.941 --> 00:41:09.780
That's an a year and a half.
That's gone.
I spent my last penny last month.

696
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:11.850
It was a very aggressive last three months.

697
00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:18.420
Do you have a go fund?
Me?
I have a go fund me information.
Yes,
please.
What is it?

698
00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:23.460
It's a,
if you go to save smooshy.com s a v e s m o,
s h,

699
00:41:23.461 --> 00:41:26.940
i.com.
You can go there.
There's a small documentary.
It's a little dated now,

700
00:41:26.941 --> 00:41:28.700
but not on account of the fact that legislation,

701
00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.010
nothing's really moved forward in the lawsuit and the legislation only just

702
00:41:32.011 --> 00:41:33.890
wrapping up.
It's still very,
so please

703
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.150
<v 1>spend the 14 minutes to sort of uh,
appreciate the story more.</v>

704
00:41:38.151 --> 00:41:41.870
I guess you'll get a better,
a more context to it.
There's,
you know,
some,

705
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.900
some footage in there,
some back,
a backstage stuffs.
You know,
it,

706
00:41:45.901 --> 00:41:49.310
it tells the tale quite well.
It's a,
it's a,
it's a good piece.
Yeah.
Folks,

707
00:41:49.311 --> 00:41:52.850
if you're,
if you're hearing this,
please help it out.
If you can,
you know,

708
00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.300
do I say it all the time?
It's the thing I hate to do most is ask for help.

709
00:41:56.301 --> 00:42:00.080
I really understands me well.
Your intentions are pure,
you know,

710
00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:05.081
you really are a person who is going about this because you feel like you are

711
00:42:05.601 --> 00:42:10.070
uniquely qualified to talk about it.
You have the actual information,

712
00:42:10.071 --> 00:42:13.640
you know what's wrong,
you know,
and you are part of the system.

713
00:42:13.641 --> 00:42:16.550
You understand that better than anybody on the outside.

714
00:42:16.551 --> 00:42:21.200
Can they have my walrus and they have your walrus still we think.
And so when,

715
00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:26.190
and so when in the litigation,
my lawyer says,
well,

716
00:42:26.191 --> 00:42:28.980
here's what marina lands prepared to offer.
I say to my lawyer,

717
00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.200
but what about the Walrus?
And he says to me,
do we talked about this?

718
00:42:33.201 --> 00:42:35.530
This is crazy.
You're not getting a walrus.

719
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:37.930
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

720
00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:41.960
<v 1>I said to marine land,
I don't want no money.
Not a penny.</v>

721
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:48.220
I want the Walrus.
There's two left.
Uh,
three have died in the last,

722
00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:52.000
it's really in mere months.
Uh,
secretly I find out.
What would you do with her?

723
00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:53.471
I mean,

724
00:42:53.471 --> 00:42:56.350
ideally what I would like is I just want to transfer it at this point to another

725
00:42:56.351 --> 00:42:56.980
facility.

726
00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:00.010
I would love to see a transfer to the Vancouver aquarium or there's a facility

727
00:43:00.011 --> 00:43:02.170
in Quebec as well.
I just want to be up pos.

728
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:06.340
I just want to possibly be in her life if she needs me,
which I mean,

729
00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:10.630
there's a reason she's in one of two still alive.
If I would comment,
listen,

730
00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.470
would you move to Vancouver if suddenly Dan Bilzerian gets on the horn?

731
00:43:14.471 --> 00:43:18.340
It's just filling out this,
uh,
well actually,
I,
well wait,

732
00:43:18.341 --> 00:43:21.340
there's a backstory to that too.
I actually got some beef with him inadvertently,

733
00:43:21.341 --> 00:43:24.130
but what we'll get back to that,
but you know,
if you were to suddenly say,
Hey,

734
00:43:24.131 --> 00:43:28.220
I got this,
uh,
Arctic Beach Front home and uh,
do you,
I'll buy you a walrus.
Yeah.

735
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:32.460
Move.
Absolutely.
I mean,
she's got another 10 years of her life.
I do.
You know,

736
00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:37.300
there's only one way I wore this to be with this Walrus,
play the music.

737
00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:42.160
Is there a better answer this to the story?
I mean,
really,
it all sounds so crazy,

738
00:43:42.161 --> 00:43:46.010
Joe.
But here's 66 and a half years ago I was like,
I want the Walrus.
Right?

739
00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:48.490
Suddenly here I am negotiating for a Walrus.
Call me crazy.

740
00:43:48.491 --> 00:43:50.920
But so are they willing to negotiate for the Walrus?

741
00:43:50.921 --> 00:43:54.760
Is this actually in consideration?
Yes.
Yeah.

742
00:43:54.761 --> 00:43:58.900
Not without layers and layers and layers of compromise and,

743
00:43:58.901 --> 00:43:59.950
but bear in mind.

744
00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:01.710
<v 5>Okay.</v>

745
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:04.860
<v 1>Not in the capacity that I see it.
More of a,
yeah,
maybe.</v>

746
00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:07.230
Maybe we won't send her to China.
How's that?

747
00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:11.490
Maybe we'll send her somewhere and not deter that facility from a you visiting.

748
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.780
Maybe we could do that for you.
That's what I mean.
It's,
it's really bad faith it.

749
00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:19.530
The problem with the thing that I have a hard time dealing with is,
look,

750
00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:24.330
we're going to litigation and you know in in litigation you have to exercise a

751
00:44:24.331 --> 00:44:27.510
certain amount of decorum and it's not exactly my strong point.
It's just not,

752
00:44:27.511 --> 00:44:31.440
I find decorum to be just a thick layer of bullshit.
I just do.
Yeah.

753
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.620
<v 2>You want to hope that there's going to be some type of good faith negotiation.</v>

754
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:42.650
I want that marine land negotiates with additional hostilities and threats.

755
00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.840
It's not worked for them in six and a half years.

756
00:44:45.841 --> 00:44:48.000
What makes you think it's going to work now?

757
00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.960
So here I think we're going down a path of possibly good at a good faith

758
00:44:51.961 --> 00:44:55.560
negotiations.
The owner,
the,
the villain of the story is gone.

759
00:44:55.561 --> 00:44:59.370
He's out of the picture.
Uh,
the,
the new president who was the,
the widow.

760
00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:03.390
The wife is a wonderful woman.
I mean,
listen,
if I honestly and truly believe,

761
00:45:03.391 --> 00:45:07.520
if the lawyer himself wasn't the controlling mind of the business now,
uh,

762
00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.030
he sort of facilitating this transfer of,
of,

763
00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:13.980
of the business as it was to just being sold off,

764
00:45:13.981 --> 00:45:18.060
pieced off and distribute the wealth to the,
to the remaining family members.

765
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:22.470
I think that we could,
I think the story ends on a good note.
I mean,

766
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:23.460
I have no hostility.
You know,

767
00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:28.620
I have every reason in the world to despise the man who sued me and I don't,

768
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:29.760
I don't even think about them.

769
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:32.010
It was never about that they made every case in the world.

770
00:45:32.011 --> 00:45:35.520
Every argument that this was personal between me and him and what that is,

771
00:45:35.521 --> 00:45:37.710
cause you look in the camera and say fuck you to people.

772
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.110
It's personal between me and Don Plett.

773
00:45:39.111 --> 00:45:40.920
You can bet your ass that's a different story.

774
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.240
But you don't know what I'm saying.
Did I make them famous?
Well,

775
00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:48.390
even in a way maybe.
Um,

776
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:53.220
so where do you stand right now?
Well,
I don't know.

777
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.650
So next week we're having a case management,
uh,

778
00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.820
the case manager's gonna talk and we're going to see what becomes of marine lens

779
00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.590
once again,
skipped examination.

780
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:04.740
It's so hard to believe this is still going on to walk into my phone.

781
00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:09.150
And from the time you first came on the podcast and now that this has been just

782
00:46:09.151 --> 00:46:12.780
as scratch and claw everyday of my life,

783
00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:17.810
I live with this looming cloud of a threat of like,

784
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:24.270
there's people out there that really want me,
I'm not talking physical threat.

785
00:46:24.271 --> 00:46:26.350
Okay.
They did.
They played their games.
You know,

786
00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.610
I called every one of their bluffs every,
at every corner of this thing.

787
00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:30.950
But you know,

788
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:34.050
there's something about when you say they played their games or they sent goons

789
00:46:34.051 --> 00:46:37.080
to my house.
Yeah,
there's video in fact that there's on that documentary,

790
00:46:37.081 --> 00:46:39.270
you'll see these,
they send some tough guys.
I mean,

791
00:46:39.271 --> 00:46:42.270
they were sending people at 6:00 AM harassing my girlfriend while she's taking

792
00:46:42.271 --> 00:46:47.220
the garbage out.
I mean,
it really got pretty intense.
Um,
but we stood our ground.

793
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.260
I was like,
this is not going to go down like this.

794
00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:51.750
It's like you're fucking with the wrong guy,
dude.
Like,
listen,

795
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.240
I come from a place called Welland,
Ontario.

796
00:46:54.241 --> 00:46:56.400
I don't know that you're familiar with that.
I'm gonna assume not.

797
00:46:56.401 --> 00:46:59.190
Probably few people are,
unless you're an avid hockey fan,

798
00:46:59.191 --> 00:47:03.420
because we have produced some pretty amazing,
uh,
Nhl talent.
But,
um,

799
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:07.380
you know,
at this population of like 50,000,
I'm a Welander.

800
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.360
I don't know any other,
a Frenchman.
I mean,
it's probably another thing to stress,

801
00:47:12.361 --> 00:47:15.900
but I don't know any other way to deal with things other than sort of fight it

802
00:47:15.901 --> 00:47:20.340
out.
You know,
you don't cower and run.
You don't,
you know,
you stare the threat,

803
00:47:20.341 --> 00:47:22.100
especially when you're on the right side of things.
Yeah.

804
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.730
I'm not gonna sit there and take shit.
I'm not gonna,

805
00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:29.830
it's not gonna work for them to continuously try to threaten me because dude,

806
00:47:29.831 --> 00:47:30.664
I'm invested

807
00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:35.740
<v 1>and I'm not talking money.
I'm in a,
it's like a hostage situation.</v>

808
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:36.910
It's how it started.

809
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:41.760
My only interest is ending the hostage situation.
That,

810
00:47:41.761 --> 00:47:44.010
that my only interest,
I shouldn't say that.
Of course now you know,

811
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:45.490
I have interest in,
in,
you know,

812
00:47:45.491 --> 00:47:48.160
I've been advocating for for bills obviously advocating,

813
00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:52.380
letting people know that they'll sort of taking the veil off the bullshit,
uh,

814
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:56.830
that the industry,
you feel like you're negotiating for a hostage in smooshy

815
00:47:59.050 --> 00:47:59.883
<v 6>there.</v>

816
00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:04.950
<v 1>They're using her as that type of chip.
Yeah,
that's there bart.</v>

817
00:48:04.951 --> 00:48:07.260
That's their bargaining chip.
That's what they got.

818
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:12.060
And the keeping this constant pressure on you.
It's constant financial threats.

819
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:14.730
Uh,
constant like my lawyer in fact,

820
00:48:14.731 --> 00:48:17.490
and this is where it gets kind of weird because listen,
I don't understand.

821
00:48:17.491 --> 00:48:21.330
He's supposed to be representing me.
The answer is no to everything.
Fight,
fight,

822
00:48:21.331 --> 00:48:24.240
fight.
I want to trial.
He instead is coming with,
listen,

823
00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:25.620
this is not how litigation ends.

824
00:48:25.621 --> 00:48:27.900
Feel like you don't seem to understand how this ends.

825
00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.080
You don't have a grip of how litigation works.
And I'm just like,

826
00:48:31.081 --> 00:48:34.140
I'm glad that I don't because my guest is I representative of what 90% of the

827
00:48:34.141 --> 00:48:36.750
population that don't know.
And it's important that we find out.

828
00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.200
I was promised the trial because they said I was this,
this,
this,
this,
this.
Well,

829
00:48:40.201 --> 00:48:42.240
let's get through that fucking trial.
This is what I've been doing.

830
00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:46.140
This doesn't end with negotiations.
I want the trial.
Yeah.
I don't understand.

831
00:48:46.141 --> 00:48:49.110
Like why would you sue me unless you want the trial.
Oh,

832
00:48:49.111 --> 00:48:50.430
because it's a bullshit lawsuit.

833
00:48:50.431 --> 00:48:53.670
Well then I want the trial because I need to show that I need that on my record.

834
00:48:53.671 --> 00:48:58.440
I want that.
I want the truth.
They fucked with the wrong guy.
I hate to say it.

835
00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:03.060
I'm the owner of all the lawsuits they've launched.
They launched in,
in,
you know,

836
00:49:03.061 --> 00:49:05.090
an excess of like 12 and threatened.
And,

837
00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:08.190
and it's important to note I've been threatened and I'm constantly under threat

838
00:49:08.191 --> 00:49:09.210
of additional litigation.

839
00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:15.210
And the only one left and the only lawsuit that's I'm the only person who hasn't

840
00:49:15.211 --> 00:49:17.700
had to compromise,
uh,
their free expression.

841
00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:23.460
It's the dirty secret about the legal business,
right?

842
00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:25.170
That this is a loophole.

843
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.720
This is something people can do to people to silence them,

844
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:31.230
just to drag them through hell for six years,
maybe 10.

845
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:34.590
Who knows how long this goes.
Right?
And this is a case manage,

846
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.460
I mean I had to fight in court at great expenditure to get this case management

847
00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:42.840
and if you put this up to the general public and have them look at what the

848
00:49:42.841 --> 00:49:46.960
actual facts are and had them look at what these people,
what their businesses,

849
00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:50.010
what they're actually doing,
it's game over.
It's game over.

850
00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:51.420
That's a real problem for them.

851
00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.270
The real problem is it's an indefensible activity.

852
00:49:55.830 --> 00:50:00.830
Having those animals in swimming pools for people's enjoyment like tea.

853
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.440
But to follow that up with trying to crush people,
crush my fiscal sovereignty.

854
00:50:07.441 --> 00:50:08.131
I mean look,
no,

855
00:50:08.131 --> 00:50:11.610
there's nothing good on their side for what they tried to do to you for what the

856
00:50:11.611 --> 00:50:16.290
business is.
I like to operate in full sort of transparency because look,
I'm,

857
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:18.690
I guess I'm sort of sponsored by the public,

858
00:50:18.691 --> 00:50:21.840
so I feel like a level of transparency and all this,
but you know,

859
00:50:21.841 --> 00:50:22.890
I had a little bit of money.

860
00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:28.940
I'd won a TV show called wipe out and I had 50 Canadian dollars tax free in the

861
00:50:29.061 --> 00:50:31.940
bank,
which I sat on because I didn't know precisely what it is.

862
00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:34.970
I was going to do with it and I felt like there was a potential of a rainy day

863
00:50:34.971 --> 00:50:35.804
around the corner.

864
00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:41.570
It took that in the first six months to six months to hire lawyers for

865
00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:43.550
everybody.
Everyone that was getting sued,
I was cutting,
you know,

866
00:50:43.551 --> 00:50:46.550
$5,000 retainers for there's a purpose for this money.

867
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:49.910
I only have it because I got on the show because of my relationship with the

868
00:50:49.911 --> 00:50:53.810
Walrus.
So I'm in for a good chunk of change here.

869
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:58.520
Uh,
it's crazy.

870
00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:04.540
The lengths of which and the ability corporations have to destroy individuals.

871
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:10.210
The fact that the court is there to facilitate it is precisely why I want to go

872
00:51:10.611 --> 00:51:13.190
to trial.
I've been told the figures are,

873
00:51:13.191 --> 00:51:14.870
and please don't quote me and I'd love the facts,

874
00:51:14.871 --> 00:51:19.340
but I've been told that something in the area of like 90% of lawsuits get

875
00:51:19.341 --> 00:51:22.430
settled without going to discovery.
I want to be,

876
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:26.810
I want to be the 10% or less.
I want it.
I want a resolution by the,
by the judge.

877
00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:30.560
I can sleep at night if the judge says,
okay,
it ends with this Phil,

878
00:51:30.561 --> 00:51:32.990
you get a $50,000 of your,

879
00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:37.850
at this point in excess of 200,000 in legal bills and marine land,

880
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:40.970
you lost.
So you know,
you,
you got to eat the shame and walk away.

881
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.870
I would assume be more comfortable with that than if Maureen Lynn said,

882
00:51:44.871 --> 00:51:48.530
here's $100,000.
Don't talk about the,
um,

883
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:51.680
I mean even let's say in the best case scenario,
they said,

884
00:51:51.681 --> 00:51:54.290
here's a chunk of change.
So let's just use $100,000 and said,

885
00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.930
just don't talk about the terms of the settlement.
But other than that,

886
00:51:56.931 --> 00:51:59.150
you have no impeded speech.
You can just be free.

887
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:03.980
I would be more comfortable with the judge's decision then that hundred k

888
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:07.160
because then at least I know exactly what it is that I went through.

889
00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:10.940
I had the world can find out what function these courts have and what their

890
00:52:10.941 --> 00:52:14.120
version of justices.
I mean,
I'm just still,

891
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:18.050
I'm trying not to be jaded because obviously it's a heavy load to carry as in

892
00:52:18.051 --> 00:52:22.010
your day to day.
It's,
uh,
you know,
I've been on the cusp of crazy.
Um,

893
00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:27.220
I'm thankful for plant medicine for sort of keeping me grounded and keep me in a

894
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:31.460
with the proper perspective.
But plant medicine listen to you.
Hippie.
Yeah,
well

895
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:37.010
they do try to call me hippy a lot too.
That's interesting.
I mean,

896
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.920
I'm pretty little bit of a different version of hippie I suppose.
I mean,

897
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:44.720
I don't mind war.
Well your,
um,

898
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.960
your God cares about these marine mammals.

899
00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:51.540
The walrus is like my daughter due to sounds crazy distressed it,

900
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:54.590
but as soon as you consider that factor,
you're just like,
dude,
he's got,

901
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:56.410
they've got your daughter.
That's a mess.

902
00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:59.270
Trying to put yourself in the perspective that if they had your dog,

903
00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:04.250
your neighbor's got your dog and is,
uh,
is an unimpeded Lee,
uh,
uh,
uh,

904
00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.800
by your definition abusing or neglecting their life.

905
00:53:06.801 --> 00:53:09.230
And you're there to just watch silently.
I mean,
that's disgusting.

906
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:12.580
That's disgusting scenario.
This is the poison that I live with.
I,

907
00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.480
I need,
I need a proper closure.

908
00:53:17.481 --> 00:53:22.481
I'm relying on there being a level of justice so that one day I can live in this

909
00:53:24.111 --> 00:53:25.980
world without being just that old

910
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.040
<v 3>Jayda dude look,
last time I was here it was not nearly as fucking gray,</v>

911
00:53:29.041 --> 00:53:33.330
like starting to feel the effects of longterm litigation.

912
00:53:33.331 --> 00:53:36.180
You don't have a podcast to you.
I want to do a podcast,

913
00:53:36.181 --> 00:53:40.050
I'm urge to do a podcast was urgent.
You well people,
you know they just,
you know,

914
00:53:40.051 --> 00:53:41.250
fill your wish should have a podcast,

915
00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:44.100
do a podcast and I had to get a real simple thing for you to do.

916
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:48.360
I know I'm running lots of saying you're a great talker and thanks Joe.

917
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:52.080
I appreciate that.
Why don't you do it?
I am considering it.
Yeah,

918
00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:55.760
I really get mad at me that I keep suggesting the people get podcasts but we

919
00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:57.360
just don't have bro.
Stop doing the,

920
00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.250
you know you said to me when we were in Toronto at dinner,

921
00:53:59.251 --> 00:54:01.950
you said you should be a comedian.
I say that.
I've heard that before.

922
00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.690
Convenient for sure.

923
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:06.150
That's funny cause I've heard you mentioned that on the show a number of times

924
00:54:06.151 --> 00:54:10.210
too.
I've got two people.
Well there's so few of us on,

925
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:13.920
there's more podcasters and there are comedians force or like,

926
00:54:13.921 --> 00:54:16.260
it's not even close.
There's like,
um,

927
00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:21.000
I think there's more than 600,000 podcasts now in iTunes.
So yeah,

928
00:54:21.001 --> 00:54:25.140
there's not 600,000 comics.
There's like,
that's a big pool to wade in,
you know,

929
00:54:25.141 --> 00:54:28.260
but I mean,
I'm in,
I'm in,
if I did it,
it would be up for my own purposes.

930
00:54:28.261 --> 00:54:32.520
You know,
I would be,
there's categories of course,
and for someone new,

931
00:54:32.521 --> 00:54:36.240
I guess you'd probably be in his conservation to category or wildlife or

932
00:54:36.241 --> 00:54:38.840
something like that,
you know,
you would,

933
00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:43.850
you would launch pretty quickly and it would be fascinating for people to,

934
00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.150
have you ever,
um,

935
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:49.900
heard like one of the really well produced a NPR podcasts like the dropout?

936
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:51.810
Was it,
did NPR do the dropout,

937
00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:55.200
the one on Elizabeth Holmes and the Theranose controversy,

938
00:54:55.201 --> 00:54:58.350
the blood scanning stuff.
Anyway,

939
00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:03.380
it's an amazing multipart series that describes how these people made this phony

940
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:09.900
blood testing technology and sold it and made millions of dollars in,

941
00:55:09.901 --> 00:55:12.060
was they were worth valued at billions.

942
00:55:12.061 --> 00:55:16.470
And now they're literally virtually worth nothing.
So it was by ABC radio.

943
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:20.880
That's who did it.
Nightline.
That's what it was.
ABC News Nightline.

944
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.730
But something like that could,

945
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:28.910
if someone wanted to follow this and and document it from the beginning in a

946
00:55:30.241 --> 00:55:34.710
podcast form,
this is something that really could be like six one hour episodes.

947
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:39.240
If you were talking about your history with training orchids,

948
00:55:39.241 --> 00:55:40.850
what you thought it was when you first got into,

949
00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:44.250
when we went into that and several of the other episodes.
But think about this.

950
00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:47.910
You and I have talked now,
how many times have you been on now?
This is my fourth.

951
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:52.140
Okay,
so each time it's been like three hours.
So all those,

952
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:54.210
all those hours of discussion.

953
00:55:54.211 --> 00:55:58.170
If someone you condense that into your story,

954
00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.060
I think it would be super compelling.

955
00:56:00.061 --> 00:56:04.080
And then you could also update people on the case.

956
00:56:04.081 --> 00:56:09.081
You could update people on the state of Marine mammo captivity legislation and

957
00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:15.360
because there are countries that are right now waking up and realizing this is

958
00:56:15.361 --> 00:56:18.180
crazy,
like this is really almost like human slavery.

959
00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:22.170
It's like finding aliens and just keeping them in a cage somewhere.
I mean,

960
00:56:22.171 --> 00:56:24.220
the timing's right.
I don't don't that.
So

961
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:27.160
<v 2>yeah,
I mean perfect.
Again,
with the looming litigation,</v>

962
00:56:27.161 --> 00:56:31.190
I do get a little bit sort of a tongue shy because this is just going to be,

963
00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:35.560
I'll be sued again,
man.
It's kind of freaks me out.
I,
I really what?
You know,

964
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:38.050
it's the same premise of writing a book.
It's like great,
write a book,

965
00:56:38.051 --> 00:56:40.210
but it's like I can't do anything with it because I'll be sued.

966
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:44.510
I'll be suiting seat.
It's a virtual guarantee.
Now the,
the,
the,

967
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.720
the bright side is,

968
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:51.340
it seems to me like a marine land is not going to be around for terribly long,

969
00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:56.380
a terribly long time.
Once their dissolved,
oh,
you bet your ass.

970
00:56:56.381 --> 00:56:57.700
I got lots to talk about.
I mean,

971
00:56:57.701 --> 00:57:02.701
I would love if I could speak of everything without having to sort of watch,

972
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:06.370
you know,
I really do have to keep from saying a lot of stuff.

973
00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:09.790
I'm not on account of it being illegal,

974
00:57:09.791 --> 00:57:11.080
but just on account of the fact that it will,

975
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:16.600
it'll virtually guaranteed me additional hostilities and you know,

976
00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:20.200
leaving,
she was kind of,
I can completely understand.
I completely understand.

977
00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:24.190
I do look forward to that day where I'm sort of free and unencumbered and just

978
00:57:24.191 --> 00:57:26.860
can just be fucking me again,
you know?
Yeah.
Well,

979
00:57:26.861 --> 00:57:29.830
if you're in that business right now,
you gotta be looking at the future going,

980
00:57:29.831 --> 00:57:32.770
we've got to get out.
We've got to get out before they take us out.

981
00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.090
That's precisely what's happening.

982
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:39.150
So the speculation is a marine lens lawyer is now the sole controlling mind and

983
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:42.430
that's precisely what his job is to transition this from.

984
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:44.710
We know that they've sold property,
they sold the golf course,

985
00:57:44.711 --> 00:57:48.850
they sold the camp ground.
Uh,
we know now that they're there,
uh,
I'll say,

986
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:49.840
I'll use the word selling.

987
00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:52.420
It might not be the right term because marine land claims there'll be no

988
00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:57.250
financial,
uh,
exchanges.
But,
uh,
you know that,
that's yet to be seen.

989
00:57:57.910 --> 00:58:01.720
Um,
yeah,
the writing's on the wall,
they're going to be gone.

990
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:06.700
I don't think the wife has any interest.
What I mean she's,

991
00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:10.330
she's pushing 70 something.
It's probably doesn't want to be a part of this.

992
00:58:10.331 --> 00:58:13.210
She's never really had a heavy hand in it.
I mean she had her,
she had,

993
00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:16.240
she sort of took care of the cash business aspect of it.
She sort of,

994
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:17.290
she had her role in it,

995
00:58:17.291 --> 00:58:20.650
but it wasn't like a management position making decisions on animals,
health,

996
00:58:20.651 --> 00:58:23.680
importing,
exporting,
things like this.
Like it's just beyond her.
So what,

997
00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:28.780
what we've been told is that a marine lens owner in his final days,

998
00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:33.400
there's a wishlist.
This is what happens to the park.

999
00:58:33.401 --> 00:58:35.530
This is what happens with this.
This is what happens with this.

1000
00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:40.510
And you can bet your ass that there's something about a walrus and there's

1001
00:58:40.511 --> 00:58:42.340
something about me in there.
What it is,

1002
00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:47.380
at least that I know of right now is obviously hostilities till the end.

1003
00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:51.700
I think that what's happening is the lawyer is fulfilling,
uh,

1004
00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:55.360
John Holders wishes with me.
I think it's,

1005
00:58:55.420 --> 00:59:00.420
I think it's in the books that he can't just end this thing or I don't know.

1006
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:06.000
It's a,
at the time,
I know the guy's dead.
Let it go folks.

1007
00:59:06.001 --> 00:59:09.490
A lawyer doesn't like me.
What can we in the same,
we're talking a lot of shit,

1008
00:59:09.491 --> 00:59:11.760
bro.
You know what?
He actually said camera.

1009
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:15.010
I told him to go fuck himself or whatever you said that's going to be in court

1010
00:59:15.011 --> 00:59:18.220
document.
I didn't say that.
I said that to senator,
but he'll run with that.

1011
00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:21.590
That's okay.
Will it be in court documents?
Oh,
he's watching.
He's listening.

1012
00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:22.160
I mean,
uh,

1013
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.280
<v 3>I sort of have hope that he suits you joy to say that,</v>

1014
00:59:25.281 --> 00:59:27.440
but I sort of have fuck up.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Do.
Yeah.

1015
00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:31.260
I don't wish that on my best of friends,
but man would,
that's

1016
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:36.860
when the sun is not going to happen,
but fuck.
Do you know it's not gonna Happen?

1017
00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:39.190
No.
You just target shirt.
You just put it out there,
man.
It's,

1018
00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:41.570
he's not gonna Jude Juju.
We talked about this last time too.

1019
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:46.630
I think that what they do in terms of that business for their own sake,

1020
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:52.300
they should stop for everyone that's profiting off that.

1021
00:59:52.330 --> 00:59:55.550
You've got to find an exit strategy.
And I don't just mean marine land.

1022
00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:59.620
I mean anyone who understands my language,
that's,

1023
00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:04.310
that's hearing my words.
You should stop.
This is not the future.
This is,

1024
01:00:04.311 --> 01:00:09.260
you can't do that anymore.
This is going,
this is going to look horrible.

1025
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:13.280
Just a few years from now where people who've seen blackfish,

1026
01:00:13.281 --> 01:00:15.230
people who do understand what those things are,

1027
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:19.430
the more we find out about dolphins and orchids,
the more we understand them,

1028
01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.070
it's going to be more and more.
It's not like,
oh,
wait a minute.

1029
01:00:22.071 --> 01:00:24.870
We just did some tests we found there.
They're like crabs,
bro.

1030
01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:28.820
They're dumb as fuck.
Like you can just eat them and it's not going to happen.

1031
01:00:28.821 --> 01:00:31.730
Man.
Where more and more impressed with them,
the more we study them,

1032
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:38.270
<v 2>I am more than happy to negotiate with the marine land that rather than signing</v>

1033
01:00:38.371 --> 01:00:43.170
any type of non-disparagement because I don't want my speech virtually locked in

1034
01:00:43.171 --> 01:00:46.630
a,
uh,
in a,
in a legal document.
Um,

1035
01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.890
I'm a forgiving person.
I don't need,

1036
01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:54.360
I'm only responding in kind to their hostilities.
They come at me with war.

1037
01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:57.990
I bring it back.
I don't want to,
I have to.
Yeah.

1038
01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.570
I take it right back up to where they bring it.
Then they do this,

1039
01:01:00.571 --> 01:01:03.030
then I got to do this.
Then they do this.
I'm like,
well,
he fucking thinking.

1040
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:06.960
It's like if they would just die,
just dial it back.
I can be a happy smiley,

1041
01:01:06.961 --> 01:01:10.620
not chirping marine land guy.
I don't have to be,
I don't have to do that.

1042
01:01:10.621 --> 01:01:14.880
I've done what I've had to,
to be where I am.
The man who was,

1043
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:18.300
who created this scenario is gone.
We don't need the hostilities anymore.

1044
01:01:18.301 --> 01:01:21.390
So what is the lawyers motives exactly.
I don't know,

1045
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:24.070
but I can assure you now that they've blacked out the fence.
They,

1046
01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.850
they're doing everything they can to suppress,
uh,
our information.

1047
01:01:26.851 --> 01:01:29.370
They've bought up all the billboards in,
uh,

1048
01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.410
all the available billboards in Niagara Falls,

1049
01:01:31.411 --> 01:01:33.690
so that they've got marine Marineland signs.
Because,
you know,

1050
01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:36.980
we have put up like as activist activist have put up billboards,
uh,

1051
01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:39.990
one of which was like right at the entrance of marine land last year was a thing

1052
01:01:39.991 --> 01:01:42.060
of beauty.
So they've,
you know,
they bought all these things up.

1053
01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:45.180
They really don't want bad PR right now.

1054
01:01:45.181 --> 01:01:47.760
My guess is trying to get rid of the animals,

1055
01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.650
mitigate the PR losses because there's already a sound foundation of it,

1056
01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:57.900
of bad PR and sell the property,
get rid of it all.
And I think,
you know,

1057
01:01:57.990 --> 01:02:00.450
they're trying to fast track and accreditation so that they can facilitate

1058
01:02:00.451 --> 01:02:02.910
animal,
uh,
movements and whatnot.

1059
01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:09.620
My greatest weapon right now unfortunately is that I can assure them a great

1060
01:02:10.171 --> 01:02:11.580
deal of,
uh,

1061
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.000
of financial risk I have and I certainly can and am right now.

1062
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.010
They need to take that into

1063
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:23.100
<v 1>consideration when you consider the price of a Walrus and let's just use the</v>

1064
01:02:23.101 --> 01:02:26.490
number of 100,000 which is a grossly inflated number for a Walrus.

1065
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.550
And let's say Marineland were to say hypothetically,
well,

1066
01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:33.150
why would we give you $100,000 asset when it's going to cost us less than that

1067
01:02:33.151 --> 01:02:36.100
just to finish this litigation and owe you a 25 k at the end of some shit?
Why?

1068
01:02:36.101 --> 01:02:38.970
Why would we do that?
Doesn't make sense.
And I say to them,

1069
01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:41.850
it's because I'm going to make that Walrus cost you tens of millions.

1070
01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:46.740
Consider that,
lose the hostilities.
I'll make you guys heroes.

1071
01:02:46.741 --> 01:02:50.340
We can do that too.
The narrative,
this narrative doesn't have to continue.

1072
01:02:50.341 --> 01:02:55.140
The narrative of war can end with the debt owner.
It could have ended,

1073
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:57.840
but,
well,
they're all invested in it.

1074
01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:00.990
And one of the things about lawsuits,

1075
01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:04.170
it's like people when they get it started,
there's a game going on.

1076
01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.530
You're trying to,
when you're trying to win,

1077
01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:07.590
trying to get the other side of the cave.
I mean,

1078
01:03:07.591 --> 01:03:09.120
this is a lot of what this is all.

1079
01:03:09.121 --> 01:03:12.960
And obviously you've taken this very personally,
this is all a part of,
you know,

1080
01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:16.860
can I explain something really messed up?
I now,

1081
01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.330
because we're coming to an end,
the,

1082
01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:24.960
the law that I've been advocating for is going to pass.
Um,

1083
01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:28.530
this lawsuit is going to end.
The animals will,
I mean,

1084
01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:30.540
we're gonna find out what's going to happen to them in,
in the,

1085
01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:34.740
in the near future.
We already know what's becoming of some,
um,

1086
01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.850
I don't know what it's going to be like to live without a lawsuit.

1087
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:40.740
Once the prospect has gotten nice,
Bro,

1088
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.480
you're going to be on the beach two feet up.

1089
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.660
When the prospect came round of me not having one anymore.

1090
01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:50.160
That's not how I saw it.
It's weird.
I'm oddly connected,

1091
01:03:50.161 --> 01:03:54.340
strangely addicted and married to a fucking lawsuit.
I can't,

1092
01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.940
you'll be fast.
It,
listen,
we'll get you through
more of that plant medicine.

1093
01:03:58.941 --> 01:04:01.440
It's like,
I look at that bag right there and says insane.
I'm like,
yeah,
no,

1094
01:04:01.441 --> 01:04:03.640
that's about right.
That's be real stuff.

1095
01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:07.080
That's stuff we'll put you on the planet that's outside Pluto that we haven't

1096
01:04:07.081 --> 01:04:10.680
discovered yet and I see you've got the Tyson ranch box.
Oh yeah,
man.

1097
01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:15.050
I got to Tyson ranch box.
He hooked me up and then that big box is from what?

1098
01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:18.870
What is the company that gave us the big box?
I was speed we'd that helped,

1099
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:23.610
but I think the extracts company Abx extracts or I'm not sure who,

1100
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:26.640
honestly,
don't know.
We shouldn't help the shout out that company.

1101
01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:30.090
Different things in there.
I had,
I was elbowed most all these box speed.
We,

1102
01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:34.200
they're the best and they're,
they're fucking,
they brought me a war chest,

1103
01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:38.130
so get in there.
I'm actually going to be on the Tyson's podcast tomorrow.

1104
01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:40.460
Are you Rianne Stoke?
I supposed to do.
It's amazing.

1105
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:42.240
I was kind of stoked and then it,
it,
it,

1106
01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.460
it got postponed to Thursday and I'm really like,

1107
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.440
in what world am I sitting down smoking a bunch of weed with Mike Tyson?
Well,

1108
01:04:49.441 --> 01:04:53.010
it's the one that was created on account to these crazy decisions that I've
made.

1109
01:04:53.011 --> 01:04:55.680
The fact alone that we've come together like this dude I'm talking with,

1110
01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:59.400
with Whitney,
who's,
you know,
she,
she says to you that I'm a hero now,

1111
01:04:59.401 --> 01:05:02.940
unless she's my fucking hero,
man.
Like I say it,

1112
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.360
that crazy lady drove all the way to Texas with a fucking pig.

1113
01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:09.360
She tried to like help this pig out that she found.

1114
01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:13.320
She Fed the pig and then drove all the way to Texas with it.

1115
01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:16.200
I love her level of crazy.
I think it's just fuck a perfect,

1116
01:05:16.201 --> 01:05:20.350
it fits exactly what this needs.
Uh,
and again,
I'm blessed that you,

1117
01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:23.500
that you sort of,
uh,
turned around to,
to me and I know she was,

1118
01:05:23.501 --> 01:05:25.990
she was looking to have a conversation with you,
um,

1119
01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:30.100
with regards to some legislation and with the dolphins and will kept him and

1120
01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:32.200
whatnot.
And you sort of steered or my direction.
Yeah.

1121
01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:35.980
Let me touch on the Dan Bilzerian think so is he coming here on in May?

1122
01:05:35.981 --> 01:05:39.850
Is that right?
Is on the podcast.
Not that I know.
Someone had said to me,
Oh,

1123
01:05:39.851 --> 01:05:42.880
I hear Dan Bilzerian gonna be talking before though.
Yeah.
And it was that he has,

1124
01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:43.960
I thought they was coming out soon.

1125
01:05:43.961 --> 01:05:48.460
That kind of made me nervous cause so why a couple of weeks ago?
Whitney's like,

1126
01:05:48.461 --> 01:05:50.590
just,
just drilling,
uh,

1127
01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:54.310
Dan Bilzerian on Instagram for having this polar bear.
Right.

1128
01:05:54.311 --> 01:05:56.980
There's video of a polar bear to fucking party and he's feeding it and she's

1129
01:05:56.981 --> 01:06:00.040
just,
she's a polar bear in a party.
I don't know,
it's like a big,

1130
01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:03.570
it was a big brown bear.
Like grizzly was big grizzly bear,
partly.
Yeah.
On,
uh,

1131
01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:06.640
you know,
electric fence around and everything else.
So she's Waze.

1132
01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:11.650
Probably one of his crazy house.
Yeah.
Oh,
Jesus.
Dan Bilzerian.

1133
01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:15.820
What the fuck,
Bro?
All my God,

1134
01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:20.830
he had a fucking brown bear at his house.
Look at the size of that thing.

1135
01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:25.420
Oh my God,
I'm getting anxiety.
Did he ever see the fucking,

1136
01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:28.130
what was the yeah,
the best they do.
Yeah.

1137
01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:31.540
The one where the bear rip the guy's throat apart and that was one of the movie

1138
01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:34.960
too,
wasn't it?
No,
the bear was in a movie.
The bear was in a football movie.

1139
01:06:34.961 --> 01:06:38.110
What was that movie?
Let's go along with it was a basketball.

1140
01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:41.110
I think he has been in a few movies,
but with the Will Ferrell,

1141
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:42.030
whether he's playing basketball,

1142
01:06:42.031 --> 01:06:45.310
you're like wrestled him in the middle of the basketball game.
Was that the bear?

1143
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:46.263
Yeah,
I think so.

1144
01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:50.920
Well there was a bear that had been in movies and had done stunted movies and

1145
01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:51.760
this guy,

1146
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:56.140
the video is awful because the guy is literally just standing there and the bear

1147
01:06:56.141 --> 01:07:00.400
just goes up to him and just decide to attack and rips his throat out like that

1148
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:03.230
in a second.
It's exactly that video minus the,

1149
01:07:03.231 --> 01:07:06.730
this can happen at a fricking time only.
You got 45 girls in the back,

1150
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:09.130
scantily clad basically could happen.

1151
01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.730
And what's really crazy is that that bear that killed that guy,

1152
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:14.800
they went back to training them.

1153
01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.320
They're not going to kill an animal that has value.

1154
01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:19.660
It's the same as the Orca that killed all the trainers.

1155
01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:21.740
Like they're not going to kill them.
It's just not going to happen.

1156
01:07:21.741 --> 01:07:23.860
But they were trying to like figure out whether or not he was going to do it

1157
01:07:23.861 --> 01:07:25.780
again.
Like Jesus Christ,

1158
01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.100
what do you have soothsayer how are you going to figure out what a bear's going

1159
01:07:29.101 --> 01:07:32.560
to do?
It's going to be a bare ass hole that's going to do the hair stuff.

1160
01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:35.530
The people that are bringing that are trying to have you interact with these

1161
01:07:35.531 --> 01:07:36.940
animals like that,
they're,
they're,
they're,

1162
01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:40.420
they're relying on the animal's shock factor,
the shock and awe.
You know,

1163
01:07:40.421 --> 01:07:43.090
they're bringing these animals in the close proximity to scare you.

1164
01:07:43.091 --> 01:07:46.960
It's like that's a fucked up thing,
man.
That's the bear right there.
Look at that.

1165
01:07:46.961 --> 01:07:51.550
See that throat apart.
So horrific.
So back to the Whitney thing.

1166
01:07:51.551 --> 01:07:53.880
So Whitney's just,
just harping on Danville's ended,

1167
01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:57.310
he's deleting the comments as quick as she's tossing them.
So I decided,
okay,

1168
01:07:57.311 --> 01:07:58.390
well I'm going to weigh in now.
Right?

1169
01:07:58.391 --> 01:08:01.590
So I throw a comment and then I forget about,
I turned the light,
go off,

1170
01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:04.550
do my thing,
and then that night I'm on the field to Frankel show,

1171
01:08:04.551 --> 01:08:05.111
not me personally,

1172
01:08:05.111 --> 01:08:08.200
but he actually takes the comment because they know it's got a lot of likes and

1173
01:08:08.201 --> 01:08:11.560
stuff.
I said something to the effect of,
uh,
you know,
that's an abused animal,

1174
01:08:11.561 --> 01:08:14.890
blah,
blah,
blah,
this and that,
said something,
you know,
smoke more weed.
Anyways,

1175
01:08:14.891 --> 01:08:17.900
they,
the comment up,
oh,
by the way,
the guy who handles the animal,
he was sort of,

1176
01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.270
he was using some legal,
uh,

1177
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:23.900
sort of jargon with me as if he'd maybe was talking about lawsuit.
And I said,

1178
01:08:23.901 --> 01:08:28.570
fuck it,
sue me.
Legal jargon.
We present to the defamatory.
Oh,

1179
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:31.720
because I said,
that's a starved,
abused a animal.
I mean,
I know how to,

1180
01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:35.210
I know in the history of wild animals,
when is a bear ever walked out?

1181
01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:37.160
And today I'm going to become fuck friends with someone today.
You know,

1182
01:08:37.161 --> 01:08:40.370
fuck this shit.
I'm going to be card them out when they're a little cubs,

1183
01:08:40.371 --> 01:08:44.570
you know that of course.
So they starve them.
They abuse them.
They have the,

1184
01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:48.800
I mean,
but my definition of low ses,
but do they have to do that to train them?

1185
01:08:48.801 --> 01:08:53.240
I know there are people who claim to love bears that trained bears to take care

1186
01:08:53.241 --> 01:08:57.140
of bears and I guarantee you they don't all do that.
It says big.
No,
no,

1187
01:08:57.290 --> 01:09:00.050
there's nothing fun about abusing a drug.
Starved animal.

1188
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.470
Delete this and you're pinched for animal exploitation.
Smoke more weed.

1189
01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:05.810
I don't smoke more weed.
Just like kind of help that.

1190
01:09:05.811 --> 01:09:09.260
But it wasn't a church though.
What do we uh,
filled the Franco said it was like,

1191
01:09:09.261 --> 01:09:11.840
I was like,
smoke more weed.
You fool.
I was just like,
no,
no.
Smoke more weed.

1192
01:09:11.841 --> 01:09:15.650
Like go inside one thing.
Okay,
got it.
Not True.
Yeah.

1193
01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:17.121
See,

1194
01:09:17.121 --> 01:09:21.830
I feel like there are people that have bears that raise them.

1195
01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.500
I'm not in any way,

1196
01:09:24.501 --> 01:09:28.310
shape or form endorsing keeping bears in captivity.

1197
01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:33.290
But what I see is people that have these sort of intimate relationships with

1198
01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:34.670
these really well fed bears,

1199
01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:38.440
they're big and happy and they feed them and get in the pool with them and it's,

1200
01:09:38.441 --> 01:09:39.590
it looks ridiculous,

1201
01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.620
but I don't think they're starving that bear and I don't think there abused in

1202
01:09:42.621 --> 01:09:44.600
that parent and I don't think you have to do that.

1203
01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:50.060
I don't think you can automatically assume that a bear is starved and abused.

1204
01:09:50.061 --> 01:09:53.540
So I assume the start part,
I certainly can't say,

1205
01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.290
but is there a big bear that was a fat bear?
Nice feeding it.

1206
01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:57.380
It might be hungry that day.

1207
01:09:57.381 --> 01:10:02.180
I mean that's born saying look at the body on the bear.
Oh big.
Not Well Fed bear.

1208
01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:05.340
You can have a well fed animal that's hungry for a week.
There's no question.

1209
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:08.300
But it's not likely that that thing start.

1210
01:10:08.301 --> 01:10:11.570
And my definition of abuse is there's an electric fence around that fucking

1211
01:10:11.571 --> 01:10:12.710
thing,
which is there.
Yeah.

1212
01:10:12.711 --> 01:10:17.690
You can see about the ankle at about ankle was a fucking electric fence at Dad's

1213
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:21.430
house.
Well,
I'm sure whoever comes back to that picture,
whatever installation,

1214
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:24.660
the the person who brought this thing does has to keep the animal within

1215
01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:29.240
confines of [inaudible].
It was just went on a model killing rampage.

1216
01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.350
They kind of,
that's an electric fence.
That's again an assumption I'll say,

1217
01:10:33.351 --> 01:10:36.170
but again,
I don't see how that wouldn't be.

1218
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:38.780
What the hell does that serve as a barrier?
It's just a trip line.

1219
01:10:38.781 --> 01:10:42.770
Otherwise for that.
So that's a welfare bear though,
son.

1220
01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:45.950
Look at that thing then mother fucker eats dead is a big ass.

1221
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:49.490
If you want to get an animal to do something,
if you want it to be docile,

1222
01:10:49.491 --> 01:10:50.910
you have to train it.
You have to sort of,
there's,

1223
01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:54.440
there's breaking the animal in many cases,
but I'll assure you Joe,

1224
01:10:54.441 --> 01:10:59.360
that food deprivation is,
is in training is your most effective tool.
It just is.

1225
01:10:59.361 --> 01:11:03.380
You can find a healthy balance,
right?
But food deprivation is,

1226
01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.470
we've talked to one,
you've talked about this particularly with Dolphin.

1227
01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:11.180
To be fair,
in my,
in my experience of wild animals,
it is with a marine mammals,

1228
01:11:11.181 --> 01:11:14.670
so not worked with bears.
There bears that marine land.
It's a really,

1229
01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:17.400
it's a disgusting display.
It's an archaic,

1230
01:11:17.401 --> 01:11:20.730
it looks like it's out of the 18 hundreds even.
I mean,

1231
01:11:20.731 --> 01:11:25.680
it really is a disgusting place.
Uh,
but the practice was to starve them.

1232
01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:28.080
And what people do there is they pay like,

1233
01:11:28.081 --> 01:11:29.640
I think it's a buck and they get like this,

1234
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:34.950
this little cup full of corn pops in youth.
The bears are like wave and yeah,

1235
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.410
historically there's been bears,
I mean he's got,

1236
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:40.350
they've got like 40 or 50 bears in this little confined space.

1237
01:11:40.351 --> 01:11:41.790
I mean there's nothing,
there's no more,

1238
01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:45.510
no greater abomination of nature then I can imagine than a solitary,

1239
01:11:45.511 --> 01:11:48.780
largely solitary animals are confined to a bunch of them of the speech.

1240
01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:53.850
And then historically they have ripped each other apart.
And Dude,
it's crazy.

1241
01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:57.720
I can actually delve into marine lands history deeper than I can.
Uh,

1242
01:11:57.810 --> 01:12:00.360
you get to hear the full spectrum of some of the things that happen in bear in

1243
01:12:00.361 --> 01:12:03.900
mind.
And it's important to note.
It was a different time,
different times,

1244
01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:06.210
different things happen.
And that's just,
that was the,
that was the,

1245
01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:11.100
that was the norm.
It's,
it's starkly contrasting time to when marina and started.

1246
01:12:11.101 --> 01:12:14.130
So,
but the stories are like really,
um,

1247
01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:17.970
it's jawdropping it's really jaw dropping stuff,
but

1248
01:12:20.210 --> 01:12:25.210
it on one hand when you have children and you bring a child to the zoo,

1249
01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:30.300
on one hand it's really fascinating to watch this little person look at all

1250
01:12:30.301 --> 01:12:35.070
these different animals and freak out and,
and,
and see how amazing it is.

1251
01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:40.820
But that's the only pro is introducing human beings,

1252
01:12:41.341 --> 01:12:43.680
like little human beings in particular to these animals.

1253
01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:48.890
Everything else is a con except for the animals that are like really endangered

1254
01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:51.990
and they protect them and help breed them.

1255
01:12:51.991 --> 01:12:55.620
And then sometimes they were responsible for some reintroduction efforts.

1256
01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:58.680
But other than that,
it's an animal prison man.
Weird.

1257
01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:00.720
I don't take the position or Idl,
I don't,

1258
01:13:00.721 --> 01:13:03.750
I'm not at this person that's trying to represent an ideology necessarily.

1259
01:13:03.751 --> 01:13:05.070
I'm not against all zoos,

1260
01:13:05.071 --> 01:13:09.270
but I have to say that there's nothing more sad than seeing elephants.
Cats,

1261
01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:12.840
bears.
I mean,
cats,
man,
the cats,
when they're pacing back and forth,
I mean,

1262
01:13:12.841 --> 01:13:16.440
just get him out of there.
Who Sir,
whose purpose are you serving?

1263
01:13:16.441 --> 01:13:19.920
Is that good for you?
I mean,
seeing an animal that's got zoo,
this,
I mean,
it's a,

1264
01:13:19.921 --> 01:13:20.580
it's,
it's,

1265
01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:23.700
it's a mental case and we don't know what the fuck's going on in their head.

1266
01:13:23.701 --> 01:13:24.620
So we have no idea.

1267
01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:27.330
Most people just think this is just maybe normal or something.
Right.

1268
01:13:27.331 --> 01:13:28.260
A lot of people were not.

1269
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:31.980
See because the veil is only now sort of coming off and people are started now

1270
01:13:31.981 --> 01:13:35.580
getting the truth,
uh,
on the matters.
You start to see things for what they are.

1271
01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:39.570
I watched the video on youtube some weeks ago and it was a marine land in the

1272
01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:43.640
70s and man was this place busy.
And the people were just,
I mean,
they were,

1273
01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:46.110
they were climbing over each other to be next to the pool.

1274
01:13:46.111 --> 01:13:48.030
I've never seen anything like,
I worked at 12 years.

1275
01:13:48.031 --> 01:13:50.640
I'd never seen the amount of people that this thing had.

1276
01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.290
And when you looked into pool,
there's a bowl Orca,
who's,

1277
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.760
he spans the literal length of the pool that he's in on the side with his dorsal

1278
01:13:59.551 --> 01:14:01.880
fin over and he's literally staring at the wall and not moving.

1279
01:14:01.881 --> 01:14:06.150
And then you got two other massive orchids that are in this pool like fuck,

1280
01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:08.190
maybe five times the size of this room kind of thing.

1281
01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:10.320
And people are celebrating like it's,
and the view,

1282
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:12.310
the video has like this sort of quirky music

1283
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:13.890
<v 2>and it's kind of funny and fun.
And I'm watching this going,</v>

1284
01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:16.690
what a disconnect of time.
Like where this,

1285
01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:20.520
you're looking at exactly what you see today in terms of the animals,

1286
01:14:20.521 --> 01:14:21.251
in the conditions that they're in.

1287
01:14:21.251 --> 01:14:24.560
And yet here are these people having knowing nothing about it.
Just in the,

1288
01:14:24.561 --> 01:14:27.510
of the beauty of the met,
the majesty of these animals at the majestic nature,

1289
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:28.270
these animals.

1290
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:33.270
And yet we couldn't see for ourselves whatsoever how abusive and gross this was.

1291
01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:38.710
It was really a weird and strange thing,
but that's um,

1292
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.470
marine lends a legacy business.
They built a,

1293
01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.120
they built themselves on a,

1294
01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.700
on having people come and experience the shock and awe of these animals.

1295
01:14:48.701 --> 01:14:53.050
And they did very,
very well.
Uh,
but that time is long gone now,

1296
01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:54.273
long gone.

1297
01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.720
<v 3>I think we're going to come to a time in the future where people think the same</v>

1298
01:14:57.721 --> 01:15:01.710
way about zoos.
I think it's uh,
we're just,
we're going to realize like,

1299
01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:05.280
I get that.
You want to see them?
I get it.
I get you want to see them.

1300
01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:10.020
I guess I lost.
I want to see them too,
but God damn,
we got to stop doing that.

1301
01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:12.740
Like this is no way also for the,

1302
01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:17.160
the problem is humans don't have any real experience with animals.

1303
01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:20.580
We have experience with dogs and cats,

1304
01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:25.740
which are these domesticated weird little fluffy friends.
They are not animals.

1305
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:29.160
We don't have much experience with real animals.

1306
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:32.880
And even the animals that you have experienced with their urbanized,
you know,

1307
01:15:32.881 --> 01:15:36.660
like pigeons that you can feed or squirrels that take peanuts from you.

1308
01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:42.380
He can't out into the world and the world of the wild of forests and mountains

1309
01:15:44.101 --> 01:15:47.940
and you,
you see actual real animals and it's almost psychedelic.

1310
01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:53.210
There's like a weird like paradigm shift that goes through when you see a wild

1311
01:15:53.881 --> 01:15:57.600
animal in the,
in the actual like,
oh,
this is where it's supposed to be.

1312
01:15:57.630 --> 01:15:59.920
It kind of feels weird because you're in their world.
You can be,

1313
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:05.180
<v 2>because now you're like,
oh,
what?
Because that,
the series of,
um,
of,
uh,</v>

1314
01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.460
of,
of,
of,
uh,

1315
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:11.080
tools that that animal has in its world that doesn't translate in,

1316
01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:13.190
in captivity for instance,
is like,
wait a second,

1317
01:16:13.191 --> 01:16:18.170
that thing can spring on me to climb of Ma.
Like,
like I'm in its world now.
To me,

1318
01:16:18.171 --> 01:16:22.490
that's the awe of the experience of witnessing animals because since the year

1319
01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:25.110
and a half that expired,
that,
that from our last show,
you know,

1320
01:16:25.190 --> 01:16:30.190
I had the blessing,
the gift of seeing,
uh,
dolphins in the wild.
I went down to,
um,

1321
01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.000
I can't remember what Beto was,

1322
01:16:32.001 --> 01:16:34.880
but it was while I was in California and that was my first experience.
In fact,

1323
01:16:34.881 --> 01:16:35.091
again,

1324
01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:38.630
I'm from a small place and then this year I was able to go to Washington state

1325
01:16:38.631 --> 01:16:39.770
and see orcas in the wild.

1326
01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:44.630
Now I've jumped off Orkos rostrums into the air so high that you're looking down

1327
01:16:44.631 --> 01:16:46.970
into Dixie Cup to land.
I mean,
that's pretty awesome,

1328
01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:52.090
but there's nothing like having seen fucking bull Orca with an eight foot mass

1329
01:16:53.481 --> 01:16:56.540
on his back,
swimming next to his mother and all.
I've never,

1330
01:16:56.541 --> 01:17:01.530
my heart sunk into my stomach.
I'd never seen anything more majestic.
Wow.

1331
01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:04.100
Wow.
Yeah.

1332
01:17:04.490 --> 01:17:07.730
<v 3>Do you know anything about what's going on in the Pacific northwest where</v>

1333
01:17:07.731 --> 01:17:10.430
there's a pot of orchids exists primarily

1334
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:14.870
<v 1>on Chinook salmon and they're starving.
So that's the,
so in fact it's important.</v>

1335
01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:19.280
I'm glad you mentioned that because just a yesterday and today,
um,

1336
01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:23.300
a bunch of different protections are being announced for the southern resident

1337
01:17:23.301 --> 01:17:26.690
killer whales,
which are,
uh,
in the sailor's sea.

1338
01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:29.840
So it's going to impede sort of vessel,
uh,
you know,
they're,

1339
01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:32.000
they're really focusing on doing what they can.

1340
01:17:32.150 --> 01:17:35.270
What's happening there is they've got the Snake River dam system that needs to

1341
01:17:35.271 --> 01:17:38.750
be,
what happened is they put this system in and the Chinook are just dying.

1342
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:42.140
They can't get through.
The flow has gone.
So they put the system in a long time,

1343
01:17:42.141 --> 01:17:42.801
a long time ago.

1344
01:17:42.801 --> 01:17:45.400
So it's virtually over time has been decimating these populations.

1345
01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:46.251
No one really knew why,

1346
01:17:46.251 --> 01:17:48.790
but we're at the point now that we know that these orchids exclusively each

1347
01:17:48.791 --> 01:17:51.680
Chinook and there's just not enough.
And whereas they used to be massive ones.

1348
01:17:51.681 --> 01:17:55.650
Now they've got these little tiny ones and you know,
there was,
uh,
the,
the,

1349
01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:59.580
the plight of the southern resident killer whales is really,
I'm glad that it,

1350
01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.120
it's got getting global attention.
Um,

1351
01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:05.510
I'm sure you're familiar with the mother who lost his calf and mourned for an

1352
01:18:05.511 --> 01:18:09.170
excess of like 40 days and carried around on her head in the type of vigil.

1353
01:18:09.171 --> 01:18:10.160
I mean,
this was,
uh,

1354
01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:14.870
this captivated the world and you can't look at an animal capable of such

1355
01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.300
suffering,
uh,

1356
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:21.770
without being acutely aware of the damage you're doing when you separate them

1357
01:18:21.771 --> 01:18:24.620
from their family,
the natural environment.
Let me explain the difference.

1358
01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:29.600
When bears see their cubs dead,
they eat them.
Yeah.

1359
01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.790
That's a difference.
Yeah.
This is the,

1360
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:34.910
you're talking about something that's insanely emotional.

1361
01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:36.500
It's a different kind of animal.

1362
01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:40.280
And that's the thing that we're learning is the most notable aspect of these

1363
01:18:40.281 --> 01:18:44.300
animals is there.
So is there a emotional,
uh,
intelligence and capacity?

1364
01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:46.400
I'm afraid of what it is,

1365
01:18:46.401 --> 01:18:50.180
the depth of which we're going to find out that they're capable of a,
of bond.

1366
01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:54.020
Because particularly if there's ever some sort of a way of translating

1367
01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:54.830
communication,

1368
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:59.810
if they figure out a way of breaking down those sounds and expressions into

1369
01:18:59.811 --> 01:19:02.510
something that we can decipher,
we right now they don't,

1370
01:19:02.511 --> 01:19:03.830
I don't think they know much.

1371
01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:08.330
I've been underwater with orcas and dolphins and I've heard them,
uh,
you know,

1372
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.150
I've heard,
forget,
I can't even tell you the sounds,

1373
01:19:11.151 --> 01:19:14.870
I mean they've got a wide array of sounds,

1374
01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:19.160
but you know,
I could,
you know,
to,
to,
to,

1375
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:20.450
to the best of my abilities.

1376
01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:23.960
I could tell you when an animal was excited based on their sounds,

1377
01:19:23.961 --> 01:19:28.220
they were making like one when our Orca Neosho was pushing me underwater to do a

1378
01:19:28.221 --> 01:19:28.821
rocket ride,

1379
01:19:28.821 --> 01:19:31.910
which is when you jump off into the air and you do this big majestic jump,

1380
01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:33.890
you knew it was going to be a good one.

1381
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:37.520
When she let out this squawk at the bottom of the pool before pumping her tail

1382
01:19:37.521 --> 01:19:40.520
and lots,
you just knew it,
man.
This she was on,

1383
01:19:40.521 --> 01:19:42.350
she was on fire and then there's other times that you just,

1384
01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.190
you just knew she wasn't into it and I could just,

1385
01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:48.200
I could know by the sounds you can really determine underwater sound alone.

1386
01:19:48.201 --> 01:19:50.990
You could really get to know your animal.
Again,
I was there 12 years.
I mean,

1387
01:19:50.991 --> 01:19:54.080
I really get to experience a lot of things other people can never really truly

1388
01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:55.710
understand,
which is really why it's important.

1389
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:59.270
Really important that I'm able to speak to these things because I mean even when

1390
01:19:59.271 --> 01:20:01.010
it comes to the legislation that is passing,

1391
01:20:01.690 --> 01:20:04.400
I mean I've had my name mentioned in the House of Commons.
I mean,

1392
01:20:04.401 --> 01:20:07.320
this is a national stage.
I had mentioned in the Senate,
I mean,

1393
01:20:11.150 --> 01:20:15.240
some people care about what is coming up just yet,
just a few days ago.
And uh,

1394
01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:19.830
a Niagara MP.
Um,
actually this would be a great video if you could,

1395
01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:21.480
if you could pull it up,
it'll be on my Twitter.

1396
01:20:21.481 --> 01:20:24.120
It's one of the things I retweeted with the MP,
the local MP.
He,

1397
01:20:24.210 --> 01:20:27.900
he bashes Marineland.
I mean,
that is a thing of absolute beauty.

1398
01:20:29.490 --> 01:20:34.260
I'm glad that I'm able to talk and explain to people what it is that my

1399
01:20:34.261 --> 01:20:36.270
experience has shown me and the things that I know.

1400
01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:40.170
Because if people know they'll do better

1401
01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:45.690
problem with the videos.
If we play,
that video gets claimed.
Oh really?

1402
01:20:45.691 --> 01:20:48.660
It's a House of Commons,
a video.
It's public and government thing.

1403
01:20:48.661 --> 01:20:52.260
Those usually are okay,
but I don't know if it's from,
is it from a new soul?

1404
01:20:52.261 --> 01:20:56.610
But you know what a,
the ad,
the group that put it up because they a,
okay,

1405
01:20:56.611 --> 01:20:58.660
sorry about that little guy.
If you go to my Twitter and you check it,

1406
01:20:59.130 --> 01:21:00.390
it's something to marvel is beautiful.

1407
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:03.150
You have to be really careful with how I understand you've had a shit load of

1408
01:21:03.151 --> 01:21:06.500
problems.
Uh,
Niagara Region,

1409
01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:10.020
I can assure you this marine animal justice will have no problem with you doing

1410
01:21:10.021 --> 01:21:12.430
this.
I'm good friends with Kim allowed chuck.

1411
01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.180
We'll just tell people how to get to it,
but put that back up so I can read that.

1412
01:21:15.181 --> 01:21:17.700
Sorry.
Um,
it says,
um,

1413
01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:22.610
marine land and unfortunate in place with horrible conditions.
Okay.
Yeah.
He's a,

1414
01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:26.290
I mean this is a member of parliament.
This is a on the net on this is the,

1415
01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.380
this is the big stage right here.
And he's finally,

1416
01:21:28.381 --> 01:21:31.860
and it took a long time for people,
anyone in,
in,
in the,
in,

1417
01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:35.730
in public policy to ever weighed into this subject.

1418
01:21:35.731 --> 01:21:38.640
And now we've got people outright saying like this place as a whole.
I mean,
wow.

1419
01:21:38.641 --> 01:21:41.640
What,
what,
how far we've come in the last six and a half years,

1420
01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:45.540
the world's changing my friend,
very changing whether people like it or not.

1421
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:49.740
And this is one that I think it's,

1422
01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:55.560
it's unavoidable.
This discussion in this resolution,
this,
this has to be,

1423
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:59.340
we have to come to grips with what that is.
It's just,

1424
01:22:00.690 --> 01:22:04.470
it's just all kinds of wrong man.
It's all kinds of wrong.
And,
um,

1425
01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:09.800
the fact that they're still suing you after all these fucking years as if they

1426
01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:11.970
think it's working as if it's serving them.
Any purpose.

1427
01:22:12.090 --> 01:22:15.120
Here I am again on the fucking jre.
Like,
are you kidding me dude?

1428
01:22:15.121 --> 01:22:17.100
You don't even know the favor you're doing me.

1429
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:22.350
You don't even know what you've done.
Like,
come on.
What?
Like,
uh,

1430
01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:24.990
what,
what,
what are you,
what do you want to accomplish?

1431
01:22:24.991 --> 01:22:27.600
What have you failed in accomplishing what you think you're going to accomplish

1432
01:22:27.601 --> 01:22:31.800
by kin?
Like continuing.
And Jamie is the virtual death definition of insanity.

1433
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:35.400
It's not a good move.
Jamie,
who was it?
That was on the podcast?

1434
01:22:35.401 --> 01:22:37.740
So it was explaining the,
um,

1435
01:22:38.130 --> 01:22:42.510
the processes in place of reintroduction into the wild.

1436
01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:46.560
They were going to have stages in nets and stuff like that and these big outdoor

1437
01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:51.180
areas where they can transmit dolphins and orchids to who was that?

1438
01:22:51.181 --> 01:22:55.740
Do you remember?
Too many God damn conversation that me wasn't you.

1439
01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:58.980
We talked,
we spoke of the whale sanctuary project.
I mean that would be the,

1440
01:22:59.130 --> 01:23:03.420
I mean that's essentially the basis of it.
And the goal is that maybe it was you,

1441
01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:07.180
was it discussing how there's places where they're going to have like

1442
01:23:07.190 --> 01:23:11.290
intermediate steps?
Absolutely.
So much.
Amen.
Maybe,
maybe you guys,
uh,

1443
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:14.710
expanded on it with someone else,
but know that is the basis of this project is,

1444
01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:18.340
and a,
I mean the good news is,
uh,
the whale sanctuary project.
I mean,

1445
01:23:18.341 --> 01:23:21.630
this thing is gonna happen.
It is the future.
They're there,
they're there.

1446
01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:25.300
They're well into the process of finding a site.

1447
01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:29.860
Considerations are being made for a Washington state's,
a site of Vancouver site,

1448
01:23:29.861 --> 01:23:32.230
but it appears as though they're settled on maybe Nova Scotia,

1449
01:23:32.231 --> 01:23:35.680
the community there at largest looking to work with them.
That's a wonderful,

1450
01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:39.400
that's wonderful news.
And I'll tell you something,
Joe.

1451
01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:44.230
Once this law gets royal,
ascension becomes law.

1452
01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:49.060
What happens is marine land is not able to export the animals unless the

1453
01:23:49.061 --> 01:23:50.640
minister of the Dfo,

1454
01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:54.820
the Department of fisheries and oceans concurs that it's in the animal's best

1455
01:23:54.821 --> 01:23:56.530
interest.
Well,

1456
01:23:57.370 --> 01:24:01.840
if such a site exists and marine land is keen on getting rid of their animals,

1457
01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.160
we'll have a place for them.

1458
01:24:04.570 --> 01:24:08.950
I told you last time I was here that my dream is to save whales.

1459
01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:14.830
This might happen.
Additionally,

1460
01:24:14.831 --> 01:24:19.600
if there's a real concerted effort of real effort to rescue those animals in

1461
01:24:19.601 --> 01:24:22.420
Russia,
I may very well be a part of that team.

1462
01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:25.870
So we're six and a half years ago I was talking about,

1463
01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:30.700
I was speaking of a crazy dream where there was no blueprint,

1464
01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:32.650
there was no foundation.
I just,

1465
01:24:32.651 --> 01:24:35.050
I'd sort of threw myself into the universe and said,

1466
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:40.080
I'm just going to hang my hat on a dream I'm watching in real time as it's

1467
01:24:40.271 --> 01:24:44.920
materializing.
That's a hell of a perspective.
Humbling.

1468
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:46.743
That is amazing.

1469
01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:51.490
This thing that we were talking about with the Pacific Northwest,
um,
there are,

1470
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.420
it's the resident population that has an issue because they only knew each and

1471
01:24:55.421 --> 01:24:56.254
oak salmon.

1472
01:24:56.260 --> 01:25:01.260
But then there isn't there a another pod that comes through.

1473
01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:03.940
There's transients and they're thriving because they eat everything.

1474
01:25:03.941 --> 01:25:05.170
The transients are there.

1475
01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.800
They're giving birth to doing quite wealthy marine animals.

1476
01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:11.650
They eat marine animals.
It's correct.
The hills and stuff.
When I was there,

1477
01:25:11.651 --> 01:25:15.490
the guy that was with us literally said,
can you smell that?
I'm like,
no.

1478
01:25:15.491 --> 01:25:18.520
What is that smell?
That sort of oily,
weird.
She's like,

1479
01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:23.540
a seal is getting eaten somewhere.
Next thing we know,
we saw the activity,

1480
01:25:23.541 --> 01:25:25.900
you know,
the dorsals and everything and yeah,
sure as shit,

1481
01:25:25.901 --> 01:25:29.560
there's a part of a certain smile she could smell that uh,

1482
01:25:29.561 --> 01:25:30.660
that the seal was being used.

1483
01:25:30.661 --> 01:25:34.840
Why can't they teach these smart whales to fucking eat what their friends are

1484
01:25:34.841 --> 01:25:39.580
eating?
Why are they have to be rude?
It's like they won't eat Chinese food.

1485
01:25:39.610 --> 01:25:44.050
Fuck Chinese food or starving to death.
No,
I want a burger.
It's a rare occasion,

1486
01:25:44.051 --> 01:25:47.200
but there's something called a super pod where it's actually a congregation of

1487
01:25:47.201 --> 01:25:51.100
all the difference,
uh,
uh,
families of orchestra into this,

1488
01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:54.690
into this event where they all think they congregate and it's a big social
event.

1489
01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:58.930
And there's a conference that happens every two years in Washington state called

1490
01:25:58.931 --> 01:26:01.780
Super Pod,
which is organized by a good friend of mine,
Jeff Venture.
It's a,

1491
01:26:01.781 --> 01:26:04.610
it's an amazing event.
I look to being there again,
it's speaking,

1492
01:26:04.611 --> 01:26:07.040
I got to get to another place for me to speak and,

1493
01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.850
and Roma boat with experts and whatnot and learned a great deal of things.
But,

1494
01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:12.530
um,
I was,

1495
01:26:12.531 --> 01:26:15.650
we were on the cusp of that almost happening because the boats are radioing to

1496
01:26:15.651 --> 01:26:17.760
each other.
Like,
okay,
well we've got family going this,
we've got a family go,

1497
01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:21.080
this is like,
wait a sec,
there's three families going in the same,
same direction.

1498
01:26:21.081 --> 01:26:25.670
It's like there's gunna be a crossing of paths and this is where the boulders

1499
01:26:25.671 --> 01:26:30.530
get real excited about the prospect of a super POTUS sorts or conflict.

1500
01:26:30.531 --> 01:26:32.900
Or they have conflict.
They fight.
It could be,
but I mean,

1501
01:26:32.901 --> 01:26:35.590
for the most part it's verbal.
They just tell you like,
stay away from me.

1502
01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.090
Fuck you.

1503
01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:42.440
I imagine their messages are quite clear and you've got a 15,000 pound bull male

1504
01:26:42.441 --> 01:26:45.710
Orca giving you the bird.
Yeah.
You're going to listen.
Fuck.
Yeah.

1505
01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:48.180
Especially a trans.
He holds man.
Oh yeah.

1506
01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:50.630
When you see their mouths wide open and see their teeth,
you're like,

1507
01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:54.770
what the fuck are you,
why?

1508
01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:57.920
Why don't they start eating mammals?

1509
01:26:57.921 --> 01:27:01.790
And I wonder if anybody's ever studied the difference in the behavior between

1510
01:27:01.791 --> 01:27:03.170
the transient ponds at eat,

1511
01:27:03.171 --> 01:27:07.490
the marine mammals versus the behavior of the ones that only exist on salmon.

1512
01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.630
Like maybe they have a different,
maybe they're like,
you know,
like Avatar.

1513
01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:14.390
Like there was different,
different kinds of people up there.
Mike,

1514
01:27:14.391 --> 01:27:18.620
go to my go to source is Ingrid Visser.
She is a top,

1515
01:27:18.621 --> 01:27:21.360
she's the woman in New Zealand that swims with the rescues or cause,

1516
01:27:21.361 --> 01:27:23.760
I mean she is a top,
the uh,
the,

1517
01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:28.220
the really the global spectrum of wild orchids,
uh,
uh,
scientists.

1518
01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:29.660
She'd be the one to talk to you about that.
I mean,

1519
01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:32.060
you want to talk about a fascinating person to talk to.
Holy Shit.

1520
01:27:32.061 --> 01:27:34.010
The wealth of knowledge she has and she is a,

1521
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.940
she's a very passionate advocate and I'm very proud.
I've done some very,

1522
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:42.680
very good work with her.
So I'd love to talk to her to have her on the show.

1523
01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:46.110
I would love to talk to her.
I'm so curious about those things.
Oh,
I,

1524
01:27:46.130 --> 01:27:49.250
she would blow your mind.
No.
Well,
if there was a difference,

1525
01:27:49.251 --> 01:27:52.040
if it at all and behavior,
if you were to invite her on the podcast,

1526
01:27:52.041 --> 01:27:54.110
she would get on the next flight from New Zealand and come here.

1527
01:27:54.111 --> 01:27:56.920
I can assure you that.
So does everybody interested in the proposal?

1528
01:27:57.050 --> 01:28:00.170
I actually don't.
I like being home.
Fuck you.
Tell you what I think she,

1529
01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:04.040
I think she may have had done the total universe.
Maybe she told me that.
Yeah.
Um,

1530
01:28:04.110 --> 01:28:06.620
uh,
they're amazing animals.
I always said that.

1531
01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:10.910
I mean this is coming from a self admitted big foot dork.

1532
01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:13.840
I'm a big foot dork.
I really wished bigfoot was a real thing.

1533
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:17.480
But if big foot was real thing,
it wouldn't be nearly as cool as an orchid.
No.

1534
01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:18.400
Like if,

1535
01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:23.210
if we found some big stupid stinky aids has been hiding from people forever and

1536
01:28:23.211 --> 01:28:27.560
be like,
wow,
that's cool.
But is isn't much cooler than a chimp or a gorilla.
What?

1537
01:28:27.561 --> 01:28:31.400
Just cause it's bigger.
Now what an Orca is,
is really cool.

1538
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:34.760
That is a super intelligent,
super killer that eats sharks,

1539
01:28:34.761 --> 01:28:38.130
death killing machine that they'll eat that,
that has great whites turn,

1540
01:28:38.131 --> 01:28:42.650
tucking tail and running.
Fuck up a great white shark like it has no business,

1541
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:45.650
no business being in the ocean or the perfect weapon in their world.

1542
01:28:45.650 --> 01:28:48.650
I mean there's nothing that touches them.
They're literally at zero risk.

1543
01:28:48.651 --> 01:28:49.461
They have no predators.

1544
01:28:49.461 --> 01:28:52.370
I mean they're just too damn strong and too damn smart and coordinated.

1545
01:28:52.450 --> 01:28:54.650
They do their kills as teams.
I mean,

1546
01:28:54.710 --> 01:28:56.210
you're literally up against an army out there.

1547
01:28:56.211 --> 01:29:01.211
Try to be a 500 pound Celia and that would be a big seal army of 13,000 pound

1548
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:02.650
killer whales who has a,

1549
01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:05.760
who sort of enjoy playing with you a little bit before you die.

1550
01:29:05.761 --> 01:29:08.670
I mean it's all interpreters play,
but more often than not it's training.

1551
01:29:08.671 --> 01:29:11.520
They lit the young ones and hunt and kill and stuff.
It can be a brutal thing.

1552
01:29:11.521 --> 01:29:12.030
I mean,

1553
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:15.630
I don't love watching it personally because know I've worked with seals as well.

1554
01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:20.000
Yeah,
I mean it's,
I take team Orca all day.
Yeah,
me too.

1555
01:29:20.370 --> 01:29:21.840
You're not getting,
you're not getting great odds,

1556
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:25.320
but put the hosts on it and you'll,
you'll get some returns.
Every time.

1557
01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:30.000
Amazing videos I ever saw was an Orca with a beach seal,
the seal.

1558
01:29:30.001 --> 01:29:33.690
He had bitten it and toss it through the air and the CEILIDH made its way to the

1559
01:29:33.691 --> 01:29:37.620
shore and it was actually on the land just with a little bit of water.

1560
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:42.950
And the ORCA beached itself grabbed a hold of seal and just start smashing it in

1561
01:29:43.831 --> 01:29:44.551
the water there.

1562
01:29:44.551 --> 01:29:49.200
And you see the water just flood red with blood and then it hops back and

1563
01:29:49.201 --> 01:29:53.700
wiggles itself back in the water and swims away.
You're like,
holy fuck crazy.

1564
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:57.810
Holy Fuck.
These things were beached themselves,

1565
01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:02.130
I think is 15,000 pounds.
So that is now.

1566
01:30:02.131 --> 01:30:05.430
Do they ever get stuck?
Yeah,
they do.
They do in New Zealand.
In fact,

1567
01:30:05.431 --> 01:30:09.480
that's where it,
Ingrid's work is,
uh,
is really special that she's,
dude,

1568
01:30:09.481 --> 01:30:13.200
this is a crazy story.
I have a friend that I grew up with,
uh,
Matt Harrison.

1569
01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:17.300
He went onto the to be,
I'm real involved in the army's,

1570
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:20.820
they decades into the army now.
He was on a training mission in New Zealand.

1571
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:24.270
They were doing this training on a beach and didn't they get called to go

1572
01:30:24.450 --> 01:30:26.880
perform an Orca rescues?
Just like,
oh,
what's now?

1573
01:30:26.881 --> 01:30:28.680
He's running and now they've got shovels.

1574
01:30:28.681 --> 01:30:31.650
They're trying to figure this thing out.
And now Ingrid shows up as the,
you know,

1575
01:30:31.651 --> 01:30:34.020
that's,
she's the person to call.
And now there's a photograph.

1576
01:30:34.021 --> 01:30:37.430
I'm waking up in the morning to a photograph of Ingrid at this end of an orchid.

1577
01:30:37.431 --> 01:30:39.930
And my friend Matt Harris from the same place as me,

1578
01:30:39.931 --> 01:30:42.570
a little town of welding at the other end of the Orca.
And I'm like,

1579
01:30:42.571 --> 01:30:43.950
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

1580
01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:48.300
And I got to reunite the two of them back in Niagara Falls in the summer because

1581
01:30:48.301 --> 01:30:51.290
Ingrid had come down again.
And I'm like,
it's,

1582
01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:54.740
these are blessings that I couldn't have even ever imagined.
And yet here he was.

1583
01:30:54.741 --> 01:30:56.970
And you know,
and he'd be the first to tell you when he came back,

1584
01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:00.330
it changed his world.
It changed them.
Never again.
Marineland done.

1585
01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:03.000
Whereas before it might've been,
you know,
it wasn't necessarily the case.

1586
01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:05.850
He was part of this rescue.
He's changed man.
Like he's just,
I mean,

1587
01:31:05.851 --> 01:31:07.980
now he's fascinated with work as like,
you can't imagine he,
he,

1588
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:12.510
he got the bug now.
That's amazing.
Um,
listen,

1589
01:31:12.511 --> 01:31:17.010
is there anything else?
Probably a million things,
but no,
no,
we're done.
For sure.

1590
01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:19.200
I,
uh,
I'd like to give a couple of shout outs.
Let's see.

1591
01:31:19.201 --> 01:31:23.010
Just to give you a shout out to the Kanye West marine mammals.

1592
01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:26.070
What'd they call you?
The Kanye west of Lonnie west of animal trainer.
Oh,

1593
01:31:26.071 --> 01:31:30.220
there you go.
Absurd.
So a animal justice Canada.
I got to do a shout out to,
uh,

1594
01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:33.550
Camille,
who's a next level.
They're calling you the conduit.
[inaudible].

1595
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:38.400
That's it from November.
Wow,
bro.
2013.
That started at all,
man.

1596
01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:40.680
I say,
wait,
they're calling you the con.
Wow.

1597
01:31:40.681 --> 01:31:44.460
The Connie was a Wall Street firm has to defend himself against one point $5

1598
01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:48.540

Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Showed up,
man.

1599
01:31:48.541 --> 01:31:51.240
It's been an honor to be your friend.
Oh Dude.
You've,
you've,

1600
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:54.870
you've changed the landscape of all of this by the way.
I know you don't look,

1601
01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:58.200
I get it.
I can do this all day.
The first shout out is to you,

1602
01:31:58.201 --> 01:32:00.310
the last ones to you,
the one in the middle's to every one of them.

1603
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:02.140
Like you've changed my world personally,

1604
01:32:02.141 --> 01:32:04.690
but you've really changed the landscape of this entire thing.
Uh,

1605
01:32:04.691 --> 01:32:06.010
Whitney said at best today,
she goes,
you know,

1606
01:32:06.011 --> 01:32:08.920
Joe really is the guy to move the needle on this thing.
And I'm like,

1607
01:32:08.921 --> 01:32:10.670
you damn right.
So like a couple of fucks,

1608
01:32:10.671 --> 01:32:13.180
see worlds out there as often as you can and just,
you know,

1609
01:32:13.181 --> 01:32:14.680
keep this stuff up because you,
you,

1610
01:32:14.681 --> 01:32:18.550
you've had a heavy hand in all of this along with,
for instance,
senator,

1611
01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:20.710
Senator Wilfred,
Wilfred Moore,

1612
01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:25.150
who was the person who a tabled this piece of legislation,
Murray Sinclair,
uh,

1613
01:32:25.151 --> 01:32:29.290
I gotta extend a thanks to um,
um,

1614
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:31.530
to the leader of the Green party,
Elizabeth May,
who's,

1615
01:32:31.531 --> 01:32:35.290
who's really taken this thing.
It's her baby and process this thing through.

1616
01:32:35.770 --> 01:32:39.530
And uh,
yeah,
if you didn't hear me,
shout out your name.
Sorry.
Okay.

1617
01:32:39.610 --> 01:32:43.090
<v 3>Do it forever.
It's a,</v>

1618
01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:48.100
there's some very satisfying things about having a podcast and one of the really

1619
01:32:48.401 --> 01:32:53.401
satisfying things is being able to let people know about something that for them

1620
01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:57.790
is very important.
Like there's many people that are listening to this,

1621
01:32:57.850 --> 01:32:58.990
as many people that are hearing this,

1622
01:32:58.991 --> 01:33:02.680
that are trying to understand with your busy life,

1623
01:33:02.681 --> 01:33:06.840
with your bills and your relationships and your work and you're,

1624
01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:11.410
you're also living in a world where something is happening that most likely

1625
01:33:11.411 --> 01:33:16.411
would be thought of as a horrendous act in just a decade or two decades,

1626
01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.420
and then we're going to be looking back saying,

1627
01:33:19.421 --> 01:33:22.540
how the fuck did we let this slide?
How did we do this?

1628
01:33:22.810 --> 01:33:26.230
And I think guys like you,
if it's not for your sacrifice,

1629
01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:31.980
many millions of people don't understand this as well and that's real.

1630
01:33:32.170 --> 01:33:35.740
That's you.
That's 100% you,
your sacrifice,

1631
01:33:35.770 --> 01:33:40.660
your ability to describe it so eloquently and your courage to keep fighting

1632
01:33:40.661 --> 01:33:45.070
this.
This is very important.
I haven't put it to the human race.

1633
01:33:45.071 --> 01:33:48.570
I've had faith through and through and it's right.
It's not failed me.
Listen to,

1634
01:33:48.571 --> 01:33:50.770
you're right,
you're right.
When it comes to this.
You're right.

1635
01:33:50.771 --> 01:33:55.090
When it comes to animal,
these marine animals that are super intelligent,

1636
01:33:55.091 --> 01:33:58.630
being stuck in swimming pools,
it's fucked up.
It's gotta stop.

1637
01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.180
It's gotta stop while we understand what it is.

1638
01:34:01.181 --> 01:34:06.130
You can't keep your head in the sand with this.
This is,
this is madness.

1639
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:11.550
This is a terrible,
terrible thing and we need to stop it.
Well,

1640
01:34:11.630 --> 01:34:15.880
as much as I've had a hand in it.
Uh,
thank you,
Joe.
My pleasure.
Listen.
Thank you.

1641
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:19.570
Um,
while we're Swissper on Twitter,

1642
01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:21.410
<v 1>Instagram,
yeah,
I'm just learning to Instagram,</v>

1643
