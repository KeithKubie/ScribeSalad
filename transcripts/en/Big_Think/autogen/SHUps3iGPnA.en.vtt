there's on the one hand exhilaration
 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.509
there's on the one hand exhilaration
over the progress and we have to

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519
over the progress and we have to
 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.550
over the progress and we have to
acknowledge how much progress has been

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560
acknowledge how much progress has been
 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.110
acknowledge how much progress has been
made but in the other hand I think

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120
made but in the other hand I think
