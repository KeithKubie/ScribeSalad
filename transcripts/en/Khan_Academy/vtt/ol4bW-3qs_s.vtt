00:00:00.964 --> 00:00:02.207
- [Voiceover] So part c.

00:00:02.207 --> 00:00:05.039
Find the x-coordinates of
all points of inflection

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:06.827
for the graph of f.

00:00:06.827 --> 00:00:09.138
Give a reason for your answer.

00:00:09.138 --> 00:00:11.204
So points of inflection,

00:00:11.204 --> 00:00:13.585
points of inflection

00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:17.716
happen

00:00:18.844 --> 00:00:22.474
when we go

00:00:22.474 --> 00:00:25.949
from concave upwards,

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.552
concave upwards

00:00:29.552 --> 00:00:34.552
to downwards

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:39.415
or vice versa.

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:43.396
So this is true if and only if

00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:46.116
f prime prime of x

00:00:46.116 --> 00:00:50.954
goes from

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:54.870
positive

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.680
to negative

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.577
or vice versa.

00:01:02.577 --> 00:01:05.271
So where do we see f prime prime of x

00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:07.676
going from positive to negative?

00:01:07.676 --> 00:01:11.531
Well that's going to
be true if and only if

00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:14.677
f prime of x goes from

00:01:14.677 --> 00:01:17.870
being increasing to
decreasing or vice versa.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.517
F prime goes

00:01:20.517 --> 00:01:25.517
from increasing

00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:30.513
to decreasing

00:01:30.513 --> 00:01:32.394
or vice versa.

00:01:32.394 --> 00:01:34.646
We're seeing a lot of vice versa here.

00:01:34.646 --> 00:01:36.393
So now let's, and I
want you to think of it

00:01:36.393 --> 00:01:39.319
in terms of f prime because
we have the graph of f prime.

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.442
So f prime goes from
increasing to decreasing

00:01:42.442 --> 00:01:45.786
or vice versa or we could go
from decreasing to increasing.

00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:46.796
Let's think about it.

00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:50.836
Let's see, over here, f prime is

00:01:50.836 --> 00:01:54.598
decreasing, decreasing,
decreasing, decreasing

00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:56.223
and then it increases.

00:01:56.223 --> 00:01:59.102
So we have a point of inflection
right over here, right?

00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:01.634
When f prime of x is zero.

00:02:02.844 --> 00:02:04.366
That's because a prime is differentiable

00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:06.432
so the derivative is definitely,

00:02:06.432 --> 00:02:08.929
the derivative is zero right at that point

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.171
of inflection right over here.

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:12.872
So with that happens at
x equals negative one.

00:02:12.872 --> 00:02:16.583
And over here, then f
prime starts increasing

00:02:16.583 --> 00:02:18.057
but then right at x equals one

00:02:18.057 --> 00:02:19.915
then it starts decreasing.

00:02:19.915 --> 00:02:23.212
So at x equals one, we have
another point of inflection.

00:02:23.212 --> 00:02:26.359
That's where we have that zero,

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.979
that zero of tangent line with slope zero.

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:32.419
And then we're decreasing, decreasing,

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.577
decreasing, decreasing,
decreasing, increasing.

00:02:35.577 --> 00:02:36.995
All right, so this is going to be another

00:02:36.995 --> 00:02:39.896
point of inflection, x equals three.

00:02:39.896 --> 00:02:43.006
So these are at three
points of inflection.

00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:47.248
So this happens,

00:02:47.248 --> 00:02:52.117
happens at x equals negative one,

00:02:52.117 --> 00:02:56.401
x equals one and x equals three.

00:02:56.401 --> 00:03:01.401
So these three points
on our graph of f prime

00:03:01.521 --> 00:03:03.634
where we see f prime goes
from decreasing to increasing

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:07.210
or increasing to decreasing
or decreasing to increasing.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.533
All right, all right.

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:14.403
Now, well, I'll do the last
part on the next video.
