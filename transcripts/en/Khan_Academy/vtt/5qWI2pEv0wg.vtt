00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.472
Narrator: By the end of
1923, Hitler sees it as

00:00:03.472 --> 00:00:06.693
his chance to seize power in Germany.

00:00:06.693 --> 00:00:10.212
He's getting this popularity,
the Nazis are getting

00:00:10.212 --> 00:00:12.404
this follower-ship because
the Weimar Republic

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:13.450
is falling apart.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.950
You have the hyperinflation,
the German people feel

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.954
insulted by this French
occupation of the Ruhr region.

00:00:18.954 --> 00:00:21.803
It isn't just regular people
who are starting to support

00:00:21.803 --> 00:00:24.876
the Nazis, it's very
notable people as well.

00:00:24.876 --> 00:00:26.776
This right over here
is General Ludendorff,

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:28.414
we've already talked
about him, he's one of the

00:00:28.414 --> 00:00:30.139
believers in the 'stab-in-the-back' theory

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:31.870
that Germany would have won World War I

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.409
if it wasn't stabbed in the back by

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:35.469
the November Criminals
who had taken control

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.543
of the government during
the revolution in October

00:00:38.543 --> 00:00:40.482
and November.

00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:43.207
He becomes a supporter of Hitler as well.

00:00:43.207 --> 00:00:45.468
In 1922 you have Mussolini come to power,

00:00:45.468 --> 00:00:46.821
this inspires Hitler.

00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:48.957
So, as we get in to
November, Hitler sees this as

00:00:48.957 --> 00:00:51.618
his chance and the way that
he wants to take control,

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:55.672
is he wants to abduct
or kidnap the leaders

00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:57.943
of the Bavarian region,
and there's three of them,

00:00:57.943 --> 00:00:59.336
in particular at this time.

00:00:59.336 --> 00:01:02.007
Then from there, try to
take control of the nation

00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:03.483
as a whole.

00:01:03.483 --> 00:01:07.147
So, in November of 1923
you have a gathering

00:01:07.147 --> 00:01:11.119
of the three gentlemen who are essentially

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.024
in charge of Bavaria, a gathering of them

00:01:14.024 --> 00:01:16.290
and several thousand officials in Bavaria

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.468
at a local beer hall in Munich.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.169
(writing) at a beer hall.

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:26.604
Hitler sees this as the
opportunity to take control.

00:01:26.604 --> 00:01:31.526
This is where he launches
his Beer Hall Putsch,

00:01:31.526 --> 00:01:32.889
and I know I'm mispronouncing it,

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:35.858
but Putsch literally means coup d'Ã©tat,

00:01:35.858 --> 00:01:37.799
to try to overthrow the government.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.861
So, Hitler and his Nazi's
the go to that Beer Hall

00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:43.177
meeting of the government officials,

00:01:43.177 --> 00:01:46.670
they surround it with
their paramilitary group,

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.839
their storm troopers,
Hitler enters into the hall,

00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:51.931
gets on stage, shoots into the air twice

00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:53.806
and says, look this is the revolution,

00:01:53.806 --> 00:01:55.193
it is beginning.

00:01:55.193 --> 00:01:58.741
He forces the three leaders
of Bavaria at gunpoint

00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:01.761
to pledge allegiance to the Nazi party

00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:04.720
and to this Putsch and
to Hitler, in particular.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.283
Then things start to go a little bit ...

00:02:07.283 --> 00:02:10.803
get a little bit ... start to dissolve.

00:02:10.803 --> 00:02:13.457
As Hitler tries to address
some issues that are

00:02:13.457 --> 00:02:17.993
going on outside, the
members who they were going

00:02:17.993 --> 00:02:20.525
to kidnap are allowed
to leave, you have chaos

00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:23.282
in the area amongst the Nazi's

00:02:23.282 --> 00:02:24.822
and, frankly, amongst the government

00:02:24.822 --> 00:02:26.865
throughout that evening,
into that morning,

00:02:26.865 --> 00:02:28.960
at which point Hitler and his followers,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.723
and Ludendorff is one
of them, decide to march

00:02:31.746 --> 00:02:34.306
(writing) decide to march

00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:36.763
into central Munich.

00:02:36.763 --> 00:02:39.456
All of this is happening
... all of this is happening

00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:41.392
in Munich, which is in Bavaria.

00:02:41.392 --> 00:02:44.397
They decide to march, and
it's during that march

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:47.532
that they have a confrontation
with the official

00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:48.795
government troops.

00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:50.465
It's unclear who fired the first shot,

00:02:50.465 --> 00:02:52.359
but you do have an exchange of fire

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.942
and during that exchange of fire,

00:02:53.942 --> 00:02:58.796
I've seen estimates of
about 14-16 Nazi's are shot.

00:02:58.796 --> 00:03:01.397
A few days later ... and a few policemen,

00:03:01.397 --> 00:03:04.128
or a few soldiers are shot as well,

00:03:04.128 --> 00:03:07.859
and then a few days
later Hitler is arrested.

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:13.034
(writing) Hitler, Hitler is arrested.

00:03:13.034 --> 00:03:17.252
He's tried in early 1924
and then he is sentenced

00:03:17.252 --> 00:03:24.052
to jail, so all of his
ambitions were lead to nothing.

00:03:24.052 --> 00:03:29.211
In jail, he still continued
to develop his philosophy.

00:03:29.211 --> 00:03:32.628
He actually continued to
develop his following.

00:03:32.628 --> 00:03:36.456
He spent roughly the
second two-thirds of 1924,

00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:39.801
in 1924, he spent it in jail.

00:03:39.801 --> 00:03:43.992
(writing) 1924 was
spent primarily in jail,

00:03:43.992 --> 00:03:46.989
but while he was in jail he had dictated

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.212
his autobiography and his, frankly,

00:03:49.212 --> 00:03:52.671
his belief system in Mein
Kampf, which literally means

00:03:52.671 --> 00:03:54.444
'My struggle.'

00:03:54.444 --> 00:03:56.928
It's actually banned in many countries,

00:03:56.928 --> 00:03:59.831
it's not banned in the U.S.

00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:02.404
It does make for interesting
reading because you get

00:04:02.404 --> 00:04:05.864
a sense for, on one level,
how bizarre Hitler's brain

00:04:05.864 --> 00:04:08.530
was and how disturbed Hitler's brain was,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.344
but on the other side, you
can appreciate that he was

00:04:11.344 --> 00:04:15.110
a very, he was a strong communicator.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.110
Even before any of this
people would talk about

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.400
how transfixing his eyes
were, how much attention

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.042
people paid to him when
he would give a speech.

00:04:23.042 --> 00:04:24.732
You can even see this in his writing,

00:04:24.732 --> 00:04:26.528
and you can do a web search on it

00:04:26.528 --> 00:04:28.600
and you can get the
entire text of Mein Kampf.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.691
It's disturbing and
fascinating at the same time,

00:04:32.691 --> 00:04:34.121
but this is a little passage.

00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:37.941
In this passage, it gives
you an idea of Hitler's

00:04:37.941 --> 00:04:40.526
view of why Germany was
having these failures

00:04:40.526 --> 00:04:44.118
and what he, in his
bizarrely disturbed mind,

00:04:44.118 --> 00:04:46.788
thought what the solution was.

00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:49.395
"If we pass all the causes
of the German collapse

00:04:49.395 --> 00:04:53.126
"in review, the ultimate and most decisive

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:57.190
"remains the failure to
recognize the racial problem,

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.807
"and especially the Jewish menace."

00:04:59.807 --> 00:05:02.688
He's blaming all of
Hitler's difficulty on a

00:05:02.688 --> 00:05:07.435
racial problem and in particular on Jews.

00:05:07.435 --> 00:05:10.779
"The defeats on the
battlefield in August 1918

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:14.018
"would have been child's play to bear.

00:05:14.018 --> 00:05:16.065
"They stood in no
proportion to the victories

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:17.448
"of our people.

00:05:17.448 --> 00:05:20.391
"It was not they that cause our downfall,

00:05:20.391 --> 00:05:23.688
"no, it was brought
about by that power which

00:05:23.688 --> 00:05:25.600
"prepared these defeats by systematically,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.520
"over many decades, robbing our people of

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.934
"the political and moral
instincts and forces

00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:33.312
"which alone make nations capable,

00:05:33.312 --> 00:05:34.716
"and hence worthy of existence."

00:05:34.716 --> 00:05:36.267
If you read a lot of the other text,

00:05:36.267 --> 00:05:38.614
what he's talking about
is this decades of,

00:05:38.614 --> 00:05:40.998
essentially, watering down their society,

00:05:40.998 --> 00:05:43.696
watering down their
society with other people.

00:05:43.696 --> 00:05:46.799
If they didn't water it
down, they say the defeats

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:49.860
in the battlefield would've
been child's play to bear.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.037
"In heedlessly ignoring the question

00:05:52.037 --> 00:05:55.832
"of the preservation of the
racial foundations of our

00:05:55.832 --> 00:05:59.088
"nation, the old Reich
disregarded the sole right

00:05:59.088 --> 00:06:01.799
"which gives life in this world."

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:05.600
He views this racial, in
his mind, racial impurity

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.748
as the reason why Germany was facing

00:06:10.748 --> 00:06:12.509
all of this difficulty.

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:14.263
As we'll see over the next few videos,

00:06:14.263 --> 00:06:20.412
this leads to one of the
ugliest and bloodiest periods

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:23.420
of human history.
