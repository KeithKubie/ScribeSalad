00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.880
Hey, can you hear me now?

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.049
In this video I’m going to show you 10 cell
phone life hacks, for getting better reception.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.500
Would you believe there’s actually no industry
standard for what the bars on your phone mean?

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.670
It’s true.&nbsp; 4 bars on your phone could
translate to only 2 bars on another phone,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.150
so how can you tell what kind of service you’re
actually getting?&nbsp; Well check this out.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:29.029
If you’re on an iPhone, try dialing *3001#12345#*,
then press call.&nbsp; You can see it puts your

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.619
phone in a secret “field testing” mode
that shows the real strength of your signal,

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.939
in the upper left corner of the screen.&nbsp;
I’ll show you why that’s important in just a second.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.260
In the mean-time if you’re an Android user
it’s even easier.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just go to “Settings”

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.100
—&gt; “About Phone” —&gt; “Status”,
and look for the “Signal Strength” indicator,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.140
which you may have noticed, is measured
in dBm.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.539
dBm stands for “decibel-milliwatts”, and

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.100
to put things in perspective, -70 dBm is a
really great signal, while anything under

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.519
-100 dBm is pretty much a dead zone.&nbsp; The
scale’s exponential, which means a boost

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.250
from -105 to -95 actually means, the signal
on my phone just got 10 times better.&nbsp; And

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.000
a shift from -105 to -75 isn’t just 30 times
stronger.&nbsp; It’s over 1,000 times stronger.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.340
That a dramatic difference!

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.380
Now try walking around your house, and stopping
in each of the rooms for a couple of minutes,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.500
to make a map of which areas have the strongest
signal, and which areas are the weakest.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.280
This way you’ll know all your ideal calling
locations, so you’ll know where to go, for quality conversations.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.300
Speaking of locations, let’s try to find
the phone tower you’re connected to right

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.460
now.&nbsp; If you have an Android, go to the “Play
Store” and download a free program called

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.439
“Open Signal”.&nbsp;&nbsp; Open it up and click
the tower icon on the left-hand side, and

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.180
you’ll see it brings you to a map view,
showing all the towers in your area.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.329
Give it a minute, and you should see a red
line pops up between your phone, and the tower

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.130
you’re connected to, which in most cases,
isn’t the closest one.&nbsp; If you click the

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.740
tower, you can get GPS directions to it in
the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.040
So, why not go for a little walk and make a “real-life” connection, with your cell

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.369
phone tower?&nbsp; By knowing exactly which direction
it is, you’ll be pointed the right way,

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.960
on your quest for clarity.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.520
Quite often your phone will stay connected
to a tower, even if there’s a much stronger

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.520
signal near by.&nbsp; Of course this prevents
you from being tossed around from tower to

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.580
tower, but it might be the same reason your
call quality is suffering.&nbsp; Try rebooting your signal.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.480
You can easily do that by switching to airplane
mode for about 3 seconds, then switching it

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.890
back.&nbsp; If you don’t have airplane mode,
you can use “Open Signal” to refresh the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.590
network for you, or simply turn your phone
off, and turn it back on again.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.920
You know those times when you start getting
messages just when you take your phone out

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.739
and check it?&nbsp; It might not be a coincidence,
but instead, your messages might be getting

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.700
delayed, and delivered late.&nbsp; Glance down
at your battery level, and check to see if

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.670
it’s low.&nbsp; Your phone uses more power to
ping the towers when you’re actively using

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.190
it, but conserves power when it’s on standby
mode.&nbsp; And that might be the reason it’s

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.940
not getting updated as frequently.&nbsp; So if
you’re suspicious your messages are getting

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.640
delayed, the solution could be as simple,
as charging your battery.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.780
By the way.&nbsp; Flip it to airplane mode for
a few minutes, and it’ll recharge even faster.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.820
Modern day insulations and window tintings
are great for keeping buildings and vehicles

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.060
cool, but they can be terrible for cell phone
signals, because it’s kind of like wrapping

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.220
the building in aluminum.&nbsp; Try doing that
with your cell phone the next time you’re

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.160
on a call, and see what happens.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.040
In a similar way, your vehicle’s nothing
more than a big metal box with metallic tint

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.459
covering the windows.&nbsp; So if you notice you’re
struggling for a good connection on the road,

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.170
the simple solution could be as easy as rolling
down the window.&nbsp; You’ll probably find

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.989
your signal more than doubles in strength,
which not only boosts productivity, but will

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.009
probably boost your mood as well.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.160
It’s possible that your phone doesn’t
work very well because your carrier doesn’t

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.590
actually cover your area. Get online and compare
your location with the coverage maps for all

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.120
the different networks.&nbsp; If you live inside
one carriers “dead-zone”, there might

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.760
be another network that services your area
a bit better.&nbsp; So solving the problem could

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.260
be as simple, as switching providers.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.220
Now if you really like your carrier and don’t
want to switch, it’s no problem.&nbsp; There

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.420
is a way you can keep your network and still
boost your signal, and I’ll show you how

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.240
that works in a couple of minutes.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.879
In the mean-time, another low-budget alternative
is to call your carrier and ask for the “customer

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.269
retention department”. You might be able
to talk them into sending you a Femtocell,

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.400
or a Cell-Spot Router, which is basically
a small, low-powered cell phone converter

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.769
that connects through your internet. You should
be able to get service as long as you have

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.739
an internet connection, but there are some
drawbacks you need to be prepared for.&nbsp; Calling

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.500
through the Internet doesn’t produce the
best call quality, and your Femtocell only

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.310
works with your carrier.&nbsp; That means it won’t
be compatible for anyone with a different

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.070
network, and since it goes through your internet,
it’ll likely slow your connection as well.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.860
But as long as you're ok with that, a Femtocell
or Cell-Spot Router, could be a good way to go.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.140
Another option is “Wi-Fi calling”.&nbsp; If
you happen to be near a Wi-Fi hotspot, try

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.410
switching your phone over to “Wi-Fi mode”,
and just like that you’ll be able to make

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.910
and receive calls using your regular phone
number, but over the Wi-Fi network instead.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.280
This can be a great way to save on roaming
charges, if you’re traveling internationally,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.760
or maybe trying to send a message from 39,000
feet.&nbsp; But keep in mind that not all phones

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.410
and carriers will support this feature, and
if they do, it’ll still count against your

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.310
monthly cell phone minutes, while slowing
your internet speed at the same time.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.000
Now if you want to fix the problem, rather
than just figuring out ways around it, try

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.540
what I did and get a weBoost, cell-phone signal
booster.&nbsp; The genius behind a signal booster

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.040
is that it can take the weakest of signals
outside, and amplify them to full power inside.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.700
Which effectively, is like putting a mini
cell-phone tower right inside your room.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.440
This means you'll get faster data speeds,
clearer conversations, and since your phone

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.040
doesn’t have to transmit long distances
anymore, you’ll be saving power as well.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.820
Which means longer battery life.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.580
A signal booster will eliminate dead-zones
at the office, and even keep you connected

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.160
on the road, which is perfect for anyone making
business calls on the go.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.730
And if you’re living way out in the boonies,
a booster may be just the right prescription,

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.400
for curing, your “weak signal” condition.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.670
By the way the great thing about “weBoost”
technology is they work with every network,

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.270
every carrier, and there’s really no limit,
to how many people can use it.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.120
Well now you know a little more, about how
your phone works, and 10 tricks for finding a clearer signal.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.680
So whether you live in an area with terrible
coverage, or just have a load of radio-blocking

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.320
materials, between you and your tower, remember
you’ve still got options to boost your network’s

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.540
signal, and get your voice heard.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.500
Well that’s it for now.&nbsp; If you liked this
