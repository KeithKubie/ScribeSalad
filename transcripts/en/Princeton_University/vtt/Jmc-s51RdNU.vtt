Matthew Cramer:
I remember when I was a freshman, it was the first time I stepped back and thought,

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:14.000
Matthew Cramer:
"Wow, this is really amazing."

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:29.679 position:97%
Shirley M. Tilghman:
only begin to imagine now. Preparing you to be informed and effective citizens of this

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:35.759 position:98%
Shirley M. Tilghman:
and all countries -- citizens who are able to draw understanding from and discern the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.590 position:98%
Shirley M. Tilghman:
most fruitful path amid the immense sea of facts surrounding them. I am looking forward

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.189 position:98%
Shirley M. Tilghman:
to getting to know each of you and to cheering you on inside and outside the classroom as

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:54.310 position:98%
Shirley M. Tilghman:
you chart your course through this great University. I hope you will leave our campus saying,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.310 position:97%
Shirley M. Tilghman:
as generations of students before you have said, "This place changed my life."

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.520 position:97%
Suzannah Beiner:
President Tilghman's opening address really put my four years in perspective. College is about

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.590 position:98%
Suzannah Beiner:
new experiences and Princeton really encourages students to try new things. I'm going to push the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.250 position:98%
Suzannah Beiner:
boundaries and explore new possibilities and be an even better person than when I got here.

We're here, as we are every year, to welcome the freshmen to Princeton as they walk through the gates.

Rachael DeLue:
Tonight's talk was about a very large question, which is, "How do we represent history?"

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.330 position:97%
Rachael DeLue:
And it was inspired, of course, by the fact that today is the tenth anniversary of Sept. 11.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.690 position:98%
Rachael DeLue:
One of the great pleasures of teaching at Princeton, of being a professor at Princeton,

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.460 position:97%
Rachael DeLue:
is that I get to figure things out in collaboration with students such as yourselves. It's meant

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:36.460 position:98%
Rachael DeLue:
to frame the students' experience at Princeton, which is about asking questions. History matters,

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.790 position:97%
Rachael DeLue:
but the manner in which we describe history matters just as much. We have a historical

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.730 position:97%
Rachael DeLue:
responsibility but also an ethical responsibility to tell the story of our past completely and

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:00.319 position:97%
Rachael DeLue:
fully and from multiple points of view. Doing that will help us make decisions for the greater good.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:07.319 position:98%
Clayton Raithel:
And now, as per Princeton tradition, we'd like to invite all of the a cappella groups

that sang with us tonight back on stage for the singing of "Old Nassau."

Thank you. Thank you very much, guys. Enjoy the rest of your evening and your time here at Princeton.
