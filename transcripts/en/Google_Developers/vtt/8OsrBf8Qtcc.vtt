00:00:01.184 --> 00:00:02.600
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Hey, everyone.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.280
Welcome to "Coffee
with a Googler."

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.300
I'm here with Sebastian
Thrun, founder of Udacity.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.230
And I wanted to just
hear a little bit more

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.800
about the announcements
today in the keynote.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.790
Can you tell us and
share with the world

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.880
what you and your team
are doing at Udacity?

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.796
SEBASTIAN THURN: Yeah.

00:00:16.796 --> 00:00:18.730
We are really,
really pleased to see

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.810
that someone took the time to
talk about our new nanodegree.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.890
That is basically a way to
bring education to the world,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.820
to democratize education.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.920
Google, wonderful.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.070
14 great instructors at
Google have teamed up

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.230
with my startup company
Udacity to bring education

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.000
to the entire world, including
Egypt and many other places.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.280
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.720
Where did you get
the idea for Udacity?

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.300
Because you used to
be at Google, right?

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.190
SEBASTIAN THURN: I
used to be at Google.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.740
I was a mid-level
manager in Maps

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.260
and eventually made
it into Google X

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.320
and founded Google X.
And then at some point,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.990
I realized one of the most
important things we have

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.880
to do is to provide education to
people-- not just information,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.097
not making just the world's
information accessible,

00:00:54.097 --> 00:00:55.680
but we're making the
world's education

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.640
accessible and democratize it.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.640
So I took time out,
I started Udacity,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.600
and we have more than
4 million students.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.800
We're doing fine.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.550
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
That's really awesome.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.280
And is the education primarily
focused around developers,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.100
or can you share more about
the breadth of the offerings

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.170
that Udacity has?

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.086
SEBASTIAN THURN: Yeah.

00:01:15.086 --> 00:01:17.510
So the Android nanodegree
with Google to be [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.890
is built and undersigned
by Google, by Peter Lubbers

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.210
and his team really
teaches people

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.049
to become Android developers.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.340
So if you take the education,
you getting a nanodegree,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.320
you should be able to find a job
in the Valley or in the world.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.570
And in the Valley, we pay
for a good Android developer

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.065
easily $100,000 or more
in salary per year.

00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:36.290
So it's really meant
to find people a job.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.210
It's projected based.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.290
You do many projects.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.460
You do much less lectures.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.252
There's some classes,
but they're optional.

00:01:41.252 --> 00:01:43.418
And it's one of the many
nanodegrees we've launched.

00:01:43.418 --> 00:01:44.620
We launched five other ones.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.280
I hate to say, in
iOS, we have one.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.577
But we also have data
engineering and programming,

00:01:49.577 --> 00:01:50.910
and all around computer science.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.020
So all that kind of stuff.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.820
The kind of stuff that
we teach is the type

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.778
you would like to hire.

00:01:54.778 --> 00:01:55.960
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.547
And I think that's
a game changer.

00:01:57.547 --> 00:01:59.130
Bringing more people
into the industry

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.150
and having this
industry knowledge

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.770
really helps more people come
into our industry faster.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.660
Because I know that
in the next 20 years--

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.380
we have so many
jobs, and we're going

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.287
to need them filled by amazing
people around the world.

00:02:09.287 --> 00:02:09.414
SEBASTIAN THURN: Yeah.

00:02:09.414 --> 00:02:11.039
And this is the kind
of stuff-- I mean,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.045
I'm a former university
professor from Stanford,

00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:15.670
and this is the kind of stuff we
can't really offer at Stanford

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.632
because it is so bleeding edge.

00:02:17.632 --> 00:02:19.840
I mean, we announce a new
feature here at Google I/O,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.715
and we already have a
course online where you

00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:23.640
can learn how to program this.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.390
That speed cannot be
matched in academia.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.200
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So this
nanodegree program, is it free?

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.970
Does it cost money?

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.746
If I wanted to sign up
today, what do I have to do?

00:02:36.746 --> 00:02:38.620
Do I have to have some
background experience?

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.530
How do I get started?

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.363
SEBASTIAN THURN: So
first of all, it's free.

00:02:41.363 --> 00:02:43.530
Udacity's mission is to
democratize education,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.480
and you can't democratize
if you charge money.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.520
So anyone in the world can
study all the content for free

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.000
and do any of the projects.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.580
However, to become really
good, you want our feedback.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.490
You want services.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.840
You want mentors.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.570
You want code reviews.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.880
You want some engagement.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.180
And these things cost us
money, so we charge money,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.820
and we charge $200
dollars a month.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.020
Google has very
graciously, in Egypt,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.340
just offering 2,000
scholarships for students

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.400
so that students can
get those services

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.220
and still study for free.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.140
In terms of prerequisites, if
you've never programmed before,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.760
don't try it.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.400
It's too hard.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.610
If fact, we have a
little test there.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.143
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Maybe become a designer?

00:03:17.143 --> 00:03:18.330
SEBASTIAN THURN: No no no.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.045
Take a different nanodegree.

00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:20.920
Do programming first.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.280
We have a whole bunch of those.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.321
You can start at the very
beginning with Udacity.

00:03:24.321 --> 00:03:25.960
But Android is
really meant to be

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.036
kind of a proficient,
top-level Android developer,

00:03:29.036 --> 00:03:30.786
the same way Google
would hire internally.

00:03:30.786 --> 00:03:31.911
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Got it.

00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:32.490
Got it.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.330
So we kind of
talked a little bit

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.940
about how Udacity is going
to help drive job creation.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.660
I heard, when I was talking to
Peter backstage, a little bit

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.720
about this career summit.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.875
Can you speak to what the
career summit is and some

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:47.750
of the goals of that?

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.666
SEBASTIAN THURN: Yeah.

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:50.154
That's totally cool.

00:03:50.154 --> 00:03:51.570
Laszlo Bock and
his team at Google

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.200
have decided they're going to
invite 50 of the top Android

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.010
finishers for our
nanodegree over to Google

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.840
in November, all expenses paid,
for a multiday summit where

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.600
we do a hackathon and you
meet Google recruiters,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.660
and possibly a few of
them find Google jobs.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.060
That's a great motivation
to the students in the world

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.840
to sign up for it, but
it's also a great sign

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.570
that Google is
willing to reconsider

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.089
alternative credentials--
in this case, it's

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.959
own nanodegree-- alternative
to conventional college

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:21.720
credentials.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.150
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.600
And so it's not
even that this is

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.490
going to be a long-term goal.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.276
This goal can be
accomplished this year.

00:04:27.276 --> 00:04:29.650
SEBASTIAN THURN: It's going
to be accomplished this year.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.450
And think about what's at
stake, how many people we have

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.400
in the world who don't
like their job who

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.700
can't get a good education.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.180
Like the entire Middle East, for
example, my friend Tom Friedman

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.074
talks about that he
believes if there's

00:04:41.074 --> 00:04:42.490
good education in
the Middle East,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.160
there'd be fewer terrorists.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.060
Think about mid-career people.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.295
We have stay-at-home moms to
turn into software developers.

00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:50.670
We had a professional
golf player

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.480
who became a data analyst.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.040
These kind of shifts don't exist
today, and in this work force,

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.840
we need paths for those people.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.059
If we do this, humanity
could be twice as productive.

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:02.100
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.590
So you spoke about
the Middle East.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.560
I know that your team has
also been working with Google

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.120
to enable even more
educational opportunities,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.710
specifically in Egypt.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.190
Can you tell me
a little bit more

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.148
and our audience a little
bit more about what's

00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:17.040
going on in Egypt?

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.470
SEBASTIAN THURN: Google
has a really great

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.553
working relationship with
the Egyptian government,

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:22.160
and so do we, by association.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.200
And Google has decided to
translate several courses

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.610
that we've jointly built
into Arabic, end to end,

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.310
so that a non-English speaking
person could still study

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.070
and become a top-notch software
developer, Android developer,

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.120
and so on.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.240
And on top of it,
Google is putting

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.510
in study centers, job centers,
and stipends for students

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.050
to take those materials.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.700
For me, it's great because
I'm passionately following

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.970
the sad news in the
Middle East every day

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.570
and the entire Arab peninsula.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.990
I truly believe if we
brought good education

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.800
to that specific
part of the world,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.665
there'd be alternative
pathways for people

00:06:01.665 --> 00:06:03.956
to get a bit of the energy
and do something productive.

00:06:03.956 --> 00:06:07.040
And picking Egypt is a great
launching pad because Egypt

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.670
is relatively stable,
has an extremely

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.730
talented and
inspiring population,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.254
and has a huge number
of women in technology,

00:06:14.254 --> 00:06:16.420
as I just learned, which I
think is really important

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.630
to bring more women
into technology.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.030
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.080
So as I was mentioning, I work
on the Women Techmakers program

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.020
here at Google, and
my role is to increase

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.030
the visibility,
community, and resources

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.030
for women in technology.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.600
And I think so
often, we don't hear

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.050
of all the amazing
women globally that

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.020
are in the technology industry.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.020
And so specifically, when we're
thinking of the Middle East,

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.700
so Arabic is first.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.040
Have you guys started thinking
about what countries you

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.110
might go to next?

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.540
SEBASTIAN THURN: We have
translated various classes

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.360
into up to 40 different
languages when

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.380
it comes to subtitling, but the
narrative is still in English.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.100
We currently took
investment from Japan,

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.190
from Europe, Germany,
and from Brazil.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.420
We are very heavily
contemplating

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.790
China at this point, and we
have a huge following in India.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.510
Udacity is an
international platform.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.720
Our students are mostly
from international countries

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.224
from all parts of the world,
and that's our mission,

00:07:12.224 --> 00:07:12.765
to be global.

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:13.130
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.410
And when I was talking to
even some women yesterday,

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.450
we were talking about
how in order to, I think,

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.179
really increase
the participation

00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:22.970
and the graduation rate
from these courses,

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.970
I think what's really
powerful about what you're

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.620
doing is this end
to end translation,

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.150
because I think sometimes,
subtitles aren't enough.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.510
The more that we can have
natural language speakers

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.320
actually teaching these courses,
it makes it feel-- not just

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.480
for women, but I think
for people of any nation,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.230
to have it feel like
it was made for them.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.940
So I think that's a
really cool aspect

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.550
of what you're doing in Egypt.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.470
I was telling you a
little bit backstage,

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.630
I had the privilege to bring
together a four-woman team

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.341
to create the new Android
for Beginners course.

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:57.840
So those are just the women
that are specifically at Google.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.930
There's also a whole
team at Udacity.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.740
And our thought was, how can
we bring anyone anywhere,

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.800
regardless of their background,
into the Android ecosystem?

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.660
What are your thoughts
around how anyone

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.930
can jump in and participate?

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.509
Is it starting with Android?

00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:14.050
Where do you think
they should begin?

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.690
SEBASTIAN THURN: I think
online education is not

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.110
to be underestimated
in its power.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.270
It's easy to box people in.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.300
I don't want to
box anybody here,

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.570
but I've heard some of our
female students voicing,

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.790
look, we feel less intimidated
than in the classroom

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.750
with like 90% males
that are all super smart

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.000
and raise their hand and makes
us feel slightly inferior.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.580
It gives much more privacy
and much more ability to-- you

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.980
can watch the same video 50
times if you want, and so on.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.010
It's also cultural.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.960
I mean, to me, programming
Android is sexy.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.260
It's interesting.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.110
How many billions of
people at this point?

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.280
There's 1.5 billion new devices
unlocked every single day.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.970
How can you possibly
be worth more than

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.469
if you become an
Android programmer.

00:08:55.469 --> 00:08:58.610
We have 3.69 billion unique
mobile accounts in the world.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.390
Half the world is on mobile.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.530
81% is Android.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:04.430
I think we should
just all move into it,

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.656
and we should leave
the old stuff behind.

00:09:06.656 --> 00:09:08.030
We're being told,
you can't do it

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.710
because of race, ethnicity,
whatever, intellect, gender,

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.640
sexual orientation,
that's all wrong.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.240
Just do it.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:14.790
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.100
Well, thanks so
much for joining us.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.090
I really appreciate you taking
the time, and congratulations

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.173
on the announcement today.

00:09:19.173 --> 00:09:20.690
SEBASTIAN THURN:
Thank you so much.
