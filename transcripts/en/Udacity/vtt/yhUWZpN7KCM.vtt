00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.070
Okay, the time has come to wrap up

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.560
transactions where we will cover transaction rules. And the

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.910
two things we will start with are snapshot

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.050
isolation which defines the read consistency and optimistic concurrency

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.210
which governs concurrent updates. We'll start off with

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.070
snapshot isolation. And please observe that this behavior may

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.570
differ between languages, so be sure to check out

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.480
the documentation. The first rule is that all read

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.040
operations in a transaction will return the values datastore

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.280
had when the transaction started. And the second rule

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.960
for snapshot isolation is. Updates will not be reflected

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.070
while in the transaction. So, if an entity is modified

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.780
or deleted in the transaction, a query will get

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.750
the original version of the entity, or nothing if

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.300
the entity did not exit then. That's snapshot isolation,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.920
but please be sure to check out the documentation as

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.360
this behavior is somewhat language specific. So let's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.880
turn to optimistic concurrency. This rule is that a

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.990
commit transaction would only be successful if the

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.810
values updated by this transaction have not changed since

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.650
the begin transaction. If the values that you're

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.030
trying to update has changed since begin, the transaction

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.460
will fail. Then there are two additional rules

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.990
you should be aware of. The first is that

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.750
one transaction can modify at most five ancestor

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.590
groups. The second rule is that a transaction

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.680
must complete within 60 seconds, but the general

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.710
rule is, of course, to keep the execution

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.200
of transactions short. As short as possible, unless

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.840
in extremely rare cases, they should be finished

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.740
within a couple of seconds and in most

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.050
cases, less than a second. That completes this section
