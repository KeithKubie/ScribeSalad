00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:16.698
I want you to imagine that you are
a Child Protective Services worker.

00:00:17.563 --> 00:00:20.380
And you have to respond
to a report of child abuse.

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:26.024
You walk into a home, unannounced,
unexpected, certainly uninvited.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.903
The first thing you see is a mattress
in the middle of the room, on the floor.

00:00:30.927 --> 00:00:32.927
Three kids lying on it, asleep.

00:00:33.982 --> 00:00:37.538
There's a small table nearby
with a couple of ashtrays,

00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:38.910
empty beer cans.

00:00:40.268 --> 00:00:42.847
Large rat traps are set in the corner,

00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:46.037
not too far from where
the kids lie asleep.

00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:47.327
So you make a note.

00:00:49.173 --> 00:00:52.347
A part of your job is walking
through the entire home.

00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:55.307
So you start with the kitchen,
where there's very little food.

00:00:56.315 --> 00:00:59.593
You notice another mattress
in the bedroom, on the floor,

00:00:59.617 --> 00:01:02.259
that the mother shares
with her infant child.

00:01:04.419 --> 00:01:07.781
Now, generally, at this point,
two things may happen.

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.143
The children are deemed unsafe
and removed from the home,

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:15.505
and placed in state custody
for a specified period of time.

00:01:16.657 --> 00:01:19.874
Or the children remain with their family

00:01:19.898 --> 00:01:23.623
and the child welfare system
provides help and support.

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:27.842
When I was a Child
Protective Services worker,

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.450
I saw things like this all the time.

00:01:30.474 --> 00:01:32.607
Some far better, some far worse.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.998
I asked you to imagine
yourself in that home,

00:01:36.022 --> 00:01:38.435
because I wonder what crossed your mind.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.259
What guides your decisions?

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.809
What's going to impact
your opinion of that family?

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.005
What race, ethnicity,
did you think the family was?

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.085
I want you to realize
that if those children were white,

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:57.086
it is more likely that their family
stays together after that visit.

00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:00.839
Research done at
the University of Pennsylvania

00:02:00.863 --> 00:02:05.672
found that white families, on average,
have access to more help and more support

00:02:05.696 --> 00:02:07.314
from the child welfare system.

00:02:07.632 --> 00:02:12.452
And their cases are less likely
to go through a full investigation.

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.892
But on the other hand,
if those kids are black,

00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:20.863
they are four times
more likely to be removed,

00:02:20.887 --> 00:02:24.164
they spend longer periods
of time in foster care,

00:02:24.188 --> 00:02:27.291
and it's harder to find them
a stable foster placement.

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.188
Foster care is meant to be
an immediate shelter of protection

00:02:32.212 --> 00:02:33.863
for kids who are at high risk.

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:38.020
But it's also a confusing
and traumatic exit from the family.

00:02:39.027 --> 00:02:41.138
Research done at
the University of Minnesota

00:02:41.162 --> 00:02:43.677
found that kids
who went through foster care

00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:46.908
had more behavioral problems
and internalized issues

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:51.382
than kids who remain with their families
while receiving help and support.

00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:55.381
The scenario I mentioned earlier
is not uncommon.

00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:57.738
A single mother,
living in low-income housing

00:02:57.762 --> 00:02:59.296
with her four children.

00:02:59.695 --> 00:03:02.304
And the rats make it
almost impossible to keep food,

00:03:02.328 --> 00:03:04.595
let alone fresh food in the home.

00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:09.148
Does that mother deserve
to have her children taken from her?

00:03:10.934 --> 00:03:13.187
Emma Ketteringham,
a family court attorney,

00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:16.085
says that if you live
in a poor neighborhood,

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.928
then you better be a perfect parent.

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.865
She says that we place unfair,
often unreachable standards

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.762
on parents who are raising their kids
with very little money.

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:28.810
And their neighborhood and ethnicity

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:31.508
impact whether or not
their kids are removed.

00:03:33.783 --> 00:03:36.651
In the two years I spent
on the front lines of child welfare,

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.268
I made high-stakes decisions.

00:03:38.292 --> 00:03:41.815
And I saw firsthand
how my personal values impacted my work.

00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:47.029
Now, as social work faculty
at Florida State University,

00:03:47.053 --> 00:03:48.204
I lead an institute

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:52.021
that curates the most innovative
and effective child welfare research.

00:03:52.486 --> 00:03:57.216
And research tells us that there are
twice as many black kids in foster care,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.137
twenty-eight percent,

00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:02.914
than there are in the general
population, 14 percent.

00:04:03.673 --> 00:04:05.736
And although there are
several reasons why,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.998
I want to discuss one reason today:

00:04:08.022 --> 00:04:09.172
implicit bias.

00:04:10.815 --> 00:04:12.387
Let's start with "implicit."

00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:15.211
It's subconscious,
something you're not aware of.

00:04:16.752 --> 00:04:19.015
Bias -- those stereotypes and attitudes

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.705
that we all have
about certain groups of people.

00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:25.012
So, implicit bias is what lurks
in the background

00:04:25.036 --> 00:04:27.103
of every decision that we make.

00:04:28.608 --> 00:04:30.007
So how can we fix it?

00:04:30.973 --> 00:04:33.781
I have a promising solution
that I want to share.

00:04:34.671 --> 00:04:36.019
Now, in almost every state,

00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:39.300
there are high numbers of black kids
going into foster care.

00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:43.333
But data revealed that Nassau County,

00:04:43.357 --> 00:04:45.000
a community in New York,

00:04:45.024 --> 00:04:48.500
had managed to decrease
the number of black kids being removed.

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:54.052
And in 2016, I went
into that community with my team

00:04:54.076 --> 00:04:55.893
and led a research study,

00:04:55.917 --> 00:04:59.301
discovering the use
of blind removal meetings.

00:04:59.887 --> 00:05:01.287
This is how it works.

00:05:02.014 --> 00:05:04.855
A case worker responds
to a report of child abuse.

00:05:05.196 --> 00:05:06.585
They go out to the home,

00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:08.672
but before the children are removed,

00:05:08.696 --> 00:05:11.093
the case worker
must come back to the office

00:05:11.117 --> 00:05:12.823
and present what they found.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.910
But here's the distinction:

00:05:14.934 --> 00:05:16.729
When they present to the committee,

00:05:16.753 --> 00:05:20.702
they delete names, ethnicity,
neighborhood, race,

00:05:20.726 --> 00:05:22.659
all identifiable information.

00:05:23.297 --> 00:05:29.053
They focus on what happened,
family strength, relevant history

00:05:29.077 --> 00:05:31.791
and the parents' ability
to protect the child.

00:05:32.815 --> 00:05:36.188
With that information,
the committee makes a recommendation,

00:05:36.212 --> 00:05:38.679
never knowing the race of the family.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.680
Blind removals have made
a drastic impact in that community.

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:48.695
In 2011, 57 percent of the kids
going into foster care were black.

00:05:49.712 --> 00:05:53.735
But after five years of blind removals,
that is down to 21 percent.

00:05:54.667 --> 00:06:01.127
(Applause)

00:06:01.151 --> 00:06:04.277
Here's what we learned
from talking to some of the case workers.

00:06:04.916 --> 00:06:07.884
"When a family has a history
with the department,

00:06:07.908 --> 00:06:10.559
many of us hold that history against them,

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:13.130
even if they're trying
to do things differently."

00:06:13.892 --> 00:06:16.510
"When I see a case from a certain
apartment building,

00:06:16.534 --> 00:06:18.511
neighborhood or zip code,

00:06:18.535 --> 00:06:20.813
I just automatically think the worst."

00:06:22.034 --> 00:06:25.653
"Child welfare is very subjective,
because it's an emotional field.

00:06:26.114 --> 00:06:29.226
There's no one who doesn't have
emotions around this work.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.146
And it's very hard to leave
all of your stuff at the door

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.408
when you do this work.

00:06:33.432 --> 00:06:37.621
So let's take the subjectivity
of race and neighborhood out of it,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.839
and you might get different outcomes."

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.478
Blind removals seem to be
bringing us closer

00:06:45.502 --> 00:06:49.545
to solving the problem of implicit bias
in foster-care decisions.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.814
My next step is figuring out

00:06:52.838 --> 00:06:55.799
how to use artificial intelligence
and machine learning

00:06:55.823 --> 00:06:57.831
to bring this project to scale

00:06:57.855 --> 00:07:00.140
and make it more accessible
to other states.

00:07:00.514 --> 00:07:03.047
I know we can transform child welfare.

00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:05.688
We can hold organizations accountable

00:07:05.712 --> 00:07:08.855
to developing the social consciousness
of their employees.

00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:10.982
We can hold ourselves accountable

00:07:11.006 --> 00:07:14.548
to making sure our decisions
are driven by ethics and safety.

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:20.984
Let's imagine a child welfare system
that focuses on partnering with parents,

00:07:21.008 --> 00:07:22.531
empowering families,

00:07:22.555 --> 00:07:25.578
and no longer see poverty as failure.

00:07:26.666 --> 00:07:29.214
Let's work together to build a system

00:07:29.238 --> 00:07:33.366
that wants to make families stronger
instead of pulling them apart.

00:07:34.563 --> 00:07:35.738
Thank you.

00:07:35.762 --> 00:07:39.896
(Applause) (Cheering)
