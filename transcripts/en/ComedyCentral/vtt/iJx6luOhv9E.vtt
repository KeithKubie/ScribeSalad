00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:04.171
- Trump, the name is
synonymous with quality,

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:07.875
luxury, being better
than losers, and class.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.146
Its been on golf courses,
casinos, and beautiful meat.

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:18.318
Now, I'm lending my name
to the failing game show,

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:22.523
At Midnight, and they need
it, they need it tremendously.

00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:27.494
I've bought and paid for
every episode this week,

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:32.032
just like I bought and paid
for my beautiful wife, Melania.

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:35.402
And soft little nougat
chinchilla Chrissy Hardwick

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.572
is going to play the
games I want to play.

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:42.442
It's to be huge,
stupendous, the bestest.

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:45.812
Okay, you losers, here's
more than you deserve.

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:48.115
Trump Presents At Midnight.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.053
(audience cheering)

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.722
- And now it's time for
tonight's #HashtagWars.

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:58.759
(audience cheering)

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:07.134
Tonight's sponsor, Donald Trump,

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:10.771
has a very interesting grasp
on the English language.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:11.939
If he wasn't
sponsoring the show,

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:13.207
I'd say that he
rambles like a toddler

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.309
on bath salts, but
he is, so I can't.

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:18.679
So in order to celebrate
2016's most innovative orator,

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:20.714
tonight's hashtag
is #TrumpAQuote.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.183
#TrumpAQuote is
tonight's hashtag.

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:24.051
(audience cheering)

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.586
- Why are you clapping?

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.722
I don't know why
you're inviting him.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:29.590
- Okay.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.332
Okay, stop talking,
wee-willy-Seacrest.

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:40.167
I paid for this episode, and I'm

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.970
gonna play in this
segment, because no one

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:45.305
is better at quoting me than me.

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:47.007
(audience laughing)

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.142
I am tremendous, I'm
incredible at it.

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:50.477
I'm incredible Chip.

00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:52.579
Also, all my answers are worth

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:55.115
eight times the points
of everyone else.

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:55.949

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:57.851
You got it Chuck?

00:01:57.885 --> 00:01:58.952
- I don't,

00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:00.053
I feel dirty.

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:02.689

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.607
Alright, tonight's
hashtag is #TrumpAQuote.

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:22.876
Examples might be "All
the world's a stage

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.912
"and all the men and
women are merely losers."

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:26.280
