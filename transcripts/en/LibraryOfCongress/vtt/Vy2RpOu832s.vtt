[ Applause ]

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.746
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering:
Okay were on now.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.413
Thank you very much.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.546
That was a -- Marilyn
and I had talked

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.346
about giving a slight introduction
about ourselves and who we are

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.946
but that was fantastic so I
think we're going to move right

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.080
in to talking about <i>Snook
Alone</i>, this new book

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.070
and we just did a book signing
just about a half hour ago.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.083
We had a lot of people in line with
this book so it's really exciting

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.203
to see this new, new book
out and in the public.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.816
So were just going to kind of going
to share back and forth and talk

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.643
about inspirations and I'm wondering
if maybe would you like to speak

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.983
because the writing came first
and I know you have some friends

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.923
and your travel and islands
and emotions that all went

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.280
into this book and
maybe people would

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.780
like to hear about
your inspirations.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.446
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: Okay
this book began for me,

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.393
it grew out of my friendship with a
man who is a former Benedictine monk

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.676
and is now a Roman Catholic Priest
on an island in the Indian Ocean.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.896
We were friends from
college forty-five years ago.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.650
I was visiting once several years
ago and he had three little dogs,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.380
little I think they were Jack Russel
Terriers although I made Snook a Rat

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.100
Terrier because I wasn't sure.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.473
He had these three little
dogs who were adorable

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.373
and one of them was named Snook.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.333
It was both of our favorite and
while I was there I happened

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.570
to read a magazine article about
someone who had abandoned a dog

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.030
on a uninhabited island
and he and I talked

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.640
about what an awful thing
this was to do and I said,

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.286
"You know I think the
adventures of a dog

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.556
on an island though could be
a nice story for children".

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.083
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering: I by the
way didn't know the whole time

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.663
illustrating this until
towards the end

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.023
that there really was this character
Oba Jacob she calls Oba Yacum

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.300
[phonetic] and a real dog Snook so
later on when I met with Marilyn

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.070
and talked about this
stuff I was like excited

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.736
to see an actual photograph
of Oba Jacob.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.750
It was probably best that I didn't
see that in the beginning either

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.063
because then I would of tried to
make it look like him maybe so

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.143
but keep going that was...

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.873
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: So we
spent some time talking

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.446
about what could possibly make
the, we figured it would be him

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.800
in the story and his dog and what
would possibly make him leave his

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.810
dog behind on an uninhabited island.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.800
Just by chance one of the
things my friend is dedicated

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.643
to is the preservation of a
atoll in the Indian Ocean,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.193
St. Brendan's atoll and he had the
previous year made an excursion

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.700
with some other people to
do a survey of the animals

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.483
and birds living on these tiny
little islands in this atoll.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.983
So we put that into
the book and the book.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.006
Maybe you should talk a little
bit about because it's a sea book.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.800
It's a book about islands and I will
say one last thing before handing it

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.313
off to Tim again.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.180
My friend who he had gone on
several silent solitary retreats

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.630
on these islands in this atoll and
so he said well he gave me a map

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.020
of the atoll so that I could see
all of the islands in the atoll

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.273
and then he said well it probably
would be best to put Snook

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.633
on this one particular island

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.633
and then he drew a map
for me of this island.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.543
This is where he would probably
be able to find fresh water.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.223
This is where the seabirds
are nesting.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.756
This is the vegetation in
this part of the island.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.783
So I left my visit with
him with a map of the atoll

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.926
and a hand drawn map of
AdvoCare Island and the image

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.633
of Snook himself who was
a very, very sweet dog.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.160
He was the one of the three dogs,
Snook was the one who would sneak

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.286
into my room in the guest house
at night and sleep at the foot

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.690
of my bed even though
he wasn't suppose to.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.483
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering:
On a green mat?

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.193
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: Yeah
well actually in a chair

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:28.576
which he really wasn't
suppose to yes.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.850
So although I myself have not
been to this island I was equipped

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.496
with a strong sense of the island
from my friend and with a sense

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.243
of the adventures that
a dog would have

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.353
on an uninhabited island
in the Indian Ocean.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.600
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering: Alright
so as an illustrator a lot

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.230
of times you don't met the
author right off the bat.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.030
I guess as I get farther into
my career maybe I'll work

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.373
with a author a second time or
something and will have already met

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.673
that author but a lot of times you
get this manuscript it's just a

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:11.376
typed out xeroxed black and white
just like you get in school,

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.316
these little assignment and I read

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.673
that you know Snook Alone
is this beautifully written.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:23.376
I don't know if anybody's read
it yet but heres, this is it

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.890
and it is beautifully written.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:29.870
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: It
just came out last week.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.303
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering:

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.636
The fourteenth I think
was the release date.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:36.730
So I was excited immediately
because I'm going to tell you

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.476
about how I was inspired
to illustrate this.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.933
I had, I just brought a couple
little snapshots, I just printed

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.406
out these little just some
old pictures I scanned in.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.323
So first of all I grew
up with having dogs

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:54.686
and this you probably
can't see it that well

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.966
but this little dog here his name
is Caesar and he was a awesome,

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.323
awesome dog I mean everybody
could say that about their own dog

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:04.966
but he just had such a personality
and he used to go out on the boat

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.683
with us all the time fishing
and if we had to many people

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.656
in the boat he had to stay on
shore we could watch him barking

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.936
and running up and down that shore
as we got farther and father away

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.203
and we would literally go
back and say, "Okay get in".

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.716
So his personality of just hanging
out with him whatever you know

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.336
of we were just taking
walks in the woods

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.403
or down the beach I
had all those memories

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.166
of you know the dog
personality stuff to kind of plug

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.076
in to this Snook who I've
never met that I felt

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.110
like I knew already just
by reading about him.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:41.900
So there was kind of
like the dog inspiration.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.406
Then I had a lot of
excitement in my body and mind

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.690
about where this was taking
place and this whole island thing

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.153
and there's a couple reasons.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.080
I love, I'm a beach bum,
I grew up on Cape Cod

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:02.596
and I just spent a lot
of time at the beach.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.990
I still do.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.190
I love surfing, fishing, boating all
that kind of stuff, and adventure

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:13.456
and so this whole island thing
was like oh this is great I get

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.010
to draw this cool stuff,
this island stuff.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:20.210
I'm holding up a picture of the
United States ship Kitty Hawk

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:21.990
and I was stationed on this ship,

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.640
I was in the Navy before
I started art school,

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.403
I went to The Art Center
Collage of Design in Pasadena

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:33.410
but I wasn't quite ready for school
yet even though I loved drawing

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.246
and everything I was just like
I wanted to run my friskies off

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.383
or whatever it was so I moved
from Cape Cod went all the way

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.286
to California, I'm on this ship
and we sailed all over the place.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.706
I went to Hawaii and Africa and
Japan, the Philippines and Australia

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.316
and Diego Garcia and it was
an unbelievable adventure

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.203
and like heres a old picture
of me, just a silhouette,

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.773
I was on Diego Garcia and
walking around the tidal pools,

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.520
just like this is all relating
to the book stuff, catching stuff

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.433
like little octopus
and spiney lobsters

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.276
and all kinds of cool stuff.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.606
So after college I, this all
relates to [inaudible] illustrate

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.036
in the book, my Dad had been
trying to learn how to sail

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:20.530
for years growing up on the Cap,
breaking his knuckles and knees

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:23.170
and just trying to learn how wind
goes through sails and eventually

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.693
when all us kids, there was five
of us, got out of school he saved

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.103
up his pennies and bought
a boat that was worthy

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.683
of sailing farther
than just Cape Cod Bay.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.693
He says, "Would you
like to go on a trip?"

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.626
I said, "Are you kidding?

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.093
I would love to".

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.026
And he wanted to sail
from Florida to Guatemala

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.040
and for five months I was on a
boat with my Dad and we sailed

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.053
on a little thirty foot boat
from Florida to Guatemala

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.240
and it was a trip of a life time
and on that trip we just had

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:56.246
so many adventures I
can't even tell you.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.176
We saw you know beautiful scenes
like going through we went

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:02.196
on the Bahamas all over the place.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:04.516
Little light houses and that
light house for the first example

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.476
of how illustration
you're inspired by memories

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:15.163
as an illustrator is just a little
tiny drawing here in the beginning

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.786
of the book and it doesn't
necessarily have to look exactly

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.116
like what I saw as a light house
but I just picture that little read

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.276
and white stripped light house
and I plugged it in right there

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:29.556
and you just start putting in your
own memories as well as these images

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.966
that you're developing
from reading text.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.383
So there's stuff like that and
then there's stuff like this these,

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:36.023
she talks about living
a little hermitage.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:43.210
I saw I actually for eight bucks a
night folks these little grass huts

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:45.936
and I actually did one of
my first books <i>The Diary</i>

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:48.920
<i>of Victor Frankenstein</i>
it was back in 1997.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.526
I was drawing it while I was
sailing on this trip and when it was

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:56.793
to rough out there, the seas
were to big we would pull

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.813
into these little places and
for eight dollars get one

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.560
of these little huts and I would
sit in there and draw for a day

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:02.813
or two till the storm
kind of settled down

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.440
and that leads into storms.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.240
I saw all kinds of
storms again relating

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:14.443
to that's how Snook is separated
from Oba Jacob by a huge storm

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:15.486
and Oba Jacob has to
take the boat and go

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.740
to the leeward side of an island.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:20.726
So I was thinking about
all my travels during this

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.983
and these little anchorages that's
our boat right there in the middle

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:29.256
of the uninhabited island
in the middle of the ocean.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.120
It was so awesome.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.960
So all this is relating to
the story and I was thinking

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.003
about you know trudging around
the mangroves were snorkeling

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:40.710
and in fact one time he was
just talking about adventures.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.343
I know what the cards going to
say ten minutes left [inaudible]

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:45.620
and I know I got side tracked but
we were snorkeling in this lagoon

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:49.823
and it's a great idea when you
anchor to hop out of the boat

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.083
and dive down and check on your
anchors visually with your mask

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.310
to make sure they're set
because these squalls

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:00.110
and these storms come
through all the time.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.576
So we get down there and make sure

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.710
that [inaudible] anchor is
wedged right in that sand

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.776
and then we say okay lets
just check out the area see

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.110
if there's any good
lobstering around here.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:09.966
My Dad and I were swimming around
this, I mean there's no one around

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.743
and were in there for about
30-45 minutes and were coming

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.830
up to this other shore, this
little coral reef and like

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.570
where you're walking down the
streets sometimes you just feel

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.453
like you get this weird sense where
you just kind of want to turn around

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.343
and feel like there's somebody
there it's just human nature sudden

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:28.976
instincts and I had
that, I turned around

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.416
and there was this huge
bull shark right there.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:35.026
He just like his from his throat
to the top of his head was

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.360
like that deep the pecks
were open just like you see

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.413
on Discovery Channel and we weren't
snorkeling we were just I mean we

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.886
weren't scuba diving we were
snorkeling and so we had

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.166
to keep coming to the
surface and he's right there

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:48.340
and my Dad he kept tugging
on my fins here and there

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:51.803
like he's joking about
the shark thing.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:54.143
I poked him in the ribs
told him to go up looked

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:56.443
at him one time took my
snorkel and said big shark.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.536
We put our heads down there
it was going broadside right

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.150
in front of us.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.100
I had caught a barracuda and
to keep it fresh I hung it

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:05.866
over the side of the sail boat.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.133
I forgot all about it, it
was dumb, it was a bad move.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.733
We were so excited to get in the
water so we started swimming back

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.480
to the boat because we said if we
stay on shore were going to be there

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.453
for weeks trying to make
a raft out of coconuts,

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.260
there's no help here we
better get this done now.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.503
So we swam very calmly back to the
boat in the middle and I could see

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:28.976
that crystal clear water.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:29.776
I could see the barracuda
hanging down

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:31.510
and another shark under the boat.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:33.576
We get up onto the boat, I slopped

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.556
up onto the dingy the little
zodiac we had, Dad tried to climb

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.083
up the little latter on the
back of the transom with his,

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.676
I joke about it all the time,
he's got his flippers on they're

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.370
that long, the latter's got about
that much room between the latter

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:47.160
and the transom, he
crawled up on his knees

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.606
with his flippers peeled back
like little onions and we looked

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.820
in the water, ripped our masks off
and there were three bull sharks

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:55.840
that circled our boat for
like forty-five minutes

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.626
and I'm recalling all this because
Snook was looking for little fish

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.950
and stuff in these little
tidal pools in this island

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.893
and Marilyn describes like being
aware of these little baby sharks

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.516
that are prowling around, these
little predators and stuff.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:18.110
So I literally had deep thoughts
for like to be inside Snook's mind

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:20.153
as well as like having my dog
memories and all that kind of stuff.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.470
You know heres like a little spiney
lobster we caught so she describes

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.820
like creatures and stuff in there
so these all related and I was

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.800
so excited so as an illustrator the
way I like to work is from memory.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:37.300
All day long I look at stuff I
stare at things I'm defiantly one

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:41.076
of those guys that gets,
stops to smell the roses,

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:44.663
I stop and smell the
roses I start to look

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.033
under the rose bush every bodies
already ten minutes ahead um there's

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.480
a turtle and I'm at the rose bush
for like a half hour and late again.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.760
So I like to take those memories and
try to draw without looking at scrap

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.086
of course I had to look up here
what does a rat terrier look like

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.480
and I loved that he had floppy ears,

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:05.350
I love floppy ears
rather than pointy ears.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:11.543
So I started drawing and I was
on this trip, I was in Kansas

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.123
and the first drawing
that came out of Oba Jacob

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.710
and I don't think I've shown
you this yet it was on a napkin.

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.450
I'm going to have big slides,
I do school presentations

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.000
and I'll have this on PowerPoint,
these will be big and colorful

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:25.890
but for now I just because of the
time we didn't have PowerPoint

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:29.873
but write on the napkin then I
bought a bagel I was in the airport

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.123
and I opened up the
bagel bag and laid it out

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:35.330
and just started doing my
first sketches on the back

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:41.263
of the bagel bag of Oba Jacob
and I love this little kind

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:46.096
of round shape, this little round
head and the monk kind of shape

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.053
and so I brought those back
to the studio and got started

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:54.963
on the sketches and that's the whole
way it all started happening for me

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:59.303
and I recalled this trip you know
the adventures that I've been

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.163
on while illustrating this thing

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.080
and there's an image
of you know the storm.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:07.750
I don't know if I can find
everything here right away but.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.846
Here's when they go on the adventure
and they get this assignment

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.213
to catalog the plant and animal life
on the surrounding atoll islands

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:20.800
and that's just what my dog used to
do you know go right up to the bow

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:22.840
and his ears would be flapping
in the wind just like you said

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.106
and I could it was just like
illustrating is hard I mean

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.953
when you have a blank white piece
of paper its hard sometimes an hour

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:37.140
or two goes by and nothing good
happens you know you got your it

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.376
takes a long time to
finally start making

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:44.476
so I lie this first scribbling
but with Marilyn's writing things,

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.530
I had that image in my head
and I know about the storms

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.056
and holding a boat into the waves.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.340
You know if you have the transom
of that boat with the waves coming

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:54.473
like this the waves smash against
that flat part of the transom

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:58.500
and water gushes up into the boat

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:00.660
and you can swamp and
sink your boat.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.140
So just like I was enjoying

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.406
that I could draw these little
you know heres a couple of guys

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.570
that were helping out and they're
holding this boat with the bow

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:12.510
into the wind and you know
I love all this stuff.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:13.623
You know Snook was busy
snorting around for rats

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:21.043
and so there he is just howling into
the wind and it's just helpless.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.103
He is officially separated
from his buddy.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:30.776
So and then mornings I love like
going surfing early in the morning,

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:31.633
first light fishing, walking
down a big open beach,

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.113
I don't know if you've ever
been to Cape Cod miles and miles

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.553
of beautiful beach that are just
untouched and there's no cottages

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.913
or anything just beautiful dunes
and all those memories you know come

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.893
through when I'm doing that and
just almost everything in there is

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.353
from things I've experienced and
even though being on Diego Garcia

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.440
to see these like coconut crabs,
these giant crabs and stuff.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.506
So for you guys that are looking
for a little adventure and a lot

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.320
of emotion this story
is really cool and Snook

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.596
when he is alone he really does
have all these cool things happen

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.723
and like there's the shark
one where he's like looking

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:14.296
around his little tidal
pools and stuff like that.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.023
I wonder how much, where are
we at for time right now?

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:23.810
Where's our timer?

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.210
We have 15 minutes left?

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.596
Okay so we were going to
save some time for questions

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:32.746
and answers would you guys
like to ask the questions?

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.910
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: I would
like to say one thing first.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.596
I just want to say that although
every book has several levels

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.880
of meaning and although this
book is an adventure story

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.470
about a dog that's left
on an island it's kind

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.310
of a dog version of Robinson Crusoe.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.980
On one level that's all it
is, is an adventure story

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:07.003
but as I said it began for me with
a friendship with a former monk

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.793
who has himself sailed, he sailed
once from Southern Africa to Brazil

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.533
on a sailboat with four other people
and he's a man whose had adventures

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.973
but for me the book
began with the idea

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.273
that it could teach
young people something

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.166
about what it means to pray.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.040
The Snook belongs to a monk

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.386
and so he has spent his whole
life following the rhythms

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:47.623
of the monk's life, which is
a rhythm of work and prayer.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.763
So that when Snook is left alone

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.676
on the island he conducts
his work as usual.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:58.116
His work is to catch rats that's
what he does, he's a rat terrier

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:02.343
but the work is punctuated by
periods when he sits on the beach

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:07.170
and listens to the waves when
the waves become like the sound

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.573
of his breath and he sits there
longing for his friend, his Oba

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.236
and I had hoped that
this would be a book

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:26.576
which would enable grownups reading
it to children to talk a little bit

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.866
about what it means to long
for someone who loves you

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.000
and who you know is out
there but you cant see them.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:37.026

is the good stuff folks.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:40.266
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: I'm
hoping that there are

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.173
that it's a story with
a couple of layers.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.426
It's not necessary to read that
second layer into the story

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:55.103
because it's a terrific adventure
but it's possible to use this story

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.626
as a way of thinking
about something else

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.656
in our universal human experience.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:08.223
So I don't know whether I have a
minute to read a little tiny bit.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.663

Oh yeah, yes, yes.

&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering:
This is awesome.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:17.316
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: This is
the beginning of the time,

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:24.390
the book begins by describing
the life of Snook with his Oba,

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:32.260
what they do every day and then it
describes how they get separated

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:37.016
and this is the beginning
of Snook's aloneness.

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:44.810
In the morning there were only
faint sips of his friends scent left

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.080
for Snook to drink
in here and there.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.343
He sat on the beach watching a band

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.936
of clear sky filled
with streaming light.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.500
Snook was thirsty he sniffed
past the squealing rats and mice

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:08.003
and the nesting birds, quack,
quack as they rose in alarm

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.813
and formed a black spiral overhead.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.186
He followed his nose to a
sandy hollow in a circle

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.813
of velvet leafed Argusia bushes.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.923
There he dug attentively
at first then as the scent

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:31.723
of fresh water grew stronger he
dug furiously making the sand fly.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:38.490
At last he lapped sweet water
then he made his well larger

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.273
and drank and drank.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.540
On his way back down to the
beach he marked many trees.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:52.146

enough now we can have question

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.020
and answer.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.553
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: Yes.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.353
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering:
Can you read just one more?

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.020
We can't give the ending away.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:06.220
The ending is just like fabulous.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.553
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson:
I read from the book

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.620
on the day it was published
I read the first part of it

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.153
and then I thought well
that's enough I had read

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:14.380
about five pages a man said no
how does it end, how does it end.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:18.340
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering:
This is a good one.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.273
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: I read one more
page then this is a description

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.620
of the sea turtles come
ashore to lay their eggs.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.443

There are sharks too!

[ Laughter ]

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.280
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson:
Maybe should I read now.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:37.840
By afternoon the northwest
beach had been scored by dozens

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.120
of carapaces the high dry
sand dug up and covered

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.020
by many graceless flippers.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.716
But one last turtle
was still digging.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.640
Snook lay in the scant shade of
a Ceriana and watched her labor.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.400
Her beak opened as
if to pant she dug

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.740
with one rear flipper
and one healed stump.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.910
Her eyes half closed streamed tears.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.376
She seemed as old as the world.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.506
She laid dozens of eggs,
covered them with sand

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:26.656
and as dark fell dragged
her weight back to the deep.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:30.216
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering:
Is that like good or what?

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:34.756
That is such much good writing.

[ Applause ]

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.460
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering: And
then Snook's alone again

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:39.526
like even his little
sea turtle friend

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:41.393
that he had for a coupe of minutes.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.060
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: It's something
I read about sea turtles is

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.993
that when they come ashore
nobody can explain why they weep.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.153
They weep tears and
so the weeping eyes

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.616
of the sea turtle become
something inside of Snook

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.056
in his heart it fills him

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.840
with compassion again this is
the second layer of meaning.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.040
On one layer it's just a sea turtle.

words make illustrating so fun

an assignment like that

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:22.303
to work with words like that.

don't, I hopefully have left

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:37.716
at least a couple of
minutes for a couple

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:41.450
of questions, if there
are questions.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:46.696
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering:
Oh wait we have a...

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:52.730
&gt;&gt; So much and I was
wondering don't you have a book

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:54.756
about George Washington
Carver, is that who he is?

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:57.746
That is one of my absolutely
favorite books so its not a question

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.810
but I just wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate that book

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.743
and I use that with my
students who are going

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:06.556
to be teachers all the
time and we all love it.

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:10.330
Thank you.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.130
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: Great, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.530
I think about Carver a lot lately

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:20.223
because among his inventions were
gasoline made out of peanuts,

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:27.540
motor oil made out of peanuts and
there was something just recently

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.366
that was, oh someone is
starting to make some kind

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:37.250
of a peanut based food for
famine, something about some place

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.506
in like Kenya where
people, there's a famine

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.996
and somebodies made
this peanut based,

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.503
Carver did that sixty years ago.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.693
Exactly the same thing, but
her never, he's not connected

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:55.073
to his discoveries because he
didn't sell the formula he gave them

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.260
away free.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.926
So I read all the time about things
that new people are making money on

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:04.480
but they're really Carver inventions
that were made in the forties.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.173
So thanks for mentioning that book.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.556
&gt;&gt; I wondered if you had any pets.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:17.503
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson:
I grew up with dogs.

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:21.236
I had lots of dogs in my lifetime.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.346
My, I'm not sure, I had
two who were wonderful.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.746
One was an Irish setter and one
was a miniature pincher miniature

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.713
Doberman but my Irish
setter was a genius dog

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.346
and she was scarily
intelligent, really so yeah, you?

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.443
&gt;&gt; We have two kitties and
they're pretty smart to.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:47.270
They learned how to open
up their food box so.

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:49.573
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: Yeah you don't
want a pet that's quite that smart.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:52.876
Yeah I had a friend who
had a dog that learned how

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.496
to open the refrigerator.

00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:58.370
[ Laughter ]

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:00.436
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering:
I had a goat and a rat.

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:01.623
A pet goat we used to
go clamming with it.

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:04.586
Everybody's like that not a
dog they're with that's a goat.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.053
&gt;&gt; I guess you have to put
a lock on the refrigerator.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.020
I'm curious you mention that
you start out with drawing

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.393
but then later on when you go

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.926
to the finished illustrations
what medium do you use?

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.786
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering: I use
acrylic a lot because I do like to,

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.060
I use actually all kinds of mediums,
oil and acrylics and charcoals

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:25.990
and inks and everything but
I do use acrylics a lot.

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:31.290
One reason I like them is
you can create layers quicker

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:36.166
with the acrylics because I
use heat guns and water bottles

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.443
to spray them, like kind of a road
paint, and then a rusty erosion

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:43.670
with heat kind of like a hair dryer.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:48.890
And then you can quickly add
layers on to that and it's still

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:49.736
in that same session not waiting
for oil layers to dry and stuff so.

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.770
Acrylics mostly I'd say.

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.656
&gt;&gt; Hi the text comes first right
and the pictures come afterwards

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.793
so you don't change the text
I assume it stays what it is

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.466
but did you guys ever
argue about the pictures?

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:15.480
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering: I don't
think we've ever argued ever.

was one very small thing

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:28.736
because as we've both said Oba
the Oba is a real person and so

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.686
when the first sketches came
to me I sent them to my friend

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.396
and my friend is a
monk but he's vain.

know the Oba's a little bit rotund

we changed one of the
sketches here we thinned him

out a little bit yeah, yeah.

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:03.643

little it's not even a question,

that you created drew me

who was going to be speaking.

when you're writing just making art

almost you're an introvert.

I'm able to speak for myself but
like I do hear similar things.

and you're trying to create

for a lot of hours alone trying

you know my eyes get glassy

that because you have this

is so awesome and to hear comments

was I think that was NASA light

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.056
because we checked in there because
of a big storm we were headed

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.970
to the Berry Islands at
that time and I think.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.196
Have you been to NASA.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.186
&gt;&gt; There's two yeah ones in
Hopetown Elbow Key in the Bahamas.

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:09.036
The second question is how
did you originally come

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:11.010
to your collaboration, how
did you two get together?

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:14.856
Did you know your work,
was it your publishers,

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:17.523
agents, how did it happen?

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:18.536
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering:
Well from what I'm finding

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:24.043
that the publisher puts authors
and illustrators together

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.346
and because we hadn't
met before the book

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:33.856
and Marilyn sends the manuscript in
and Candlewick press is who we work

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:39.070
with they just have an arsenal
of illustrators and writers

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:41.703
and they kind of know
everybody's style

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:43.543
and they approached me they read
it first and said Tim might have,

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:47.436
because you know I
developed a friendship

00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:50.866
with my editor Karen [inaudible]
is the president over at Candlewick

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:53.170
and they more you know about each
other kind of the better it is

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:57.170
because she knows my love of
adventures and sailing and water

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:03.476
and all kinds of stuff so that's
how you're placed a lot of times

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:04.256
without even meeting
sometimes till the end.

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.036
&gt;&gt; Thank you both very much.

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:11.036
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: Thank
you all for coming.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:14.660
[ Applause ]

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:15.926
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering: Thank you.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.966
