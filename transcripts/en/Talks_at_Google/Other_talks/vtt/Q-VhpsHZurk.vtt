SPEAKER 1: Hi everyone.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.080
I'm very, very excited to
welcome to Google Michael

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.260
Kupperman, who's going to be
talking about his new book "All

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.320
the Answers" and about his
family's history with "Quiz

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.370
Kids" and the early days
of celebrity culture.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.670
Mr. Kupperman is an Eisner
winning cartoonist, author.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.189
He's done video stuff.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.660
I've been a big fan
of his for many years.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.210
But I think there's no better
place to start with his work

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.640
than his new book,
"All the Answers."

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.780
Mr. Kupperman.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.720
MICHAEL KUPPERMAN:
Thank you, Alex.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.760
Thank you.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.070
Hello.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.040
OK.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.951
Are we-- Are we alive?

00:00:56.951 --> 00:00:57.450
Hi.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.190
OK.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.030
Great.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.020
Hello.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.670
I'm very excited to be here.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.400
My family uses
Google all the time.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.060
And my son is obsessed with it,
in particular, Google Street

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.960
View.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.600
He's always telling me, he's
just seen the Google Street

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.890
View car.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.530
And sometimes, he
turns out to be right.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.590
Google is also part of the
story I'm about to tell you,

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.480
the story of how
I created my book,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.660
"All the Answers," which
came out in May of this year.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.720
On the cover, it's
called a graphic memoir.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.470
But I sometimes think
a better description

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.380
might be graphic auto noir.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.600
In some ways it's
a detective story,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.970
one in which an
individual-- me--

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.610
discovers-- investigates the
past of a member of his family,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.910
but in doing so discovers
the hidden limitations

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.980
that have dominated his life.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.510
My name is Michael Kupperman.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.730
For most of my career,
I've been a humorist,

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.460
underground comic
artist, and Illustrator.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.640
You might have seen my work
in or on the "New Yorker,"

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.180
"Fortune," the "New York
Times," "Adult Swim," "Vice,"

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.300
"Saturday Night Live,"
"Heavy Metal," "Playboy,"

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.160
and many other places.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.740
Until recently, all
my sequential work

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.930
has been humorous,
until this book.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.970
In 2010, my father,
Joel Kupperman,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.020
retired from the
University of Connecticut,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.420
where he had taught
for 50 years.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.050
He seemed more relaxed
than he had ever been.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.660
Things that used to bother
him didn't trouble him at all,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.250
or so it seemed.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.990
And when I asked if he could
talk to me about his childhood,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.570
he said he wouldn't mind.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.930
This was huge.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.690
His formative years had been a
forbidden subject in my family

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.030
for my entire life.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.370
All the way through my
childhood, any mention of them

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.239
would visibly upset him.

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.030
I was astonished that
I might have a chance

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.820
to finally hear something
from him about his life when

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.790
he'd been a Quiz Kid.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.150
"Quiz Kids" was a show
that was on national radio

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.430
and then on national TV.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.020
On it, five children
would compete

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.720
to answer questions
sent in by listeners.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.840
My father had first appeared on
it when he was five years old

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.420
and had stayed on
it until he was 16.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.660
I'm going to play you two quick
excerpts of the radio version.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.010
I've edited these way down.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.620
But even so, you'll be able to
tell that entertainment back

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.950
then moved at a different,
more leisurely pace.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.084
This is how the show opened.

That's the first question
for the Quiz Kids tonight.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.850

folks at home can

- I had 33 and 1/2.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.690
I was just a little
bit off there.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.649
I'm sorry.

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:32.940

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.050
get together with the judge
and explain it to him?

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.141

multiply it by 2, and then--

that by 3 and 1/7.

MICHAEL KUPPERMAN: My father
had a reported IQ of 219

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.950
and could do sophisticated
math tricks in his head.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.630
The press promoted
him as a genius

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.030
equal to Einstein and Socrates.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.670
During most of World War
II, he was a household name

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.560
and universally beloved.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.270

every month, making appearances
and selling war bonds.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.600
This is my father's schedule.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.340

where they'd compete

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.780

movie stars, professors,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.480
scientists.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.520
They toured military
and Naval institutions,

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.130
visited hospitals,
posed for pictures,

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.830
and sat on strangers laps a lot.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.910
By the end of the war, they had
raised more than $120 million

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.710
for the war effort.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.800
I had not understood how
famous he really was.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.540
I had known-- we
all knew-- that he

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.460
had been on radio
and then TV for years

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.950
and that it hadn't
been fun for him.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.980
I'd heard his name mentioned
on "Rocky and Bullwinkle."

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.100
I'd seen him mocked
in "Radio Days."

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.980
I'd been told he'd been an
inspiration for Salinger.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.990
But all these are just details.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.570
I'd never understood the
context for his fame.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.880
And fame without
context is meaningless.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.490
His fame had seemed
meaningless to me.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.950
This was one of the things
I wanted to understand.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.830
And I wanted to try to make
a connection with my father.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.650
We'd never had a real
relationship as adults.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.040
And I thought this would
bring us closer together.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.720
As it turned out, now that he
could tell me his perspective,

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.750
he couldn't remember
most of it anyway.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.440
He'd had experiences that seemed
fantastical and impossibly

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.010
glamorous.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.320
But all he'd wanted
to do was forget them.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.110
He remembered that he thought
Jack Benny genuinely didn't

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.280
like him.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.190
Everything else was vague,
a memory of a memory.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.290
The one thing that
he was emphatic about

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.630
was he wasn't a real prodigy.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.910
He'd been built up by the
producers of "Quiz Kids"

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.400
as pro-Semitic propaganda.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.820
Once he'd said it out loud, he
repeated it to me every time

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.800
I saw him for the
next few months.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.100
It was the war, and they
wanted a cute Jewish child.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.110
He'd obviously been
thinking about it--

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.950
that one aspect of
it-- for decades.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.380
This idea took a long
time to sink into my mind,

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.120
partly because I'd
been raised not

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.010
to think of myself as Jewish.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.450
My mother is Scandinavian.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.210
And when we'd gone to
churches, they'd been Lutheran.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.610
But when I started to think
about my father's Jewishness,

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.410
and I plugged this
idea into his story,

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.076
it suddenly made
so much more sense.

00:08:16.076 --> 00:08:17.700
The sentimentality
which surrounded him

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.080
took on a more
charged symbolic tone.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.410
A fairly cute kid who
can do math quite well

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.750
has never been such a big
deal at any other time

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.230
in American history.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.070
It could only have happened
with a Jewish child during a war

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.070
that many people saw as
a fight to save Jews.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.940
I think there were
other things going on.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.169
A lowering infant mortality
rate and the spread of media

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:39.210
meant that children
could be appreciated

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.340
for their adorableness
instead of being grimly

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.320
shepherded into adulthood.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.630
But the Jewishness was
certainly a big part

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.180
of my father's appeal.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.000
I still wasn't sure what kind of
story I would be able to tell.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.530
But after my father
was diagnosed

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:56.034
with dementia in December 2012,
I decided I was going to try.

00:08:56.034 --> 00:08:58.200
I thought maybe I could do
research and confront him

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.060
with truths I had discovered.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.300
And this would unlock
memories or perhaps even slow

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.340
or reverse his dementia.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.790
I didn't know then that
this wasn't possible.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.710
The basic story was obvious.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.080
My grandmother was an
ambitious stage mother

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.390
who'd pushed my father
into show business.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.940
He'd been a sensation on
"Quiz Kids" when he'd started.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.920
But he stayed on
the show too long,

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.410
until he was an
awkward teenager on TV,

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.210
where everyone could see him.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.790
I'm going to show you a short
clip of him answering questions

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.280
on the TV version
when he was 15.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.560
The guest host is Fran Allison.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.630
This show was being broadcast
at this time on NBC at 8:30 PM

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.454
on Fridays.

00:09:37.454 --> 00:09:38.120
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.270
- Take out 1 cup from
the coffee to the milk.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:46.200
You'll have x plus
1 cups in the milk.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.610
And of those x plus 1 cups, x
are coffee, and 1 is of milk.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:10:00.270
So when you transfer a cup back,
of that cup, 1 over x plus 1

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:06.250
will be of coffee, while x
over x plus 1 will be of milk.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.930
So if you take the 1 over
x plus 1 away from the 1,

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.890
you'd-- let's see, x plus 1--
you'd get x over x plus 1 cups

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.157
of coffee left in the milk.

00:10:15.157 --> 00:10:16.990
And you'd have that
much milk in the coffee.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.894
So it'd come out even.

00:10:18.894 --> 00:10:20.310
- You know, Joel,
if one were just

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.434
determined to find out the
answer to this question,

00:10:22.434 --> 00:10:25.078
it would be much cheaper to
have someone like you around.

00:10:25.078 --> 00:10:28.110
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.360
MICHAEL KUPPERMAN: Other
kids hated my father by then,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.470
because their parents had all
told them to be more like him.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.270
After finally leaving
the show, his life

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.700
had been hell until he left
the country for a while.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.590
I wanted to know more.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:45.360
During 2013 and 2014, I spent
countless hours researching.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.480
In the real world, I visited
Paley Center and their library,

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.550
where the librarian
Jane Klain showed me

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.050
the typewritten
notes that were kept

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.530
on index cards of
early NBC broadcasts,

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.690
and Columbia
University, where I went

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.020
through the bequested papers
of the "Quiz Kid" producer.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:05.010
But most of my research during
that time was done online.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.650
And Google was the net
I used to pull material

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.870
from the vast ocean
of the internet.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.060
I'd follow basic
search terms for hours,

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.980
discovering new facts
or details that I'd

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.170
use to refine my next search.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:17.790
I'd discover a
hint of something,

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.440
follow it to a certainty,
hunt for the evidence.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.650
I scoured old radio sites,
news archives, auction sites,

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.870
and anywhere that
had information.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.270
I searched Google
News and Google Books,

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.570
sometimes quite frustrated
by the cryptic snippet

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.460
views of 70-year-old books.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.410
But I found out quite a lot.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.750
To give an example,
I noticed a quote

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.200
by Orson Wells that suggested
he had met my father.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.390
I searched obsessively until
I found an entire newspaper

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.180
column about my father meeting
Marlene Dietrich and Orson

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.230
Wells.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:48.250
I kept searching.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.400
And I never found a picture of
my dad with Marlene Dietrich,

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.520
but I did find this picture on
an auction site of Orson Wells

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.450
doing a magic trick for him.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.850
My father looks delighted,
but if you follow his eyes,

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.970
you can see he's looking
off to the right.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.130
Because of the newspaper
account of this moment,

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.560
I know that at
this exact second,

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.560
someone off camera to the right
has told him Orson has rabbits

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.270
and he can pet them.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.000
He wasn't interested in or
impressed by Orson Wells

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.250
and his magic at
all, although Orson

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.280
didn't take it personally.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.111
There are kinds of
research you can do now

00:12:20.111 --> 00:12:22.360
on the internet that would
have been at the very least

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.090
extremely difficult in the past,
and very likely impossible.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.150
You can trace the
history of an idea,

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.190
for example, the idea
of child prodigy,

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.990
first used in the second
half of the 19th century.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.170
And you can trace the
origins of untruths.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.090
A lot of the cute
things my father said

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.499
were obviously made up.

00:12:38.499 --> 00:12:40.540
And in fact, I've been
able to trace some of them

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.290
to scripted dialogue my father
delivered in radio shows.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:47.320
Sometimes another Quiz Kid
will say something clever.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.810
And within a few weeks it's
being reported as something

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.430
my father said.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.860
It definitely seems,
looking at all the evidence,

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.740
that my father's specialness was
being deliberately exaggerated

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.040
by some columnists
and reporters.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.200
One person I became aware
of through the internet

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.130
was the brilliant producer of
"Quiz Kids," Lewis G Cowan, who

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.620
as it turned out was one
of the people in charge

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.260
of American radio propaganda
during the war, which

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.970
seemed like a huge
coincidence given

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.260
what my father had been saying
and everything I had noticed.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.890
Lewis G Cowan, born Cohen,
was a fascinating person.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.920
A very smart man, he later
invented the television game

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.340
show with "$64,000 Question"
and became president

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.590
of CBS's television division.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.409
After leaving "Quiz
Kids" and the country,

00:13:31.409 --> 00:13:32.950
my father came back
to television one

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.930
more time to appear
on the spin-off

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:40.150
of Cowan's show, "The $64,000
Challenge," a CBS TV program.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.980
Apparently, the show
had been rigged.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.410
Although my father claimed
barely to remember,

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.000
he insisted only that I
shouldn't tell anyone.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.600
Lewis G Cowan had had an
enormous amount of influence

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.920
on my father's life.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.130
And my father didn't
remember him at all.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.590
But as I was
starting to realize,

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.110
my father's
pre-dementia memory gaps

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.030
meant more than I had seen.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.130
To not remember
your crazy showbiz

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.320
experiences when
you were 6 or 7--

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.060
that could be said to be normal.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.950
But he'd claim not to
remember a lot of stuff

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.710
from when he'd been a teenager
and in his 20s that it

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.500
seemed would have been
impossible to forget--

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.510
being violently bullied
by your roommates

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:20.980
at college, for instance.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.380
I found descriptions online
by a former roommate,

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.620
who'd become a passionate
racist and white nationalist.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.500
But my father denied that the
bullying had ever happened.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.780
The racist seemed quite crazy.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.400
But I believed him.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.770
My father had erased
memories from his mind

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.710
because they were too
much for him to handle.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.170
The real story was beginning
to appear in front of me.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.120
And the story was trauma.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.877
Even if I couldn't find
details of his experiences,

00:14:46.877 --> 00:14:48.460
I could see their
shape in the imprint

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.207
that had remained on him.

00:14:50.207 --> 00:14:51.790
And I couldn't stop
thinking about how

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:54.520
the kid I kept reading about
and listening to in old radio

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.220
recordings was in some ways
a very different person

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.720
from the father I knew.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.140
The kid loved baseball.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.220
He loved comedy and could
be extremely funny himself.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.960
He could play the piano.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.230
I had never seen or heard
my father mention baseball,

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.940
perform comedy,
or play the piano,

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.480
or even let on that he could.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.280
Decades earlier, he
had told my mother

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.540
his game show experience.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.539
And between what she
remembered and my research,

00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:20.320
I was able to put
together how the game

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.710
show had tricked my father
into feeling dishonest.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.330
He'd come back
this one last time,

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.000
because suddenly game shows
were paying big money.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.620
And he thought he'd
be smart and do

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.230
what he'd done for a
decade one last time

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.720
and make some money
for his future.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.690
He'd only made $18,000
from "Quiz Kids."

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.390
And people were easily making
10 times that in one week

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.980
on the bigger shows.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.249
He didn't know that the
sponsors had seized control

00:15:44.249 --> 00:15:45.790
of the process and
demanded the right

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.760
to choose the winners
through dishonest means.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.920
His first appearance on
the show went smoothly.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.540
And the sponsor
must have liked him,

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.407
because before the next show,
another contestant approached

00:15:55.407 --> 00:15:57.490
him and showed him facts
in a book that turned out

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.280
to be the answers to
that night's question.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.290
There's no recording
of the show.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.330
But I'm quite sure
that my father only

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.600
realized what was happening when
he was live on air answering

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.952
the question.

00:16:08.952 --> 00:16:10.660
He would have gone
ahead and answered it.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.220
And then he left,
making it clear

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.590
he wouldn't be back,
with the producers almost

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.260
certainly begging him
not to say anything.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.580
He was never on TV again and
refused all interview requests

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.140
for the rest of his life.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.720
He became a philosopher
and devoted himself

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.675
to studying character,
morality, and ethics.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.170
It had definitely
been his mother

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:37.160
that had setup that last
disastrous TV appearance.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.960
Who knows if she
knew it was rigged

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.700
or would have cared if she did.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.890
She still dreamed that he
could become a television

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.980
personality, even after it
was clear he was really not

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.800
suited for it and hated
everything about it.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.220
This was something else online
news archives showed me,

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.200
that my grandmother had
maintained friendships

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.600
with newspaper columnists
and was feeding them

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.840
items about my father in
hopes of stoking interest.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.370
She couldn't stop.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.710
She couldn't let it go.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.450
A couple of years
after his quiz show

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.750
experience, the whole enterprise
came crashing to the ground,

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.329
as seen in the movie,
"Quiz Show," a movie

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.400
my father refused to see.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.530
During the hearings,
"Quiz Kids" was brought up

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:19.040
as a show that had maybe
not been completely honest.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.109
The kids had been
softballed questions

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:23.670
about subjects they
knew very well.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:27.319
And again, my grandmother was
eager to talk to the press.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:31.040
After all this, I don't think
he ever really forgave her.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.725
And yet I don't think he could
ever admit this to himself.

00:17:36.344 --> 00:17:37.760
Now I know that I
should have been

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.430
able to see the size
of his fame reflected

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.957
in the size of his trauma.

00:17:41.957 --> 00:17:43.790
And now that I could
see the effects on him,

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.149
I couldn't stop noticing
the effects on me.

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:48.440
The man I'd thought of as a
mild-mannered and repressed

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.500
professor was a
traumatized ex-child-star.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.890
The timeline of my life
suddenly looked very different.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.387
I interviewed my
father one last time,

00:17:57.387 --> 00:17:58.970
trying to get some
reaction out of him

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:00.350
with everything I'd learned.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:01.790
I couldn't stop
myself from asking

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.940
why he hadn't helped me with
homework like his father had.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.640
What he said next
still rings in my ears.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.230
Nobody told me I was supposed to
build a relationship with you.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.810
In a way, he was more
honest than he'd ever been.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.644
This was our last
coherent conversation.

00:18:18.644 --> 00:18:19.310
Let me be clear.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:22.470
I did an enormous amount of
research on this project.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.500
But one of the main
things I did was think--

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.100
really think-- about my
father and my family.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.380
Obviously, by this time,
I was wrestling with a lot

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.310
of emotions about it.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:35.240
But I felt ready to start
trying to make a book.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.120
Between 2013 and
the middle of 2015,

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.360
I produced three drafts
which weren't good enough.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.990
This was a very painful period
as I tried to shape this story

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.880
and wrestled with my feelings.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.800
What I was doing wasn't working.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.990
And I couldn't figure
out how to fix it.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.030
The thing that really
saved me was cleaning out

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.930
my parents' house in
Mansfield, Connecticut.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.300
My wife and I had,
by this point,

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.450
spent years in cleaning out
the house, which my parents had

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.215
largely abandoned, partly
out of filial obligation

00:19:05.215 --> 00:19:06.590
and partly because
we were trying

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:09.320
to use it as some version
of a vacation house.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.840
But it was uncomfortable,
too far away

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.170
from New York, and always
more work than it was worth.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.270
It was horribly full of stuff.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:20.550
My parents had never
thrown anything away.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:24.680
I threw mountains of junk
away, recycled it, burned it,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.030
filled dumpsters.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:27.950
And there was always more.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.500
But finally, it yielded results.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.540
In a corner of my
father's study,

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:36.010
well hidden in a secret
space behind other books,

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.810
were five scrap books that
my father had obviously

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.470
hidden decades earlier
and then forgotten.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.950
Even when he'd wanted to
help me uncover his past,

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.870
he hadn't remembered them.

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.570
They turned out to contain
an exhaustive record

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.910
of my father's
"Quiz Kid" career--

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:57.440
newspaper clippings,
itineraries, tickets, scripts,

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:03.830
photographs, passes, autographs,
an avalanche of paper.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.680
One of them turned out to
belong to his sister, my Aunt

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.740
Harriet, who had briefly
been a "Quiz Kid" herself.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.180
It hadn't lasted though.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.070
And she'd been given
the role of being

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.980
a housekeeper for her father,
so her mother and brother

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.030
could go touring around and
meeting Hollywood stars.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.780
She obviously hadn't
wanted her scrapbook.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.150
And it was easy
to understand why.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.460
There was a lot of
withheld information--

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.850
emotion in these scrapbooks,
a lot of frustrated hopes.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.760
And they were full of
information and insights.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.770
The way that they'd
been so well-concealed

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.110
and completely forgotten
was very telling.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.350
They brought new life to the
story I was trying to tell.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:42.710
And in fact, their discovery
provided a narrative jolt that

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.540
starts the engine of my book.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.450
It was an incredibly lucky find.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:48.920
By now I could see
most of the book

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.480
and set about doing a new draft.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.910
The price I was going to have
to pay was becoming obvious.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.310
The story was my discovery
of how my father's fame had

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.820
traumatized him, and it had made
a real relationship between us

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.200
impossible.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.420
The whole process had
changed the way I saw him,

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.970
but also the way I saw myself,
because I now saw how I

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.770
had been shaped by his trauma.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.920
And I was going to relive
those feelings nearly every day

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.560
as I worked on this book,
because I had to feel them

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.020
in order to express them.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.660
The main goal was I wanted
people to read this book

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.500
and feel some of what I'd
felt and not be bored by it.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.300
My goal was to create
a graphic novel that

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.970
could be very easily read,
that would not be boring,

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.010
and would convey emotion.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.740
From this point on, there
were multiple drafts,

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.890
and drafts within drafts, as I
tweaked and reworked elements

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:35.780
and removed excess material.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.940
By now I knew this
was not really

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.030
a book about old show
business or the war or TV.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.460
This book was about
fathers and sons.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.360
I had my theme.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.040
And the story was
coming into focus.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.490
And everything
extraneous had to go.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.910
The next draft, which is
the one my agent sold,

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.520
was different from the
finished book in some ways.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.380
The original art was
much larger-- at least

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:58.820
double page size.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.220
And I was portrayed
realistically.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.929
This was intensely
difficult for me.

00:22:02.929 --> 00:22:04.970
I am one of those people
who has a lot of trouble

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:06.170
with their self-image.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.810
I cannot see a photograph of
myself without getting upset

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:12.320
with how ugly I am, how poor
my posture is, how fat I am.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.330
This is an issue I have
struggled with but never

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:15.329
overcome.

00:22:15.329 --> 00:22:17.120
I was determined to
try, though, to come up

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.599
with a realistic
likeness of myself.

00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:21.140
Of course, I could
photograph myself.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.990
But I still had problems with
realizing my physical shape.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.940
So first I drew my
shadow, my shape,

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.837
and I started to
work from there.

00:22:27.837 --> 00:22:29.420
Ultimately, though,
I decided it would

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.250
be best to come up with
a version of myself

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.710
that would seem more
universal and the reader

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.942
could identify with more easily.

00:22:35.942 --> 00:22:37.400
It was a boundary
I struggled with.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.890
And ultimately this book
involves my feelings,

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.330
but it's not about me.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.024
It's about him.

00:22:43.024 --> 00:22:43.940
That's what I decided.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.064
But there's a later point
in the book's development

00:22:46.064 --> 00:22:50.310
where that was underlined
more decisively.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.670
This draft of the book
was delivered to my agent

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:57.710
in July of 2016 and sold by the
end of August to Gallery 13,

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.636
a subsidiary of
Simon &amp; Schuster.

00:22:59.636 --> 00:23:01.010
I was given an
advance that would

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:04.100
have seemed enormous 10 or
15 years earlier, but not now

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.580
with a family and with a
deadline less than a year away.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.740
The task of creating this book
seemed literally impossible.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.460
I had never, ever created a
work of this size or pages

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.140
at the rate that
were now required.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.090
I was stricken with terror.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:18.650
Plus the advance
was not large enough

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.590
so I could simply afford
to concentrate on the book.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:23.990
I would have to do other
work at the same time.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:25.730
I can still taste the fear.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.400
It all seemed
absolutely impossible.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.780
Adding to the
terror was the fact

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.230
that I was determined not to use
the computer so much this time

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.730
around.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:35.540
I wanted to do the art and every
bit of the lettering by hand.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.660
I'd been using a computer font
and other assists for a while.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.207
But I felt they never
looked as good or as real.

00:23:42.207 --> 00:23:44.540
I adjusted my attitude and
saw that all of my challenges

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.100
were also opportunities.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.680
I wanted the art in this book
to look spontaneous and loose

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.920
and feel immediate, not tight
and fussed over and distant.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.180
If I took my original art size
down much closer to print size,

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.165
and worked as
quickly as possible,

00:23:58.165 --> 00:24:00.290
maybe it would actually
work better for the feeling

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:01.370
I wanted.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.200
It was also an added
incentive to keep

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.480
images as simple as possible.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.730
I created model sheets of some
characters and backgrounds

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:13.700
I could use, including my
own homemade zip-a-tone.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.470
I was also doing
weekly comic strips

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.867
for two websites,
adultswim.com and "Vice,"

00:24:17.867 --> 00:24:18.950
while I created this book.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.750
But that, too, felt
like an opportunity

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.850
to keep my hand practiced.

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.890
I tried to hypnotize
myself into becoming

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:27.230
a machine of comics creation.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:32.000
I probably drew close to 300
pages of comics during 2017.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.100
And I lettered them all by hand.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.130
This was an intense challenge
psychically, physically,

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:38.120
and mentally.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.460
And adding to all this
was the psychic trauma

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.010
that I was essentially
living in every day.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.020
I had to make the
reader feel the emotions

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.320
I felt about my father and the
trauma I now saw I'd inherited.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.110
And that meant I'd have
to live in those emotions.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:55.370
I'm lucky to have a loyal
and supportive wife.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.020
The book had been due in June.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.510
But that was a soft
deadline, and I actually

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:02.450
delivered the close-to-finished
draft in August.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.310
But there were problems with it.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.260
There literally
wasn't an ending yet.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.660
But also, the final chapter
focused much more on me

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.810
and the kind of person my
upbringing had created.

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:14.810
As my editor pointed
out, it had an angry tone

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.330
and was at odds with
the rest of the book.

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.190
I told him I would fix it.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.110
I took the book back,
thought a lot about it

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.730
as quickly as I
could, and then I

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.790
completely removed the last
two chapters and reworked them.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.920
I removed most of the
material about myself,

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.810
leaving only a few
moments that I felt

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:31.760
summed up our relationship.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.190
I moved our final
painful conversation--

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.410
the one where he says nobody
told him he should build

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.360
a relationship with me--

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.120
from chapter 9 to
chapter 8 and instead,

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.750
constructed a more emotional,
elegiac ending that I felt

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.510
brought the book full circle.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:52.850
I submitted this new final
draft in January 2018.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.590
At this point, obviously,
I was well past deadline.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:57.680
But I had made the original
deadline less relevant

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.170
by taking on the responsibility
of doing every piece of it

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:01.280
myself.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.550
After editing, the book was then
copy edited a couple of times,

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.670
and nearly all the mistakes
were caught and fixed.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.320
The interior of the
book was completely

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.780
finished on February 26.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.940
The cover was finished
at the end of March.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.100
Just as with the insides,
every bit of the cover

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.394
was done by my hand,
except the barcode.

00:26:19.394 --> 00:26:21.310
I wanted the story to
pull the reader forward,

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:22.460
to feel like an experience.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.800
And I had to leave out
1,000 details and anecdotes

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.900
in service of the
narrative flow.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.760
One thing that got left
behind was the idea

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.460
that my father came from
the pre-war reality, where

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.620
dynamic individuals
dominated the news

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.140
and created the inventions
that changed the world,

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.600
but then was caught in the
post-war reality, where

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.120
committees and organizations
like the men who developed

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.280
the atomic bomb became the norm.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.650
Computers took the place of
people in doing calculations.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:50.180
The first programmable
computer in the United States,

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:55.220
the Mark I, was built by IBM
in a Harvard basement in 1944.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.110
And according to the
press at the time,

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.060
it was nicknamed Big Joel.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.670
I'm very proud of the book.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.270
And I think I hit most,
if not all, of my goals.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:10.180
I think that the story has
an urgency that makes people

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.350
want to read it all at once.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:14.350
I believe I've created
a relatable story

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.450
with recognizable emotion.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:18.640
I'm receiving responses
from people all over,

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.580
people I've never met, who
identify with this story.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.600
But there's one way in
which this book has failed.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.940
I really hoped I could build
a connection with my father

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.660
before dementia took him.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.930
And I wasn't able to do that.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:33.820
Maybe I understand him now.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.230
But ultimately, although
there is hope in it,

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:39.610
that's why this is a story of
frustration and loss, which

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:43.610
may be at least partly why
it resonates with others.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.700
We've all felt that
with our families.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.940
Many of us have tried to repair
our families and given up.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.230
It's the human condition.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.370
My son is now nine.

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:57.640
His school sends us emails
complaining about his behavior.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.500
And it's exactly
the same behavior

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.240
that was described
in glowing terms

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.970
by the reporters who
wrote about my dad.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.610
What was encouraged
is now discouraged.

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.500
If my father had
been a child now,

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.240
he wouldn't have
been a celebrity.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:14.170
He would have been drugged, so
he would sit down and shut up.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.470
America tends to extremes.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:18.764
Thank you.

00:28:18.764 --> 00:28:24.066
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:24.066 --> 00:28:25.030
Hey.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:28.160
AUDIENCE: Now that you're a
dad, if your son were ever

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.100
to write or create
something about you,

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.092
what would you hope
that he would say?

00:28:33.092 --> 00:28:34.550
MICHAEL KUPPERMAN:
Well, of course,

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.940
I'd hope he'd think I
was mostly a good dad,

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.610
and had been a good
influence, and tried to not

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:44.330
do what my father did wrong.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:47.660
AUDIENCE: What does being
a good dad mean to you now?

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.240
MICHAEL KUPPERMAN:
Well, I feel for me,

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.510
it's about appreciating who
he is and trying to guide him,

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:56.930
so he can be the
person he's supposed

00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:02.540
to be and treat other people
nicely at the same time.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:07.370
He's is a very enabled child,
which can be its own struggle,

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:10.130
because he's very interested.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:12.650
He's very passionate.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:17.820
And he can walk all over
other people sometimes.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.420
So I think as a parent,
what I'm trying to do

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:24.230
is guide him to do what
he wants to do but to also

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.980
be the best self he could be
and to have manners and body

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:28.790
awareness.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.244
Those are the other main things.

00:29:30.244 --> 00:29:32.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.302
Yeah.

00:29:33.302 --> 00:29:34.010
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:35.009
MICHAEL KUPPERMAN: Sure.

00:29:37.124 --> 00:29:39.780
AUDIENCE: How do you
feel, as a parent now,

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.740
about your father's mother's--
your grandmother's-- choices

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.776
raising your father?

00:29:45.776 --> 00:29:48.510
MICHAEL KUPPERMAN: I think they
were terrible choices, really

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:49.710
terrible choices.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:52.560
He should have left the
show after the war ended.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:57.030
His life would have been
so much better, I think.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:01.140
The desire to keep him on
TV was just inexplicable.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.660
And it doesn't make
sense from any viewpoint.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:08.175
Also, she thought he could
have a career in show business.

00:30:08.175 --> 00:30:10.050
But she was never canny
enough, for instance,

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.790
to negotiate his contract
with "Quiz Kids" again.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.960
So he was making the
same $75 per show

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.850
10 years after he
started and was on TV.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.310
It's really hard to think what
she thought the endgame was

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:25.710
or how she thought he
could have been a TV star.

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:29.370
So it's just-- it's
confusing to me,

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:32.490
because it doesn't seem
like good strategy.

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:35.850
And in fact, of course,
it tore the family apart

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.330
in a certain way.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:39.990
So I think it was both bad
parenting, but bad parenting

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:43.245
that's inexplicable in
its kind of pointlessness.

00:30:47.051 --> 00:30:47.550
Hi.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:50.680
AUDIENCE: Hey, so thanks
for such a wonderful talk.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.410
As someone who read the book,
I found the talk nonetheless

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:54.320
incredibly arresting.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.335
So thank you.

00:30:56.335 --> 00:30:58.960
So one of the things that's wild
that comes through in the book

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:04.950
is that your dad was
so insanely famous

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:07.522
and then just wasn't, right?

00:31:07.522 --> 00:31:08.980
You didn't even
really know, right?

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:13.240
And I feel like
it's wild that he

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.090
went from being so remarkably
well-known in the country

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:17.380
to sort of just forgotten.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.796
And I was wondering if you
could say, what's up with that?

00:31:19.796 --> 00:31:21.790
Is that a unique
set of properties

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:25.390
of the difference between
the cataclysm of World War

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:26.210
II and afterwards?

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.130
MICHAEL KUPPERMAN:
I think it was.

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:28.180
AUDIENCE: Or is it--

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.014
what's up with that?

00:31:29.014 --> 00:31:30.596
MICHAEL KUPPERMAN:
No, I think it was.

00:31:30.596 --> 00:31:32.230
I think it was a
unique experience.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.252
And the aftermath was unique.

00:31:34.252 --> 00:31:35.710
And in some ways,
he was very lucky

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:38.890
as someone who wanted to
escape from it, because--

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:41.930
excuse me-- during
World War II, of course,

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:44.290
people were being told
to recycle all paper.

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:47.440
And there was not much
frivolous merchandise.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.050
So in a way, he was famous
at the best time for it,

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:52.510
if you don't want
to be remembered.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:56.140
The ability to record video
wasn't invented until '47.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.970
And even then it
was done sparingly.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.790
I think there are three
remaining "Quiz Kids" shows

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:03.010
with him on them.

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:05.230
And radio shows,
there are about 130.

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:09.790
But part of it was that
people weren't that interested

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:12.430
in the past in those days and
in the decades afterwards.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.440
They were excited
about the future.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.090
And nostalgia only
really started

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:20.740
to be a thing, as I remember
it, in the '70s and '80s.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.670
But by then, the people who
really cared about "Quiz Kids"

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.320
didn't anymore.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.240
It was a cultural phenomenon.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.810
And his fame was sort of just
a combination of circumstances.

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.810
So there was nothing to
bring it back for people

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:39.700
beyond the sentimentality they
individually felt for him.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.606
So he was very
lucky in some ways,

00:32:41.606 --> 00:32:43.480
because if he had been
famous now, of course,

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.646
he would never have escaped.

00:32:44.646 --> 00:32:46.760
The video would be there
forever, the radio.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.750
Everyone would remember him.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.850
And it did take decades.

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:53.740
I was still being
asked by people

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.400
if I was related to him until
the late '70s, early '80s.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.057
But then it seemed
to vanish completely.

00:33:01.057 --> 00:33:01.890
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:02.890
MICHAEL KUPPERMAN: Sure.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.240
SPEAKER 1: So the
experience seems

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:11.500
to have been a pretty uniformly
terrible one for your father

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.140
and to have done tremendous
damage to your family.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.670
Do you think there's any good--

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:18.580
maybe not for you
guys-- but any good

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.434
at all that came
out of "Quiz Kids"

00:33:20.434 --> 00:33:21.850
and what your
father went through?

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.150
MICHAEL KUPPERMAN: Well, I
mean, I'd like to say this book.

00:33:32.049 --> 00:33:32.590
I don't know.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:36.610
It's hard to imagine, since it
was such a profound experience

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:41.210
that really changed
everything in the family,

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.360
how things would
have been different.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.980
I suspect my father
would have been

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.710
a very different person
had he been allowed

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:53.080
to grow up not on radio and TV.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.130
There were obviously
some good aspects.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.100
The money that he
did make, he used

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.640
to buy a house, which was
the house we lived in.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.890
It enabled him to do a few
things he couldn't have

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:04.150
otherwise.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:09.429
But for the most part, it's hard
to think of other aspects that

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:12.010
were positive.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.089
Certainly for him, it seemed
to be wholly negative, even

00:34:15.089 --> 00:34:16.630
the parts that you
might have thought

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:20.199
of as joyous for a child.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:23.260
He claimed he didn't
enjoy them at all.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:28.210
So I'd say, apart from the
money, which wasn't much,

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:33.076
and maybe this book, I
can't think of any really.

00:34:33.076 --> 00:34:33.784
SPEAKER 1: Sorry.

00:34:33.784 --> 00:34:35.370
It's me again.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:37.320
You mentioned that
some of this seems

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.880
to have been intentional
propaganda as part

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.860
of the fight against
anti-Semitism

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.389
in the United States.

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:48.630
Do you think it had any
effectiveness in that capacity?

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:51.404
Or was it just a good idea--

00:34:51.404 --> 00:34:53.761
or maybe not a good idea--
that didn't work out?

00:34:53.761 --> 00:34:55.719
MICHAEL KUPPERMAN: Well,
since doing this book,

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.690
I've been getting a lot
of responses from people.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.356
And some of them are
actually old enough

00:34:59.356 --> 00:35:00.540
to have been around then.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:03.450
And someone was telling
me just a couple of weeks

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:07.680
ago that it was huge for
his neighborhood in Brooklyn

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.500
that there was this
Jewish kid on the radio.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.760
And they were all
very excited about it.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.490
So yeah, maybe it did.

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:15.810
It's possible it did.

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:17.400
You just never know.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:22.800
I found information about that
side of propaganda very hard

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.320
to find.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.160
And in fact, if you look
some places on the internet,

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.000
they claim there was no black
propaganda, for instance,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
by America during the
war, which is not true.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.470
And I looked and looked for
any kind of a smoking gun

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:43.350
that this was a
deliberately planned thing.

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.620
I couldn't find one, of course,
not that I thought I would.

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.160
But I had to look.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.900
But I think it was
a deliberate choice

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.510
to put him on radio
as a Jewish child

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.160
and to build up his image.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.840
But even if he wasn't,
that was still the effect.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:06.240
So it was either accidental, or
intentional, or part of each.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.290
But I have found citations
that Lewis G Cowan

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:14.490
inserted propagandistic
messages in American radio

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:18.660
shows to improve the image
of minorities and servicemen

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:23.790
and so on, and also was doing
radio propaganda for overseas,

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:28.650
and was involved in the creation
of the Armed Forces Radio,

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:32.040
and would insert
messages meant to be

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.820
heard by the opposite side
in some radio shows too.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.310
During-- when I was
looking at his papers

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:40.170
at Columbia University,
I found a mention

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:42.930
that when he put a
message in a radio show

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.600
and he wanted it
heard by the enemy,

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.110
they made sure that
the announcer read it

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:51.780
at quote unquote
"dictation speed," which

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.830
was very interesting.

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:57.690
So it's something I strongly
suspect and feel to be true.

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:00.450
But I have no solid proof of it.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:03.570
But I think there was a
positive effect, possibly,

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:07.650
by all these Jewish
kids being featured.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:08.880
I don't know for sure though.

00:37:12.226 --> 00:37:13.182
Anyone else?

00:37:16.909 --> 00:37:19.450
SPEAKER 1: Well, Mr. Kupperman,
thank you so much for coming.

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:24.569
This was an absolutely
fantastic and moving talk.

00:37:24.569 --> 00:37:26.110
Some of it was
honestly a little hard

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:31.420
to watch-- that clip of
your father on television.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.240
And as moving as
your book is, it

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.580
was an entirely different
experience hearing

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.300
you talk about this live.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.740
So thank you so much for coming.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.000
MICHAEL KUPPERMAN: Thank you.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:41.500
Thank you.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.250
[APPLAUSE]
