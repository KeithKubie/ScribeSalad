00:00:04.227 --> 00:00:06.060
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Welcome to Assistant

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.280
on Air, where we have
conversations with people that

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.660
build for Google Assistant.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.240
I'm Jessica Dene Early-Cha
and I'll be your host today.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.350
I'm a Developer Advocate
for Actions on Google,

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.350
which means I build actions
and I create content

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.340
for developers.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.090
Today, we'll be chatting
with Brad Abrams.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.910
Welcome, Brad.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.550
BRAD ABRAMS: Hey, Jessica.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.430
It's good to be here.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.430
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.305
Brad, what do you do?

00:00:23.305 --> 00:00:26.280
BRAD ABRAMS: So I am a Product
Manager on the Google Assistant

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.790
team.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.820
And I run a big part
of the developer

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.530
platform for the Assistant
we call Actions on Google.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.150
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Oh, that's awesome.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.710
So what does that
mean that you run--

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.340
you run this?

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.000
BRAD ABRAMS: Yes, well--

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.130
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: You're
a product manager on this.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.740
BRAD ABRAMS: Yeah,
so I'm the product--

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.900
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: Not
that you run the whole shabang.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.810
BRAD ABRAMS: Yeah, exactly.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.185
A few engineers
watching this are

00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:43.830
going to have questions for me.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.550
I'm-- yeah, so I'm the product
manager for parts of it.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.920
And really, what I do
as a product manager is

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.120
try to figure out
what developers want

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.075
to do on the platform,
like, how can they take

00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:57.200
advantage of the Assistant?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.550
How can we make it
easier for them?

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.510
And how we can bring in
end user requirements,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.700
like what users want
out of the Assistant,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.560
and match that with
what developers want.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.797
So it's kind of a
giant jigsaw puzzle.

00:01:09.797 --> 00:01:11.880
But I work very closely
with the engineering team.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.670
And it's fun to work together
and build brand new products,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.190
especially in this space.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.820
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Oh, my gosh, yes.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.570
It's great.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.950
BRAD ABRAMS: So
many other spaces

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.800
are mature for developers,
and we know what works

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.770
and what doesn't work.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.100
And, in this space, the
Assistant is brand new.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.220
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: Yes.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.960
BRAD ABRAMS: It's
the wild, wild west.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.690
Developers are figuring it
out, we're figuring it out.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.970
And so it's kind of fun
to do, fun space to be in.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.640
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.740
Well, speaking
about the fun stuff,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.230
at I/O we announced a couple
of really cool things.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.570
BRAD ABRAMS: Yes.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.810
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: So
I'd love to talk to you about

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.422
content--

00:01:40.422 --> 00:01:41.130
BRAD ABRAMS: Yep.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.210
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
--about App Actions, and about

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.990
experiences.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.290
BRAD ABRAMS: All right.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.550
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: So
let's start off with content.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.425
BRAD ABRAMS: Content.

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:46.410
Yeah, content is great.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.910
So I've been on this team
for almost three years now.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.670
And what I've
learned is that it's

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.690
hard to build
conversational experiences.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.250
JESSICA DENE
EARLY-CHA: It is hard.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.900
BRAD ABRAMS: I mean, let's--

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.972
it's a new domain.

00:01:55.972 --> 00:01:57.430
It's hard for Google
to build them.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.790
And it's even hard for
third parties to build them.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.450
And so what we've seen
is many of these actions

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.360
actually just reflect
some underlying content

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.990
that the developer has.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.050
And so we thought,
why don't we just

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.510
let developers give us that
content in a way that's

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.730
native for them to
give us the content

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.260
and then we'll do
the heavy lifting

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.245
of building rich, immersive
conversations out of them?

00:02:19.245 --> 00:02:20.370
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: OK.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.730
BRAD ABRAMS: And that way, users
can have great user experiences

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.950
and they can work super
well conversationally.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.325
And developers can focus on kind
of what their unique value is,

00:02:29.325 --> 00:02:30.940
which is in that content.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.357
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: OK,
so what type of examples-- so,

00:02:33.357 --> 00:02:36.300
if I have content, how
can I either format it

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.912
so that it's
digestible by Google?

00:02:37.912 --> 00:02:39.620
And what type of
materials would be good?

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.350
BRAD ABRAMS: Yeah, so the
ones that we announced at I/O

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.950
here was FAQs and how-tos.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.010
So, for example, with how-tos,
if you have a website,

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.710
maybe how to change
a flat tire, you

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.870
can actually mark
up that website

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.120
with schema.org markup,
which has been around

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.100
for 10 plus years.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.280
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Yeah, industry standard.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.985
BRAD ABRAMS: Industry standard.

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:02.310
A lot of web developers are
already familiar with it.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.430
Literally, it's just
tagging the HTML elements

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.290
with the schema.org.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.590
And then Google
will index that data

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.920
and build a conversation
action for you

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.610
that helps users navigate
your website in a way that's

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.880
more voice forward, more
assistive in nature.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.440
So, on the phone, or on a
smart display, for example,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.500
an end user can go
through there with just,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.470
show me the next step, move
to step two, skip this step.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.970
JESSICA DENE
EARLY-CHA: Oh, my gosh.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.150
BRAD ABRAMS: And that's just
a much better way for users

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.310
to go through your content
in this assistive experience.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.350
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: Yeah,
so it sounds like they just have

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.748
to worry about
marking up their--

00:03:41.748 --> 00:03:42.540
BRAD ABRAMS: Right.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.582
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
--content and Google will

00:03:44.582 --> 00:03:47.100
handle all of the natural
language processing, all that--

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.660
BRAD ABRAMS: That's right.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.680
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
--the hard part.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.347
BRAD ABRAMS: That's
right, that's right.

00:03:50.347 --> 00:03:53.963
And, you know, YouTube also
has a ton of how-to videos.

00:03:53.963 --> 00:03:56.130
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: I'm
on there learning things

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.550
all the time.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.670
BRAD ABRAMS: Yes, I
wouldn't be able to get

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.120
anything done in my house
if it weren't for YouTube.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.230
And so we've also made it
possible for YouTube creators

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.570
to create these how-to
experiences that work really

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.900
well on the phone and on the
smart display with that content

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.960
that they have.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.140
So, in this case, they just--

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.665
you go to the Actions console
and then upload a spreadsheet,

00:04:19.665 --> 00:04:20.165
actually--

00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:21.209
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Oh, interesting.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.420
BRAD ABRAMS: --you just give the
URL to the video that you own,

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.898
and then the minute markers for
each step of the conversation--

00:04:27.898 --> 00:04:29.190
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: Oh, OK.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.290
BRAD ABRAMS: --each
step of the how-to.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.480
And then we can build out
the experience from there

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.553
that moves the video to the
right place, and whatnot.

00:04:36.553 --> 00:04:38.220
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Oh, that's nice.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.095
BRAD ABRAMS: It's a
really smooth experience,

00:04:40.095 --> 00:04:41.860
so I encourage
people to try that.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.780
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Oh, that's really cool.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.530
That's fantastic.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.280
So, in that same kind of vein,
for Android developers, people

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.493
who have their own Android
apps, we have App Actions now.

00:04:50.493 --> 00:04:51.285
BRAD ABRAMS: Right.

00:04:51.285 --> 00:04:52.230
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
So what does that mean?

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.647
BRAD ABRAMS: Yeah, so I'm
really excited about App Actions

00:04:54.647 --> 00:04:58.590
because, on the phone, we want
the Assistant to be the best

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.900
way to get things
done on the phone.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.290
And there's-- we were talking
about mature ecosystems.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.175
Android has a quiet,
mature ecosystem.

00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:07.425
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: It is.

00:05:07.425 --> 00:05:10.240
BRAD ABRAMS: Everybody out there
already has an Android app.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.730
And so we want to help users
make better use of the Android

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.630
apps they already
have installed.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.622
So, right now, to
launch an Android app,

00:05:18.622 --> 00:05:20.580
you have to go to the
launcher, scroll, scroll,

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.550
find it, tap on it,
navigate into the app

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.210
to get something done.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.910
What we want to do
is shortcut that,

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.890
make it much easier for users.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.597
You could just say, hey,
Google, send $50 to Jessica.

00:05:32.597 --> 00:05:33.930
That would be good, wouldn't it?

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:34.720
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
That would be great.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.470
Let's do that now.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.530
BRAD ABRAMS: Everybody
should do that.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.480
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: Not only
does that just sound faster,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.415
I could definitely
imagine people who are not

00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:44.412
as familiar with apps, that
being an easier learning

00:05:44.412 --> 00:05:46.870
curve of this is how you just
do something with your voice.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.760
BRAD ABRAMS: It's
much more natural.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.990
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: Yeah.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.820
BRAD ABRAMS: You know, when I
tell people how to do things,

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.610
you say, well, first you open
the app, and then you go here,

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.610
and you have to know the
way the app thinks about it

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.943
rather than the way
humans might talk, right?

00:05:58.943 --> 00:06:00.360
JESSICA DENE
EARLY-CHA: Basically.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.670
BRAD ABRAMS: And so
just like with content,

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.510
we've moved the burden
for dialogue understanding

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.630
to Google.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.088
So we actually have a team
of hundreds of linguists--

00:06:10.088 --> 00:06:11.880
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Oh, that's awesome.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.600
BRAD ABRAMS: --that
are coming up

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.180
with all the different ways
users might say something like,

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.320
send money to Jessica.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.465
Like, I can't come up with them.

00:06:18.465 --> 00:06:20.340
Like, hundreds of
different ways and hundreds

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.810
of different languages.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.280
We have people
figuring that out.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.660
And so, once we do, we
load that into a concept

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.790
we call a built-in intent.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.310
And so we have built-in
intent for sending money,

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.520
for ordering food, for
tracking a work out.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.690
We launched four or
five here at I/O.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.550
We're going to launch
hundreds of them

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.370
as we get our linguists
going on this.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.540
And then, as a developer, you
just subscribe to those intents

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.920
or implement those intents.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.087
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: So
far an Android developer,

00:06:52.087 --> 00:06:52.932
what are they doing?

00:06:52.932 --> 00:06:53.640
BRAD ABRAMS: Yes.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.330
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
How much work

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.470
are we looking at for them?

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.360
BRAD ABRAMS: So we think this
is about a day's worth of work.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.390
So we think this is something
every Android developer should

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.570
do.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.910
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: Yeah.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.285
BRAD ABRAMS: So what you do
is you open up Android Studio

00:07:03.285 --> 00:07:06.120
and you add an Actions XML file.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.400
It's the file right next
to the AndroidManifest,

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.500
similar to the AndroidManifest.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.740
And, in there, it's
essentially a mapping file.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.050
You take the set of the built-in
intent that we mentioned,

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.760
so for example, the send
money built-in intent,

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.670
and you map that to whatever
intent that is in your app.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.970
That means it goes to
this intent, whatever

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.427
page of your app makes sense.

00:07:29.427 --> 00:07:31.260
And then you write a
little bit of Java code

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.780
to handle the arguments
that will patch you.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.480
We'll patch you the amount,
and the person's name,

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.890
and so the app developer parses
those and then pre-populates

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.583
the UI and sets it up.

00:07:43.583 --> 00:07:45.500
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
That sounds fantastic.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:45.690
BRAD ABRAMS: Yeah.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:46.870
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: I'm
super excited to see-- just

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.720
be able to talk to my
phone to open things up,

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.920
get things done a lot faster.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.080
BRAD ABRAMS: Yeah, hopefully
it'll be a lot faster for users

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.780
to get things done.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.400
JESSICA DENE
EARLY-CHA: Very cool.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.870
So the last thing
which I'm really

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.050
excited about because-- it's all
about the experience and more

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.130
the conversation side.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:07:59.790
BRAD ABRAMS: That's right.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.010
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: So
I'd love to talk to you about

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.562
Canvas--

00:08:01.562 --> 00:08:02.520
BRAD ABRAMS: Yeah, so--

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.780
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: --and
that amazing experience.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:04.905
BRAD ABRAMS: I love Canvas.

00:08:04.905 --> 00:08:08.640
So for people that are building
conversational actions today,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.280
they've mainly been voice
focused and not had any UI.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.210
And that works well
for Google Home device.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:21.390
But on the phone or on a
smart display, it's not great.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:25.890
And so, in the past, we've had a
handful of cards you could use,

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:30.730
so three or four different
cards, which is good.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.919
But we wanted to offer a much
more immersive experience.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.880
Specifically, we want to--
we've been looking at games.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:44.100
Like most new platforms, games
are a big use case for us.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.160
And for people that are building
games for the smart display,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.140
we wanted to give them
a lot more flexibility.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.050
And so we thought,
what's a great UI

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.480
technology that works on every
device and scales beautifully?

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.360
You know, the web is
pretty good at that.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.240
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
It is really good.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.407
BRAD ABRAMS: That's kind
of been figured out, right?

00:09:02.407 --> 00:09:05.130
So we thought, let's
just let developers

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.600
use the knowledge they already
have, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.480
but they get to execute
that on the client, so

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.140
on the smart display device.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.670
And then you attach a
conversational action to that

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.490
so that, at any stage
in the conversation,

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:27.330
I can click a button on the
screen or I can just say that,

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.707
and the UI moves forward
or the game moves forward.

00:09:29.707 --> 00:09:31.540
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
That sounds awesome.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.123
BRAD ABRAMS: So we
think this is going

00:09:33.123 --> 00:09:36.000
to unlock, really, a
whole new set of use cases

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.580
and really rich,
immersive experiences

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.050
for that smart display.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.280
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Something you just reminded me

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:41.910
of--

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.472
I think of children
playing games.

00:09:44.472 --> 00:09:45.180
BRAD ABRAMS: Yes.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:45.660
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
So many times

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.000
when they're playing games,
they're yelling at the game.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.280
BRAD ABRAMS: Right.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.340
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: Because
that's the most natural--

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:49.620
BRAD ABRAMS: Exactly.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.580
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
--way that we do things.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.020
BRAD ABRAMS: And now the
game can understand them.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.060
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: I
know, that sounds so great.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.450
BRAD ABRAMS: So it's
good, it's good.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.500
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: Oh
my gosh, that's awesome.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.083
BRAD ABRAMS: Yeah,
I'm looking forward

00:09:57.083 --> 00:09:59.230
to seeing what developers
come up with with Canvas.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:09:59.640
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
I know, right?

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.430
Oh, my gosh.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.140
That's exciting.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.380
So it sounds like there's
also just a different way

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.880
of thinking of how
to build as well.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.460
BRAD ABRAMS: Yeah, so
it's a state based model.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.310
So developers actually
think about, what

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.130
are the different parts
of this conversation?

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.970
What's the flow of this
conversation going to be?

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.620
Users were first asked
this, and then they'll

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.020
move to this, and then to this.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.770
And then, as a developer,
you can actually

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.190
model those as states
in your application

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.870
and the transitions
between them.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.440
And then Google actually
helps with the human language

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.620
understanding part
of this and how

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.210
they move between those states.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:35.750
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
That sounds great.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.667
Because I know from a
developer point of view,

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:40.505
just the state experience makes
a lot more sense to me versus--

00:10:40.505 --> 00:10:41.880
not that [INAUDIBLE]
isn't great.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.400
I love that tool.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.200
It makes a little more sense--

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:45.380
BRAD ABRAMS: Yeah.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:45.830
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
--from my point

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:46.800
of view, which is great.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.550
BRAD ABRAMS: Yeah.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.320
So yeah, we're super
early with this.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.200
We're just in an
early preview of it,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.980
but we're hoping developers pick
it up, give us feedback, tell

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.470
us what works and doesn't work,
so that we'll be ready when

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.790
we launch it for developers.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.020
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: Yes,
that sounds really exciting.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:00.610
Speaking of feedback--

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:00.870
BRAD ABRAMS: Yes.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:01.640
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
--how can developers

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.370
give you feedback on any of
these and all the things?

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.780
BRAD ABRAMS: Well, we--

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.380
my team and a lot of
[INAUDIBLE] hangs out on Reddit,

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.730
on our Google Assistant
developer channel on Reddit.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.380
So that's a great place to post.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.440
Love to hear your stories about
what's working and not working.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.070
And then also, I'm on Twitter.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.818
So I'm BradA at Twitter,
so please tweet at me.

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:27.860
Let me know what's working
and not working there.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:28.130
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Oh, that is awesome.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.340
BRAD ABRAMS: I'd love
to hear your stories.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.720
So please feel free to do that.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.120
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Thank you so much for coming

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.950
and also just to
offer all of that.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.465
Because not everybody
understands, necessarily,

00:11:36.465 --> 00:11:38.090
the importance of
getting that feedback

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.442
and making our products better.

00:11:39.442 --> 00:11:41.150
So thank you so much
for taking the time.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.840
BRAD ABRAMS: No, thank you.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.540
I enjoyed being here.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.550
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Yeah, thanks.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:44.050
Awesome.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.400
