00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.380
So in fact, let's, let's go there, let's, let's go to use case number two,

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.400
which was the having to do with the containment vessel was not ready.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.510
So our first use case asks the question, but

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.150
the question might come out negative and

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.830
in that case we have like a contingency we have to, have to deal with.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.310
So this is a variant on the, on the first use case.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.020
So, in order to get there,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.100
the, the steps are that the query is sent to the containment vessel.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.420
If it is not ready then a message must be sent to the hot water source,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.940
telling it to stop or prevent the flow of water.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.490
Now what's, what's going on here is, really a couple things.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.600
One is, the startup situation where, before we even start.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.777
The, we check whether the, the pot is there, but

00:00:45.777 --> 00:00:50.540
it could also be the case that somebody pulls that pot out too quickly, okay?

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.960
And so in that case it's not going to be ready either.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.740
In both of those situations we want to make sure that

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.820
water doesn't start pouring through.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.272
We can extrapolate it and

00:01:00.272 --> 00:01:06.460
indicate that when the containment vessel is returned to the, the heating plate.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.360
Another message is sent to the hot water source, enabling it to resume.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.470
So we're talking about one to turn, turn off the hot water source and

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.540
the other one to turn it back on.
