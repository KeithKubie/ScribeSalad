TAKAKO AIKAWA: So
the development

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.450
of speaking and listening
requires interactions

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.370
with somebody else.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.380
So that has to be
done in classroom

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.830
because there are not so many
Japanese people on campus

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.900
at MIT.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.220
So classroom activities really
focus on the development

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.530
of listening and speaking.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.000
Whereas reading and
writing, students

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.320
can do them outside of class.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.780
And then, in
particular, our textbook

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.880
has a so-called workbook.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.970
And then they can do writing
practice by themselves.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.810
In fact, we provide assignments
so that they can just

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.030
practice writing at home.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.860
For reading, our textbook
has a reading section

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.870
for each lesson.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.510
And we provide a
reading session one day

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.350
for each lesson in class.
