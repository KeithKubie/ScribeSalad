Hi, I'm Brett, a Software Engineer on the App Engine team.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.300
In this screen cast, we'll purchase additional resources

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500
for an application running on Google App Engine.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.500
In the Admin Console, there are new links for Billing--

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:16.875
a settings page and a history page.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.500
Let's go to the settings page and enable billing for this app.

00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:28.471
I click Enable Billing and that takes me to the Setup page.

00:00:33.607 --> 00:00:36.107
I set a max daily budget,

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:41.175
choose either a budget preset or a custom budget.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:52.810
The custom option allows me to tune each resource if I know what usage to expect.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.250
I set my country

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.500
review my Checkout authorized weekly charge limit and click Checkout.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I go through the Checkout process and return to the Billing settings page.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.750
After my credit card is authorized, my Resource Allocations will be updated in a few minutes.

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:28.875
On the Dashboard, you can see the resources I've purchased.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.125
It will also tell me how much I've spent today for each resource.

00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:36.121
The marker indicates where the free quotas are, which still apply.

00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:41.921
Later, if I want to increase or decrease my budget, I can quickly reallocate my daily quota.

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:55.625
The Billing History page is like a bank statement.

00:01:56.693 --> 00:02:01.693
It lists all billing events and how they affect the app's budget and running balance. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.750
For convenience, we have a print function that makes it easier to submit these for expense reporting.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.500
Thanks for watching.
