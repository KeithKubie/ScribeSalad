00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.150
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.170
On behalf of Authors
at Google, it

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.000
was my privilege to welcome
philosopher and author Rebecca

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.710
Newberger Goldstein to
Mountain View four years ago.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.344
She's back.

00:00:14.344 --> 00:00:15.594
I think she enjoyed her visit.

00:00:15.594 --> 00:00:17.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.420
Ms. Goldstein was trained
as a philosopher of science,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.130
receiving her PhD from
Princeton University

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.850
and is the author of
10 prize-winning books

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.440
of both fiction and nonfiction.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.770
She has received fellowships
from the MacArthur Foundation,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.990
Guggenheim Foundations, the
American Council of Learned

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.570
Societies, and the Radcliffe
Institute, among others.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.500
Since her last
visit, she has been

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.320
named Humanist of the Year, as
well as Freethought Heroine.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.870
In her latest
book, Ms. Goldstein

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.000
asks us to accept the
one preposterous premise

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.660
that Plato could turn
up in 21st century

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.050
America, an author
on a book tour.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.030
So here he is at
Google headquarters

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.360
in Mountain View,
California, discussing

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.490
with his media escort
and a software engineer

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.620
whether crowdsourcing can
answer all ethical questions?

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.430
So here we are at
Google headquarters

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.290
in Mountain View, California,
where Ms. Goldstein

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.670
will discuss her latest book,
"Plato at the Googleplex."

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.820
Please join me in welcoming
Rebecca Newberger Goldstein.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.947
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:31.280
REBECCA NEWBERGER GOLDSTEIN: Hi.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.100
It's very good to be here.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.460
Obviously, I was fairly
inspired four years ago when

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.995
I visited this place.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.550
So in bringing Plato back,
I brought him here first

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.050
to Google.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.400
That solved many
practical problems for me.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.750
I didn't want to have
to waste a lot of time

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.240
bringing him up to speed
about everything that's

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.230
happened in the
past 2,400 years.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.640
So he gets himself
a Chromebook here.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.630
And he gets addicted very,
very quickly to the internet.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.920
And by the last
chapter, when he's

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.290
in discussion with
a neuroscientist

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.630
and is about to have
his brain imaged,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.460
he knows quite a bit of
neuroscience, he's taken a MOOC

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.540
and so he can translate
an ancient argument

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.230
that he put forth in
the "Phaedo," a kind

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.270
of nonreductive
argument that is there

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.720
in the "Phaedo," in
one of his dialogues,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.000
he can translated it into
neuroscientific terms

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.270
and it's all thanks to the
first stop here at Google.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.600
And he was very, very
intrigued by what was going on,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.490
here particularly intrigued by
the whole notion of the cloud,

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.814
as he would be.

00:02:57.814 --> 00:03:02.660
But this an odd book
to say the least.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.790
It's divided up into two parts.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.790
There are 10 chapters and
five of them are expository.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.280
And they go back in time
to the ancient Greeks.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.890
And what was it?

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.890
Well, it's a problem
I and many others

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.440
have tried to solve for
the past two millennia--

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.050
I think I solve it-- as to why
the Greeks, the ancient Greeks

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.360
did so much?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.050
They not only discovered
philosophy, but in a sense

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.720
began science, protoscience,
certainly introduced

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.510
the study of
abstract mathematics.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.100
Geometry existed in other
places, certainly in Egypt.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:00.190
But the notion of proof, of
axioms, of deduction, this

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.690
really was discovered
by the ancient Greeks.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.680
What else did they do?

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.140
I mentioned philosophy.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.080
Democracy, right?

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.650
They discovered democracy, not
quite our form of democracy.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.790
In fact, the
founders, the writers

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.610
of the American Constitution,
who were all classically

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.690
trained and knew their
Plato, in some sense

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.840
formed our form of
democracy knowing

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.100
Plato's criticisms of
Athenian democracy.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.940
What else do they do?

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:44.050
Well, there's our art,
architecture, timeless poetry,

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.180
tragedies, comedies.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.130
It's still studied
and still move us.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.770
So this is an
extraordinary people.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.100
And I'm particularly
interested that they discovered

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.970
this kind of peculiar question,
a philosophical question,

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.390
that it is my contention
still exists and is still

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.750
very alive in our society.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.090
But it's even more
amazing that they

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.430
did what they did because
they did it so quickly.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.030
They went from
anomie and illiteracy

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.000
to Aeschylus and Aristotle
in a matter of 200 years.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.940
It had been an
illiterate society.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.990
There had been literacy
under the Mycenaean culture.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.770
Then it was destroyed

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.660
They imported the alphabet from
the Phoenicians, adapted it

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.130
to their language.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:44.010
And then there's just this
explosion of achievement.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.050
And what was it that
allowed that to happen?

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.010
I actually have an article
in "The New York Times"

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.290
today under "The
Stone," which is

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.030
where philosophers philosophize.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.830
And it's a blog.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.230
And it's about the way in
which our society is so very

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.260
similar to ancient
Greek society.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.470
And it's very similar in ways
in which Socrates and Plato had

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.580
actually criticized
their society.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.710
But there are many ways
we're living in a time

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:31.070
that makes us particularly
able to appreciate the value

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.830
system of the ancient
Greeks and what

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.370
allowed them to achieve so much.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.695
So that's part of
what I'm doing.

00:06:38.695 --> 00:06:40.070
Because I do think
that there are

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.420
such an interesting parallels
between our extraordinary age

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.680
and their extraordinary
age and some

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.820
of the same conditions
in place that

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.825
are promoting
explosive discoveries.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.680
There's that.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.690
But then I actually wanted
to bring Plato forward

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:10.080
into our time and have
him discourse with us.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.510
Plato-- excuse me--
had used the dialogue

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.790
form and for a very good reason.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.457
He actually said that
he mistrusted writing.

00:07:19.457 --> 00:07:21.040
He thought that
philosophy is supposed

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.500
to be a lived discourse,
a lived conversation.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.490
If you wrote down anything,
there was the danger

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.840
that it would become a doctrine.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.930
It would become hardened.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.240
You would have disciples.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.675
Thinking would
become thoughtless.

00:07:34.675 --> 00:07:37.640
It would be a matter
of interpreting

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.840
what the great man has said.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.020
And that is the exact opposite
of what you want in philosophy.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.110
And I think that
that's certainly true.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.560
So he chose this form,
the dialogue form.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.290
And he used a beloved
figure, Socrates,

00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:01.560
who was already dead at the time
that Plato was writing, perhaps

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:07.910
to bring Socrates forward with
him as he developed philosophy.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.190
And Plato really did
give us philosophy

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:15.200
as it exists, carved
out the landscape.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.730
It's as if he almost raised up,
like the continent of Atlantis,

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.060
the whole submerged
field of philosophy

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.630
in all its different
subbranches.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.440
And that's actually
a very good metaphor

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.770
to use because our
earliest allusion

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:36.260
to the myth of Atlantis comes
from Plato in the "Timaeus."

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.360
So that actually comes from him.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.320
Anyway, he used Socrates
in these dialogues

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.560
and probed his own society.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.570
And I thought, well, why
not do the same for Plato,

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.280
to bring him forward
into our day,

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.530
to put him into a
dialogues with our society?

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.820
And as many times as I could,
which turned out to be quite

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:08.020
often, to lift actual
passages from his dialogues

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:14.010
into contemporary dialogues, as
seamlessly as possible so that

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.640
my readers wouldn't know
that this actually came from

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.330
a 2,400-year-old man.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.040
And every time I say that,
I think of a Mel Brooks,

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.110
Carl Reiner, 2,000-year-old-man
skit that probably most of you

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.490
are too young to remember.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.040
But it's extremely funny.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.820
You should goggle it.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:40.620
And to seamlessly fit these
passages into our own dialogues

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.120
to show that there's a kind of
relevance still of this man,

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.580
in some ways, yes;
in some ways, no.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.360
In many ways we've left
him in the dust, which

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.320
I believe he would have wanted.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.440
If, in fact, there is any
philosophical progress made

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.700
at all, and I actually
tried to argue

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.050
that there is in
this book, then Plato

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.390
can't be completely relevant.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.590
His answers can't
be completely right.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.220
Plato himself was committed
to the possibility

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.200
of making
philosophical progress.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.010
That is certainly the most
obvious interpretation

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.730
of the most famous
passage of his writings,

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.550
the myth of the cave.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:30.610
You start in darkness,
staring at the shadows

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.920
at the back wall of the cave.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.900
And then you're let
out into reality.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.510
And he certainly was
committed to making

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.070
philosophical progress.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.240
If Plato had all
the answers, there

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.340
is no philosophical progress.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.490
And so Plato couldn't
been right about that.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.110
Ergo, Plato can't be
right about everything.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.440
That's just a syllogism.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.040
It just follows directly.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.260
So anyway, I bring Plato here.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:00.130
He is constantly being
amazed by our society

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:05.370
and both its good points, what
he judges to be good and bad.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.960
He's certainly amazed by
our science and technology.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.380
But he's also amazed
at the progress

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.230
we've made philosophically,
ethically, politically.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.900
And that is part of my
argument, that this process

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.420
that he started actually
has had an effect that

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.240
was partly due to
philosophical arguments

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.750
that Plato is so surprised
by what he discovers.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.760
So I'm going to start
with the Google ones.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.330
Oh, here are the five places
that I-- five dialogues.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.300
He first comes here.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.680
He is in conversation
with his media escort.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.460
Very-- what is she?

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.140
She's a very annoying
woman I have say.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:55.210
Very opinionated and she
has no use for philosophy.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.780
She's a very practical woman.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.830
And she's actually
able to enlighten

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.590
Plato about certain
things that she

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.000
thinks are intuitively obvious.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.180
And that kind of opened his eyes
about certain ethical truths.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.450
And there's also a software
engineer named Marcus.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.440
And Marcus believes
that perhaps we

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:27.080
can rig up an ethical answer
search engine, acronym EASE,

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.690
by which we could
algorithmically-- crowdsourcing

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:35.350
algorithmically answer
ethical questions.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.070
And Plato quickly
absorbs this idea.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.000
He's very, very smart.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.840
And he has arguments
against it and from things

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.580
that he said a long time ago.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.290
The next place he
goes, Plato, he now

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:55.170
has his Chromebook cradled
constantly with him,

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:59.860
is to the 92nd
Street Y. And he's

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.390
on a panel of
child-rearing experts.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:10.410
And the topic is how to
raise the exceptional child.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:17.020
And his fellow panelist is
a woman named Sophie Zee,

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:23.530
author of "The Warriors' Guide
to How to produce Off-the-Chart

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.650
Children," a
national best seller,

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:31.890
and another woman who is
psychoanalytically trained

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.220
in Vienna.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:41.590
And her book is-- oh, let me
see if I've-- title of her book?

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.090
OK.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:44.910
Well, yes, here's the
invitation actually from the Y.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.920
"Join us at the Y
for what promises

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.010
to be the highlight
of the season.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:52.650
Zachary Burns, beloved columnist
for the newspaper of record,

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.810
will lead a discussion on "How
to Raise an Exceptional Child.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.100
With Zach will be best-selling
author, Mitzi Munitz,

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.580
author of the
"Esteeming Your Child,

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.620
How Even the Best-Intentioned
Parents Violate, Mutilate,

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.700
and Desecrate Their Children";
Sophie Zee, best-selling author

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.550
of "The Warrior Mother's Guide
to Producing Off-the-Chart

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.150
Children"; and
Plato, best selling

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.980
author of the "Republic."

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:26.320
And they fight it out there on
the stage of the 92nd Street

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:26.840
Y."

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:34.270
The next thing I do with Plato
is I have him giving advice.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.570
He's an expert
consultant to an advice

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.150
columnist about love and sex.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.990
And Plato has an awful lot
to say about love and sex.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.690
He devoted two
magnificent dialogues

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.630
actually to the subject.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.930
One is "The Symposium."

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.910
And that's the one from
which we derive our slightly

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.540
degraded idea of Platonic love.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.030
And that's from
Socrates' speech there

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.270
about how the erotic
longing we direct

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.740
to beautiful young things,
which is our love of beauty,

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.680
ought to be
redirected, sublimated,

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.230
so that all that love
of beauty is directed

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:18.150
towards beautiful mathematics,
and beautiful laws of nature,

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.760
and beautiful laws of
justice, and eventually

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.560
to the idea of beauty itself.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.930
So there, he's kind of down
on personal, romantic love.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.860
He's trying to argue
us out of that.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:36.765
And in the "Phaedrus," which
is a dialogue I like even more,

00:15:36.765 --> 00:15:39.800
Plato shows himself
to be really torn

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.150
about this subject
of romantic love.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.850
He has Socrates, who is
for the first time in any

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.070
of the dialogues,
outside the city walls.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.720
He's walking in this
lush countryside,

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.290
and he lies down beside a
beautiful boy, Phaedrus,

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:59.160
beside a sparkling stream,
and they talk of love.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:04.140
And Socrates' first
speech to Phaedrus

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.610
argues against the madness
of love, to be taken over,

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.200
to be possessed
by another person,

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:15.970
and to direct all of your erotic
energy towards him or her.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.690
And then, Socrates, as
they're about to leave,

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.090
they're about to
step over the stream,

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.810
and he says, wait a minute.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.690
I am ashamed.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.870
I had offended the god Eros.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:34.650
And he gives another speech,
completely reversing himself,

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.130
on the glories of
the madness of love.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.175
He's in a very strange mood,
Plato, when he writes this.

00:16:41.175 --> 00:16:44.130
This is really out of
character for Plato.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:48.910
So much so that many
of us, including me,

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:49.880
believe he was in love.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.300
He was in love
when he wrote that.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.250
And we even think there's
etymological evidence

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.140
within the ancient Greek
pointing to whom he

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.090
was in love with, which
would actually makes sense,

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.370
the character that
we've arrived at.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:07.310
But this is actually one
of the reasons I love Plato

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:10.710
because he philosophizes
with his whole soul.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.510
If, in fact, he's
fallen in love and he

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.460
thinks this is a
good thing, he's

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.770
going to philosophically
reverse his ideas about it.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:22.579
Philosophy for Plato is not
just a mind-- it's not a game.

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:24.021
It's not an intellectual game.

00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:26.020
It's not a way of showing
off how smart you are,

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.460
which often happens
in the Academy.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.820
Of course, he founded of the
Academy, the first Academy.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:38.180
He founded the prototype
of the European university.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.660
But for Plato, it
is all about trying

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.300
to figure out how to live.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.110
And so we would reverse
himself if he was in love.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.090
He would rethink his ideas.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:51.320
In fact, Plato was constantly
rethinking his ideas.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.730
When we teach Plato,
we say this is

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.010
what Plato said,
theory of forms,

00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:00.560
division between the mind
and the soul and the body.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.900
That's quite wrong.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.470
Plato himself
subjects those views

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:08.440
to stringent,
rigorous criticism.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.840
So much so, that
in later dialogues

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.350
he actually gets them up.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:16.100
So anyway, he has a lot
to say about love and sex.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.490
And what I did for
that is I am friends

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:22.740
with a professional
advice columnist.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.220
She wrote I think
for "Slate" or maybe

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.080
"Salon" as "Dear Prudence."

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:32.450
And she is the daughter of a
very famous advice columnist,

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.570
Ann Landers, and the
niece of a famous advice

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.600
columnist, "Dear Abby."

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.940
And what I did is
I made up questions

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.900
that I knew Plato would have
something to say about because

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.580
of the "Symposium"
and the "Phaedrus."

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.490
And very, very
contemporary questions,

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:52.480
like I'm a graduate student
in a really hard-hit humanity

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.632
subject.

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:54.590
I'm a graduate student.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.090
I about to get my PhD.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:57.090
There are no jobs.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:01.700
My professor has offered to
be my professor with benefits.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.600
Should I do it?

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.110
He's a man of honor.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.940
We're both involved
with other people.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.010
So there's no danger of
getting really involved.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:11.120
Should I do it?

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.080
And this is something
Plato had something to say.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.280
A similar situation
arises in the "Phaedrus."

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.080
And I sent these
various questions--

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.680
I think there are about 12 of
them-- to my friend, Margo.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.920
She gave her answer.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.470
And then she consulted Plato.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:34.860
And I give his advice, which
is often more liberal then

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:39.540
Margo's advice, which
was pretty surprising.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.750
The next place I bring him--
he's on an author's book tour--

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.370
is to cable news.

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.580
And he's on a show
called "The Real

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:57.930
McCoy," the bombastic McCoy.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.310
His name is Roy McCoy.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:08.280
He begins the interview
by saying something

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.220
like-- where is that?

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.490
Roy McCoy.

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:14.080
"OK."

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.660
So they tell me you're a big
deal in philosophy, Plato.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.820
I'm going to tell you
upfront-- because that's

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.230
the kind of guy I
am, upfront-- that I

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.260
don't think much
of philosophers."

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.030
Plato.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.130
"Many don't.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.440
The term attracts a
wide range of reaction,

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.790
from admiration, to
amusement, to animaadversion.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.760
Some people think
philosophers are worthless,

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.060
and others that they are
worth everything in the world.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.320
Sometimes they take on the
appearance of statesmen

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.860
and sometimes of sophists.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.900
Sometimes, too, they
might give the impression

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.627
that they're completely insane."

00:20:42.627 --> 00:20:43.960
This is actually a direct quote.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.280
It comes from "The Sophist."

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.470
McCoy.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.640
"Well, I'm going to
go with that last one,

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.340
just as long as you add that
it's the kind of insane that

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:55.140
makes right-thinking
Americans the world over want

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.310
to smack you upside the head."

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.850
It continues.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:08.400
And it gets into subjects
about American democracy,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.780
whether or not there can be--
in this particular interview--

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:16.390
whether or not there can be
morality without religion?

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.560
Has science progressed?

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.610
Roy McCoy doesn't even think
science has progressed,

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.212
much less philosophy.

00:21:24.212 --> 00:21:25.920
And one of the things
that really happens

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.615
is that there's so little
communication between them.

00:21:30.615 --> 00:21:34.750
And Plato, when he
got his Chromebook

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.320
and he saw the amazing
discussions that are going on,

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.070
the discourse,
the dialogues that

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.880
are going on in the internet,
is very, very hopeful.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:49.220
And hopes that this means that
we're constantly challenging

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:53.370
our own points of view
by speaking to so many

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.240
that we don't even have
to be face to face with.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.840
And on this show,
"The Real McCoy,"

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:05.330
he becomes more despairing about
whether or not these new forms,

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:09.170
the chat rooms, the blogs, are
actually opening our minds up

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:12.110
or whether we're actually
speaking to those who already

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.980
agree with us and even
getting our news from sources

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.870
that already agree with us?

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.580
So he becomes a little
more despairing of us.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.130
But he still thinks we've
made a lot of progress.

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.054
And the last place
I bring him to

00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:31.460
is to this neuroscience
science lab.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.070
And he's about to
have his brain imaged.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.770
He's about to undergo an fMRI.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:42.690
And he gets into a discussion
with two neuroscientists-- one

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.840
is a post-doc and
one is the head

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.760
of the laboratory,
Dr. Shokett-- one

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:53.350
whether or not neuroscience has
retired many of the questions

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.390
that philosophers
used to lay claim

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:00.750
to, free will,
personal identity?

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:07.190
And in fact, all notions of a
person choosing their own life,

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.720
making choices,
decisions intentions?

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.690
And standards of rationality,
whether it's all determined

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:20.690
and its determined on the
level of our 100 billion

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:24.330
neurons firing, or
100 trillion synapses?

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:28.020
Plato, by this time, knows
a lot of neuroscience.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:32.380
And he has a discussion with
these two neuroscientists

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.090
there.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.969
Anyway, so those are
the contemporary places

00:23:35.969 --> 00:23:36.760
that I brought him.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.280
There were many other places I
actually wanted to bring him.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:46.270
He has a lot of things to say
about money and politics mixing

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.970
together and the
dangers of this.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.500
I thought about
bringing him to Congress

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.060
to testify about
campaign finance reform.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.830
And there were actually
a lot of things

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:59.160
I could have lifted it out of
the "Republic" and the "Laws."

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.560
I also thought about
having him give a Ted Talk.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:09.950
And, yeah, that would probably
be a disaster for him.

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:15.680
Actually as I said, his mentor,
the man he loves so much,

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.570
Socrates, hung out in the
Agora, in the marketplace

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:24.540
of Athens, buttonholing
anybody he could

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:28.200
and asking them his
very peculiar questions,

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:33.170
and very high up people,
statesman, powerful people,

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:40.645
rhetoricians, sophists, who were
itinerant professors sort of.

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:44.770
But all the way down to
slaves-- it was a slave society.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:51.980
And Plato, after
Socrates' execution,

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.210
after the Athenians
voted that he

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.000
was guilty of the
two charges that

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.850
were brought against him,
impiety and corrupting

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:03.360
the young-- I have a theory
as to why they killed him

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:09.590
when they did kill him--
that Plato left Athens.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.380
And he might have thought
his own life was in danger.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:17.170
But he was certainly
demoralized, disillusioned.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.910
And he left Athens.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:21.360
He traveled widely.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.150
Very importantly
for the development

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:27.080
of his own point of view
as distinct from Socrates,

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:31.520
he traveled to Italy, which was
the center of the Pythagorean

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.150
community.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:35.320
So this view that
mathematics presents

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.460
the key to
understanding the world.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:43.780
The intelligibility of the world
is given to us in mathematics.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.170
That had a very important
effect on Plato.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:53.830
But when he came back to Athens,
he didn't go to the Agora.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:59.480
That had proved to be pretty
fatal and futile he judged.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.670
And he found the Academy.

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:06.570
He separated himself
from the mass of people.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:12.520
He had a very low opinion
of most people's potential

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.050
for being rational, for
being able to think through.

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:18.000
As you know, he developed the
idea of the philosopher king

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.700
to make most of the decisions
for the masses of us.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:27.260
And he didn't give
one public lecture.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:32.480
And this is why I know he
would really bomb at Ted.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.290
It was on "The good."

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:37.830
And apparently, the
Athenians flocked

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.670
to this one public lecture.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:42.160
Here was the famous
Plato, founder

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:48.380
of their Academy, up
there on the mountaintop,

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:52.350
bringing the jewels of
his wisdom down to them.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:53.400
It was called "The Good."

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.870
They all thought it was going
to give the secret of success,

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:58.300
how we can get ahead.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:03.020
Because the Athenians were
obsessed with that as we are,

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.120
how to achieve, how to get
ahead, how to [INAUDIBLE] your

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:11.640
name abroad, how to acquire
what they called "kleos"

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.430
and what we might call
a high Klout score.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:20.270
And one of the ways in which
we're very close to them.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.580
And they flocked to this.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.680
And Plato gave this talk
on "The Good," which

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:31.920
was mostly mathematics and a
way to convince them that they,

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.280
perhaps, that they really had
no business even going here,

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.770
that they were not capable
of understanding this.

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:42.109
So I think he would not
do very well at Ted.

00:27:42.109 --> 00:27:43.650
But if he did want
to do well at Ted,

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:47.860
he should definitely start
with the death of Socrates,

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:53.480
and how moving that was, and how
that really tore him to pieces,

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.090
and influenced the
rest of his life.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.870
So I know if he has
any savviness, which

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:04.080
I don't think he did have
that kind of savviness,

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.630
that's the way he should begin.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.950
But he would probably
make it all mathematics.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:11.550
Anyway, that is what
I do bringing Plato

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:13.740
into the modern world.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:21.070
And I thought I might read just
a little bit of Plato-- yeah--

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.300
at Google.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.590
Let's see.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:31.890
So I'm going to just
start in the middle.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:36.570
There's already been quite
a lot of discussion here.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:37.070
Let's see.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:41.100
Plato has brought up the
idea of ethical expertise.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.580
That one needs a
kind of expertise

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.940
to be able to answer
ethical questions.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:51.250
And he's used the metaphor
of-- if you have crooked teeth,

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.310
this is a metaphor
that suggests himself

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:57.570
because Marcus has
quite crooked teeth.

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.640
And so if you have
crooked teeth,

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.010
you go to the expert, who can
straighten out your teeth.

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.930
You go to the orthodontist.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.120
And Cheryl has somebody
to recommend in town,

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:12.420
in San Francisco, who
did her children's teeth.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.820
And similarly with
ethical questions,

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.650
that there's a
kind of expertise.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:23.760
And one ought to go to the
experts who the philosophers.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.930
The other thing I guess
that needs to be known

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:34.070
is he's also-- Cheryl makes an
allusion to the Charlie Sheen

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:37.110
level of ask-dumbness.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:40.440
And Plato picks
that up right away.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:46.440
Charlie Sheen being an actor
who behaved very stupidly.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.140
So Plato picks that
up very quickly.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:49.640
OK.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:54.020
So I'm just going to
read a little bit.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.400
Oh, and Cheryl,
the media escort,

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.730
is recouning this episode,
taking Plato around

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:02.630
to her friends.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:06.500
So they're in a bar
in San Francisco.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.740
And she's telling her
friend about this.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.990
Plato's dialogue sometimes
are written like real plays,

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:16.760
with Socrates saying that--
you have the characters listed.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.950
But sometimes it's one
person recounting the story.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:21.980
And here, it's Cheryl
recounting the story.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:22.480
OK.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.750
I'm just going to
read a little bit.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.840
"Oh.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.460
And I ought to mention
that right around now,

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.130
there was a little commotion
because two Googlers had shown

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.160
up to take my
author on his tour.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.440
And I could see that
he was really torn.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.450
He was involved in the
kind of conversation

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:36.550
that you could see
he just lives for.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:38.720
I mean you could see it
was his life's blood.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.050
But he was also eager to get
an insider's look at Google.

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.690
The whole cloud idea had caught
his fancy for some reason.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:48.390
Before I had wanted him to
skip the tour since I thought

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.720
it would be exhausting for him.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.150
But then the kind
of conversation

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.770
he was intent on having was
every bit as exhausting,

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:55.919
at least for me.

00:30:55.919 --> 00:30:57.710
He asked me if it would
be possible to take

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:00.710
the tour after he gave his
Authors at Google Talk?

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:01.716
No, I told him.

00:31:01.716 --> 00:31:03.340
That's out of the
question since that's

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.060
when you're signing the books.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.440
He was all for skipping
the book signing.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.480
But obviously, that wasn't
going to happen on my watch.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.010
When it comes to
that sort of thing,

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.820
then I'm the one who has
to be the tyrant since I

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.180
answer to the publishers.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.850
And believe me, they keep
track of how their authors do

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:23.620
with the various media
escorts, comparing our sales

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.470
records with one another.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:28.140
Marcus tipped the
balance by telling Plato,

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.270
again, that not only did he
want to challenge his view,

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:33.100
but he could also
explain the way

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.610
that Google works, the
way the search engine is

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:37.990
able to deliver the right
information to people

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.660
with such accuracy.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.970
You're not going to get that
on the tour of the Googleplex

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:46.630
he told Plato, since
the answers you're

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:50.260
looking for lie in the sphere of
abstraction, which of course is

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.950
right up your alley.

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:54.450
With that, Plato was so
happy that he actually

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.370
allowed himself a real smile,
not just the hint of one.

00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:00.430
And I sent the tour guides, who
seemed genuinely disappointed,

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:01.490
on their way.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:04.460
Apparently, they were
big fans of Plato's too.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.390
Go figure.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.120
Plato got right
down to business,

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.111
asking Marcus what were the
points he wanted to challenge?

00:32:12.111 --> 00:32:12.610
OK.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:14.810
Let me just reiterate
the major points that

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:18.110
have emerged so far, at least
as I see them, Marcus said.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:20.050
You assume that if
there's knowledge,

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.500
especially if it's a
nontrivial knowledge that's

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.950
difficult to come by, then
those who have the knowledge

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.380
are the few, the experts
in that knowledge.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.600
Is that right?

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.470
Yes, Plato said.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:34.600
That this is so seems to
me almost a tautology.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.261
We shall see, said Marcus.

00:32:36.261 --> 00:32:36.760
OK.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.630
Then you also assume that
there is such a thing

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.890
as knowledge about how we
ought to live our lives,

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:44.260
that it's not just a matter
of personal preference

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.060
or cultural norms, say.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.970
And that this knowledge is
nontrivial and hard to come by.

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:50.520
Am I right?

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.480
Yes, Plato said.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.880
It must certainly be nontrivial
since so many people get

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.490
it wrong, living lives that
are almost at a Charlie Sheen

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.620
level of ask dumbness.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.460
He didn't, I said to Cheryl.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:05.290
He did, repeated
me word for word.

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:09.010
Even Marcus had to all-out
laugh, instead of snicker.

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:10.440
OK, then Marcus went on.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.690
So then the implication
of these two assumptions

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.590
is that if anybody
has this knowledge,

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:17.640
and I suppose it's consistent
with your two assumptions,

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.980
that nobody has it.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.400
But if, in fact, anyone
has this knowledge,

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.990
it can only belong
to those who have

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:25.230
managed to think
their way to it.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:26.290
Am I right?

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:27.890
Yes, said Plato.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:29.730
So according to
you, this knowledge

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:32.060
is something like
mathematical knowledge.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:35.010
It's just as objective,
its truth not determined

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:37.890
by personal preferences
or societal norms.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:41.050
And it's just as non-trivial
and difficult to access,

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:43.070
being a matter of reasoning.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.600
Yes, said Plato.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.070
I agreed to all of this.

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:47.700
In fact, I would go
further and claim

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.630
that it is not only like
mathematical reasoning,

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.790
but that mathematics itself
goes into the knowledge.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:54.800
OK, Marcus said.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.280
But let's just stick with
the weaker proposition

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.990
for the purposes
of my refuting you.

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.330
Yes, agreed Plato.

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:03.610
That makes dialectical sense.

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:04.800
OK, Marcus said.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.750
And then took several
moments to breathe.

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:10.300
He was, as my mother used
to put it, overexcited.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.469
OK, he said again, what
all of this implies,

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:15.690
as Cheryl was
quick to point out,

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.480
is that only those who
are gifted in reasoning

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.810
can discover how
we ought to live.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.650
There's no other way
to access these truths,

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:26.960
meaning that nonphilosophical
people who can't follow

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.980
philosophical arguments,
have to accept

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.530
the conclusions from
the philosophers?

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.330
Yes, said Plato.

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.920
Hence the enormous
obligations to others

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.770
the philosophers have.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:42.150
Including, said
Marcus, obligations

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.639
to tell others how
they should be living,

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:47.420
to legislate morals for them?

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.130
No, said Plato, not
in every respect.

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:53.070
No, since as was also
pointed out by Cheryl,

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.159
there are many matters
that lie entirely

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:58.280
in the sphere of personal
or cultural preferences.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.410
And many such decisions,
which are there for entirely

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:04.850
a matter for an individual to
decide for himself or herself."

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:07.360
He's already been corrected
about his sexist language.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.690
So he overcorrects.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.560
And it's all himself or herself.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.200
Cheryl corrected him on this.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.270
"So for an individual to
decide for himself, or herself,

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:18.750
or to let society
decide for him or her

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:21.170
will help to make for
a life worth living.

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.590
So that, for example,
if I am of such a nature

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:26.240
that I need to test my
manhood-- I hope it's not

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.620
sexist to mention
manhood in this context,

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.820
he asked, looking at me?

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:34.940
Cheryl said, why don't you
just say test your courage?

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.752
Women test their courage too.

00:35:36.752 --> 00:35:37.960
Yes, you're right, he agreed.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.510
If I say I am of
such a nature that I

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:43.670
need to test my courage
by taking repeated risks,

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:46.040
then I am free to do
so insofar as the risks

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.760
I take do not involve
any moral transgressions.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.350
A great deal of the substance
of a life worth living

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:53.730
is made up of
decisions of this sort.

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.340
But not all of them,
Marcus prodded?

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.300
No, not all of
them, Plato agree.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.010
And these are the contributions
to a life worth living

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:06.260
that a philosophically
unintelligent person can't

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:10.840
decide for themselves, but must
instead turn the decision over

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.840
to the philosophically
intelligent, Marcus said.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.550
Not quite, said Plato.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.270
Nobody, the
philosophically intelligent

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:20.930
any more than the
philosophically nonintelligent,

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:24.210
can decide these matters
for himself or herself

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.950
since there are objective
facts of the matter.

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:28.950
Those who can access
such knowledge

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:31.160
are no more able to
change the facts of how

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.690
we are to live
than anybody else.

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:36.350
Like everybody else,
they must abide by them.

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.010
The one difference
is that they are

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.660
able to discover, through the
special talents and training

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:43.230
that are theirs,
what the facts are.

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:46.340
So they are not imposing
their personal will on others,

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:49.660
any more than mathematicians are
imposing their wills on others

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.650
by informing
nonmathematicians what

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:53.550
the mathematical truths are.

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:56.430
They are simply sharing
their knowledge with others,

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.550
knowledge that others cannot
access for themselves,

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.740
lacking the requisite
cognitive skills,

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.190
a matter of both of
talent and training.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.910
This seems to me no
more unfair than that

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:09.180
the mathematically
intelligent share

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.780
their knowledge of
mathematics with

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.900
the mathematically
unintelligent.

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.610
So, for example, you
as a software engineer,

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.210
possess considerable
mathematical intelligence

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:19.450
I would assume?

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:22.170
Yes, Marcus said, I
suppose you could say that.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:24.510
And by working here
at Google, Plato said,

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:26.140
you are able to
provide the benefits

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.637
of your mathematical
intelligence

00:37:27.637 --> 00:37:29.970
to others who are lacking
this kind of intelligence, who

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:32.850
make use of your
powerful search engine

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:36.250
while simply regarding
it as techno-magic.

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:38.840
The difference, Marco
said, is that not everybody

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:42.610
believes himself to be good
in math or even cares too be.

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:44.900
In fact, only those who
are in fact good in math

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.280
give a hoot about whether
they're good at it or not.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.790
But everybody cares about
living his life well

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:53.400
and has strong views
about how best to do it.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.110
And if you tell
him that he's just

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:58.750
lacking the cognitive ability to
figure it all out for himself,

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:04.850
he's going to have some
harsh words for you."

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:08.680
I'm going to stop here
because one thing I think

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:13.640
Plato got very right is
that discourse, dialogue

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:19.720
conversation, give and
take, Q&amp;A, is essential.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:23.130
So I am going to stop here.

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:31.090
Maybe you can anticipate
what Marcus's objection

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:33.500
to what Plato just
said would be?

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.150
Maybe you can even
anticipate what

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:39.550
Plato would say in
answer to Marcus?

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.840
Marcus basically is
trying to take down

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:47.200
the idea of ethical experts,
philosophical experts.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:54.260
So, yeah, I'm going to stop
here and ask for your questions.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.562
Thank you.

00:38:55.562 --> 00:39:00.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:02.410
AUDIENCE: My only
question is am I

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:07.160
expected to have read Plato
before I can enjoy this book?

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.580
REBECCA NEWBERGER GOLDSTEIN:
I do quote from him

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.020
or reference him.

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:15.970
And it's surprising how
often what he has to say

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:19.150
is actually relevant
to conversations

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:22.860
that we are having, that are
very current in our society.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.890
But no, of course not.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:24.950
You don't have to.

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:28.500
Although I am getting emails
from people saying that they've

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.560
opened up their
Plato books, that

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:36.260
haven't been opened since
they were freshman in college.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:39.210
I'll tell you something.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:46.940
And I think so much of Plato
is really terrifically boring.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:51.360
And he's raising these
questions for the first time.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.800
And that's magnificent.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.060
That's amazing.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.840
And philosophy is divided into
all these subspecialities.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:03.460
For just about any area of
human inquiry or concern,

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:06.164
there's a corresponding
area of philosophy.

00:40:06.164 --> 00:40:07.705
So philosophy of
language; philosophy

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:10.092
of science, which is my
own particular interest;

00:40:10.092 --> 00:40:11.550
philosophy of
mathematics, I'm also

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:14.870
quite interested in that;
philosophy of history;

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:17.860
philosophy of religion;
philosophy of art;

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:22.389
ethics; political philosophy;
philosophy of knowledge itself,

00:40:22.389 --> 00:40:22.930
epistemology.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.970
I'm leaving things out.

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:31.400
And now, applied
ethics as well So

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:36.830
applied ethics is applied to the
environment, to medical ethics,

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:41.860
to minority concerns.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:46.770
So for every area, there's
a corresponding area

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:47.880
of philosophy.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:52.760
What's amazing is Plato actually
carved out that entire terrain.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:56.080
He really asked the
paradigmatic questions

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.850
in philosophy of mathematics,
in philosophy of language,

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:04.030
in philosophy of
religion, epistemology.

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:05.440
Certainly ethics,
but that he had

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.180
gotten from Socrates,
that concern with ethics

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:11.860
and, well, perhaps to some
extent, political philosophy

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.210
he had gotten from Socrates.

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.460
But he asked these questions.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.660
And what else is so interesting,
philosophical questions

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.660
are very peculiar.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.860
A lot of the questions that
were first asked by philosophers

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.870
were protoscientific questions.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.960
As science progressed,
they were taken out

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.400
of the domain of philosophy.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:39.420
The empirical methodology caught
up and they were answered.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.440
So all of physics
and cosmology started

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.850
in the domain of philosophy.

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:45.900
It was called
natural philosophy.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:50.250
And it really pretty much
remained as philosophy

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:54.120
until the 16th,
17th century, when

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:58.900
the scientific method really--
this beautiful marriage

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:03.940
of empiricism and mathematical
description-- that part Plato

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:06.530
got right-- were
brought together

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:08.200
and we really started
making headway

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:12.310
and overturned the
Aristotelian/Ptolemaic system

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:16.750
that had dominated in
science until the reemergence

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:19.610
of science, or real
science I would say,

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:22.430
with Copernicus,
Kepler, Galileo.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:25.630
By the way, Kepler
and Galileo, who

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:31.310
so valued mathematical
description,

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:34.770
always referred to Plato
as the Divine Plato.

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:37.890
And if you read the "Timaeus,"
you'll understand why.

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:41.350
Because that notion
that it's math--

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:43.690
he's pretty much given
up on the theory of forms

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:47.350
by the "Timaeus"--
and it's math.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:50.680
And it's, in fact, the
most beautiful math.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.510
So if we have two
theories and they're both

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:56.900
adequate to explain
what we're observing,

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.510
go with the mathematically
beautiful one

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.330
and you'll go towards the truth.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:06.010
Kepler, Copernicus, that's
what they were saying.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:09.280
In fact, Kepler-- I'm
sorry, Galileo had said,

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.970
he wouldn't even have
bothered with experimen--

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:14.550
because the math, the
beautiful math was enough--

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:17.090
if his critics weren't
so stupid so that he

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:20.190
had to actually demonstrate
to them with experiments.

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:25.680
So this kind of notion of the
beautiful math leading the way,

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.540
this is Plato.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:31.210
But in any case, a lot
of scientific questions

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:34.330
first belonged to philosophy.

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:36.310
And then the
empirical methodology

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:40.990
catches up; psychology,
same thing; linguistics.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:45.410
Logic, which belonged to the
sphere of philosophy, now

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:48.500
it takes place in
mathematics departments.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:52.450
So as science
progresses, it is true

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:56.350
that the set of philosophical
questions somewhat shrinks.

00:43:56.350 --> 00:44:00.140
But I actually think that
there's a conservation because

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.940
of philosophical
questions because science

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:07.240
itself presents so many
philosophical questions to us,

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.670
trying to make sense
of the science.

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:13.060
That's why philosophers always
have to keep up with science.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:16.080
But why am I saying all
of this in answer to you?

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.880
Because I didn't say it before
and I think it's important.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.750
But no, you don't know to Plato.

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:24.610
As much as I can,
I bring him in.

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.110
I know I why I was
saying it to you.

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:30.530
Because what philosophers
are often-- you know,

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:32.740
we're often
defending ourselves--

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.420
especially if you're a
philosopher like me who

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.940
hangs out mostly with
scientists-- we're often

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.010
defending ourselves
against the charge

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:43.960
that, look, the
history of philosophy

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.390
is the history of contraction.

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:54.270
As science expands,
philosophy shrinks, contracts.

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:58.000
Here is an equation, the
fate of philosophy equation,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.120
as t goes toward infinity, the
set of philosophical questions

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.770
goes towards the null set.

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:08.680
I mean that, in fact,
eventually science

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.580
will answer all of
these questions.

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:13.960
I think that's wrong actually.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:17.140
And Plato-- this is the
extraordinary thing--

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:19.160
Plato, even though
he really lived

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:24.052
before there was any
real science to speak of,

00:45:24.052 --> 00:45:28.020
had some of the best of
antireductive arguments

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:34.840
against that sort of reduction
of all philosophical questions

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.915
to scientific ones.

00:45:35.915 --> 00:45:37.690
The other place where
you often hear this

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:42.160
is not science, that philosophy
has no right to exist,

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.220
but religion.

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.320
And that used to be an argument
you would get much more

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.350
often in the bad old days.

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:50.190
But you still get it actually.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:54.330
And Plato also has, in the
youth of Rome, the best argument

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:58.110
against those who would reduce
philosophical questions,

00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:00.380
in particular ethical
questions, or why is there

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:03.990
something rather than nothing,
to religious questions,

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:06.940
but particularly
moral questions.

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:12.460
He has an incredible argument,
which is still repeated,

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:16.490
even into our day by the
so-called "new atheists,"

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:21.720
as to why religion can
never ground morality.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:26.040
So he has these two very
prescient arguments,

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.540
on the one side against
scientific reductionism,

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.530
and on the other
side against sort

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:33.290
of theological reductionism.

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:38.820
And that's really all you have
to know about Plato, I think.

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.770
That is the most
interesting thing about him.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:44.570
He had such a nose
for this peculiar kind

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:46.120
of philosophical
question, that not

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:50.890
only did he raise this
submerged continent

00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:54.040
of philosophical questions,
he had the prescience

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.010
to see that some
of these questions

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:59.660
would never be answered, either
by religion or by science,

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.830
but yet could be answered
through human reason

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:04.520
or we could make
progress with them

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:10.180
through human reason,
an ongoing process.

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:13.520
So I think that's the
most important thing

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.350
to know about Plato
and not to have

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:21.490
to wade through so much that's
not terribly interesting to us

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:23.002
anymore.

00:47:23.002 --> 00:47:25.210
AUDIENCE: I'm actually
interested in the relationship

00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:28.960
between Plato and what he might
think of modern technology.

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:31.820
And specifically, for
example, what would

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:35.150
he think about our
extreme preoccupation

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:36.850
with Facebook and Google?

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:39.070
Like would that,
for example, make

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:42.875
us sink deeper into the cave
or allow us to leave the cave?

00:47:42.875 --> 00:47:44.250
REBECCA NEWBERGER
GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:50.850
Actually, yes, this thing that
I have in the "New York Times,"

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:53.000
"The Stone," is
exactly about this.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.070
It's exactly about
what would Plato tweet?

00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:00.940
I had never tweeted and
I'm not on Facebook.

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.550
I had never been interested.

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:05.620
But my daughter, who
is much more savvy

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.600
than I am, suggested
to me, how would you

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.310
like to tweet as Plato?

00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:14.080
And I have been tweeting
as Plato for like the past,

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.740
I don't know, three
weeks or something.

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.330
And the handle is platobooktour.

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:20.260
So Plato is with us now.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:25.330
I often have him tweeting about
the events that I've gone on.

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:27.440
And I was just with
a writer last night.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:30.160
And he said to me, oh, did you
lie in bed afterwards thinking,

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.020
oh, this is how I should
have answered the question?

00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:33.530
And I said, well,
of course I do.

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:36.090
I mean it's always
very hard to give

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:37.610
an adequate answer outright.

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:42.830
But now, I could have
Plato saying, regarding

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:45.840
capital punishment question
at Harvard bookstore,

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.470
Goldstein flubbed it.

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:48.910
Here's what I say.

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:52.170
So this is just wonderful
for me because I can actually

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:55.220
answer them much better,
what Plato would have to say.

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:59.420
Plato, I think,
would be quite struck

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:06.590
by the way in which we're trying
to answer the questions of how

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:10.540
to live a life that
matters and that we're all

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:11.880
preoccupied with that question.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:16.080
For a very long time,
religion answered that for us,

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:20.050
we mattered in the universe
in a very large way.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:22.470
God, we mattered to God.

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:24.500
God was keeping track
of everything we did.

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.255
I was brought up very religious.

00:49:26.255 --> 00:49:32.630
And I believed as a little
girl that if I took a nibble

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:35.260
from a Hostess, Twinkie
bar, which do not

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.060
have the right
rabbinical symbol on it,

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:45.820
that the Lord of the Hosts
would take note and punish me.

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:50.170
I had to do my repentance,
which was terrifying.

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:54.110
But it certainly gave one a
sense that you really mattered.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:57.780
Every single thing
you did mattered.

00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:01.900
For many of us that
kind of confirmation

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.570
of our mattering coming
from that kind of worldview

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:07.310
no longer resonates.

00:50:07.310 --> 00:50:10.260
And so this question
that actually

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:13.870
was there in Plato's
society-- his society

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:15.630
was premonotheistic.

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:18.970
We are more and more
postmonotheistic.

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:22.090
And we're going
towards the same kind

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:28.630
of answer, which is we want a
lot of people to know of us.

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:31.730
If God's not watching, we
want as many Twitter followers

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:33.490
as possible.

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:35.030
We broadcast everything.

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:36.405
If you're in a
restaurant, people

00:50:36.405 --> 00:50:39.450
are taking pictures of their
food to put on Facebook.

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:44.300
That sense of giving our
life a "moreness" using

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:51.080
our social media, now that
Jehovah's no longer watching.

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:57.240
It's very similar to what
the ancient Greek society,

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.100
especially Athens, was about.

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:06.850
And it was against that Socrates
was arguing in the Agora.

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:08.570
That's what he was saying.

00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:12.810
When he says the unexamined
life is not worth living, which

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:14.770
Plato has him saying
in the "Apology," which

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:18.180
was Plato's version
of Socrates' trial,

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:21.010
which did not end
well for Socrates,

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:25.300
that when he's saying
that, he is antagonizing

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:30.010
the Athenians so that
his execution is almost

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:34.070
a foregone conclusion because
they were so concerned

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:38.440
with feeling that they
mattered and believing

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:42.010
that their high achievements--
and for those who couldn't

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:44.700
achieve, just being
an Athenian, being

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:48.360
a member of that exceptional
society-- if there

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.400
was Athenian
exceptionalism, just as

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.490
American
exceptionalism-- to just

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:55.830
be a member of that society
would do it for you.

00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:56.730
You mattered.

00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:00.080
But they had this
notion of kleos,

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.630
which meant to claim
and to do something, be

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:08.100
an Olympic victor,
be a great warrior,

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:14.090
be smart, be a good philosopher,
be a sophist, be very rich,

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:15.020
be beautiful.

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.590
They worshipped beauty
because anything

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:21.160
that would blow your life
up so that many people would

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:28.546
be paying attention satisfied
their notion of mattering.

00:52:28.546 --> 00:52:29.920
Because you
certainly didn't look

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.110
to the Greek gods for your
affirmation of existence.

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:35.550
The last thing you
wanted was the attention

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:36.420
of the Greek gods.

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:39.290
Something terrible always
happened if they paid attention

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:43.610
to you, at the very
least a rate or worse.

00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:45.630
And so you didn't look there.

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:47.210
You looked to your
fellow citizens

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:48.710
and you tried to
do something big.

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:51.550
This obviously
promoted a society

00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:55.490
of extraordinary, explosive
ambition and achievement, also

00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:57.360
havoc.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:05.470
But Plato, and Socrates before
him, thought that it's shallow.

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:06.880
That's not what's
going to do it.

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.780
So Plato is struck
by similarities

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:13.940
and the way we're falling
back on social media

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:19.000
to fill the vacuum that
monotheism has left,

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.900
to create a society that's very
much like the one that forced

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:25.230
philosophy in the first place.

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:29.410
Which is why he thinks
that our society is

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:37.070
a ripe for again recognizing
the value of philosophy.

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:38.980
That's what he thinks.

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:41.732
I sort of think so too.

00:53:41.732 --> 00:53:43.190
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you, Rebecca.

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:44.840
So we need to wrap up.

00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.170
But she'll be here
for a few more minutes

00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:50.160
for those of you who'd like
to come on up and chat.

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.020
Thank you.

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:52.645
REBECCA NEWBERGER
GOLDSTEIN: Thank you.

00:53:52.645 --> 00:53:55.305
