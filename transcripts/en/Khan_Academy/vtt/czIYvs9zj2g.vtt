00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.830
Let's say I've got an
m-by-n matrix A.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.500
That's my matrix right there.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.340
And I could just write it as a
series of n column vectors, so

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.520
it could be a1, a2,
all the way to an.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.590
Now, let's say that I have
some other vector b.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.540
Let's say b is a member of
the column space of A.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.880
Remember, the column space is
just the set of all of the

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.830
vectors that can be represented
as a linear

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.200
combination of the columns of A,
so that means that b can be

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.230
represented as a linear
combination of

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.280
the columns of A.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.840
So I'll just write the constant
factors as x1 times

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:58.800
a1 plus x2 times a2, all the way
to plus xn times an, where

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.830
x1, x2, xn, they're all just
arbitrary real numbers.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:11.550
Another way to state this is
that that means that a, which

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.560
I could write as a1, a2, all
the way to an, times some

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:26.400
vector x1, x2, all the way
to xn, is equal to b.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.940
These two statements
are equivalent.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.110
We know that b is a member
of the column space.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.120
That means that b can be
represented as a linear

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.660
combination of the columns of
A, and that this statement

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.320
right here can be rewritten
this way.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:48.940
So you can write that the
equation Ax equals b has at

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:58.910
least one solution x that
is a member of Rn.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.070
And the entries of x would
represent the weights on the

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.210
column vectors of A to get your
linear combination b.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.970
This is all a bit of review.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.490
Now, let's draw Rn.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.050
Any solution to this equation
right here is going to be a

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.940
member of Rn.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.920
Remember, this is an
m-by-n matrix.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.320
We had n columns and this has
to be a member of Rn right

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.380
there, so let's draw Rn.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.650
So Rn maybe looks like
that, so that is Rn.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.070
And let's look at some of the
subspaces that we have in Rn.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.290
We have the null space.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.740
That's going to be in Rn.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.600
The null space is all of the
solutions to the equation Ax

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.830
is equal to 0.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.980
That's going to be in Rn.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.020
It's all of the x's that satisfy
that equation, so let

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.240
me draw that right here.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.140
So let's say I have the null
space right there, so that is

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.720
the null space of A.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.870
And then what else
do we have in Rn?

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.340
Well, we have the orthogonal
complement of the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.960
null space of A.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.550
Let me draw that.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.702
So we have the orthogonal
complement-- let me doing it

00:03:06.702 --> 00:03:09.260
in a different color.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.750
We have the orthogonal
complement of the null space

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.130
of A, which we can also
call-- we learned

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.160
this in the last video.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.700
This is also going to be equal
to the row space of A, which

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.090
is also just the column space.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.780
The row space of A is the column
space of A transpose.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.580
So we have two spaces here.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.780
That is the row space of A.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.730
So I have two subsets of Rn.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.320
I have the null space and then
I have the null space's

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.810
complement, orthogonal
complement, which is the row

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.080
space of A.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.150
Now, we've seen in several
videos now, and I proved it I

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.490
think two videos ago, that
any vector in Rn can be

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.750
represented as a sum of a member
of our null space,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.620
let's call that vector n, and
let's say some vector in our

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.430
row space, let's call
that vector r.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.470
Any vector in Rn can be
represented as a sum of some

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.920
vector in our null space and
some vector in our row space.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.590
So any solution to this equation
is a member of Rn so

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.190
it must be able to be
represented by some member of

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.630
our null space and some member
of our row space.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.000
So let's write that down.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:47.630
So let's say x is a solution
to Ax equals b, which also

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:54.670
means that x is a member of Rn,
so because it's a member

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.950
of Rn, we can represent it as
a combination of one vector

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:58.970
here and one vector there.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:11.460
So let's say that x is equal
to some vector r0, plus n0,

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:26.190
where r0 is a member of our row
space and n0 is a member

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.140
of the row space's orthogonal
complement.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.510
They are the orthogonal
complements of each other, so

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.760
n0 is a member of
our null space.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.730
Fair enough.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.140
Now, one thing we might wonder
is, clearly this vector isn't

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.950
a solution to Ax equals b.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.430
This vector is a solution
to Ax is equal to 0.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.670
But we might be curious as to
whether this solution right

00:05:52.670 --> 00:06:00.870
here, this member of our row
space is a solution to Ax is

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.780
equal to b.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.440
This is kind of what we're
focused on in this.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.260
So let's solve for
r0 right here.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.560
So if we solve for r0, if we
subtract n0 from both sides,

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.360
we get r0 is equal
to x minus n0.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.840
All I did was subtract n0 from
both sides and I switched

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.410
things around.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.040
I solved for r0.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:28.180
Now, if we multiply, A times
r0 is equal to A times this

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.030
whole thing-- let me switch
colors-- that's equal to A

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:47.770
times x0 minus n0, which is
equal to Ax minus An0.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.550
And what is this equal to?

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.910
Well, A times x, we already said
that x is a solution to

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.450
Ax equals b, so this
right here is going

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:56.410
to be equal to b.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.790
And n0 is a member of our null
space, which means it

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.070
satisfies this solution right
here, that A times any member

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.850
of our null space is going to
be equal to the zero vector.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.150
So that's going to be equal
to the zero vector.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.350
So you have the vector b minus
the zero vector, and you're

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.760
just going to have
the vector b.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.510
So we just found out that A
times this member of our row

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.400
space-- let's call that
r0, that's that

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.390
guy right there maybe.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.380
A times r0 is equal to b.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.350
So this is a solution.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:42.020
So r0 is a solution to
Ax is equal to b.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.790
So far, it 's kind of an
interesting result that we

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:46.810
have already.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.720
If you give me any vector here
b that is a member of our

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.320
column space, then there is
going to be some member of our

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:03.370
row space right here that is a
solution to Ax is equal to b.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.140
Now, the next question you might
wonder is, is this the

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.720
only guy in our row space
that is a solution to

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.280
Ax is equal to b?

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.650
And to prove that,
let's assume that

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.300
there's another guy here.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:23.380
Let's say that r1 is a member
of our row space and a

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:30.440
solution to Ax is equal to b.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.620
Now, the row space is a valid
subspace, so if I take the sum

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.409
or the difference of any two
vectors in the row space, I'll

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:39.240
get another member
of the row space.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:46.320
That's one of the requirements
for being a valid subspace.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.520
So let's see this.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.180
So if I take two members of our
subspace, so if I take r1

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.710
minus r0 and I take their
difference, which is just the

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.940
sum-- well, you multiply 1 times
the negative and that

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.700
has to be a member of the
subspace when you're summing

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.380
them, so this has to be a
member of our subspace.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:09.000
So this must also be a member
of our of our row space.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.630
That's because our row space
is a valid subspace.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.960
You get two of its members, you
take its difference, that

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.230
also has to be a member.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.170
Fair enough.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.270
Now, let's see what
happens when you

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.170
multiply this guy by A.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:26.570
So if I take A times r1 minus
r0, what do I get?

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:31.300
I get A times r1 minus
A times r0.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.770
We already figured out, or for
r1 we assumed that it is a

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.230
solution to Ax is equal to b,
and r0, we already found out,

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.890
it is a solution to
Ax equal to b.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.670
So either of these, when
you multiply them by

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.580
A, it equals b.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.520
So this equals b and that equals
b, so you get b minus

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.140
b, which is the zero vector.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.710
Now, this is interesting.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:57.440
This tells us that r minus r0 is
a solution to the equation

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.770
Ax is equal to 0, right?

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:05.110
When I put r1 minus r0 in the
place of x right there and I

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.550
multiplied it times
the A, I got 0.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:16.060
I got 0, which implies that r1
minus r0, that this vector is

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.440
a member of our null space.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:24.220
So I have a vector here that's
a member of my row space, and

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.540
we got that from the fact that
both of these are members of

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.150
our row space and the row space
is closed under addition

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:34.630
and subtraction, and the vector
r1 minus r0 is a member

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.910
of my null space.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.040
And we've seen this several
times already.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:44.100
If I have a vector that is in
a subspace and it's also in

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.302
the orthogonal complement of the
subspace, the null space

00:10:47.302 --> 00:10:52.570
is also the orthogonal
complement of the row space,

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.750
then the only possible
vector that that can

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.130
be is the zero vector.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.300
That's the only vector that's
inside of a subspace and it's

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.250
orthogonal complement or a
subspace and it's orthogonal

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:03.810
complement.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.270
These two guys are
the orthogonal

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.300
complements of each other.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.040
We drew it up here.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:15.190
So we get that r1 one
minus r0 must be

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.410
equal to the zero vector.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.830
That's the only vector that's
in a subspace and its

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:23.910
orthogonal complement,
which implies that r1

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.955
must be equal to r0.

00:11:25.955 --> 00:11:28.700
When we take the difference,
we get the zero vector.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.925
So we have a couple of
neat results here.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.020
What do we know so far?

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:39.270
We know that if we have some
vector b that is a member of

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:50.420
our column space of A,
then there exists a

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.920
unique member, right?

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.180
We just proved the uniqueness.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:03.050
There exists a unique member
of the row space of A.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.190
Let me write it.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.910
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:16.720
Of the row space of A, so this
is the row space of A such

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:22.320
that a unique member of the
row space of A, let

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.450
me call that r0.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.100
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.120
I want to make this really
stand out in your brain.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:38.030
So we know that r0 is a member
of the row space of A such

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:57.400
that r0 is a solution
to Ax is equal to b.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.530
It's a little bit of a complex
statement here, but it's

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.040
interesting.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.917
You give me any b that's a
member of the column space of

00:13:02.917 --> 00:13:06.730
A, then there will exist a
unique member of the row space

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:10.300
of A, that's my unique member of
the row space of A, that is

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.710
a solution to Ax
is equal to b.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.250
Now, we can go further
with this.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.010
We can go further.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:23.660
We wrote up here that any
solution to this equation Ax

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:28.110
is equal to b can be written as
a sum of r0 plus n0, where

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.250
r0 is a member of our row space
and n0 is a member of

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.450
our null space, and that's
because we have a subspace and

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:34.405
its orthogonal complement.

00:13:34.405 --> 00:13:38.990
So any member of Rn can be
represented as a sum of a

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.480
subspace and a member of the
subspace's orthogonal

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.190
complement.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.790
Let me rewrite that down here.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:59.310
So we already said that any
solution x to Ax is equal to b

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:10.330
can be written as a
combination-- let me write it

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:16.520
this way-- as a combination
of r0 plus n0.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.950
Fair enough.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:23.560
Now, what happens if I wanted
to take the square of the

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.620
length of x on both
sides of that.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.700
Let me write this down, and
you'll see why I'm writing

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.890
this, because I have
another interesting

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.040
result to show you.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.810
So if I were take the square
of any solution to this

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:41.200
equation right here, well,
that's going to be the same

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.640
thing as x dot x, which is the
same thing as this thing dot

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:55.590
itself, same thing as r0
plus n0 dot r0 plus n0.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.330
And what is this equal to?

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:12.550
This is equal to r0 dot r0 plus
n0 dot r0 plus n0 dot r0

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:18.270
again plus n0 dot n0.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.870
I just kind of foiled it out and
we can do that because we

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:28.110
know the dot product exhibits
the distributive property.

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.900
So this thing right here
is equal to the

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.310
length of r0 squared.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:41.070
Now, we're going to have--
what is n0 dot r0?

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.340
We don't even have to simplify
this much more. n0 is a member

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.580
of our null space.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.340
r0 is a member of
our row space.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.860
Each of them is in a subspace
that is the orthogonal

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.120
complement of the other, which
means that everything here

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.610
dotted with anything in
here is equal to 0.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:00.940
So r0 dot n0 is going
to be equal to 0.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.340
These guys are orthogonal to
each other, so that's going to

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.300
be equal to 0, that's going to
be equal to 0, and then you

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:12.790
get plus-- what's this? n0 dot
n0 is just the length of the

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.160
vector n0 squared.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.210
These are all vectors.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:21.360
And so we get the length of the
vector x squared is equal

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.490
to the length of our member of
our row space squared, our

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.150
unique member of our row space
squared, plus that member of

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.670
our null space squared.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:34.670
Now, this is definitely going
to be a positive number.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:38.140
It's at minimum 0, but it has to
be something larger than 0,

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.200
so we can say that this
quantity right here is

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:47.730
definitely greater than or
equal to just r0 squared.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.500
Or another way to think about
it is, you give me any

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:59.490
solution to the equation Ax is
equal to b, and the square of

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.620
its length is going to be
greater than or equal to the

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.020
square of r0's length.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.910
Or since both of the lengths are
always positive, you can

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.099
take kind of the positive square
root and you know you

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:15.270
won't have to switch signs
there, that the length of any

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.440
solution to Ax equals b is going
to be greater than or

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.730
equal to the length of r0.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.810
So that makes r0 kind of
a special solution.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.200
So now let's write our entire
statement, everything that

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.450
we've learned in this video.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:35.580
So if b is a member of the
column space of A, then there

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:54.670
exists a unique r0 that is a
member of the row space of A,

00:17:54.670 --> 00:18:07.370
such that r0 is a solution
to Ax is equal to b.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.880
And not only is it a solution,
it's a special solution.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:22.500
r0 is the solution with the
least, or no solution has a

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.560
smaller length than r0.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.330
Let me write it that way.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.800
Maybe some other solution could
be equal but could have

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.190
the same length.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:47.600
And no other solution can
have a smaller length.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.035
Maybe we could write that if you
give me any vector b that

00:18:51.035 --> 00:18:53.860
is a member of the column space
of A, then there exists

00:18:53.860 --> 00:19:00.300
a unique member of the row space
that is essentially the

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.800
smallest solution.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.210
You can write small as having
the least length to Ax is

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.200
equal to b, which is a
pretty neat outcome.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.480
In the next video, we'll
explore this a

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.640
little bit more visually.
