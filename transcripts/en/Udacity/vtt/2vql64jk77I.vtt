00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.420
Strong correlations might not always be a good

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.270
thing. Let's hear from Mora about why we

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.630
look at correlation in the first place, and

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.630
what it can tell us about two variables.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.450
&gt;&gt; So in addition to doing scatter plots where you can visually

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.940
see how related two variables are typically, I will actually measure their

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.520
correlation coefficient to really quantify how

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.910
correlated they are. This is really

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.500
important, because a lot of the data that I work with is correlated

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.380
with each other. So, for example, looking at Facebook

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.130
data, how many status updates someone posts in a month

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.640
is really highly correlated usually with how many days

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.430
in the last month they logged in, or how many

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.200
friends they have, or how many photos they uploaded

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.260
in the last Month. All of these variables are typically

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.230
very highly related, and it's usually because they all kind

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.850
of measure the same thing. It's how engaged someone is.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.690
And so typically, when I'm working on a problem and I'm

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.590
going to be doing some kind of regression where I'm modeling something,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.600
I'm going to be throwing some of these variables into the regression.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.940
And one of the assumptions of regression is these variables are

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.740
independent of each other. And so if any two are too

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.620
highly correlated with each other, it will be really difficult to

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.630
tell which ones are actually driving the phenomenon. And so it's

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.070
important to measure the correlation between your variables first, often because

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.250
it'll help you determine which ones you don't actually want to throw in

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.358
together, and it might help you decide which ones you actually want to keep.
