00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Hi.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.200
My name is Larry Appelbaum from the
Music Division here at the Library

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.180
of Congress, and I'm pleased to say
joining us is composer, arranger,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.830
band leader, Maria Schneider.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.130
Nice to see you again.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Good to see you.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.810
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah, we
spent some time this morning going

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.280
through some treasures in the
collection, jazz and otherwise.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.610
I want to -- I want you to tell
our viewers what made an impression

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.910
on you?

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.210
What resonated?

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.830
What moved you?

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.240
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
It's just for me,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.860
I love seeing what a
composer puts to paper,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.620
seeing what their process is,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.860
imagining the thought
going down on the paper.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.820
And, you know, for years,
I was a music copyist,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.880 position:56%
and I still write in pen and pencil.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:26.030
And I always enjoyed the -- seeing
maybe even the speed and the --

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.090
the confidence which you can see
somebody put down their ideas or --

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.610 position:56%
The Bartok we looked at today where
you could see -- Actually, you know,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.700
he was making his own bar lines
down and the score and everything

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.890
and you see he did it from the
hospital, writing concerto for --

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.190
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Orchestra.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.490
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: -- orchestra.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.790
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.090
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: And
yeah, it was just fun.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.990
And I enjoyed also seeing some
of the letters, because I am one

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.740
of those people that's very
interested in the person

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.950
and the relationships
and everything that makes

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.380
up who they are as a musician.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.180
I never think even in my own music,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.050
I don't think of writing
music as music.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.330
To me, music is a conduit for
life and so knowing and the fact

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.630
that you have these archives
and knowing a little bit

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.190
about these people's lives
through letters and things

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.530
like that just enriches it.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.830
It's --

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.380
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: When's the
last time you wrote a letter?

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.040
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: An
actual handwritten letter?

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.170
I send postcards and letters still.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.470
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Oh really?

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.770
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.070
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Wonderful.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.370
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
I mean, mostly email,

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.940
but if there's somebody I really
want to write something too,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.010
I'll still put it in a
postcard or a card, yeah.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.150
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Now
you mention the Bartok.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.450
That was a commission.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.020
It was from the mid-1940s --
I think 1943 he finished it.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.760
You -- You've undertaken
a commission

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.760 position:56%
for the library's concert this week.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.910
I want you to tell us a little
bit about that commission.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.230
Have you finished it?

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.090
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yes,
yes, I finished, although --

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.570
although, you know,
we're rehearsing.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.980
And for me, Peter Sellars
years ago --

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.970
Peter Sellars commissioned me
to write something for my band.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.270
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: The director.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.570
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yes.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.870
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.170
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Yeah, the director, yes,

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.470
for the Mozart Festival in Vienna.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.220
And I wrote a piece -- Actually,
we're going to close our concert

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.750
with called Cerulean Skies.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.510
And when we premiered
it, you know, I was --

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.490 position:56%
You know, it's always a little bit
of a work in progress, so, you know,

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.200
I always end up doing editing.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.700
So -- And he said, Maria,
the premiere is never quite,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.240
you know, where it's going to be.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.070
It's the first act and
then you do, and so,

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.910
I hope we're going
to be okay, you know?

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.890
But it's scary because I did it,

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.390
something that's a
little bit unusual.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.400
It has different kinds of
gestures and rhythmic things

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.920
that the band is playing that I
am just indicating with my body.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.680
The piece is called Data
Lords, and it's piece that's

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.100
about this seduction of all of us
through actually the use of music

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.410
and video and all these
things that people --

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.260
that corporations like YouTube
and Google use to draw eyeballs

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.420
so that they can gather
data and turn it into money.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.740
And these big data companies
I see them that they are now

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.220
like data lords and we
are kind of the serfdom.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.440
And it's just taking so much.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.850
It's literally just sucking
the life out of our economy,

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.130
our music economy and also
out of I think a certain --

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.980
It's the total opposite of what we
did today, that thing of looking

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.480 position:56%
at the real thing, the pencil to the
paper, the thing that the paper made

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.710
as opposed to this sort of
plasticized, digitized thing

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.270
that just is churned out.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.740
It's like force-feeding, you
know, yourself at the, you know,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.170
the trough or something
like that -- the trough --

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.920
You know the fast food --

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.300
I mean that's how people
are getting their music.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.640
And so it's this idea that
we're all just giving this away

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.780
and this intelligence of this thing

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.660
because of all this data is
getting bigger and bigger,

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.510
and they know that there
is a point at which

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:25.120
that intelligence will become more
than ours, that it will know more.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.150
We're already at the point where
that data turns into knowledge

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.210
about people and disease
or certain things,

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.580
and they don't even really
understand what those things are,

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.900
but that they can predict
things because of all that data.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.180
So anyway, this is a piece
that has -- It has --

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.830
I don't know if you'd call
it some beauty but seduction,

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.510
but then it kind of overtakes you.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.170
So there's these gestures
of the band doing

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.950
like [makes musical
sound], you know.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.260
So we're still -- we're
still getting that, you know.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.140
It's a little bit of a dance.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.650 position:56%
So hopefully we'll be well-prepared.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.590
It's a little intimidating
when you say Bartok's concerto

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.980
for orchestra was commissioned
by the Library of Congress.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.470
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Well, it's all music.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.770
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yes.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.070
Well, that it is.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.370
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yes.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.340
So in an era of data lords,
what happens to artists' rights?

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Well, there's
been this kind of wholesale idea fed

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.810
to artists which artists had
bought into for decades and decades

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.630
that exposure at all
costs; you know,

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.200
I don't really care
what the contract says.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.800
I don't really understand it.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.990
I just want to get
my music out there.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.080
And so of course something
like YouTube uses that.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.670
Hey, look at all the
exposure you're going to get.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:49.580
So, you know -- so we've so
completely overexposed ourselves,

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.370
and then they've now
created this culture.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.010
They make it so easy to put things
up -- difficult to take it down --

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.490
impossible to take
it down effectively.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.260
Google, you know, you can't keep
up with the BitTorrenting and,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.390
you know, the Torrent
sites and all these things.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.080
And so they purposely don't ask
questions when you upload it.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.580
When you take it down, you get
asked all sorts of questions.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.070 position:56%
And so what was your question again?

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.710
I forgot what was the --

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.280
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Oh,
about artists' rights --

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.580
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Oh
the artists' rights.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.880
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: -- [inaudible].

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.000
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: So there's
no -- There are no rights there.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.370
I mean there's no law
holding them accountable

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.800
for inducing this infringement.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.500
They monetize it through ads.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:43.030
It doesn't come to the
musicians, and it's --

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.910
There's such an erosion of rights.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:50.730
I mean most artists that I know now
are telling me that their royalties

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.860
and things from their various
sources are about ten percent

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.870
of what they were and
it is that bad.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.280
It is really that bad, so, yeah.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.580
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Is it impacting you --

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.880
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Absolutely.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.180
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: -- directly?

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.480
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Well, in different ways.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.870 position:56%
I notice the impact definitely on
my performance royalties like the --

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.390
you know, the -- Because
now what's happening,

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.640
it used to be that
music had a value.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.940
Music had a value.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.420
We said it costs this much
to make music, make a record,

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.190
we're going to price this
record at such and such.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.120
You know, this is what it costs.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.000
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So does
this impact you directly?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.320
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: It's
impacted me in a very big way

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.590
and it shaped the way
I do things now.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:37.010
So, one of the things that are
going on is that it used to be

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:41.350
that people set their price,
like this shirt, you know.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.810 position:56%
What does it cost for the materials?

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.920
What does it cost to make it?

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.740
The store that buys the shirt
pays that to the manufacturer,

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.360
the designer or all those
things and then sells the shirt.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.040
When you buy the shirt,
they aren't --

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.770
They're pricing according to what
they have to pay for that shirt.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.680
So now in the music business
with streaming and everything,

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.640
what's happening -- and the
government is setting some

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.970 position:56%
of these standards that it just to
me -- It does not make sense at all.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:18.200
They are paying musicians
for the music.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.500
They're paying for the music.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.180
The creator, the performers,
everything are being paid according

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:29.580
to a percentage of the
net profit of a company,

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.530
what they say their
profit is or isn't.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:36.050
So a company like Spotify is
paying, you know, is saying,

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.600
well this is all the money
we have to divvy out,

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.670
so you get 0.0007 cents
for a stream.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.900
You know, where -- I
mean that's just insanity

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.550
because I know what it
costs to produce a record.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:52.490 position:56%
For me to produce one of my
records costs about 200,000 dollars.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.410 position:56%
You're never going to pay for that
stream and you're never going to pay

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.740
through that -- through
any of these things.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.930
So, years ago already
in 2003, you know,

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:07.690
just when the file sharing thing
was starting, before anybody talked

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.360
about Crowd Funding, Fan
Funding, it didn't exist.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.290
It was invented by this guy, Brian
Camelio who started ArtistShare.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.650
And he came to me one day because
he knew I was frustrated already

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:23.620
with the record model, which also
had a very historically has had

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:28.140
very, you know, eschewed ways
of calculating recruitment.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.920
It's always been like that.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.360
It's like a credit card company.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.470
You know, you just, you
can never really get ahead

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:37.070
of that credit card debt, and
that's how they treated, you know,

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.370
the price of making a record.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.550
So this guy came to
me and said, what's --

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.090
And this is what we discussed
today looking at the archive --

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.600
the archive -- Your
archive shows process

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.580
and shows the creative process.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.060
So Brian said to me
this day, he said,

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.020
I came up with an incredible idea.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.660
He said, what's the one
thing nobody can file share?

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.770
I -- I don't know.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.320
Seems they can file share anything.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.800
He said, the creative file process.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.450 position:56%
He said, I'm going to design a
website where you can say to people,

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.710
hey, preorder -- You know,
we can bring in people

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.670
on different levels fan funding.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.360
He called it fan funding.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.510
And they turned it -- People called
it crowd funding, but we just sort

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.010
of privately we're doing this.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:27.470
So Brian said, I'll call it Fan
Funding and we will get people

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:33.830
to preorder and we will through
my site, document the process.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:39.840
Show your creative process video of
how you write putting up sketches,

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.880
you know, so that people can
download them and have access

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.530
to that, so that the fan feels
like they're getting more

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:48.830
than just getting a record.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.770
They can't get that when they
just file share or something,

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.730
and it's developing
this relationship.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:59.440
On top of it, I am setting my
own price and here's the thing

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.270
that gets away from
the data lord thing --

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.050
Data lords own all the data.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.350
Nobody else does.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.650
We just give it away for
the convenience and the joy

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:12.220
of gorging ourselves in all this
music that we take in so much

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.290
that we don't even
really take it in anymore.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:18.870
In the case of this, I'm
setting my own price.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:23.690
I know what it costs and I'm
making the lion's share of gross

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:27.210
without all these -- So I'm --

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.190
I've been doing this now
and developing a fan base

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:34.070
and an archive, a massive
archive of interviews and --

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:38.600
I go back and look at me
talking about my creative process

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.890
for a commission I did, you know,
through my website years ago,

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.470
and I'm like, oh wow, yeah,
I went through that too.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.810
Yeah, that thing I'm talking
about with data lords, oh yeah.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:51.400
I was really scared for
that premiere too, you know.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.550
So -- And it's even fun for
me to see my own process.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:00.190
So it's very much -- It's my own
little mini-at home ArtistShare

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.490
Library of Congress.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:08.080
And so that has largely -- For
me, it's largely protected,

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.320 position:56%
and I wish every artist would do
that because this business out there

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:18.210
like the streaming and
everything, they are nothing.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.310
They are absolutely
nothing without the music

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:25.170
if musicians didn't give away
the rights, if they didn't sign

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.380
and if they weren't signed
on with these companies

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.240 position:56%
that have now joined the data lords.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.860
So, you know, the biggest record
companies like Universal, Warner --

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:41.010
Universal, Warner, Sony, they
all took equity in Spotify.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.120
But Spotify is not in
the music business.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.620
Spotify is in the data business.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.300
So, they use music as the
carrot to draw the eyeballs,

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.870
to gather the data to get
the advertising, you know --

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.670
I forget, I have to ask somebody.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:59.290
There's a statistic of the vast,

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:04.590
vast majority of their employees
are data analytic scientists.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.150
You know, they're not
in the music business.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:12.160
So, this is, you know -- This is
kind of what we're all up against,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.020
and if musicians said, No.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:19.490
I'm taking it back, they
would -- they would crumble.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:20.880
They would crumble.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.300
The only ones maybe that wouldn't
is YouTube that somehow, you know,

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.260
the government kind of seems so
far and hopefully they're going

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.150
to change the safe harbor provision

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.060
of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act,

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.450
maybe that's going to get changed.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:39.270
And they'll start saying, hey,
if you induce this infringement,

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:44.220 position:56%
you know, if you're basically like a
drug pusher on the street, you know,

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.260 position:56%
or just one, you know, just put up
one -- one little video, you know --

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.560
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
First one's free.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.860
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Yeah, first one's free.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.260 position:56%
You know and it is kind of that bag,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.990
they have this copyright basics
video that is just like --

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.320
It's just -- it's just
-- it's unthinkably bad.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.620
It's ridiculous.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.490
So anyway, we'll see what
happens, but, you know,

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.720
no one can count on government.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.180
We -- I have to tell you
one thing that we started.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.990
A group of us in New York started
something called Musicanswers --

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.290
Musicanswers.org.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:17.820
It's grassroots, and our
idea was that we want

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.390
to start educating musicians to
these issues, waking them up.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.050
It's like, hey folks.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:28.040
For a century now, we've all
been sleeping and now, I mean,

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.880
the alarm bells were
going off before.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.270
Now it's like out of control.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.770
Time to wake up, know
what's going on.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.110
We could have examples up of
everything that should always be

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.310
in a publishing contract,
everything that should never be

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.660
in a publishing contract,
everything that should always be

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.200
in a record contract, and we --
we're getting all these endorsers,

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.540
everybody from all over the music
business, everybody from Carol King

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:57.230 position:56%
to -- to Herbie Hancock to Steve Ray
to students, so that everybody says,

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:06.100 position:56%
hey, you know what, we -- What we
do is an -- is an asset, and what --

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.680
I -- I have to tell you just a --

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.550
tell you a little bit
about the public.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:13.390
So we had a concert the other
night, and we -- My band --

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.350
I mean these players,
they're just so extraordinary.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.650
It's a little, you know --

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.220
It's a lifetime of obsession

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.780
to become a player
like these guys play.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:28.280
Every day the investment and
the time, the self-criticism,

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.540
the study, the -- It's incredible.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.270 position:56%
What they represent is unbelievable.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.790
So we did a concert and
the audience loved it --

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.090
standing ovation afterwards.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.520
This woman -- We had a
reception, and this woman,

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.870
and I think she was
one of the people

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.350
that help give money
to the concerts.

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:47.050
So a wonderful woman comes up to
Scott Robinson, and she says --

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:52.750
She said -- she said, do you
know that was just marvelous.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:57.690
My friends and I sat there and we
had the best time trying to figure

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.850
out what all of your
professions were.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:03.960
And one of the guys was
sitting next to Scott

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.890
and he said -- He was
standing there.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.870
He said, he's a mad
scientist, and she said,

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:12.240
I thought you were a scientist,
and Scott was just like, wow.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.600
He said, lady, you
just made my journal.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.290
You know, but this is -- This
idea that people have out there

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.260
that music is just something.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.730
It just sort of comes and we
just kind of do it on the side,

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.690
and then I -- I guess the rest

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:28.090
of the time we're doing
something else, you know.

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:35.130
I guess people just don't realize
that it requires more dedication

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.880
than anything else can, you know.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.180
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
And -- and commitment.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.480
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Commitment and loss.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.780
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Think of --

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.080
think of all the musicians
I your orchestra,

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.130
many of whom have been
with you for 25 years.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.460
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.470
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: That's
a serious undertaking.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.770
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:56.010
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: You invest
time, resources and it's worth it,

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.790
because look what comes
out the other end.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.090
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:02.820
They're an evolution of something
that you could never force

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.530
and put -- You know, all this
music has evolved slowly over time,

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.300
the sound of the band, that's
kind of what I'm talking too

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.120 position:56%
with premieres and everything --
all these things they have a process

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.700
and the longer -- George Wein, I
had dinner him not that long ago,

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.540
and he was saying, Maria, he said,
you're one of the few musicians

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.490
that sticks together with a group.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.210
And he said nobody does
that anymore, and he said,

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:31.800
that's why it's got that sound
and everybody develops in jazz.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.360
What's so great is when you have
that, then you have that trust.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.670
Everybody knows each other so well.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.700
And what that means is then
you can take more risks,

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.880
because when you play, you
can throw something out there

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:48.570
and everybody knows, everybody
has each other's back and knows --

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.350
and they know my music so well that
they know kind of the outer limit.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:57.490
They compress it to see if they
can still create the overall sense

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.730 position:56%
of inevitability, and that's what
I'm always looking for in a piece --

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.820
that the whole thing has
a sense of inevitability,

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.520
but is filled with surprise
and for all of us, you know,

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.080
and the unexpected risk taking.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.850
And that's the benefit
of having musicians.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:16.150
You work with that bond.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.450
You get that.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.950
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: It's
intriguing to know the dedication

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.790
and commitment of your
musicians to the orchestra.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:27.010
But there's also a level of
dedication and commitment

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:32.950
on the part of the audience
to investing in your process.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.250
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.550
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
And they feel finally

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.890
that it's not some
corporate entity who's giving

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.670
or selling them a commercial
product.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:40.970
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yes.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.270
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: They actually
feel a part of that process.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:46.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah, yeah, it
-- So when we did our first project,

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.020
the first ArtistShare project, it
was my record concert in the garden

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.970
which to this day is record that
maybe most kind of hits my heart.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.250
There was some -- there were a
lot of things about that record

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.110
that were powerful
switchovers for me.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.640
And then add with the
ArtistShare thing, you know.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.200
And we won a Grammy, and it was
the first Grammy that was won

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.530
by somebody only selling
on the internet,

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:12.210
and we didn't even realize it to
say it at the time because it was

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:16.730
so early, we almost didn't even
really know what we had started.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.690
But it was the first
fan-funded Grammy.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.720
I'm absolutely sure of it.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:27.090
So, you know, that -- that
record after that won a Grammy,

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.530
I started getting all these emails
from people saying, you know,

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.130
it's crazy, but I feel
really proud of this.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.760
And I know I wasn't
part of the music,

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.980
but somehow I felt like I was.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.610
And that is what we wanted is
that everybody they felt like --

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:45.130 position:56%
And when I made that record even in
the graphics on one of the booklets,

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:48.170
I had the names of all the
high participants mixed

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:51.930
in with the players in the
band, as if to say, we all --

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.230
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Right.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.530
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: We are
all this music together.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:55.830
We all make this together.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.310
We cannot do this alone.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:04.170
Yeah, most those people still are
coming back and commissioning works

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:08.290
through the site, and
it's -- it's great.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.560
And as an artist, it
also feels really good

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.240
to be supportive that way.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:17.240
It's like -- It is like the old
patron thing a little bit too.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.620
It's nice.

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:22.530
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So if
it's a model that works,

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.960
why don't more people join?

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.450
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: I think for
a lot of musicians a long --

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:32.880
for a long time, there --
there was this ego attachment.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.500
There was one -- I remember David
Sanborn talking to me about it.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.930
It's an ego attachment to
that record label name,

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.130
you know, the "I'm on Warner.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:49.210
I'm" -- Maybe there was something
to that, and I think the idea

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:54.270
of doing these things, you
know, doing the documentation.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:57.650
But I think more and more
people now are realizing

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.370
as everything, you know.

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:02.030
It's like -- Have you ever
watched a spider suck the life

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.080
out of an insect in a web?

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.380
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Not lately.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.800
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Well,
I have when I was a kid.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.230
We used to every once in a while,
we had a window, and there was --

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:13.980 position:56%
I remember one night, my sister was
watching out the window this spider,

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.690
and so my mom got us all there.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:18.750
And I remember seeing that
spider just suck the life --

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.860
And that's what -- That's
the image I always get

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.280
of what this is doing to musicians.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.390
It's just sucking the
life out of them.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:30.760
I mean, the copyright report
from the office of copyrights

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.820
that they did, going around,
studying, you know, what --

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.540
how the DMCA is affecting people.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.740
And they said 80 percent of the
song writers in national have quit.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.560
So this is like, you know -- this
is just an astounding figure.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.470
So I think as more
and more people start

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:50.520
to realize what they're giving
away, they're going to realize

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:57.710
that self-ownership is really
key and owning ones' own data.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:01.530
I mean, people are
just really behind.

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.850
They're just starting to wake up.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:07.820
And I've noticed -- I mean Brian
was just way ahead of his time.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.580
That -- I think that's
the main thing.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.780
But I think people are waking up

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.130
and I think it is going
to start to happen.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.880
He just started something
called Fan Funded.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.360
It's going to be like
for the masses.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.660
It's kind of like ArtistShare
a little, you know,

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.610
but a little easier and not
requiring quite so much --

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:29.910
doesn't give quite the
benefit that I have, but I --

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.050
I am hoping that more and more
people are going to do this.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:39.920
I love the idea about the music
industry basically being the music

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.160
industry, you know, being
the people that make it

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.560
and owning our own stuff
and taking control again.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:50.460
It's this, I don't know.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:54.050
It could really -- There could
be a critical mass change

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.970
over that could really
change things for the better

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:58.600
and requiring transparency.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.960
Transparency is so key.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:06.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Have you
noticed any movement to address some

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:12.200
of these inequities
in higher education?

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.600
For example, musicians
learn their --

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.200
They become trained
in how to play music.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:23.860
They -- Most of them take some
kind of business of music course,

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:27.450
but I wonder as more and
more musicians graduate

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:31.910
from these schools from
conservatories, how aware are they

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:36.280
in some of these issues
and how well do they know

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.700
that there's a choice for them?

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.320
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Not aware enough.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.770
I mean that is one of the things
that I brought to the table

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:47.370
with Musicanswers is I said,
"This has to be as much

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.740
about the young student musician --

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.040
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.340
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: -- as it
is about the professional,

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:56.010 position:56%
because they're the ones that really
have been kind of brainwashed,

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.300 position:56%
that this is just really cool to put
up all your favorite music on a --

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.830
on a channel and you're somehow --

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.080
YouTube channel and you're somehow
helping everybody and yourself.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.210
And they don't realize
that they've been taught

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:10.540 position:56%
to cannibalize themselves for --
and they're cannibalizing themselves

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.500
for somebody else's gain and
they don't even realize it.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.310
And those things are not taught.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.400
They're still teaching.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.000
Some people are.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.530
Some schools are, but mainly,
you know, they're teaching kind

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.540 position:56%
of the old business and a little bit

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.440
about the social media
and all that stuff.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:34.410
And my goal is to wake
everybody up and start --

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:38.040
I've been starting to write to
deans and say, will you send this

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.080
to every -- We want every
faculty member and every student

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.670
at your school to endorse
this and start watching and --

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.770
We're into educating them
about what's really going on,

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:53.780
the things that people do not
know and are not awake to.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:26:01.410
So, yeah, that's tops on my -- on
my agenda for what I want to do.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:04.140
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I loved
hearing this image you cite

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.750
about the spider sucking the life.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.900
It's not so much the sucking part.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.560
It's that that's an image from
your childhood that has stayed

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.720
with you all these years.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.680
And so for people who know
about your music and they listen

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.500
to your recordings, but
they may not know that much

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.480
about you personally
and your background.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.350
You grew up in Windom, Minnesota?

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.840
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Uh-huh, southwest Minnesota.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.050
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And
is that prairie land?

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:31.350
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
It's prairie land.

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:32.650
It's farm land.

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:37.560
There's some native prairie
there left, very little patches,

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.750
beautiful wide open
landscape, you know, flat,

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.100
far as the eye can see, beautiful.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.580
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And does
that impact or in what way does

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.570
that impact your aesthetic
or your artistic identity?

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:51.870
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: You
know, it's so amazing.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.240
It's like when you --
As you're coming up

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.730
and you're doing things you don't
realize what's impacting you,

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.740
and then you look back
and you start to see?

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.810
And what -- First of all, when I
was a kid, I loved Aaron Copland,

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:07.110
and I think there was --

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.820
not the modern Aaron Copland
because I didn't know it.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.120
You know, I knew more

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.560
of the Appalachian spring
and the, you know --

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.860
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Right.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: -- but there was
something about the openness of that

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.470
that I related to, the
landscape of things.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:24.580
And I've always been -- Even
earlier today, I was telling you

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:28.720
about my piano teacher, this
extraordinary teacher, Mrs. Butler,

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.080
who had been a stride
pianist in Chicago.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.460
She was married to
one of the pianists

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.680
from the Glenn Miller
band, her second husband.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.100
She was also a great
classical pianist,

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.910
and she was a great
organist, red hair with a face

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.400
like Dizzy Gillespie kind
of, you know, very flamboyant

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.260
with rhinestone-studded
glasses, red hair and wore like,

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.710
you know, moo-moo's and, you know.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:54.050
She was just an amazing,
amazing woman.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:58.550
And my first lesson she taught
me, started teaching me theory.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:03.930
And she taught me to understand
why the music I played felt the way

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.230
it felt.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.750
So the one-four-five
chord would be, here we --

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:14.020
here we go up the hill back again
home, to show the four going up,

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.580
the five bringing you
back home is tonic.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:20.710
She had -- Before that, it was
bright the day with a major triad,

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:23.170
dark the night with a minor triad.

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:33.080
So, I've always equated maybe
the visual to music, and I've --

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.790
Much of my music has
been about something.

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:39.980
And I don't set out to
write about something.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.850
It's that I start writing,
and before I know it,

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:48.860
I'm on top of the silo of the
Thompson Farm in Windom, Minnesota,

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.120
and I'm seeing those
beans, and I'm like,

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.280
Oh my god, that feels like that.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:59.980
Maybe it's a way to bring back
memory and freeze it into --

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:03.480
into a new form that
I can relive it.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.280
It might be that.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:12.360
It might be -- Because I
love it like if my band plays

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.750
and whatever it was that
was going into that music.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.350
Like I say, the idea -- Usually
when the idea first comes,

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.950
it's just a musical idea.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.080
Then it attaches a
lot of times itself

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.490 position:56%
to a memory or an idea or something.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:27.670
And what I love is in the
end when the band plays that

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:32.750
and I'm standing there conducting
it, and all that imagery is coming

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:35.360
to me, to the point sometimes
where it makes me cry.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.240 position:56%
You know, I'm like, wow, I am there.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.920
It's just so -- such a powerful
attraction to that moment,

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:47.620
and I don't know why
that's how it clicks

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.450
for me in my head but it does.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:54.030
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I assumed that
you would need to have a detachment

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:59.010
in order to pay all attention to
detail and performance, and yet,

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:01.040
I'm hearing that you
get caught up in it.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.340
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Oh yeah.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.640
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Just as [inaudible].

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.940
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Very much, very much.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.350
I mean I am definitely,
you know, detail, you know,

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.950 position:56%
cut of this breath, you know, that's
a little out of tune, you know,

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:13.940
look at somebody here, you know,
want a little more trumpets.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.240 position:56%
Can you play that a little smoother?

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.850
There's always that going on.

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:19.600
But there are moments
that when it's happening,

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.400
you're just -- you
just get lost in it.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.530
You just say, oh, you
know, yeah, definitely.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.010
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Did
you study conducting

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:29.740
or is this something
that happens naturally?

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.040
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: I
studied a little bit.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.560
I took some lessons in
Minnesota undergrad,

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:38.860
some classes with the
conducting teacher at Eastman.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.140
He -- The poor man,
Donald Hunsberger.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.680
He was charged with teaching
all the jazz musicians how

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.980
to conduct, you know.

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.280
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Poor man.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.580
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Poor man.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.880
But I -- It was funny,
recently, I had to conduct --

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.180
Well a few years back, I had

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.380
to conduct the same Paul Chamber
Orchestra, and I called him up.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:59.460 position:56%
I said, Don, can I -- You know, it's
years, decades later, Don can I come

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.420
up and have a little
conducting lesson?

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.730
Can we talk about this piece?

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:06.060 position:56%
And he was just very sweet about it.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:11.260
But, you know, conducting my band
is something that just evolved.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:16.760
And what is, you know, my band's
playing and I would just --

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.680
You don't need to conduct
a big band in the --

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.380
I mean you need some
of that technique,

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.660
because there are always
moments where you need, you know,

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.560
the little break, the lift,
the rubato, this and that.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.160
So you need conducting
technique, but it's not the same

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.350
as in an orchestra where the
conductor's kind of the --

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.340 position:56%
You've got a rhythm section usually.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.160
There's something keeping time.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:43.090
For me with -- with my band, it's
more about giving them the picture,

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.780 position:56%
because the trumpets are back there.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.810
They're not really
hearing the reads.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:48.210
Everybody's kind of separate.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:51.880
I see myself as a focal
point to keep them focused

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.600
on where the music is so they
don't just get in their part,

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.210
try and go into auto-play,

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:03.880
because they're not maybe
hearing the pictures so well,

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:08.220
because it's that --
I'm that picture

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.600
and I'm letting them know,
is this feeling right?

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.150
You know, they can see it in
my body and if something is --

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:16.090
And I kind of look at
them and I go like that,

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.390
you know, then they get it.

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:22.670 position:56%
So for me, it's more about sculpting
this thing so that it is emotional,

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:27.630
that it's not just technically,
yes, I want it technically right,

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.800
because that also helps
bring out the emotion.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:35.790
But bringing out the right
crescendo, flavor, you know,

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:39.150
just the little things that -- that
are going to make me feel like I'm

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:43.030
on that silo as opposed to, you
know, that it's a good piece --

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:46.240
good sounding piece
of music, you know.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:50.160
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: There's -- I --
I've no doubt that you've seen it.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.110 position:56%
In fact, many of the viewers of
this will have seen it, but in 1959,

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:58.040
CBS Broadcast, something
called, The Sound of Miles

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.900
or The Sound of Miles Davis.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:04.480
So it's Miles with his quintet,
and then there's an orchestra led

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.790
by Gil Evans, and they did
some of their collaborations.

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:10.970
And I love watching Gil conduct.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.270
It's like a --

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:13.570
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Yeah, it's kind of

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:14.870
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: -- big bird.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:16.170
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah, yeah, the
kind of long hands and the arms --

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:17.470
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:18.770
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: -- and it's
-- Yeah, they're something.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:20.070
It's some about Gil, yeah.

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:21.370
It's just his movement.

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:23.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: We should talk
a little bit about Gil because along

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:28.220
with Bob Brookmeyer, Gil Evans
is the musician, arranger,

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.590
composer of who -- who
you're often associated with.

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:34.260
I love the story about how
you first came to meet Gil.

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.560
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:36.860
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Will you tell it?

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah, so I was
a music copyist in New York eight --

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: By the way, what
does that mean, a music copyist?

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:43.430
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Okay, so -- so before --

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:48.540
before computers back when we were
young with something called and pad

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:52.510
and ink, and -- Yeah, so this
-- the composer makes the score

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:55.660
and somebody has to make
all those individual parts

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:59.060
for all the players, and that
calligraphy is a real art.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:02.600
And thank god I had a wonderful
teacher, great composer,

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.830
Dominique Argento, back at
the University of Minnesota.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.740
And whenever -- And he
taught me orchestration,

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:12.770
great orchestration
teacher, wow, brilliant.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:17.630 position:56%
And all our orchestration exercises,
he made us do in calligraphy pen,

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:21.820 position:56%
and he said, because that's just
the skill I want you to learn to do.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:26.330 position:56%
Well, it was so fantastic because by
the time I left Eastman and I wanted

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:29.200
to move to New York, I had a skill.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.630
And so there's these
music copying offices.

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:32.930
There were.

00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:34.560
We looked at one of
the things today.

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.860
It was a --

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.160
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Charlap?

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.560
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah, Bill --
not Bill Charlap -- Emile Charlap.

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:43.200
It was a -- it was a -- was
a Brookmeyer score and --

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.500
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.800
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: -- and on the
bottom of the page, I said, oh,

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.710
I want to see who copied this,
and it was Emile Charlap.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:50.540
So his office was right around
the corner, all in mid-town.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:54.390
In that -- in that office
at one time, you know,

00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:56.720
all the arrangers sat
there, the copyists.

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.450
It was a music production.

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:00.020
You know, they had somebody,

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.880
Ray Charles making a
record or something.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.770
They were sitting there all
writing these arrangements.

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:05.510
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Like a
factory or an assembly line.

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:07.410
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Well that
whole area was like that.

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:08.710
The Brill --

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.010
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:11.310
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Have you read
that book, The Brill Building --

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:12.610
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.910
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: --
the book about, yeah,

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:15.210
music in the air or whatever.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:16.510 position:56%
It's just -- There was a time there.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:17.810
Wow. It must have been amazing.

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:19.110
So --

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:20.410
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So you came
at the tail-end of that time?

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:21.710
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Well yeah,

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:24.000
I would say a little past the
tail-end, but there were still,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.470
yeah -- 1985, there were
still music copying offices,

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:30.390
and so I got a job in one.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:32.550
And I also ran these big --

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:36.750
You know, they had these huge
Xerox machines for the big scores.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.580
I miss all that stuff, you know.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.990
And you'd -- The machine, you
could put the parts through,

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:45.090
like if you were doing a long
like three page part, you could --

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:47.810
and the -- You know, then
you'd just have to fold it.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:50.090
You didn't have to print
all the individual pages.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:51.390
It was amazing.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.350
So one day this composer,
Tom Pierson came in,

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:57.630
wanted me to print
a score for him --

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:00.490 position:56%
was kind of a dance classical thing.

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:06.060
And he -- and I got talking
and I was really starved

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.090
for conversation about music.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:09.390
I'd left Eastman, you know.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.820
Every night at dinner, we're
talking and now I live in New York,

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:19.540
and all that community of minds
always churning out over music,

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.100
you know, I just wasn't with that.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:28.630 position:56%
So, I think he and I got together
for lunch after that I was on my way

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:32.920
out to mail something or -- Anyway,
we got talking, and he asked me

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:37.770
who my favorite writers were,
and I started talking about Gil.

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:39.070
And he just listened.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.320
And then we went to a
Penderecki concert I remember.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.940
But that night, he was
talking about Penderecki.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:47.120
He didn't even mention
much about Gil.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.380
And then he called me and he
said, I didn't tell you today,

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.580
but Gil happens to be
like my closest friend.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:54.850
And I called him, and
I told him about you,

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:58.400
and he needs somebody
to do some work for him.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:02.880
And what's crazy about
it is I was so into Gil.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:07.350
And Gil was the one that
really -- Gil and Brookmeyer --

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.760
Well, so many of them made me
want to be a jazz composer,

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:16.510 position:56%
but it really -- Largely, the reason
Gil and Bob were so powerful for me

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:20.570
that way was that Gil had
-- It's big band music.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:24.540
It's jazz, you know, but it had
all that transparency, the nuance,

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.200
the stuff starting with
the Claude Thornhill.

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.520
We looked at the Arab --

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.820
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Arab --

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:32.000
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: -- Dance
score from the Claude Thornhill.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.100
That music, you know, back then,
you know, it's like big bands were

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:39.970
like this thing, and then it's
got this airy sound and mixing it

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:42.580
with classical and I love that.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:46.530
And then Bob Brookmeyer had
the thing of forms, you know,

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.170
forms that you find
in classical music.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:53.440 position:56%
So bringing together -- So it wasn't
just this definable jazz thing,

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.740
you know.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:58.110
So I was -- Way back then,
this is before I even went

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:59.930
to Eastman or moved to New York.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:04.330 position:56%
One night I was sitting on the couch
and I was listening to Svengali,

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:07.800
and I was looking at the picture
of Gil on the Priestess album.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.780
And I had this whole vision --

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.400
like literally, it just kind
of came to me working for Gil.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:18.880 position:56%
So when that whole thing happened to
me, I was like, this is just freaky.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.130
It was -- And the first time I saw,

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:23.910
I met him with some
rehearsal studio.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.670
He said, come to the
rehearsal studio.

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.970
I'll meet you.

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:28.270
I'll give -- They were rehearsing

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:29.750
and he wanted me to
copy some things.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.340
He came with like a
little sketch this big --

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:37.160
this little King brand music with
the whole score on each line,

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:42.650
you know, all the little notes,
you know that made up the entire,

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:45.670
so I'd have to -- I was like,
wow, okay, this is some kind of --

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:48.180
This is a different kind
of copy job, you know.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.430
But when I first met him,
he came walking towards me.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:54.650
I was so excited and freaked out
that it's like my whole field

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:57.470
of vision went just
haywire, and he was like,

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.250
flying around the room almost.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.090
I had to literally like put
my hand out and shut my eyes

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:04.990
because I couldn't --
I couldn't take it in.

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:11.090
He was almost like a -- like a,
you know, like a shamanistic sort

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:14.840
of experience of, you
know, somebody --

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.140
And if ever there was somebody

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:20.310
who was probably a musical
shaman, that would be Gil.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:24.440
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Of his
music, what has the sort

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.810
of dearest place in your heart?

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:28.750
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Oh wow.

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:35.770
It's been different, different
pieces -- hard to say.

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:37.780
The Barbara song.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.080
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
From the Individualism?

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.380
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
The Individualism

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:46.170 position:56%
of Gil Evans is [makes musical tune]
-- You know that sound of the flute

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:51.920
and -- And the way he -- I couldn't
believe it, it was only years later

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.440
that I heard the original
Barbara song

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.040
and how fast it moves
and [makes song tune].

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.660
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Kurt Vile.

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.040
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah, Kurt
Vile, you know, it's like --

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.320
And the words are something
very strange.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:08.910
And Gil just recomposed it
into this long, haunting thing.

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:14.260
So, I think that one for me
maybe has the most magic.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:17.140
But then there's so much stuff.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.860
Oh boy, I don't know.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.300
God, there's so many.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:24.030
One of the great Gil Evans
arrangement Ryan Truesdell did

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:25.330
on his new album.

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:26.630
It was, "How About You."

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:31.010
Just a -- And that one he
heard about from Brookmeyer.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:33.800
He knew to look for it and start
digging to find this thing,

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.740
because Bob Brookmeyer said
years ago I played a rehearsal

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.040
for the Thornhill Band.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.370
Gil came in with this
arrangement of, "How About You,"

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:42.570
and it was just crazy great.

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:44.030
And it was never recorded.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:46.030
And he ended up digging that out.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.970
That thing is amazing.

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:49.290
Oh my Gosh.

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:51.910
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I love
Gil's arrangements for singers.

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:53.210
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Oh yeah.

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.690
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And I know
you've used Luciana Souza among

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.240
others with your orchestra.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.680
How do you feel about
writing for voices?

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.980
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: I love it.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.280
I love it.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.180
Yeah, if it takes forever.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.330
With Astrud Gilberto, that thing --

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:12.520
that arrangement he
did is so beautiful.

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.580
You know, I wrote for Dawn Upshaw.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Oh that's right.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.180
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
See, I wrote for --

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:21.670
Luciana started because I
wanted that human element.

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:25.240
I -- And a piece that was on
Concert in the Garden, The Bulerias

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:29.550
and she -- she sang, she is so
beautiful at making her voice

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:31.120
like an instrument, mixing in --

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.420
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.720
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: -- but then
you've got that human thing.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.860
So I started using that in my music
with Luciana just on recording.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:42.730
We didn't do it much live because
having a singer with a big band

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:44.390
in that kind of context live

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:47.210
from an engineering
standpoint is just a nightmare.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:49.520
She doesn't hear herself
enough or, you know,

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.860
or if somebody mixes it too loud.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:55.110
So, it's not something
I do live very much.

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:59.330
But years later, then
Dawn Upshaw comes to me

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:01.030
and wants me to commission her.

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:06.270
And that started from the same Paul
Chamber Orchestra I did I think

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:08.330
called, The Carlos
Drummond de Andrade Stories.

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:11.210
And then she asked for
another one and I did a suite

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:13.460
of nine Ted Kooser songs.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.160
Ted Kooser was just
my favorite poet.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.070
I just love him.

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:20.370
He lives in Lincoln,
Nebraska -- poet laureate --

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:23.720
He was poet laureate and
a Pulitzer Prize winner.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:28.000
And I did nine of his poems from
his book, Winter Morning Walks,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.380 position:56%
a hundred postcards to Jim Harrison.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:36.510
And what I found was so wonderful,

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:38.270
especially in doing
the Kooser stuff,

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:42.170
because that poetry,
I related to so much.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.340
It's very Midwestern.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:48.420
It's very plain spoken
but profoundly beautiful.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.580
And what I discovered is, you know,

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:55.390
I've been writing instrumental
music for so many years.

00:42:55.390 --> 00:43:00.320
And you're pulling every idea,
and if there is that story.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.160
Everything's coming out of you.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.320
Suddenly, when I was
working with this poetry,

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.220
the poetry was giving
me the imagery.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:16.550
The poetry was giving me the rhythm
of the, you know, of the words

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:20.970
and even hinting at where
that melody would want to go.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:25.080
So, it was almost like somebody
taking my hand and say, okay,

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.960
this is the basic outline.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.210
This is the sketch, you know.

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:30.510
It -- I don't know.

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:34.820
It just -- It needed -- I don't
want to say the word is easy,

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:41.900
but it just -- it made it less
effortful, you know, or something.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.130
There was just something
about it that it just came --

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:46.710
It felt like somebody just
giving you a little --

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:49.800
a little boost into
a direction and --

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.660
and I love that music and music
is very close to my heart.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:57.410
One of the pieces I -- when
I was coming here last night,

00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:00.800
one of them came up on my
iPOD, and it was, "Spring."

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.780
The sky rippled with
geese with this --

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:08.610
but the green comes on slowly tying
to the ticking of down spouts.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:10.420
The pond still numb from months

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:14.110
of ice reflects just one
enthusiast this morning,

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:19.390
a budding maple whose every twig
is strong with beads of carves

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:23.170
and a cinnabar, bittersweet red."

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:26.970 position:56%
And I had done that song, and it was
playing and I just thought this time

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:28.430
of year is so perfect for that.

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:31.920
And I was just like, I love that.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.110
And it's easy to love it
because it's not only my music,

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:38.550
it's music I would've never
written if it wasn't for Ted.

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:41.850
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Did
you discuss it with Ted?

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:45.710
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: I got
permission of course and --

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:47.010
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: By the
way, how does that work?

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:48.500
Do you have agent who
does it for you?

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.800
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: No.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.100
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Or do you
literally pick up the phone?

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.400
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: No, I --

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.700
I found him through the
internet, and wrote him.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.000
I was just terrified.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.750
You never know what kind of
person, you know -- you know.

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:58.050
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:59.350
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
You know I'm sure.

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:02.330
Artists, writers, whatever,
they can be anything from open

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:05.180
to the prickliest things
on the planet, you know.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:06.480
It can be everything, right.

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.970
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: But
usually if you're sincere,

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:09.490
they will at least hear you out.

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:10.790
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:12.090
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:13.390
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Well, he was very open.

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:14.690
I think he had --

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:15.990
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Did
he know who you were?

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:17.290
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: No.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:20.550
And I think he had no real
expectation, you know, of anything.

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:25.370
And then -- and I didn't
-- He doesn't --

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:27.850
he isn't much into traveling.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:29.500
He does it here and
there but not a lot.

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.760
So I invited him to come
to the premier and Ojai,

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.910
and he didn't much want to go.

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:39.810
And then I didn't have him here
until I finished the record,

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:44.260
and I sent it to him, and
I was so scared, because --

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.720
First of all, these
poems -- this book --

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.020
I don't know if you
know about this book,

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.840
but he -- he wrote those poems.

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:53.810
He was recovering cancer treatment,
and he couldn't be in the light.

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:56.780
So he started going on
these early morning walks,

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.930
and he was very depressed,
and he wasn't writing.

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:01.330
And then one morning,
he went on a walk.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:04.040
He tells the story at the
beginning of the book.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:08.680
He came back from a walk and he
wrote down a poem and he put it

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:12.180
on a postcard, and sent it
to Jim Harrison, his friend.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.110
And then the next day, and it kind

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:17.220
of I think probably became
a little bit of his lifeline

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.960
and brought him back, you
know, writing these poems.

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:25.880
So one of them, that's my
favorite maybe that I used was,

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:30.020
"Walking by flashlight at six in
the morning, my circle of light

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:33.070 position:56%
on the gravel swinging side to side.

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:36.370
Coyote, raccoon, field
mouse, sparrow,

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:40.770
each watching from darkness, this
man with the moon on a leash."

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:44.700
So, you know, it's just
such beautiful imagery.

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:50.110
And so, I was so scared for him
to hear the music because I knew

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:54.620
that these poems were so for him.

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:58.190
You know, they had to be so
close to his heart, you know.

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:01.800
I'm sure all of his poetry
is, but I was just terrified.

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:05.700
And I got up one morning
early, you know,

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.620
and I glanced at --
Because I just sent it.

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:12.460
I FedEx'ed it to him,
and there was an email

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:15.600
from him, and he just loved it.

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:19.250
It was this long email
and it was just so --

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:21.460
And I remember I was so beautiful.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.890
I mean I was so -- so moved
that he thought it was beautiful

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:27.910
that I started to cry and I --

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:29.850
I went back to bed and
said to Mark, "He likes me.

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:33.810
He likes -- " You know, I was
just -- I'm going to cry now,

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:38.760
because I was so relieved, because
I loved that poetry so much.

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:42.030
So, you know.

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:51.090 position:56%
It's scary to put somebody's words
to music, and it's a responsibility.

00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.390
And --

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:55.740
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Has
anyone used your music

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:58.490 position:56%
or repurposed it for something else?

00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:00.520
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: A few
people have rearranged it

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.820
and made it into things.

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:07.150
One of the most beautiful -- You're
not even going to believe this,

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:13.970 position:56%
because I -- One day my -- the guy
who handles my publishing, you know,

00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:19.310
administration, he said there was
a Drummond Bugle Corp that wants

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:20.720
to do a version of Sky Blue.

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.020
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Oh.

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.820
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Sky
Blue is this ballad of mine.

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:27.090
I thought Drummond
Bugle -- I'm going to --

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:29.070
I was like, okay, whatever,
you know.

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:31.330
It was kind of like Ted, you know,

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:34.870
probably the low expectation,
you know.

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:42.680
And they sent me a
video of this thing.

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:47.270
It is one of the most moving,
beautiful arrangements.

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:49.060
It's so beautiful.

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:53.520
It's beyond, and they had videos
of the kids singing all the parts,

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.820
you know, in preparation.

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:56.120
They were all singing.

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.860
Then they showed them just
standing there and playing.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:48:59.270
And then they showed
them on the field

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:03.370 position:56%
and they all had these spandex light
blue -- You might be able to find --

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:08.310 position:56%
I don't know if they have a website
where they show that, but t-shirt --

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:10.600
blue spandex shirts with
clouds and -- It was --

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.000
it was a group called
the Blue Coats,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.800
and their -- It was beautiful.

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.660
And so -- and some people
have made small group versions

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:20.880
of Torben Waldorff,
of Choro Dancado.

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:27.600 position:56%
I mean my music is so kind of frozen
into a shape that is, you know.

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:30.620
It's not like a tune, you
know, that you easily just kind

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:32.370
of turn into something else.

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:35.200
So when somebody does it,
it's kind of a notable thing,

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.050
so it doesn't happen a lot.

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:39.850
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Now do
people who may, you know,

00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:44.280
let's say an ensemble somewhere
who might want to perform some

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.610
of your works, do they
have access to the music?

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:47.910
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yes.

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:49.210
I sell --

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.510
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Through your publishing?

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:51.810
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: I --

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:53.240
I self-publish my music
all through Artistshare.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:57.100
So it's -- so everybody --
And so what we do is, yeah,

00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:01.370
people can buy the scores in
parts, and then we include a video

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:03.130
of me talking about
how I conduct it.

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:06.370
I include videos of
guys in my band talking

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:12.810
about how they approach playing the
solos or maybe the comping or it --

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:15.430
depending -- Each one
has different videos.

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:20.370
And we also do a thing
on my last recordings.

00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:23.060
Well you know a lot
about engineering,

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:28.650
so everything's recorded
multitrack and with --

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:32.000
The soloists are always in a
soundproof booth or usually.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.750
They have been on my last records.

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:39.720
And so we make a version
with the soloist mixed out.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:43.030
And then I put with that --

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:45.080
So then I can include that so

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:49.510
that the student solos can
practice along with my band.

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:52.510
So all those kinds of things are.

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:56.270
Yeah, I figured out a
way to share and publish

00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:59.210
and do everything I can
through that website.

00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:02.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Can I assume
that when you write, you often write

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.020
with specific people in mind --

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.320
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Absolutely.

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.620
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
-- in your orchestra?

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:08.920
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.220
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Can
you give me an example

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.520
of how you might write
for a specific soloist?

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:17.870
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: I don't
think I can give you an example

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:19.170
and I'll tell you why.

00:51:19.170 --> 00:51:20.830
So people always say
this about Ellington --

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:22.130
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:23.430
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: It's
probably the most talked

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:24.730
about aspect of Ellington.

00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:27.220
He wrote for his players
and what I --

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:34.270
what I would say about
that is that you --

00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:42.730
If you work with people night
after night and year after year,

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:44.990
you can't help but do that.

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:47.980
You have a way of relating
and taking them

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:50.180
in with what you put out.

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:52.910
It's very much like conversation.

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:54.560
You're talking to me one way.

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.500
If your mother was sitting here,
you'd talk to her a different way.

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.210
If a -- your closest
friend was sitting here,

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:03.570
you'd maybe have a highly
inappropriate conversation

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:05.040
about something, you know.

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.340
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
We could do that.

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.110
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Who
-- who knows what --

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:09.410
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:10.710
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
-- what it would be?

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:13.120
And so it's the same
thing, you know.

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:16.680
It's just your gut
makes you do something.

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:20.380
So, I don't know if I
can put it into words.

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:27.490
And maybe sometimes now though I
think I really write for my soloist

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:32.880
and tuned into what they do, I also
know that sometimes maybe I kind

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:37.580
of typecast them, because I have an
idea in my head about who they are

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:41.150
and sometimes for fun, you know,
we'll be on a tour and I'll switch

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:43.050
around solos to shake things up.

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:46.680 position:56%
And it's like, okay, let's give this
to this person tonight or whatever.

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:48.680
And an instrument and a person

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:51.800
that I never imagined playing
a certain solo will do it,

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.720
and all of a sudden, it
turns it into something

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.650
that I just never imagined
that I love.

00:52:57.650 --> 00:53:04.480
And so -- so, yeah, to say
an example of how I do it;

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:08.760
well Scott Robinson
-- Let's pick Scott.

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:14.560
Scott can do so many things with
his instrument, and he is somebody

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:17.550
who is coming from a deep respect

00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:20.750
of everything very
traditional all the way

00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:24.200
to Sun Ra and beyond, you know.

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.700
So -- so he's got this wide scope.

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:35.930 position:56%
So with Scott, you know that you can
do things that don't just require,

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:39.790
you know, fitting in, you know,
really beautiful melodic way

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:43.460
to a harmonic thing, but that
can go kind of creatively beyond

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.770
into sort of a sonic spectrum.

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:48.980
I mean there's that, but
then also kind of knowing too

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:52.230
where his heart can go
as a musician too --

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:56.380
what he can get into and
what he might not get into.

00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:58.880
So I try to hit that.

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:01.620 position:56%
For me, the hardest part with all --

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:05.940
with the guys and this stuff is
when we're rehearsing and trying

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:11.760
to describe to them in rehearsal
what I want, so that we can get it

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:14.550
to a certain point so
that then they get it,

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:17.270
and then now they can take
it to their own point.

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:22.150 position:56%
But that first initial thing of,
no, no, no, can you try it this way?

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:23.450
Can you do that?

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:27.420
You know, it -- it can be very
antithetical to creativity

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:32.590
and you have to just kind of muscle
it into some sort of understanding

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:36.660 position:56%
and then -- then the thing freeze
up and then they take it some place.

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:37.960
I don't know.

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.780
I wasn't expecting.

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:41.840
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: There
are some very creative people

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.140
in your orchestra.

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.440
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Oh yeah.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.740
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Because you mentioned Scott.

00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:50.700 position:56%
He not only has this wide palate of
what he's likely to do as a creator,

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.450
but he also has all
these instruments --

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:54.750
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:56.050
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
-- they can create on.

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:57.350
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yes.

00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:58.650
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And I
wondered if you ever write

00:54:58.650 --> 00:54:59.950
for a contrabass saxophone?

00:54:59.950 --> 00:55:01.250
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yes.

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:02.550
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: You do?

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:03.850
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah, yeah.

00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:05.150
Sometimes -- Well, you
know what, if I do that --

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:06.450
Well contrabass clarinet
is in the Bulerias.

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:10.270
I generally don't do
it as a -- as --

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:13.780
I do it as this could possibly
be played on this also,

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:17.640
because getting a contrabass
saxophone on an airplane,

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:21.500
you know -- There are -- there are
practicalities that you have to --

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:25.000
So, we'll experiment
with those things

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.640
and contrabass trombone,
George Flynn.

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.860
But I love when Scott brings
out these wild instruments,

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:33.660
you know, and plays things.

00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:36.920 position:56%
I just -- I love it and the audience
loves it, and it's just so --

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.530
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: It's
visually interesting also --

00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:39.830
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah, yeah.

00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:41.130
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: --
to watch your orchestra.

00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:46.330
I suppose I should ask you
about your brush with one

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:52.000
of the most famous,
let's say rock icons,

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.420
and that's David Bowie
at the end of his life.

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.720
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:57.380
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Why don't
you talk a little bit about what

00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:01.840
that experience meant to
you and how it played out?

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:03.140
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Well, I'll tell you.

00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:06.940
The biggest way, it's -- I
mean it's how it's played.

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:09.650
This piece that I wrote
for you, for the Library

00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:11.400
of Congress would not
have been written

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.130
if it weren't for David Bowie.

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:14.430
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Really?

00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:15.730
How so?

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:17.540
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: There
is no question about that.

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:20.630
Well, so he came to me
about working on this song

00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:22.740
that he was -- had started.

00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:27.360
He gave -- he came with
a, like a little recording

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:28.660
of something he had put together.

00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:31.520
It was the beginnings of
something, but it wasn't developed

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.090
into this long thing and --

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:34.390
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
And he knew about you

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:35.690
or did you know each other already?

00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:36.990
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
No, I'd never met him,

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:38.760
but he had come to hear the band.

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.060
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Got it.

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.360
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: And somebody
had once written to me about,

00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:42.910
you know, would you sign some CDs?

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:44.500
I want to give them to
David for this birthday.

00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:48.090 position:56%
So I knew David liked my music, that
he came to hear the band one night,

00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:51.270
and he was gone before the
-- I had a chance to say, hi.

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:55.450
And then out of the blue, I'd
heard he was looking for --

00:56:55.450 --> 00:57:00.810 position:56%
for me, and he called me about
collaborating on this song together.

00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:06.320
And I was very, very nervous
about it, because I just --

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.090
It's like David Bowie,
and I just thought,

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:12.630
what if I don't meet his
expectation or you know?

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:15.970 position:56%
So I kept saying to him, okay, you
just have to promise me if you don't

00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:17.270
like it, you can just say so.

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:18.570
That's okay, you know.

00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:20.390
I was just constantly doing that.

00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:23.920
And then once we were --
decided we were going to go ahead

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.880
and I listened to the thing and
he was sitting there, you know,

00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:30.250
and I heard it, and I
went over to the piano,

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:31.550
and I started playing around.

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:34.150
And I said, so you
want this to be dark?

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.060
Because I said this doesn't
sound super dark to me.

00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:37.940
He said, I want it dark.

00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:41.480
And so I was playing
around, and I said, okay.

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:42.780
I said, I'll do it.

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:45.690
I said, let's -- I think I hear
-- I said, I don't want to say,

00:57:45.690 --> 00:57:49.450
yes unless I feel like I can
really bring something to it.

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:51.420
Of course, who doesn't want
to work with David Bowie?

00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:55.470 position:56%
But I didn't want to work with David
Bowie unless I felt like I was going

00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:56.890
to do something he was
going to be happy with.

00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:01.270
So -- so then I worked on
some ideas or, you know,

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:02.720
we talked about a little bit.

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:04.150
He left and then he came back.

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:06.560
And then I brought some
ideas to the table.

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.620
Then we started working together
on it, and we met a few times,

00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:11.460
and we put together
a little session.

00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:13.780
But somewhere in there, you
know, I was like, David,

00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:15.250
this is going to be
really expensive.

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:17.700
What we're doing is
kind of a crazy thing.

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:19.290
And what if it's not good?

00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:20.590
What if you don't like it?

00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:22.560
And he said, Maria,
the plane goes down.

00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.560
He said, everybody walks away.

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.860
So -- so --

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:27.160
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.670
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: You know and
I'm a person who I go in a crisis.

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:31.790
When people call me
to do a commission,

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:33.120
many composers are happy.

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:36.890
I'm like, oh, no, not a commission,
because I know I'm going to --

00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:38.630
That means I'm going
to torture myself.

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:41.510
I'm going to have several
months of self-loathing.

00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:42.810
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Is that true?

00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:44.110
Are you really like this?

00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:45.410
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Absolutely.

00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:46.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: But that doesn't
come from insecurity, does it?

00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:48.120
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Of course.

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.420
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Really?

00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:50.720
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Deep-seated --

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I would not have
imagined you as an insecure person.

00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:53.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Are you serious?

00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:57.560
Oh, yeah. When it comes to the
writing and everything, oh yeah.

00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:58.860
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
And it's every time?

00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:01.060
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Oh, I have
-- I have -- Every time I hear --

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.360
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Wow.

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.660
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: -- new
music, I go in a crisis

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:07.160
and many times have been in tears
at rehearsals including yesterday.

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:08.870
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Who'd of thought?

00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:10.660
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah,
it can happen to me.

00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:12.540
Yeah, I just get frustrated.

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:15.270
It's hard for me to
figure it all out.

00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:17.270
Every time, it is so --

00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:18.830
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: But
Bowie gave you some cues

00:59:18.830 --> 00:59:21.210 position:56%
that said that, yes, she hears it --

00:59:21.210 --> 00:59:22.590
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: It's okay.

00:59:22.590 --> 00:59:23.890
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:27.100
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: So when
I was writing this piece,

00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:29.120
and David liked my intense stuff.

00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:31.670
So he wanted this piece
to be kind of a Sue.

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:34.210
It ended up being called Sue
or In the Season of Crime.

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:38.610 position:56%
He wanted this drum and bass fast,
kind of drums going under this thing

00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:41.700
and this whole thing was just
kind of this intense thing.

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:45.620
And then I created this sort
of rubato stuff over the top.

00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:49.690
Well, somehow that whole
concept has just been in my head,

00:59:49.690 --> 00:59:52.170
and he liked my intense music.

00:59:52.170 --> 00:59:55.100
And as I started working
on this idea,

00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:59.700 position:56%
all of a sudden I just realized this
is a continuation of David -- David.

00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.730
And David would really
love this piece.

01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:04.030
I know he would love this piece.

01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:05.660
It might not be quite fully formed.

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:09.100
I may have to do some editing
yet, but I think he would --

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.220
he would love what I'm doing.

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:14.510
My assistant Marie, she was at the
rehearsal when I was playing it.

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:15.990
She said, "David would love this."

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:17.550
And I said, "Yeah,
I think he would,"

01:00:17.550 --> 01:00:19.520
which makes me happy, you know.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:24.760
And I -- So these gestures
that I do in the ensemble

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:27.440
where the band just
goes -- the band --

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.990
the rhythm section's
cooking along and there's --

01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:32.020
the soloist is going or whatever

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.500
and the band just starts
going [makes musical noise].

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.110
That's the kind of thing.

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:40.780
I would've just -- I don't know if
I would've ever risked doing it.

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:44.170
And I -- When I threw it in front
of my band, it was just like,

01:00:44.170 --> 01:00:45.470
I'm just going to do this.

01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:46.770
The plane goes down, whatever.

01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:48.070
We do all walk away.

01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:49.370
You know, that's art.

01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:53.670
We take the risk and we try
it and we see what happens.

01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:58.960
And so, I did this piece with --
Even though I will tell you, yes,

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:04.630
it's been stressful, I did it
with more joy and more like,

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:07.210
throw it to the wind,
see what happens,

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:10.010
than I would've because of him.

01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:14.740 position:56%
And I kept having his face in my
head of him just smiling and that --

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:18.570
I still remember him looking, you
know, just smiling and just --

01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:21.600
And at the -- and when we were
recording, seeing his face

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.810
through the glass and just smiling,

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:26.300
just enjoying doing this
thing with the band.

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:30.160
You just -- You know, he
loved Kenton, loved Kenton.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.460
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Oh, I didn't know.

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:32.760
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.460
And he loved jazz and
he loved big band music,

01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:37.620
and then his last album
ended up being with Donny.

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.920
So --

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.220
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Donny McCaslin.

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:41.520
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.820
He had wanted to do one
more piece with me --

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:44.120
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:48.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: -- and we talked
even about doing much more, but --

01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:50.420
and I think we would've
done much more.

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:52.310
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Did you know
at the time that he was dying?

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:54.650
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: No, no.

01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:57.230
But -- but I didn't have
time to do another piece,

01:01:57.230 --> 01:02:00.260
because I was doing the Thompson
Fields, my newest record, so --

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:04.130 position:56%
And I -- and I didn't even have time
for Sue, but I did it, you know,

01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:08.060
but that summer was just so
cramped and busy and stressful.

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:11.520
And so I just said I just
only have the time for one,

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.890
but the other piece ended
up becoming Lazarus.

01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:17.050
And I'm so glad that they did it.

01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:18.350
And I had said to him.

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:21.800 position:56%
I -- When he was describing to me
the whole drum and bass and the jazz

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.560
and everything, I said, you have
to listen to Donny McCaslin.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.150
I -- So I said, let me get --

01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:28.050
I pulled out, you know,
the recordings I have.

01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:29.350
I said, listen to this.

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:30.650
And he just loved it.

01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:32.750
I said, you should
work with these guys.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.050
This would be amazing.

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:36.730
This would be an unbelievable
combination.

01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:41.570
And we went to hear Donny and Tony
Visconte was there, his producer,

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:47.610 position:56%
and they ended up with Donny's group
doing that last album which for me,

01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:49.680
is one of the greatest
albums David made.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.980
It's so beautiful.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:52.820
It is so evocative.

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:56.270
I love it so much, but then I'm
just wrecked after I listen to it.

01:02:56.270 --> 01:03:01.270
So I -- Then I can't listen to it
that last -- the last song on that.

01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:02.570
Oh my god.

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:04.140
It's so beautiful.

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:10.170
So I love what David and
I created together on Sue.

01:03:10.170 --> 01:03:11.470
I love it.

01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:12.830
I love the way he sings on it.

01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:14.720
I'm so happy with it.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.380
But even if all that had been was
just to get him connected to Donny

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:23.850
to make that last record,
I would've been like, wow,

01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:25.290
that might be musically one

01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:30.030
of the greatest things I ever
did is just being that, you know,

01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:34.120
little arrow point for him, so.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.780
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I'm
glad you both did it.

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:37.270
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah, it's --

01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:44.740
Who would think that you'd
affect David Bowie's musical --

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:46.120
last musical project?

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.610 position:56%
Do you know I would've -- I would've
thought I'd be the last person

01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:51.250
on earth that would that, you know.

01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:56.900
But it just goes to show
you how open musicians are,

01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:01.140
how open we are amongst
ourselves and what a world --

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:03.750
a beautiful world of collaboration.

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:11.100
I mean it's -- It is the greatest
world to be a part of and it's

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:14.090
such a privilege, and
there's so much talent.

01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:18.230
And there's so much hard
work and creativity.

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:21.460
And I think it's -- Going
back to that other subject,

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:22.760
the nasty subject before,

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:27.230 position:56%
I think that's why I make this whole
advocacy thing such a huge part

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:33.340 position:56%
of my life, because it burns my butt
when people not only take advantage

01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:36.990
of the financial aspects of,
you know, of people's lives --

01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:43.290
It's basically like reaching into
somebody's 401K and saying, hey,

01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:47.550
I'm going to give out, you know,
number -- little 15 dollar --

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.770
You know, here, everybody,
take a little, you know

01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:51.620
and just pick away at it.

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:54.170
It's not just that.

01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:57.820
It's eroding the whole
culture of it.

01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:01.790
And it's going to affect
the quality of the music,

01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:04.400
because if the music can
only then be made just

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.940
by these massive record companies
that are pushing these, you know,

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:13.600
teen wonders or whatever
it is just to make money

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:18.440 position:56%
and get billion streams or whatever,
and so many other musicians are just

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.690
like I can't swim amidst
this, you know.

01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:24.740
How can I have a family if I
get a check for three cents

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:27.310
or 30 dollars even in this day?

01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:30.980
You know I have millions of streams
and got, you know, 17 dollars.

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:32.280
I mean it's like come one.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.820
This isn't -- this is -- this
is going to destroy things,

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:39.760
and it makes me angry
because it's an ecosystem.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:43.730
It's an amazing ecosystem,
the music industry.

01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:45.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: It's fascinating
to hear you talk about it

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:50.400
because within you, there's a
kind of balance between the things

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:54.200
that might arouse your
passion and the things --

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.960
the gifts that you've
been given in life.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.440
And the greatest thing
is to find that balance.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.740
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.040
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.340
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Not easy.

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.640
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:06.940
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Not easy.

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:08.240
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: As a --

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.540
I think we have time maybe
for one last question.

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:10.840
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Okay.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:13.480
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: As a composer,
as an arranger, band leader,

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:16.310
all the other hyphens, all
the other hats you wear,

01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:19.040
how do you measure success?

01:06:23.850 --> 01:06:26.490
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: How
do I measure success?

01:06:26.490 --> 01:06:30.060
I don't know.

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:36.080
Success to me, enjoying
loving what you do and feeling

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.780
like it's growing and it's moving.

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:44.200
Because success kind
of implies arrival.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:48.370
And artists, I think you never
feel like you arrive, you know.

01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:49.750
Somebody said to me, what --

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:52.130
Well does it feel good to
get like where you are?

01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:55.670
And I said, No, actually not,
because it's an infinite ways to go

01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:57.340
and you're always a
beginner on the next.

01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:00.160
You know, there's always the
next wrung on the ladder.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.420
And maybe you get to a certain
point of confidence and, you know,

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:07.960
not proving yourself
that makes some plateaus,

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.940
but then there's always
that next challenge.

01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:14.830
So, success, you know, I think
if you ever even have the feeling

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:19.330
of success, you sort
of are done, you know.

01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:24.120
So, maybe success is never
actually feeling success.

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:27.660
I don't know -- I don't know.

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.030
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: A
snake eating its tail --

01:07:29.030 --> 01:07:30.330
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:31.630
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
-- Maria Schneider.

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:32.930
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Thank you.

01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:34.230
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Thank you very much.

01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:35.530
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Thank you.

01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:36.830
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
