00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.710
We said that the goal of computer architecture

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.790
is to design a computer that is better suited

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.210
for its intended use. In the rest of

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.170
this course, we will learn about techniques that can

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.070
be used to improve the computer's performance, energy

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.130
efficiency, and cost. However, before we get into these

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.650
techniques, we need to learn how to measure

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.220
and compare performance and other characteristics of computer designs.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.230
In other words, we need to come up with

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.049
some numbers that express our intuitive notion of better
