that this actually had a profound effect

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550
that this actually had a profound effect
 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.420
that this actually had a profound effect
on the very way that they think when the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430
on the very way that they think when the
 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.550
on the very way that they think when the
pre-modern villagers were given skins of

pre-modern villagers were given skins of
 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.740
pre-modern villagers were given skins of
wool or silk of different colors and

wool or silk of different colors and
 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.330
wool or silk of different colors and
hues and asked to organize them into

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340
hues and asked to organize them into
 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.640
hues and asked to organize them into
groups they basically said it can't be

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650
groups they basically said it can't be
 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.960
groups they basically said it can't be

done none of them are similar
whereas when some of the villagers who

whereas when some of the villagers who
 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.830
whereas when some of the villagers who
had been touched by modernity were given

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840
had been touched by modernity were given
 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.380
had been touched by modernity were given
this same task they pretty easily

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390
this same task they pretty easily
 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.449
this same task they pretty easily
grouped them into colors even if they

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459
grouped them into colors even if they
 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.890
grouped them into colors even if they
didn't really have names for those

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900
didn't really have names for those
 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.930
didn't really have names for those
colors they started to recognize the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940
colors they started to recognize the
 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.240
colors they started to recognize the
abstraction of a color for use in

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250
abstraction of a color for use in
 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.740

grouping and the same thing was true

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750
grouping and the same thing was true
 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.390
grouping and the same thing was true
with shapes so for example a 26 year old

remote villager named Ali Ewa was asked

remote villager named Ali Ewa was asked
to group certain shapes together but to

to group certain shapes together but to

her a square with a with a solid line
 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.010
her a square with a with a solid line
was obviously a map and the same square

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020
was obviously a map and the same square
 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.530
was obviously a map and the same square
with a dotted line was obviously a watch

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540
with a dotted line was obviously a watch
 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.210

she could only see them as these

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220
she could only see them as these
 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.250
she could only see them as these
concrete objects whereas the villagers

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260
concrete objects whereas the villagers
 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.900

who had started to interact with the
 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.400
who had started to interact with the
modern world were used to abstract

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410
modern world were used to abstract
 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.650
modern world were used to abstract
classifications and even if they didn't

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660
classifications and even if they didn't
 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.630
classifications and even if they didn't
know the names of the shapes they

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640
know the names of the shapes they
 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.610
know the names of the shapes they
recognized that the concept was the same

and they could group them together and

so that's just sort of one example but

so that's just sort of one example but
 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.970
so that's just sort of one example but
in all of these tests what

of modernity that villagers had had the
 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.300
of modernity that villagers had had the

Ebbinghaus illusion and if you're

Ebbinghaus illusion and if you're
watching this then you're clearly

watching this then you're clearly
 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.250
watching this then you're clearly
engaged in modern work and in the modern

the circle on the right probably looks
larger the big one surrounded by smaller

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.510
and scientists who studied this think
that this has to do with how we

differently perceive these circles in

differently perceive these circles in
 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.770
differently perceive these circles in
relation to one another so for the

individual circle they're not as drawn
 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.380
individual circle they're not as drawn
to the holistic context and so they can

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390
to the holistic context and so they can
 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.240
to the holistic context and so they can
accurately see the size of the central

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250
accurately see the size of the central
 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.250
