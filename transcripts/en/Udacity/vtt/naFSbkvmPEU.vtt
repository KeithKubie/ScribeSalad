00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.010
Okay. Did you find anything interesting? There are

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.680
a couple of possible things that I've noticed. The

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.850
first is that not all codons have an amino

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.940
acid. You'll notice over here, UAA, UAG, and UGA

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.330
all code for something called a stop codon.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.920
They don't even have an amino acid associated with

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.300
them. You might also have noticed redundancy. Leucine is

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.010
coded by C U U, C U C, C

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.160
U A and C U G. All four of those code for leucine. this is

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.670
considered redundancy. And then we look up here: U U A, U U G. That also codes

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.510
for leucine. But not every amino acid has

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.890
that redundancy. For example, only one codon codes

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.410
for tryptophan symbolized by Trp and W here.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.890
A third possible thing I noticed was that,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.500
it seems when there is redundancy, and you

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.320
get several condons for one amino acid, it's

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.340
always the third position that seems to be

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.330
unimportant. GU anything will give me Valine. GC anything

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.540
will give me Alanine. AC anything will give

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.920
me Threanine. CC anything will give me Proline.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.730
So it seems as if, biologically speaking, this

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.530
third position may not be so important in distinguishing

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.300
different amino acids the same way that the first

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.520
or the second letter in the codon would be.
