[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.544 --> 00:00:02.960
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Hey, everyone.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.740
Natalie Villalobos
here at Google I/O--

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.540
extremely proud to introduce
Jackie O-- the Jackie O--

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.980
Jackie Omotalade.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.914
She is an environmental
justice tech maven here at I/O.

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:16.830
And we get to hear a
little bit about her work

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.689
and the innovations
that she's driving

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:19.730
in environmental justice.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.470
Welcome, Jackie.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.440
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE: Thank you.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.150
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So tell me, how

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.860
did you get involved
in the tech industry?

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.530
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE:
Well, I think

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.090
that's kind of funny because
I'm kind of dating myself--

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.680
but I got involved in
tech when my uncle gave me

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.160
my first Commodore 64.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.180
So that really does date me.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.710
And I've been in love with
computers and technology

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.180
and all those things ever since.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.500
So that's probably
30 plus years now.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.224
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: What was
the first project that really

00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:43.640
struck your passion,
that knew you

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.870
wanted to get into technology?

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.300
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE: I think
one of the first projects

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.400
was after I graduated
actually college.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.930
And I was working on a
fellowship for Bill Clinton.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.800
And I was working in Africa
on improving public health

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.910
outcomes there.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.840
And there were so many
opportunities to use technology

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.980
in a way that was
for social good

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.770
and that would really, really
have this substantial impact

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.580
on how people experienced
their lives and their outcomes

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.340
in health and
environmental issues.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.350
And that's when I really,
really became interested

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.790
in this cross section
between health

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.090
and environmental
justice and technology

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.220
and how all these
amazing innovations

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.130
that people are
doing and creating

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.131
could drive social good.

00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:28.171
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.900
So it's not just
that one industry is

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.540
siloed from another industry.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.304
You're actually crossbreeding
this hybridization,

00:01:35.304 --> 00:01:36.970
this place where
technology meets health

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.420
and environmental justice.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.760
So tell me, how did you land
on environmental justice?

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.394
Why this particular topic?

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:44.810
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE: I think
because right now, especially

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.770
in this time as we
deal with climate

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.260
change and global warming and we
see, particularly in California

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.250
with the drought, environmental
justice is the issue right now

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.970
and it affects all of us
no matter where we are.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.790
And collectively, we really
can tackle and collect

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.950
the brain power of
all of us to address

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.110
some of these questions.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.693
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
And so you settled

00:02:05.693 --> 00:02:07.260
on Southeast San
Francisco as a place

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.190
to really dig into your work.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.180
Tell me why that particular
community and what

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.934
you found in creating
this project.

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:15.350
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE:
Well, I think

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.180
it's so amazing that I'm
here in San Francisco, which

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.070
is the tech capital of
the world, hands down,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.690
and I work for a fabulous
organization called the San

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.260
Francisco Parks Alliance.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.260
It deals with parks and open
space and access to open space.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.010
And you think of San Francisco
as being this global mecca

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.440
of wealth, technology,
prosperity, all those things,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.490
but yet the communities in
the southeast of San Francisco

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.360
haven't been able
to access or tap

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.220
into any of those benefits
for multiple reasons.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.680
And if you look at some of
the history of San Francisco

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.970
around some of the
environmental degradation

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.130
that happened there with nuclear
sites, with the whole landfill

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.940
and how that, seismically,
is very dangerous when

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.070
you build housing on top
of things that aren't land.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.990
So I wanted to make sure that
communities in the Southeast

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.780
are connected to the wealth
of information and knowledge

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.980
and prosperity and
environmental justice

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.232
because the sea is rising
and lots of those people

00:03:12.232 --> 00:03:13.190
live on the waterfront.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.231
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:17.010
So in this work, are
you making this area

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.560
more accessible, safer?

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.917
Tell me specifically how
you're addressing this problem

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:21.750
with this community.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.040
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE:
So it's multifaceted.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.070
I am a director of a project
called the Blue Greenway, which

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.810
is an initiative that has been
led by the San Francisco Parks

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.310
Alliance.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.684
And what we are
doing is there is

00:03:31.684 --> 00:03:35.175
13 miles of waterfront
shoreline in the southeast

00:03:35.175 --> 00:03:39.520
part of San Francisco that
probably in the last 60 years

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.190
has not been accessible to
communities in the Southeast.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.710
So you have people that
live a half a mile,

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.770
a quarter of a mile
away from the waterfront

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.140
and have not been able
to access it, touch

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.260
it, for multiple reasons.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.450
One, some of it was
active nuclear sites.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.305
Two, it was closed off
for industrial reasons

00:03:56.305 --> 00:03:57.550
and other reasons.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.650
So part of the project that I'm
leading with the Park Alliance

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.027
is around making those
areas open and accessible

00:04:04.027 --> 00:04:05.360
to communities in the Southeast.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.120
So it involves the cleanup.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.790
It involves protecting the
native Bay Area species.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.630
It involves conserving
and creating

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.740
new wetlands, which help protect
us against climate change

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.360
and sea level rising.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.350
It involves using technology to
connect the community to what

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.260
actually is happening
on the waterfront,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.730
because lots of
people don't know.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.040
And I'm only one
person, and I do do

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.300
a lot of community engagement.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.290
But at the same time,
pretty much everyone

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.870
in this day and time has a
cellphone and has a smartphone.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.100
And part of what we're doing
is creating this platform

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.250
using mobile technology that
people can look on their cell

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.310
phone and they can
go up and down all 13

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.770
miles of that waterfront and
discover what has happened,

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.484
what will happen, and what they
can do to participate in it.

00:04:50.484 --> 00:04:52.650
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So
you're bringing the community

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.460
into the work.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.450
It's not like
solving the problem,

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.930
coming in, and fixing it.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.397
You're engaging the community
to solve for themselves

00:04:59.397 --> 00:05:00.105
in a lot of ways.

00:05:00.105 --> 00:05:00.540
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE: Yes.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.910
Exactly.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.576
It's all about
empowering the community,

00:05:02.576 --> 00:05:04.452
because obviously I
can't do this by myself,

00:05:04.452 --> 00:05:06.410
nor could the Parks
Alliance do it by themself.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.850
And the community
has to value it

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.026
and has to see it as
a win-win for them.

00:05:11.026 --> 00:05:13.150
And the way you do that is
you engage the community

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.640
and you use the fabulous
thing called technology.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.300
Who can't sit and
twiddle on their phone

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.550
and comment on something
or drive an initiative

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.930
or suggest something?

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.680
I mean, I think that's
the beautiful thing

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.800
about technology is that
you have groupthink.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.120
And you can have millions
of people together trying

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.360
to solve a certain problem.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.401
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:38.390
I'm very passionate about
having underrepresented groups

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.240
or communities not feel just
like they consume technology,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.090
but they can create.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.770
They can make the technology.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.970
And I think a lot
of times people

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.451
just aren't in that
mindset, right?

00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:50.450
They're just kind of
feeling like it's something

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.908
that they receive
and not something

00:05:51.908 --> 00:05:53.470
they actively participate in.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.069
And so we have an incredible
audience of millions

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:57.360
of developers around the world.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.879
How can developers or designers
or really anyone help you?

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.170
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE: Oh my god.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.740
There's so many ways
they can help me.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.823
First of all, they can
definitely reach out to me.

00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:08.010
Follow me on Twitter,
@JackieOmotalade.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.120
And I would say, comment,
give us feedback,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.670
let us know suggestions.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.500
Even in the two days that I've
been here-- or day and a half--

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.510
I've found out so many wonderful
things in apps and applications

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.840
that people are developing
that could be Incorporated

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.120
into this whole environmental
justice, social justice

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.902
movement that we're creating
and growing in the southeast

00:06:27.902 --> 00:06:29.110
communities of San Francisco.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.610
So I would love for developers
to come and donate their time

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.907
and energy to thinking big.

00:06:34.907 --> 00:06:36.740
And every meeting I go
to and every time I'm

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.960
talking to people
in the Southeast--

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.430
like the actual
residents there-- I say,

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.180
we can think big.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.220
We can make this
as big as we want

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.870
to make because the power
is within us to do that.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:45.130
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.240
And just for those
tuning in, when

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.615
we're saying the
Southeast, we're

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:49.270
meaning Southeast San Francisco.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.690
We just want to make sure
that the developers all

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.660
go to the right place.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.360
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE: Yes.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.770
Yes.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.019
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So you've
had this extreme passion

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:58.990
for solving for communities and
really social justice issues

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.940
for a very long time.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.490
With technology going in the
way of the Internet of Things

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.670
or wearables and these
new ways of technology

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.790
engaging consumers,
what do you want

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.020
to see solved in
your lifetime given

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.890
the incredible
possibilities of technology?

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.390
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE:
I think as much

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.130
that can be solved as possible.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.470
I would say I wouldn't even
limit it or close the door.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.636
Whatever we can solve
in my lifetime--

00:07:21.636 --> 00:07:23.260
and who knows what
my lifetime will be,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.205
given what technology
is doing right now.

00:07:25.205 --> 00:07:26.830
Maybe my body will
be in something else

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.720
in some other shape
or form or time.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.660
But I think that one
of the big things

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.610
is making sure that underserved
communities have access

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.850
to technology, both from
a user experience but also

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.580
a participatory, actually,
creation-wise as well.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.480
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
And so with your work,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.590
are you collaborating
with other communities

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.790
around the world that might
have incurred similar issues,

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.830
or do you feel like this
particular project is

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.820
unique in what it's experienced?

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.820
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE: No.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.105
The funny thing is it's not
necessarily very unique.

00:07:57.105 --> 00:07:59.800
It's unique in the situation
that at this time right now

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.140
in San Francisco, when you
think about San Francisco,

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.130
you don't think about
nuclear waste sites,

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.799
or you don't think
about hydrocarbon damage

00:08:07.799 --> 00:08:10.090
and pollution done, or you
don't think of San Francisco

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.964
as having some of the
highest-- the southeast

00:08:11.964 --> 00:08:13.680
part of San
Francisco-- as having

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.719
some of the highest asthma rates
in the state of California.

00:08:17.719 --> 00:08:19.260
And some of those
asthma rates mirror

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.426
some of the other countries
in the developing world.

00:08:21.426 --> 00:08:23.970
So in some ways, our
experiences are very similar.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.950
And part of the work
I am doing is also

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.170
reaching out and
studying some of the best

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.490
practices from other
countries and what they've

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.270
done as they tackle
environmental justice

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.739
issues using technology
and other resources.

00:08:36.739 --> 00:08:39.030
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So in
the lifespan of your project,

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.071
are you at the beginning,
the middle, or the end?

00:08:41.071 --> 00:08:44.030
And can you share a story of
maybe interacting and engaging

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:48.610
with the community that shines a
light on how your work is truly

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.072
improving the community in
Southeast San Francisco?

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.530
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE:
So we're still

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.620
very much in the
beginning stages.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.040
I mean, a lot of it is still
very much like ideation

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.220
because when you're
participatory

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.060
and when you do true
community engagement

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.180
it involves speaking out to
lots and lots of stakeholders,

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.900
which I really enjoy doing.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.920
I love hearing people's stories.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.806
I love when people tell me they
never thought in their lifetime

00:09:11.806 --> 00:09:13.430
that they would
actually be able to put

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.250
their toes in the
water of San Francisco

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.791
right near their houses, which
is pretty powerful when you

00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:19.290
think that some of
these individuals

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.587
are third and fourth generations
in those neighborhoods

00:09:22.587 --> 00:09:24.920
and they actually never thought
that they could walk out

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.350
of their house, walk
across the street,

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.960
and actually touch the water.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.290
So those are some of the most
powerful messages that I get.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.314
And then also some
people thought

00:09:34.314 --> 00:09:35.730
that-- because a
lot of the things

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:39.660
are former nuclear sites, it
was all classified information.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.320
And so now the
fact that I've been

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.890
able to open that door of, OK,
this is what is happening there

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.020
and this is the timeline
for various cleanups,

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.650
et cetera and what all these
different terminologies

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.590
mean in environmental cleanup.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.680
That is just so powerful.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.930
I think information is
probably the best gift that you

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.050
can give people--
information connected

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.130
to how they can actually
act and change the world.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.630
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.495
I'm actually an 11th
generation Californian.

00:10:06.495 --> 00:10:08.370
My family's been here
for a really long time.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.110
And I live over on the East Bay.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.690
And I feel now privileged
and completely unaware

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.630
that this was a problem
in my neighborhood.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.520
And so do you have a website?

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.240
We're all going to
follow you on Twitter,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.790
but is there a
central place that we

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.175
can read about this
work online and dig

00:10:25.175 --> 00:10:26.300
into some of this research?

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.800
I know it's incredibly
powerful-- organizations

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.430
like Code for America
opening up access to-- that's

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.130
more city information.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.060
But how do we open
up more of this

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.060
and research it and assist you?

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.930
So do you have another site?

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.680
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE:
So there actually is.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.460
So if you go to
sfparksalliance.org

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.670
and you search that
site Blue Greenway,

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:48.860
there's all the information.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.300
And we're actually
in the process

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.240
of building a brand
new website that

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.380
will have a reservoir
of information

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.300
and pulling from data from
multiple different sources

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.760
so that anyone around
the world can find out

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.840
exactly what's going on and how
they can help and participate.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.090
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: And
hopefully what you set up here

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.180
is a model for what can be
then moved to other places

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.030
around the world where
they're experiencing

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.980
similar environmental
justice issues.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.410
So we're at I/O. What has been
your favorite thing so far?

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.910
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE:
Oh my goodness.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.870
I'm fascinated by Project Tango.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.850
I probably spent-- I
don't know-- maybe an hour

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.540
up there picking their
brains of everything

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.120
possible with that
piece of technology,

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.220
because in some ways, as I said,
particularly with communities

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.280
in the southeastern San
Francisco, some of them

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.090
have not been able to
experience past state,

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.452
as in before all the
environmental degradation

00:11:40.452 --> 00:11:42.910
because it all has happened
within their lifetime, but also

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:43.830
future states.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.300
A lot of people can't even
envision what is possible.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.774
And that technology
actually makes

00:11:47.774 --> 00:11:49.190
it happen, where
they can actually

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.280
see what a cleanup site would
look like, see what it's

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.730
like to experience their
waterfront in a different way,

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.267
but also go through
history and see

00:11:57.267 --> 00:11:58.850
all the horrible
things that happened,

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.391
because there's lessons to be
learned from history so that we

00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:02.330
don't repeat it.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.160
So I think that is
just-- and visually see.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.450
And I think visuals actually
speak to people in ways

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.589
that reading about
it just don't do.

00:12:09.589 --> 00:12:11.130
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:14.142 --> 00:12:15.975
So I work on women and
technology at Google.

00:12:15.975 --> 00:12:17.610
And prior to this
work, I was also

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.720
working with Native Americans
to help them map their lands.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.090
A common issue with another
underserved community with them

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:28.760
is that sometimes they can't
find or really map correctly

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.150
the boundaries of their land.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.880
And so when people are
encroaching on their land,

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.050
they need some GPS markers.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.530
They need these tools
to be able to really

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.060
be in an empowered place
to defend themselves.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.505
So after your
project is completed,

00:12:43.505 --> 00:12:44.880
are you going to
continue working

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.338
on environmental
justice, or do you

00:12:46.338 --> 00:12:48.610
think you'd want to move
over back into health care

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.514
or maybe take this
to another country?

00:12:50.514 --> 00:12:51.930
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE:
I don't know.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.855
But I definitely see
environmental justice

00:12:53.855 --> 00:12:56.680
connected to health because
environmental issues affect

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.800
health outcomes.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.370
So I see that intersection.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.397
And I also see that given
the history, particularly

00:13:02.397 --> 00:13:03.980
with the communities
in the Southeast,

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.590
I'm going to be working on that
project for a really long time

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:07.045
unfortunately.

00:13:07.045 --> 00:13:08.580
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Is this
like a 10-year problem?

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:08.990
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE:
This is probably

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:10.280
more like a 40-year problem.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.500
So we still definitely
have a lot of work to do.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.570
There's still a lot
of cleanup happening.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.950
But the truth is that at least
within the next three years,

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.250
people will actually be able to
see changes that are happening

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.400
along their waterfront.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.650
And they'll also be able to
access from the technology

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:30.670
perspective, but also from
a physical perspective,

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.530
their waterfront and be
updated about what is going on,

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:36.250
but also participate in the
decisions that are being made

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.310
and drive their own future
of the space they inhabit.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.310
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Well,
I've been sitting here

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.590
with Jackie Omotalade.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.940
She is the Jackie O
here at Google I/O.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.020
She's also an environmental
justice tech maven.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.770
Thank you so much for
committing your life

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.670
and being an advocate for
the people of Southeast San

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.220
Francisco and for improving all
of our lives with technology.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:56.710
Thank you so much.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.560
JACQUELYN OMOTALADE:
Thank you very much.
