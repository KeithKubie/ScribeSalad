00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.680
The thought that we should, if we're honest with ourselves,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.120
probably try to change our career

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.080
is one of the most anxiety inducing of all realizations.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.820
We're going to have to face for possibly a very long time

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.200
a big drop in salary,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.160
we might have to move back home,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.000
it will be hard to sound impressive at parties about what we're doing,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.000
and we'll be beginning again close to zero.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.120
Tellingly, the agony about this can be most potent when we're young.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.000
Imagine someone who's 20;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.900
they've been planning a career in chemical engineering

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.900
and they're well on the way to gaining the right qualifications.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.900
They selected particular subjects at school,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.900
took the right courses at university,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.900
and did some relevant work experience.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.000
They've already made what feels like an enormous investment.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.600
But now, they start to think very seriously of switching course,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.800
perhaps towards marine biology or anthropology.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.300
It might mean another two unforeseen years of studying.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.400
At 20, two years feels like a very long time indeed:

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.200
10% of the whole of one's life so far.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.800
And, psychologically, it's even bigger than that.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.700
At 20, you've maybe only felt you were you since you were about 16;

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.400
before that, you were in a kind of daze of

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.000
childhood and adolescence, and didn't have any real idea

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.500
of what you're life might be about.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.900
So two years feels like half of your existence.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.900
It's a vast commitment.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.600
What's so hard to grasp, and yet essential, is how things will look in the future.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.600
Age, say, 56.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.000
From there, two years will have a very different meaning.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.600
It'll only be one 20th or 5% of the forty years

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.400
between being 16 and being at the climax of middle age.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.600
Over time, the length of further study grows relatively small

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.100
against the backdrop of a whole working life

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.800
while the consequences of not having undertaken it grow ever larger.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.000
We call his paradox the "job investment trap,"

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.200
and it explains why many people, especially young people,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.600
mistakenly turn away from retraining.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.800
The present looms too large

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.400
and the long long future, which will in fact

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.700
constitute by far the greater part of our lives

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
doesn't carry the weight it really should.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600
To counter this tendency, we should draw up

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.400
timelines to force ourselves to see that the period

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.600
from 16 to 24 is truly quite short in comparison

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.400
with what lies between 24 and 65.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.800
We need to weight up investments now, not against our most recent experiences,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.700
but in the light of a more accurate picture of an entire life.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We need to believe in something that is so hard to really trust in:

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.800
the reality of our own future decades of life.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.200
And then, we need to dare to switch track.
