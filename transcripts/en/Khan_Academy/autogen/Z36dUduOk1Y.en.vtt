00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.880
 We will now talk about the adaptive immune system that has to do with B. lymphocytes. 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:15.340
 Lymphocytes B or, briefly, B cells - I will draw them in blue. 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.200
 Let's say this is one lymphocyte B. 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.720
 It belongs to the group of white blood cells, called lymphocytes. 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.360
 It is a backbone background 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.360
 even though the name B comes from Bursa Fabricius, 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.605
 but we will not stop at these details this time. 

00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:30.760
 All of these cells are characterized by the appearance of protein on the surface. 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.280
 Specifically, about 10,000 proteins. 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.890
 I feel excited by the B cells and will soon discover why, 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.390
 contains all these proteins and looks something like that. 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.120
 I draw some of them. 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.740
 Indeed these are the protein complexes that you can see. 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.380
 Actually, they are 4 distinct groups of proteins 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.215
 and these proteins will call membrane antibodies (membrane-bound). 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.460
 In the following I will speak and explain more about antibodies. 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.920
 Surely you have heard about antibodies 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.860
 You have antibodies to different gut, or for different viruses 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.800
 which I will clarify in the future, 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.060
 but antibodies are really the only protein. 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.330
 They are often referred to as immunoglobulins. 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.360
 In fact, the two terms are equivalent. 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.000
 Antibodies or immunoglobulins - are simply proteins. 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.640
 Now, these proteins are found on the surface or membrane of B cells. 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.290
 So they are connected to the membrane. 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.050
 Usually when people talk about antibodies 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.140
 they refer to free moving antibodies, for example. here. 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.410
 I will clarify in more detail that they are produced. 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.009
 What's more and more important and interesting for membrane antibodies 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.220
 and B cells in particular is that 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.465
 B cells contain a type of membrane antibody. 

00:02:28.465 --> 00:02:29.730
 Of course it also contains antibodies, but those antibodies are different. 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.920
 So we will focus on this change. 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.360
 First I will draw the same color and 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.805
 will explain exactly what they are different. 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.840
 These two are cell B. 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.190
 Both contain antibodies. 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.130
 Interesting thing is that from a cell B to another cell B, 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.200
 differ in this antibody 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.780
 which can take many varied forms. 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.960
 So it may look like that. 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.720
 So these extensions - will be further deepened. 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.600
 Fixed parts, imagine green is for each antibody, 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.500
 and there is a variable variable part. 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.710
 Perhaps the variable part of this cell is --- 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.900
 will be dyed in pink color. 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.520
 Each membrane bound antibody 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.220
 will have the same variable parts. 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.100
 Next cell B will have it 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.310
 variable variable parts. 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.640
 I will emphasize it with another color. 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.270
 I will color it in a sealed purple color. 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.690
 So variable parts are different. 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.410
 Now it has 10,000 of that, and each of them 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.170
 has the same variables (changes), 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.600
 but they are all different from this B cell. 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.110
 In fact there are about 10 billion combinations of 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.360
 these variables. 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.779
 So the first question - I still have no idea what to do 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.640
 serve these variables - is how they are likely to appear 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.149
 so many combinations? 

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.990
 As these proteins seem - maybe not so obvious, 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.420
 all these proteins that are part of the majority of the cells 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.200
 are produced by the genes of that cell. 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.200
 If I draw it - this is the nucleus. 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.050
 DNA is found inside the nucleus. 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.240
 This cell has a nucleus. 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.360
 There is also DNA in the nucleus. 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.410
 If both cells are cell B and they come from 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.000
 the same German line, I think they come from the same line of basic cells, 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.180
 should they have the same DNA? 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.300
 If they have the same DNA then why these proteins 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.530
 are so different? 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.800
 How do they change? 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.090
 For this I consider cells B, you will see that this is worth 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.720
 even for T-fascinating cells, in their development, 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.940
 during hematopoiesis 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.610
 - has to do with the development of lymphocytes. 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.960
 At a stage of development, 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.990
 there is a mixture of DNA 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.200
 coded here, for these proteins. 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.990
 So there is a great mix. 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.080
 In most of the cases when we talk about DNA, we really do 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.510
 we want to keep the information, not to have a mix. 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.110
 But when these lymphocytes, when these B cells are mature, 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.270
 or during a phase of their maturity or development, 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.120
 there is an intentional mixture 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.490
 of DNA that encodes this part and this part. 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.160
 And that is what causes all this diversity 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.980
 of these variables (changes) 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.770
 membrane immunoglobulins. 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.620
 We will now understand why all this diversity. 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.890
 So there are so many things that can infect our body. 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.220
 Viruses mutate and evolve, as well as bacteria. 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.490
 I never know what can enter your body. 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.480
 So what the immune system has done through cells B, 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.200
 this also applies to cells T, it is 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.940
 which has made a pile of combinations of these things 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.470
 which can relate to what they will find. 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.010
 Let's suppose a new virus 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.900
 newly introduced? 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.190
 The world has never heard of this virus, but cell B 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.940
 will encounter this virus and this virus will not be linked. 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.750
 Another cell B will meet the same virus 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.740
 and again nothing will be connected. 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.370
 Supposing that a few thousand B cells will belong to the same virus 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.620
 and will not tie it, but since I have so much cell B 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.620
 and having so many combinations of these variables 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.570
 in these receptors, eventually one of the B cells 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.650
 you will know him and tie him up. 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.900
 It is assumed that this is what B cell is. 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.620
 It will be related to the superficial part of the virus. 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.440
 It can also be part of the bacterium, 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.630
 or superficial part of any foreign protein. 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.080
 And that surface-related bacterium - probably linked to that part of the bacterium-- 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.050
 this is called 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.300
 epitope. 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.200
 So if this cell is related to a foreign pathogen, 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.730
 remember, other B cells do not - just that cell 

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.790
 with the given combination, 

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.760
 tenth of a tenth. 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.000
 There really are not tithing dozens of combinations. 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.310
 During their development, they examine everything 

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:48.760
 possible combinations of things that essence know, 

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.070
 to which there will be no reaction of the immune system. 

00:07:52.070 --> 00:08:00.350
 In other words, combinations of self-reanimation 

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.550
 and crinkling. 

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.950
 So there really are not tithing tens or ten billion combinations 

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.690
 so something less than that. 

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.940
 It is also necessary to remove all combinations which 

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.770
 connect their cells, but still a great number 

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.000
 of the combinations they can link to 

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.460
 at least part of the pathogens of any 

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.200
 virus or bacteria. 

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.680
 As soon as one of these B cells binds, say, 

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.650
 friend, I'm fortunate enough to fit this 

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.110
 the new pathogen. 

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:36.909
 It is activated after it is linked to the new pathogens. 

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.630
 I'll explain the details later. 

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.880
 In order to activate, it is normally needed 

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.210
 help from assistive cell, but I do not want to stretch it 

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.610
 and hack into this video. 

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.550
 So in this case, I suppose activation 

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.690
 can happen - or say the need to be responsive, 

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.080
 is signaled by 

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.200
 connection with pathogens. 

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.670
 In most cases, you also need help 

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:01.785
 Auxiliary T cells as well. 

00:09:01.785 --> 00:09:03.420
 So let's discuss why this is important. 

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.280
 Indeed, it is a defensive mechanism against failure 

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.090
 for the immune system 

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:11.830
 But once it is activated, it will start 

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.060
 to clone / copy myself. 

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.500
 It means, look, I'm the one that suits the virus 

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.390
 and will begin to cling to yourself. 

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.810
 It will begin to split and renew itself. 

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.010
 In the end there will be many versions of it. 

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.240
 Then all will replicate and differentiate, 

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.110
 differentiation means the specification of the role that it will have. 

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.350
 There are two forms of differentiation. 

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.100
 So they will be produced 

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.270
 hundreds of thousands. 

00:09:55.270 --> 00:10:01.210
 Some of these cells will move into memory cells, 

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:05.850
 which really are cell B but which will be found for a long time 

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.660
 with the perfect receptor, with the perfect variable 

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.500
 of the receptor itself. 

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.440
 Some of the memory cells will be in quantity 

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.140
 bigger than they were at the beginning. 

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.770
 If the same pathogen attacks the organism in the next ten years 

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.120
 they will face more memory B cells 

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.540
 with which to come and which will be activated 

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.710
 and some of them will be shaded 

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:36.760
 into the effector cells. 

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.640
 Effective cells are usually cells 

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.890
 do, something is going on. 

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:50.580
 What the effector cells do is that they shine in the antibodies 

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.050
 they are restored to the B-effected cells - sometimes called 

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.030
 plasma cells. 

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:59.175
 They are fed into antibody factories. 

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.690
 The antibodies that they produce are the correct combination 

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.800
 of the initial combination, on the day it is formed, 

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.050
 as they are membrane antibodies. 

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.230
 So they will begin to produce these antibodies 

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.650
 for which we have spoken, with specificity - they will start you 

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.260
 secretes out these antibodies. 

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.670
 They will secretly emit hundreds of thousands of dollars 

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.660
 these proteins that are specific and have the ability 

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.340
 to relate to the new pathogen, this is a new pathogen. 

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.430
 So an effector cell will produce 

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.590
 2000 antibodies per second. 

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.270
 So you can imagine, if you have so many cell phones, 

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.290
 you will have so many antibodies in your body 

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.500
 and in different tissues. 

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.600
 The value of this and why the adaptive immune system is 

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.560
 that there are many viruses that infect your body, 

00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:01.020
 but now you produce so much 

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.820
 antibodies. 

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.680
 Effective cells are these factories and these 

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.960
 specific antibodies will begin to recognize and bind the pathogens. 

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.510
 Wait to draw this. 

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:22.370
 Specific antibodies will bind these viruses 

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:28.360
 and this has some value. 

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.180
 First of all, identification. 

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.700
 Phagocytosis - this is called opsonization. 

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.730
 When a molecule is identified, it becomes easier 

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:51.260
 that phagocytes eat them, that's why persian 

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.600
 antibodies bind and signal phagocytes, which they do 

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.290
 the whole process lighter. 

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.760
 You should eat this "type". 

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.180
 It also complicates the functioning of viruses. 

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.240
 I have this great thing that has climbed to me. 

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.110
 It will be more difficult for them to infiltrate other cells, 

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:09.110
 in each of these antibodies, 

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:13.460
 are two identical and heavy chains 

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.710
 two light indenting chains. 

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.250
 Then they have a specific variable 

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:25.450
 in each of these two branches that can be linked 

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.760
 with the epitopes of the virus. 

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.970
 So you can imagine what happens if these cells relate to 

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.760
 an epitope and this cell is related to another virus? 

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.110
 Suddenly, these viruses are glued together 

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.950
 and this is even more efficient. 

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.680
 They can not do what they do normally. 

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.910
 They can not deplete the cell membrane 

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.340
 because they are identified or "tagged". 

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.650
 They are opsonized so phagocytes can come 

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:49.520
 and you eat. 

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.770
 We will talk about B cells in the future, but 

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.480
 what fascinates is that there are so many 

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.100
 combinations that are sufficient 

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.210
 to identify almost everything that exists in bodily fluids, 

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.760
 for which we still do not have all the answers. 

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.950
 We have not yet solved the problem of what is happening 

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.060
 when in fact things infiltrate the cells or do we have carcinogenic cells? 

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.270
 How do we snuff cells that have clearly deviated?
