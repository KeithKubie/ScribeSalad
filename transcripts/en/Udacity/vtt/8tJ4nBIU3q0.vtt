00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.010
Generally speaking, there are four important ingredients

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.444
to any information visualization. Visual cues, coordinate

00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:12.110
systems, scale and data types, and context.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.970
Let's use this line chart, which shows total

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.490
home runs by year in major league

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.660
baseball to showcase each of these ingredients.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.210
So, the first ingredient was visual cues,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.560
or visual encoding. This is encoding data with

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.200
shapes, colors, and sizes. For example, if we look at this

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.480
chart, we can show that each point shows the number of home

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.450
runs in a given year. And we can also see that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.780
the lines connecting the points give us some sense of the rate

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.960
of change of number of home runs hit from year to

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.150
year. There were also coordinate systems. So we need to place our

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.950
data point somewhere on the chart. A coordinate system gives us

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.980
a structured space that dictates where the shapes and color should go.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.280
This gives meaning to and x, y coordinate on

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.550
this chart. For example, in this particular graphic, the x-axis

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.720
represents time, and the y-axis represents total number of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.590
home runs hit. Whereas the coordinate system tells us what

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.060
various dimensions of our visualization may correspond to, the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.740
scale or data type will tell you where exactly your

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.390
data needs to go. There are three types of

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.520
scales that we could use: numeric, categorical and time series.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.610
In this example, we're using numerical data on the

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.830
y axis, the total number of home runs, and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.080
we have time on the x axis, the year.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.950
Note that both of them are a linear scale, so

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.860
numbers are evenly spaced out. There are other type

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.520
of scales, which we'll discuss later. And the final important

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.480
ingredient of an information visualization is context. So, if

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.710
your audience is unfamiliar with the data, it's your job

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.270
to clarify what values in your graphic represent and explain

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.610
to people how they should read your chart. So, in

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.730
this particular visualization, I've provided some context by giving the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.450
chart a title. Number of NLB home runs by year.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.682
Labeling the axes, year and total home runs, and I

00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:02.260
could do a little bit more by annotating the chart

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.820
potentially, so there are a variety of things that might

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.720
inform the total number of home runs hit in a

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.240
particular year, maybe the beginning of the live ball

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.480
era, which we might put somewhere over here. The

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.780
crackdown on steroid use, which happens somewhere around the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.580
year 2000, et cetera. These annotations might help people

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.470
interpret this data and understand the story of, why

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.230
the number of home runs hit by year is

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.850
changing over time. It's important to emphasize that data

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.450
is the driving force behind all four of these ingredients.
