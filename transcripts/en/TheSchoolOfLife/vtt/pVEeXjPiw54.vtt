00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.079
Baruch Spinoza

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.869
was a 17th century Dutch philosopher who
tried to reinvent

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.449
religion, moving it away from something
based on superstition

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.090
and ideas of direct divine
intervention to being a discipline

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.240
that was going to be far more impersonal,
quasi scientific

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.330
and yet also at times serenely consoling.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.460
Baruch - the word means blessed in
Hebrew,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.710
was born in the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam
in 1632,

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.350
a thriving central Jewish commerce in
thought. His ancestors were sephardic Jews

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.940
who'd fled the Spanish Peninsula
following the Catholic conspired

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.659
expulsion of 1492

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:46.649
Baruch, a studious, highly
intelligent child, received an intensely

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.499
traditional Jewish education.

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:51.960
He went to the local Jewish school, the
Yeshiva and followed all the Jewish

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.589
High Holidays and rituals

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.690
But gradually he began to distance
himself from the faith of his ancestors.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.190
"Although I have been educated from
boyhood in  the accepted beliefs

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.389
concerning Scripture",

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:06.060
he later wrote with characteristic
caution, "I have felt bound

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.750
in the end to embrace other views". His
fully fleshed-out views

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.700
would to be expressed his great work 'The
Ethics', written entirely in Latin

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.100
and published in 1677. In The Ethics
Spinoza directly challenged the main

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.840
tenets of Judaism in particular

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.740
and organized religion in general. God is
not a person who stands outside of nature

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.120
there is no one to hear our prayers or
to create miracles

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.600
or to punish us for misdeeds. There is no
afterlife

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.390
man is not God's chosen creature. The
Bible was only written by

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.150
ordinary people. God is not a craftsman or
an architect, nor is he a

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.590
King or military strategist who calls
for believers to take up the Holy Sword.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.710
God doesn't see anything, nor does he expect anything.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.820
He doesn't judge. He doesn't even reward the virtuous with the life after death.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.080
Every representation of God as a
person is a projection of the imagination

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.530
and everything in the traditional
liturgical calendar is pure superstition

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.570
and mumbo-jumbo.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.750
However, despite all this, remarkably,
Spinoza did not declare himself an atheist

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.960
He insisted that he remained a staunch
defender of God.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.020
God plays an absolutely central role
in Spinoza's ethics.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.230
But it isn't anything like the God who
haunts the pages of the Old Testament.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.840
Spinoza's God is wholly impersonal and
indistinguishable from what we might

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.750
variously called

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.660
'nature' or 'existence' or a 'world soul'. God is the universe and its laws

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.160
God is reason and truth. God is the
animating force in

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.480
everything that is and can be. He is not
in time

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.590
and he cannot be individuated.
Spinoza writes:

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.710
"Whatever is, is in God and nothing
can exist or be conceived without God."

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.690
Throughout his text, Spinoza was keen to
undermine the idea of

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.180
prayer. In prayer, an individual appeals
to God

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.500
to change the way the universe works. But
Spinoza

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.850
argues that this is entirely the wrong
way around. The task of human beings

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.890
is to try to understand how and why the
universe works the way it does

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.570
and then accept it, rather than protest
at the workings of existence

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.930
by sending little messages up into the
sky. As Spinoza put it beautifully

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.180
but rather caustically:

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.890
"Whoever loves God cannot strive
that God should love him in return".

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.680
In other words
only a deeply distorted and

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.300
infantile narcissism would lead someone
that wants to believe in God

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.560
and then to imagine that this God
would take an interest in bending the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.620
rules of existence

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.440
to improve his or her life in some way.
Spinoza was deeply influenced by the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.090
philosophy of the Stoics of ancient
Greece and Rome.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.180
They had argued the wisdom lies not in
protest against how things are

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.560
but in continuous attempts to understand
the ways of the world

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.720
and then bow down peacefully to
necessity

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.780
Seneca, Spinoza's favorite philosopher, had
compared human beings to dogs on a leash

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.850
being led by the necessities of life in
a range of directions.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.950
The more one pulls against what's
necessary, the more one is strangled.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.170
And therefore the wise must always
endeavor, to try to understand ahead of time

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.150
how things are.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.570
For example what love is like or how
politics works.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.810
And then change their direction
accordingly so as not to be strangled

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:11.970
unnecessarily.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.190
It is this kind of stoic attitude that
constantly pervades Spinoza's philosophy.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.120
To understand God, traditionally means
studying the Bible and other holy texts.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.360
But Spinoza now introduces another idea. The best way to know God

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.280
is to understand how life and the
universe work. It's through a knowledge of

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.009
psychology, philosophy and the natural
sciences

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.180
that one comes to understand God.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.840
In traditional religion believers ask special favors of God. Spinoza proposes instead

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.389
that we should understand what God wants
and we can do so in one way above all -

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.699
by studying everything that is. By
reasoning

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.900
we can exceed to a divine eternal
perspective.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.220
Spinoza made a famous distinction
between two ways of looking at life.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.719
 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:59.150
We can either see it egoistically from our
limited point of view.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.610
As he put it: sub specie durationis (under the aspect of time)

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.340
or we can look at things globally
and eternally:

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.590
sub specie aeternitatis (under the
aspect of eternity).

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.629
Our nature means that we'll always be
divided between the two.

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.080
Sensual life pulls us towards a time-bound
partial view.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.639
But our reason and intelligence can give us
unique access to another perspective.

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.060
It can quite literally allow us - and
here Spinoza becomes beautifully lyrical -

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.150
to participate in eternal totality.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.169
Normally we call bad, whatever is bad
for us,

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.240
and good whatever increases our power and
advantage. But for Spinoza,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.990
to be truly ethical means rising above
such local concerns.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.009
It might all sound forbidding, but
Spinoza envisaged his philosophy

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.300
as a route to a life based on freedom
from guilt,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.389
from sorrow, from pity or from shame.

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.729
Happiness involves aligning our will with
that of the universe.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.590
The Universe God has its own projects
and it's our task

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.620
to understand rather than rail against
these.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.949
The free person is one conscious of the
necessities that compel us all.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:10.770
Spinoza writes, the wise man, the person
who understands how and why things are,

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.259
possesses eternally true complacency
of spirit.

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:18.599
Needless to say these ideas got Spinoza
into

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:23.179
a very deep trouble. He was excommunicated
from the Jewish community of Amsterdam in 1656

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.270
The rabbis issued a censure known as 'cherem'

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.450
against the philosopher. It went by the
decree of the

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.520
angels and by the commander of the holy man - 
we excommunicate, expel, curse

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.080
and damn Brauch Spinoza with all the
curses which are written in the book of law

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.000
cursed he be by day and cursed be he
by night. Cursed be he when he lies down

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.150
and cursed be he when he rises up. Spinoza
was forced to flee Amsterdam

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.560
and eventually settled in The Hague,
where he lived quietly and peacefully as

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.550
a lens grinder,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.160
and private tutor till his death in 1677.
Spinoza's work was largely forgotten

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.120
down the ages.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.300
Hegel took an interest, as did Wittgenstein
and several other twentieth

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.470
century philosophers.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.060
But from many perspectives Spinoza's
work constitutes a warning

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.820
about failures of philosophy. The ethics
is one of the world's most beautiful

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.640
books.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.950
It contains a calming perspective for
storing take on life.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.150
It replaces the God of superstition with
a wise and consoling pantheism.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.790
And yet Spinoza's work failed utterly to
convince any but a few

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.380
to abandon traditional religion and to
move towards a rationalist,

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.390
wise system of belief. The reasons are in a way

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.430
simple and banal. Spinoza failed to
understand,

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.350
like so many philosophers before and
since, that what leads people to religion

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.430
isn't just reason,

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.460
but far more importantly: emotion, belief,
fear

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.920
and tradition. People stick with their beliefs
because they like the ritual,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.950
the communal meals,

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.760
the yearly traditions, the beautiful
architecture, the music and the lovely

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.060
language read out in a sinagoge or
church.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.510
Spinoza's Ethics arguably contains a
whole lot more wisdom than the Bible.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.730
But because it comes without any of the Bible's
supporting structure

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.060
it remains a marginal work, studied here
and there at

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.080
universities in the West. What the
traditional religion,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.090
that Spinoza thought outmoded in the 1670s,

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.350
continues to thrive and convince people. If we're

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.200
ever to replace traditional beliefs, we
must remember just how much religion has

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:13.940
helped along

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.130
by ritual, tradition, art and a desire to
belong.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.140
All things that Spinoza, despite its
great wisdom,

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.280
ignored it as peril in his bold attempt
to replace the Bible.
