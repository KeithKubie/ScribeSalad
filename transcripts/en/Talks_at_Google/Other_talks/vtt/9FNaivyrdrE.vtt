AARON ZEMACH: Hey guys,
thanks for coming out.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.480
So to get started before
we talk about the museum,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.440
I'm interested if you could
just talk a little bit about how

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.200
the two of you first met each
other, got to know each other.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.810
What's the story of you two?

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.310
MATT HARKINS: Oh,
we met at a party.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.407
We both had done comedy
at the UC [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:22.407 --> 00:00:23.740
It's like an improv in the city.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.580
And they have every year
a New Year's Eve party

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.720
at a terrible bar, and
so we both were there

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.890
at not having fun.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.159
And then we just said
hi, I guess, but then we

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:37.200
didn't see each other for
like a year afterwards.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.364
We got donuts once in between.

00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:39.864
VIVIANA OLEN: Yeah,
I kept on trying

00:00:39.864 --> 00:00:42.250
to make him a best
friend, and I knew

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.750
that that was going to happen
but he was avoiding it.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.470
And then I started asking
where's Matt Harkins.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.840
And he came over
to film this web

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.600
series I was doing
with my roommate's cats

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.710
called "TheatriCats,"
which is a play

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.470
and how the cats acted out.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.510
And he came over and we
just had so much fun,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.846
and then started hanging out
every day and working together

00:01:06.846 --> 00:01:08.870
and stuff.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.024
And then a few months
later we moved in together.

00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:12.190
AARON ZEMACH: Awesome, cool.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.230
So you moved in
together, were roommates,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.720
and then one night you decide
to watch the film on Netflix

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.896
"The Price of Gold."

00:01:22.896 --> 00:01:23.740
MATT HARKINS: Yes.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.010
AARON ZEMACH: And
could you quickly

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.770
for those of us who
maybe have forgotten

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.061
a little bit of the details
of what that movie recounts

00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:32.880
give a brief overview of the
story of "Price of Gold."

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.090
MATT HARKINS: So fun, there's a
"30 for 30" series on Netflix.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.556
You can watch it, it's ESPN.

00:01:39.556 --> 00:01:40.930
And there all
these documentaries

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.340
about sports, but this one was
about Tonya Harding and Nancy

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.850
Kerrigan, because
I wouldn't have

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.379
watched any of the other ones.

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:49.170
They're all like-- the
other ones are good.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.000
It's like Denis Leary
talking about baseball.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.085
But this one I just
started watching

00:01:54.085 --> 00:01:55.960
and then immediately
started texting Viviana.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.710
VIVIANA OLEN: You
told me to come home

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.866
and that we had to
watch it together.

00:01:58.866 --> 00:01:59.680
MATT HARKINS: It's so good.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.400
So the story is basically, it
just goes through the events

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.290
in 1994 focusing on
that, but really focuses

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.490
on Tonya Harding,
because it was made right

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.150
around the 20th anniversary.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.930
So they had two
different documentaries.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.920
One of them Nancy and Tonya did.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.290
That was the NBC one because NBC
offered Nancy the opportunity

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.350
to be a commenter
on the Olympics.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.520
This one she kept saying
maybe she'd do but then she

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.269
eventually didn't.

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.270
So they really just
focused on Tonya

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.486
and that's what got
us so passionate,

00:02:25.486 --> 00:02:27.235
because we do feel
she's an American hero.

00:02:27.235 --> 00:02:28.560
VIVIANA OLEN: Because you
remember the story at all,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.810
you just kind of remember
the parody of Tonya Harding,

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.950
and how you think
of the sex tape and

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.094
you think of just "Mad
TV" version of it.

00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:39.510
And then you watch
the documentary

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.270
and it's like just this
woman who came from nothing.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.140
All she really had
was ice skating

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.190
and she makes it to
the pinnacle of that.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.040
She makes it to
the Olympics twice.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.560
And she's the first American,
not just the first woman,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.770
but the first American
to land the triple axel.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.830
These are all things that
we had never ever, ever

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.454
heard about because we were like
six or seven when it happened.

00:02:59.454 --> 00:03:01.317
And then to see her,
she was like she

00:03:01.317 --> 00:03:03.650
made a few bad choices, she
was around the wrong people.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.220
And she comes from nothing,
she reaches the pinnacle

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.790
and then she just
loses everything,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.160
and then it's fascinating.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.070
And we were so excited
about talking about it

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.390
and nobody else had
also just seen it,

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.390
so that's kind of how we
ended up making a museum.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.640
AARON ZEMACH: All right,
really quickly just the facts

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.645
so we can all recall, 1994
Olympics, the qualifications.

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:30.770
Instead of me just saying
it and you confirming it,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.620
maybe it's better if
you just lay this out,

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.240
because your knowledge is
a bit better than mine.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.781
MATT HARKINS: So
yeah, Tonya Harding,

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:38.590
she was the first American to
land a triple axel in 1991.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.850
And then at the same time
Nancy, both her and Nancy

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.930
were showing up in competitions.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.230
And then fast forward a few
years later, they're 24 and 25,

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.510
so this is really the
last year that they're

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.060
going to be able to compete.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.250
And right before the
qualifying championships

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.150
for competing in the
Olympics, Nancy Kerrigan

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.880
is attacked at the arena
where everyone's practicing.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.250
And at first they have
no clue who did this.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.160
But really quickly it
becomes pretty evident

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.590
that Tonya Harding's husband
was definitely involved,

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.220
and then the suspicion is then
that Tonya Harding was involved

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.779
in planning the attack itself.

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:17.820
VIVIANA OLEN: Yeah, then
a media frenzy followed,

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.490
and this is right before
the O.J. Simpson thing,

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.260
so it was like months of just
every day the story changed

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.757
and it just kind of took over.

00:04:26.757 --> 00:04:29.090
AARON ZEMACH: Cool, so I do
want to talk about the media

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.624
reaction, but before that you
guys saw this documentary.

00:04:32.624 --> 00:04:34.040
You really enjoyed
it, you thought

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.310
there was a story that
was worth telling.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.500
I feel like a lot of
people watch documentaries

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.120
and have similar reactions.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.660
Very few of them decide
to take that and then

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.470
go build a museum
in their apartment

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.790
based on the documentary.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.960
MATT HARKINS: Yeah.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.710
VIVIANA OLEN: Mhm.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.915
AARON ZEMACH: So how did
that idea come about?

00:04:52.915 --> 00:04:54.290
VIVIANA OLEN:
Well, the apartment

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.630
we moved-- we moved in
there a month before,

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.440
and it was the first place
we looked at because it had

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.320
two rooms away from each other.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.180
And it didn't have
a living room but it

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.565
had a really long
hallway and we're like,

00:05:05.565 --> 00:05:08.500
oh we'll do something with this.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.270
And then he was working
at a museum at the time,

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.807
and he-- there was
actually a text exchange.

00:05:15.807 --> 00:05:17.390
He was like nobody
at the museum wants

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.090
to talk about Tonya
and Nancy, and I

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.400
said ha, ha, ha you're making
it the Tonya and Nancy Museum.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.150
And then like I think
like 4 AM the next day,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.280
I was like Matt, Matt we're
going to make the Tonya

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.258
and Nancy Museum.

00:05:34.102 --> 00:05:35.614
That's exactly how it happened.

00:05:35.614 --> 00:05:38.030
AARON ZEMACH: And when you at
that early stage when you're

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.400
thinking we're going
to start a museum,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.357
did you have any sense of what
it would mean to you to form

00:05:43.357 --> 00:05:44.940
a museum, the type
of things you would

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.149
be looking for to have in it.

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:48.523
VIVIANA OLEN: The original
plan, the original Kickstarter

00:05:48.523 --> 00:05:51.500
we were asking for $75 to
blow up pictures and put them

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.800
in the hallway, and we
figured that would be enough.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.689
And it was like oh this
will be a fun, funny thing.

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:01.980
You'll come over and you'll
walk down this dark hallway

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.470
and see pictures of Tonya
and Nancy, and it's crazy.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.970
And then we launched
the Kickstarter

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.780
and then I mean we didn't
really think ahead of time,

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.939
oh there is a figure
skating community.

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.230
But I mean of course there's
a figure skating community

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.340
and they started
reaching out to us.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.200
And the first person we
met that really took it

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.770
from joke to like, oh this
is going to change everything

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.550
was Lois Elfman who was a figure
skating reporter, journalist.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.030
And she contacted us
right away and was

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.180
like I have artifacts for you.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.640
And so we met with her and she
gave us all this amazing stuff

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.760
that she'd had in
her house like--

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.900
MATT HARKINS: A book, a scoring
book from 1990 with Nancy

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.040
and Tonya's face
on the same page.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.380
Then she gave us backstage
passes that she had

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.590
for different championships.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.730
VIVIANA OLEN: Of the one where
the attack happened as well.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.146
MATT HARKINS: Yeah,
there was one,

00:06:54.146 --> 00:06:56.729
there was a ticket for the Joe
Louis COBO Arena in Detroit.

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:58.770
VIVIANA OLEN: Original
pictures of Nancy Kerrigan

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.100
that she took, and then this
one pin from that championship.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.890
And she was just like, it
was so important to her

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:05.910
and she gave it to us.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.200
And then we got home and we're
like, OK we have to really try,

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.900
and so we went to Michaels
and got so many shadow boxes.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.230
And then more-- and then
people started making art

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.120
and people started
sending us other things.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.620
And so we kind of just came
up with this hub for it.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.430
I mean, so it did
start as like a joke,

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:31.170
but we put so many hours
and so much love into it,

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.692
and we're just so committed to
it that it's very real to us.

00:07:34.692 --> 00:07:36.150
AARON ZEMACH: You
know one of the--

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.070
so I've been to the
museum at their apartment.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.320
And one of the other interesting
things I think you do

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.240
is you really follow not only
the events of the incident

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.670
but also how the media talked
about the incident afterwards.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.540
It's not only
documenting the skaters

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.420
but it's documenting
how we as a nation kind

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.074
of responded to the skaters.

00:07:52.074 --> 00:07:54.740
MATT HARKINS: Yeah, the thing is
that's like the craziest thing.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.430
I feel like especially
with Tonya Harding

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.240
it's amazing that she
didn't kill anyone,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.010
because the things that she
had to go through are insane.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:07.820
And if it was me, I would've--
first off I wouldn't have even,

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.290
I would be in a
basement somewhere.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:13.230
But she came from just a
terrible upbringing and then

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.190
from there achieved so much.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.854
But then also once
it starts coming out

00:08:17.854 --> 00:08:19.270
that she might be
involved there's

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.845
so much press thrown her way.

00:08:20.845 --> 00:08:22.820
And at first when
you watch it she

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.180
seems excited because it
was one of the big things

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.210
that she had to go through
was seeing how unfair it was

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.886
that other figure skaters
who kind of were more

00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:33.260
in line with what people
thought figure skaters should be

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.968
would get endorsement
deals that she just

00:08:34.968 --> 00:08:38.080
wouldn't get, despite the
fact that she was so talented.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.370
So when she first gets this
attention she's excited,

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.535
but then it's obviously
not good attention

00:08:42.535 --> 00:08:44.410
and it just builds and
it builds to the point

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.970
where people are getting her
truck towed so that she'll

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.166
run outside and they can
attack her with questions,

00:08:50.166 --> 00:08:52.130
just swarm her, basically.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:56.220
And she also has
no team around her.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.190
Nancy has a full
staff basically,

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.700
agents coaches, people were
just pulling back from Tonya

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.740
so she's doing
this all on her own

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.770
and still gets herself
to the Olympics.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.300
But it's that moment that
was the thing that we relate

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.610
to the most, which was at the
Olympics there's just the total

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.751
meltdown because she's--
it's her second program.

00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:18.250
She's planning on doing a triple
Axel, which she hadn't been

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.980
able to do since
early in the '90s,

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.220
but it was her way of sort
of saying OK, well this

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.470
will make them forget all
that other stuff that people

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.600
are talking about.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.440
And then halfway
through her program

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.350
she stops because
she messes up a jump.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.016
She had a problem
with her laces before.

00:09:32.016 --> 00:09:34.787
She showed up late, so it's
just watching it all crash.

00:09:34.787 --> 00:09:36.370
VIVIANA OLEN: And
all of those events,

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.150
it feels kind of like
the birth of reality TV

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.080
because that
performance is still

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.617
one of the seven most watched
things live still to this day.

00:09:45.617 --> 00:09:46.950
MATT HARKINS: [INAUDIBLE], yeah.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.533
VIVIANA OLEN: Yeah,
and so it's like--

00:09:48.533 --> 00:09:51.615
and then every day you
just had these two women

00:09:51.615 --> 00:09:55.000
and every day you were following
just every little thing

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.190
they were doing and just
impressing so much on it.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:03.180
So it just, it feels like it was
foreshadowing so much of today.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.910
MATT HARKINS: And they
made them into these--

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.451
I don't know what the word is,
but it was just like Nancy was

00:10:08.451 --> 00:10:11.150
very much the ice queen and then
Tonya was just like the trash,

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.260
and that was how they
were constantly presented.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.940
And it's just not
true, but it was--

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.440
VIVIANA OLEN: And
that's what we try

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.148
to do as much as
possible with the museum

00:10:19.148 --> 00:10:24.490
is cut away from that and
talk about them as athletes,

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.540
and we try to show
them at their best.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.230
Yeah, separate them as much
as possible from the media

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.750
storm, because there would
have been nothing new to say

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.836
if we were just kind
of going off of--

00:10:37.836 --> 00:10:39.860
but that's all inspired
by the documentary, too.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.940
It's so good, and we got to
meet the director of that.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.000
So that was very
cool, she came by.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.860
But yeah, so it's just, it's
really she told the story best

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.070
and then we're just
mimicking the movie.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:52.610
MATT HARKINS: Yeah,
all we're doing

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.485
is making sure we keep
having the conversation

00:10:54.485 --> 00:10:56.670
that we wanted to have with a
bunch of people all the time

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:57.740
but nobody was ready.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.234
So anybody who comes over
it's like fun and everything

00:11:00.234 --> 00:11:01.650
but then we get
to talk about what

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.490
we wanted to talk about to
begin with, which was just how--

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:05.120
VIVIANA OLEN: Good
this movie is.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.630
MATT HARKINS: --good
this movie is.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.005
AARON ZEMACH: So you guys do
have this interesting aspect

00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:11.160
of your museum
where-- so in order

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.560
to view the museum
people send you an email,

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.040
and you respond and set up a
time with them to come visit.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.770
And then you're essentially
welcoming these strangers

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:24.990
into your apartment
to view the museum.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.070
What was that like
to make the decision

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.840
to just sort of open the
doors to whoever can send you

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.650
an email?

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.050
VIVIANA OLEN: I think
it was just like, oh

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.960
well first we were like
we'll meet people downstairs.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.605
That seemed to us like
some amazing safeguard,

00:11:43.605 --> 00:11:47.010
like that we meet them on
the corner by the bodega.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.280
If they're crazy we
just won't have them up.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.510
A few problems with
that, we got so lazy

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.920
and stopped meeting people
downstairs because actually

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.230
we're just like come up.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.520
So many people have
our buzzer code.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.530
And the second part
is you go downstairs,

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.680
you meet somebody who
is creepy and we do not

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.110
have it in us to say no
you can't come upstairs.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:13.230
So we have let some weird people
inside, but nobody has hurt us.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.710
I think it takes the appeal
out of it for serial killers

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.000
or something because we're
going to be such easy prey.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.760
MATT HARKINS: Yeah,
they like the chase.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.610
VIVIANA OLEN: But honestly,
anybody who's interested in it

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.871
are people like us.

00:12:27.871 --> 00:12:30.370
That's really who
we've met, people

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.810
who like figure skating
documentaries and people who

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.290
like kitsch and camp.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:37.349
So it's been so, so fun.

00:12:37.349 --> 00:12:38.890
MATT HARKINS: The
other most fun part

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.580
I think has just been seeing how
people approach that, like just

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:47.144
seeing who shows up late, who
inside the apartment-- which

00:12:47.144 --> 00:12:49.600
one time there was a
huge group of people

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.790
and they then invited
their friends over.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.479
VIVIANA OLEN: Oh,
that was terrible.

00:12:53.479 --> 00:12:55.270
MATT HARKINS: And then
their friends came--

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.410
VIVIANA OLEN: And they invited
someone else, too, I think.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.300
MATT HARKINS: Yeah,
yeah, yeah some guy.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.050
VIVIANA OLEN: There
was like three people.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.170
MATT HARKINS: And the guy didn't
talk at all, which is fine,

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.080
but she kept going around.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.505
This is a very small apartment.

00:13:06.505 --> 00:13:07.505
VIVIANA OLEN: Very small

00:13:07.505 --> 00:13:08.660
MATT HARKINS: It's like yeah,
you're in our apartment,

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.159
whatever.

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:11.160
But also she kept
going into our bedrooms

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.288
to like look around and peek.

00:13:13.288 --> 00:13:16.250
It's like, you can't
do, that's not right.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.150
VIVIANA OLEN: We did
not say anything though.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.205
We also don't like
confrontations.

00:13:19.205 --> 00:13:20.288
MATT HARKINS: Oh yeah, no.

00:13:20.288 --> 00:13:23.660
VIVIANA OLEN: So this is not
a thing to set up for us but--

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.460
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah,
yeah, and there

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.840
is sort of this new movement,
especially in New York

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.140
of the micro museum.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:35.464
So there is like the
Museum of Morbid Anatomy

00:13:35.464 --> 00:13:37.255
and a museum I've heard
about in Chinatown,

00:13:37.255 --> 00:13:38.826
a museum in an elevator.

00:13:38.826 --> 00:13:40.700
Have you guys been in
touch with other people

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.434
involved in a sort of this
micro museum movement?

00:13:44.434 --> 00:13:45.876
MATT HARKINS: Not so much.

00:13:45.876 --> 00:13:50.000
We reached out to a bunch of
different museums a while ago,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.750
just about when we
didn't know what

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.630
would happen with the
collection that we have.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:59.229
And the response
was not [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:59.229 --> 00:14:00.770
VIVIANA OLEN: I'm
not super respected

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:04.510
in the museum community.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.760
Yeah but it's fun seeing
those other things pop up.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.661
And I think we didn't
know this at the time

00:14:08.661 --> 00:14:10.160
but there was also
in the '90s there

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.070
was a troll museum in some
woman's apartment in the Lower

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.060
East Side.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.790
I think it's-- I mean
it's so appealing

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.350
because there's the idea of
like the Route 66 Museum where

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:23.790
it's like the Museum of
Spoons and that's so fun,

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.450
so it's nice to see it
coming back a little bit.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:31.155
AARON ZEMACH: And you guys have
got quite the variety of press

00:14:31.155 --> 00:14:31.780
for the museum.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.340
You've been featured
on TV, and radio,

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.280
and in magazines we
were just talking about.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.570
What do you think it is
about the museum that

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.670
captures people's interest
in that kind of way?

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:48.280
VIVIANA OLEN: I think the first
round definitely just talking

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.910
about Tonya and Nancy again,
because it instantly-- you

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.730
remember where you were,
how you remember it.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:01.070
And then I think also the
fact that it was in a hallway

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.940
was appealing, because people
like to go into other people's

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.859
houses if they can.

00:15:07.859 --> 00:15:09.650
MATT HARKINS: There's
some museum in France

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.660
that's-- it's like an old house
and it's run by a guy who lives

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.860
there.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.289
And you book an appointment,
and you go to see the house

00:15:17.289 --> 00:15:19.830
and he just walks around with
his shirt off in the background

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:21.605
and makes eggs.

00:15:21.605 --> 00:15:23.105
And it's like people
go because they

00:15:23.105 --> 00:15:26.920
would get the story of
like oh, he's so weird.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.320
So I feel like that's
also a thing that people--

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.528
VIVIANA OLEN: Yeah, I think
a lot of people come just

00:15:31.528 --> 00:15:32.620
to see the freaks.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.760
MATT HARKINS: Yeah, kind
of a little like that.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.570
Yeah, and it really does
feel like we're freaks

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.250
when it's just one of us.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.020
If it's both of us
together it's fun,

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.810
because it's sort of like
we'll play off each other

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:41.310
or whatever.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.840
But if it's just one of us,
especially if it's one of us

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.710
and then a couple on a
date, it's like all right.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.510
Very creepy.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.384
AARON ZEMACH: The third
wheel museum curator.

00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:52.796
VIVIANA OLEN: Yeah.

00:15:52.796 --> 00:15:54.610
MATT HARKINS: Yeah, there
was one time it was these two

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.859
people and it just really
seemed like they just wanted

00:15:56.859 --> 00:15:59.860
to hang out in there alone.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:04.410
So I kind of backed off and
then there's nowhere for me.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.670
I'm not going to lie down.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:07.586
We don't have like a--

00:16:07.586 --> 00:16:09.070
VIVIANA OLEN: We don't
have a couch or anything.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.322
MATT HARKINS: Yeah,
there's no couch.

00:16:10.322 --> 00:16:12.822
So I just kind of sat and then
just kept peeking my head in.

00:16:12.822 --> 00:16:14.624
And I was like, you doing OK?

00:16:14.624 --> 00:16:17.170
And they were just
like, yeah, we're fine.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.930
And then they left.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.440
AARON ZEMACH: So
Googlers as a bunch,

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.960
we're pretty creative people.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.850
If anyone here was interested
in starting their own museum

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.634
about a certain topic
in their apartment

00:16:29.634 --> 00:16:31.050
or some other small
museum, do you

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.650
have advice about
what to do to start

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.225
that, what to do to make that
successful for someone else?

00:16:36.225 --> 00:16:37.850
VIVIANA OLEN: Definitely
eBay is great.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:38.790
MATT HARKINS: Oh, eBay is great.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.320
VIVIANA OLEN: Because you
can just get a lot of stuff

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:40.830
on there.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.746
MATT HARKINS: And it's
so cheap it's shocking.

00:16:42.746 --> 00:16:45.079
It's honestly insane how cheap
some of these things are.

00:16:45.079 --> 00:16:47.110
You can get a magazine--
and I just look,

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:51.230
there's magazines that
have O.J. On the cover

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.830
and they're like, they're $3.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.530
I don't know why,
for me it seems

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.260
like that should be a lot of
money, but they're very cheap.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:02.840
And then they have these
Nancy Kerrigan trading cards,

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.640
which were still pretty cheap.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.260
They were like $30 and they
don't make them anymore.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.319
VIVIANA OLEN: Yeah,
those are artifacts.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.715
MATT HARKINS: That's it, and
so we've been giving them away

00:17:11.715 --> 00:17:12.673
to the people who come.

00:17:12.673 --> 00:17:14.859
But there's so
much stuff on eBay.

00:17:17.141 --> 00:17:19.099
Oh, I just saw this also
because I was actually

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:22.980
just looking for O.J. themed
stuff because that show is on.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.880
But they have a juror pin,
it says like designated TV

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.370
juror, which is so creepy
and that's for sale on eBay

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:33.400
for like $2 if you
want it, and maybe not.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.965
VIVIANA OLEN: So go for it.

00:17:34.965 --> 00:17:36.910
But I think the big
thing is like-- I

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.507
mean you know there's the
internet, as you know.

00:17:39.507 --> 00:17:41.090
So it's so easy to
connect with people

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.370
who are interested in
what you're interested in.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.110
And that's really
why this was so fun

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.620
and I think caught
on a little bit,

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:52.280
because we just connect
with other people who

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.270
liked the idea.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.870
And then they've
come from all over.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.750
We've met people from
Australia and we're in contact

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.180
with the guy who runs
the Tonya Harding fan

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.970
club in New Zealand.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.230
His name is Terry.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.950
He is very dedicated.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:11.130
And it's just all these
people that in another time

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:16.192
we would not know existed,
and so it's been great.

00:18:16.192 --> 00:18:17.650
AARON ZEMACH:
Great, and you guys

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.970
are working now on a
follow-up or a special exhibit

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.944
from the Tonya Harding
Nancy Kerrigan Museum.

00:18:22.944 --> 00:18:24.360
Could you explain
to everyone what

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.672
that is that you're working on?

00:18:25.672 --> 00:18:27.130
VIVIANA OLEN: Gets
me very excited.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.720
One of the artists
who had made us

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.020
a drawing for the permanent
collection, Laura Collins,

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.200
she lives in Chicago.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.730
And she has a series called
the "Olsen Twins Hiding

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.080
from Paparazzi" of paintings.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.730
And they're hiding
behind Birkin bags,

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.430
and Starbucks cups,
and BlackBerrys, so we

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.690
want to bring that here.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:52.060
It's very jarring
to see a whole wall

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.940
of women hiding
their face from you,

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.190
which is very creepy and fun.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.020
And we're going to have
special installations

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.390
inside the museum, like a
selfie station where you can

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.152
hide behind a giant BlackBerry.

00:19:05.152 --> 00:19:07.110
MATT HARKINS: Yeah, we
made a giant BlackBerry.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.070
It's to scale, and all of the
shift keys do what they would.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:13.146
It doesn't turn on but it
looks the way it should.

00:19:13.146 --> 00:19:15.110
So you can hide behind it.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.400
We just want it to be
interactive, and also

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.610
have fun with nostalgia in
general, because there's

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:21.690
so much of it now.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.900
And I feel like it
is always creepy

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.230
when people post a
GIF of the Olsen twins

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.490
saying some famous line,
because it's always like to me

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.000
at least that is just a
child who some adult yelled

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.700
at for 20 minutes before
and he's like you say this

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.575
and you say it right.

00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:39.486
And then it's like,
everyone's like, fuck you.

00:19:39.486 --> 00:19:42.710
So I feel like this is a fun
way to go like another step

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:43.210
forward.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.550
It's like yeah, if we're into
being nostalgic about this,

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.400
here's how creepy it can be.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.070
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah,
I feel like it also

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.980
continues that conversation.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.650
You talked about the
beginnings of reality TV, sort

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.270
of early '90s as
the Olsen twins also

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.910
became a part of the
media narrative as well.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.630
VIVIANA OLEN: Yeah, it
definitely carries that on.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.410
When I was a kid I was a big
Mary-Kate and Ashley fan,

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.750
and I went to this theme park
to meet Mary-Kate and Ashley.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.230
And you wait in line
for like three hours

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:15.190
and it just got more and
more depressing and weird.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.920
And then you pass by them and
they're just sitting there

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.780
and they're both like this.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:23.220
And I was just like, oh I'm
so sorry for looking at you,

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.240
and they grew up in that.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.520
And then the second
they really hit 18,

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.840
they just went into hiding,
which is just so cool I think.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.550
And I feel like
they did their work.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.220
And still they
can't walk around,

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.470
they can't walk down the street.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:43.040
And so yeah, just
highlighting that but in a fun

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.740
way with a giant BlackBerry.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.115
MATT HARKINS: And
we'll also have

00:20:46.115 --> 00:20:48.640
a model of a table at
Mary-Kate's wedding.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.890
Because there was when she
got married on Black Friday

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:54.634
last year, there was an article
in like two places about how

00:20:54.634 --> 00:20:56.592
she had bowls and
bowls of cigarettes

00:20:56.592 --> 00:20:58.985
at each table,
which was very fun.

00:20:58.985 --> 00:21:00.610
VIVIANA OLEN: It drew
us in immediately

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.414
and we said that is glamorous.

00:21:02.414 --> 00:21:04.080
MATT HARKINS: Because
there's no photos.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.571
Everyone had to turn
their phones in.

00:21:06.571 --> 00:21:09.450
The only story is just
that it was so smoky inside

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.150
and you couldn't see anything.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:13.190
So we'll have a table like that.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.165
We have a model of it now with
teeny tiny cigarettes that I

00:21:16.165 --> 00:21:18.830
spent too much time making.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.330
AARON ZEMACH: And
you guys are still

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.550
looking for some art
patrons for your Kickstarter

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.804
that's going on right
now to finish that up.

00:21:24.804 --> 00:21:26.220
VIVIANA OLEN: Yes,
our Kickstarter

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.210
is running until Sunday at 7:00.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.550
And we're asking
for more than $75

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.400
this time, because we
want to rent a storefront

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.950
and do a lot of cultural events,
and then ship the art here.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:42.290
That's very
expensive apparently,

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:44.383
but it'll be really
fun if we get to do it.

00:21:44.383 --> 00:21:45.130
Check that out.

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.060
MATT HARKINS: Yeah,
it's also we've

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.760
met so many people with our
last project that this one,

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.460
it's so cool to kind of try and
continue those relationships.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.680
At the last minute
we had a museum gala

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.310
for our Tonya Harding Museum.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:02.080
And Viviana's sister was in
town and she found on Groupon

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.392
a guy who would make cupcakes
and did a deal for us

00:22:04.392 --> 00:22:06.350
to bring cupcakes there,
and they were so good.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:11.060
So he is going to have a pop-up
shop in the pop-up gallery

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.980
with cupcakes with
all of the art on it.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.105
VIVIANA OLEN: And we've
gotten submissions already.

00:22:15.105 --> 00:22:18.960
This guy did this painting
of the Olsen twins hiding

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.240
from dinosaurs
instead of paparazzi.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.620
So it's really fun to see what
people come up with and just--

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.330
it's just a way to say hey,
let's make some more art

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:31.292
and put it together,
and that kind of stuff.

00:22:31.292 --> 00:22:33.000
AARON ZEMACH: Do you
guys feel like there

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.140
is enough pop culture,
interesting topics in your life

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.620
that this is something you
can see yourselves continuing

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.340
to do?

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.350
VIVIANA OLEN: Yeah.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:44.270
MATT HARKINS: Yeah, I
mean it's definitely--

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:46.490
I think it's just trying
to find other people who

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:47.826
maybe are as passionate.

00:22:47.826 --> 00:22:50.075
VIVIANA OLEN: I think there's
a million things though.

00:22:50.075 --> 00:22:53.920
I would see like an SVU exhibit
and that could be very fun.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:58.080
Just a lot of pictures
of Ice-T. I love that.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.557
MATT HARKINS: And there's so
much good fan art online and--

00:23:01.557 --> 00:23:03.390
VIVIANA OLEN: People
make beautiful fan art.

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:05.515
MATT HARKINS: Oh, they make
such beautiful fan art.

00:23:05.515 --> 00:23:07.270
And a lot of times
it's a joke, but it's

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:09.370
like they have created
something that is so good.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:10.370
VIVIANA OLEN: Beautiful.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:12.036
MATT HARKINS: And
it's about everything.

00:23:12.036 --> 00:23:14.530
HGTV shows, there's fan art.

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.790
There's fan fiction too.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.954
If you've watched
"Love it or List it."

00:23:18.954 --> 00:23:21.360
Yeah, it's a great show.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.750
And they have these two
hosts, Hilary and David,

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.000
and they have great chemistry.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.094
I sound very old
but I love them.

00:23:27.094 --> 00:23:28.869
And there's a fan
fiction about them.

00:23:28.869 --> 00:23:30.410
Nothing happens but
it's just about--

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.320
VIVIANA OLEN: Erotic fan fiction
is what he's talking about.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.286
AARON ZEMACH: Oh jeez.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.404
So we have a microphone
down in the second row

00:23:38.404 --> 00:23:39.820
if anyone has any
questions they'd

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.730
like to ask Matt and
Viviana about the museum,

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.818
or the skaters, or
anything at all.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:48.526
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:23:48.526 --> 00:23:49.370
VIVIANA OLEN: Hi.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.440
AUDIENCE: So what is
your favorite artifact

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.574
that you've collected if
you had to choose one?

00:23:54.574 --> 00:23:56.240
VIVIANA OLEN: I think
definitely-- well,

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.980
my favorite piece
of art is there

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.570
are these two cross
stitches of Tonya and Nancy,

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:04.480
and they're kind of
facing each other.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.320
And their shading
on them is insane.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.500
They're so beautiful.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.852
As far as artifacts,
what do you think?

00:24:12.852 --> 00:24:14.560
MATT HARKINS: I mean
I like the magazine.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.143
There's a "National
Enquirer" magazine

00:24:16.143 --> 00:24:18.440
we got off of eBay
because it's just

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:23.090
I think a lot of times
people would sort of say,

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.200
how much do you think
has changed since 1994.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.116
But then if you look at
one of these magazines

00:24:27.116 --> 00:24:28.230
like absolutely nothing.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:29.605
They're all the
same, and they're

00:24:29.605 --> 00:24:33.130
great because they're just
about different famous people.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.370
And there's like, especially
the "National Enquirer"

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:36.770
they have a life savers section.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:39.517
There is an article that Sharon
Stone saving a choking victim.

00:24:39.517 --> 00:24:42.100
But if you look at that, they're
no different than any website

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:42.850
that's around now.

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.610
It's just if it
happened today I think

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:48.210
there'd be a much more--
there'd be like Twitter,

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:49.710
there'd be any sort
of social media

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.570
where people could say
hey, let's maybe not

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:53.620
look at it this way.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.120
And I think there would
be more I guess just more

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.140
outlooks on something.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.400
Because it is very, when you
look at the magazines which

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.280
were really the place
people were going,

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:08.190
it's just insane how sexist,
how stupid some of these

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:09.350
spins on the story were.

00:25:14.729 --> 00:25:17.650
AUDIENCE: Hello, so I have a
bunch of questions I could ask

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.480
but I'll keep it
to the good ones.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.150
I noticed on the
Kickstarter page

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:26.490
that you mentioned
something about

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:29.280
like an ongoing investigation
of the way women

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.860
are portrayed in the media,
which you just kind of alluded

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:32.360
to.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.260
So it's interesting because
I think to a casual observer,

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.820
there's a certain it seems like
a very almost kitschy attitude,

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:44.880
but there is also a relatively
serious and important critical

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.650
attitude that now these
two exhibits are taking on.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:51.060
So do you think that it
would be dangerous to push it

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:54.300
more in that serious
direction in terms

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.850
of how you market it, or
is that part of what you're

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:58.690
trying to do?

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:04.690
VIVIANA OLEN: I think that
is not for us to talk about.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.600
We're going to bring the kitsch.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.550
And we think that's
a conversation

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.410
other people should have.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:10.700
AUDIENCE: Let the think
piecers think piece.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.825
VIVIANA OLEN: But we
definitely aren't smart enough

00:26:12.825 --> 00:26:14.075
to sound smart about it.

00:26:14.075 --> 00:26:14.530
AUDIENCE: Oh, I don't
know if that's true.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:16.446
VIVIANA OLEN: Well
we-- but yeah.

00:26:16.446 --> 00:26:21.210
No, I mean I think like
the idea of Tonya and Nancy

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:23.430
just being obliterated
by the media

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:27.370
and it just ruined their
lives in so many ways.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:31.780
And same thing with
the Olsen twins.

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.250
We want to bring the
fun aspect of it,

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:39.720
and we definitely hope it gets
people talking and thinking

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.910
about the seriousness
of it, because it

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:48.042
is so jarring to celebrate
or have fun in that.

00:26:48.042 --> 00:26:50.250
MATT HARKINS: Yeah, that's
basically the conversation

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:51.977
we had at first.

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:53.560
When we first watched
the documentary,

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.020
all we wanted to talk about was
how awful America treated Tonya

00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.729
Harding.

00:26:59.729 --> 00:27:01.270
But at the same
time, it's like, it's

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:03.420
kind of like it is
ridiculous to be just sitting

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.850
around and forcing people
to talk about this in we're

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:09.040
in the year 2016 or whatever.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.180
So it's just that mix of
both I guess, but that's

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:14.090
the fun of it is like--
and there's so much of it

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.540
happening now,
even the O.J. show.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.572
I keep calling it the O.J. show.

00:27:18.572 --> 00:27:21.030
That's like the whole thing,
and I just read some interview

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.590
with Marsha Clark
and it was insane how

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.780
she was picking her
words so carefully

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:29.180
because of everything she
had been through in the '90s.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.234
And I think it's fun.

00:27:31.234 --> 00:27:32.150
It's fun to look back.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.036
AUDIENCE: It's now getting the
Paulson treatment, [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:34.036 --> 00:27:34.480
Paulson.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.521
MATT HARKINS: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:35.521 --> 00:27:38.470
VIVIANA OLEN: Have you watched
the Monica Lewinsky "TED Talk."

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.845
MATT HARKINS: Oh,
that's so good.

00:27:39.845 --> 00:27:42.280
VIVIANA OLEN: It's
so crazy because she

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.670
is so careful about
every word she says,

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.960
because she was
bullied so, so hard

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.440
and she's had to go in
hiding for a long time.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:55.320
And now she's back and
she's just like every breath

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.920
is practiced because it could
just blow up in your face

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.650
again.

00:27:58.650 --> 00:27:59.864
It's just it's crazy.

00:27:59.864 --> 00:28:00.530
AUDIENCE: It is.

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:02.404
So second follow-up
question before I pass it

00:28:02.404 --> 00:28:03.682
to somebody else.

00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:05.390
You mentioned fan art
and I hadn't really

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:08.100
thought about that as
being the thread that

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.122
goes through both
of these things,

00:28:10.122 --> 00:28:11.330
although it's pretty obvious.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:11.871
I'm an idiot.

00:28:11.871 --> 00:28:16.040
But why isn't there
a museum of fan art?

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:16.890
VIVIANA OLEN: Right.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:18.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was
like people would probably

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:22.200
pay you to exhibit
there, so it could-- it

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.070
seems like it could be a pretty
good money-making opportunity.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.570
VIVIANA OLEN: That's
something we've

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:30.260
thought about where it's if we
did have a storefront it could

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:31.930
just be fan art.

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:33.502
And how fun would that be?

00:28:33.502 --> 00:28:34.210
AUDIENCE: So fun.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.560
VIVIANA OLEN: Oh, so fun.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.072
So give us a storefront
and we'll just do it.

00:28:40.072 --> 00:28:41.530
MATT HARKINS: We
had a conversation

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:42.622
about that one night.

00:28:42.622 --> 00:28:44.810
And there's some case,
it's Cheryl Tiegs

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:46.320
versus some artist.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.040
And it's about fan art.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.930
It relates about the
selling about fan art.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:52.010
I could be way off.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:54.468
AUDIENCE: You guys should get
in touch with Richard Prince.

00:28:54.468 --> 00:28:58.230
I feel like he'd probably be
down to go in on this with you,

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:01.400
because he loves
getting sued and yeah,

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.660
so reach out to Richard.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:03.998
VIVIANA OLEN: Yeah, we
haven't been sued yet

00:29:03.998 --> 00:29:04.444
and we feel like--

00:29:04.444 --> 00:29:05.930
MATT HARKINS: Yeah, but
a couple people have let

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:06.890
us know that they could but--

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.422
VIVIANA OLEN: Yeah, two people
said I could sue you but I

00:29:09.422 --> 00:29:09.921
won't.

00:29:13.395 --> 00:29:15.020
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah,
I guess while we're

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.519
waiting for more
questions, have you

00:29:16.519 --> 00:29:20.023
guys had any sort of
contact with Nancy's people,

00:29:20.023 --> 00:29:22.070
with Tonya's people?

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.954
VIVIANA OLEN: Nancy's
agency came by,

00:29:23.954 --> 00:29:25.120
this woman who worked there.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.240
And we were so
scared when she was

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.630
coming, because we were like
she's going to just have

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.985
a letter that tells us to stop.

00:29:32.985 --> 00:29:35.770
And I was like, I'll rip
everything down, I'm sorry.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.610
But she was so nice and great.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:41.760
And she said that
Nancy's agent, who

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:46.420
is also her husband, they run
an agency together in Boston.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.425
And she brought
us a lot of like--

00:29:48.425 --> 00:29:52.029
she brought us a signed
head shot and then--

00:29:52.029 --> 00:29:52.820
MATT HARKINS: A CD.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:56.710
VIVIANA OLEN: --a CD of
Nancy's only song she recorded.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.280
It's very housewives,
it's very fun.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.070
MATT HARKINS: "Love
Come Shining Through."

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.380
VIVIANA OLEN: It's called
"Love Come Shining Through."

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.012
We listen to it a lot, and
then a Halloween on ice DVD.

00:30:03.012 --> 00:30:04.470
And they were really
positive, they

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:06.640
were just like it's
absurd but fun.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:12.700
And then Tonya we did hear
from her through Terry

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:17.220
in New Zealand who said that
her godmother slash manager said

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.150
it's cool but she's
too busy to come,

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.006
which is all we could ask for.

00:30:22.006 --> 00:30:23.630
We just don't want
to make anybody mad.

00:30:27.702 --> 00:30:28.910
AARON ZEMACH: Good questions.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.400
VIVIANA OLEN: Come
by to the museum.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:32.800
It's fun.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.091
MATT HARKINS: Yeah, just email.

00:30:34.091 --> 00:30:36.610
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah, so if
people who saw this talk now

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:38.920
or who are watching
online later are

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.050
super excited to come see the
museum, what should they do?

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:42.790
What do they do?

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.870
VIVIANA OLEN: Oh, just
email us, or tweet at us,

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:51.150
or go to our website thandk1994
and there's a contact form

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:52.940
there.

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.760
And yeah we're around
most of the time.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.080
Just email as and come on by.

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:57.430
MATT HARKINS: And
we'll make it happen.

00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.260
There may be a chain
of like 20 emails,

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.986
but we'll make it happen.

00:31:00.986 --> 00:31:02.975
VIVIANA OLEN: Yeah.

00:31:02.975 --> 00:31:04.350
AARON ZEMACH: All
right, awesome.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:05.891
So if there aren't
any more questions

00:31:05.891 --> 00:31:08.456
let's thank Matt and
Viviana for coming and--

00:31:08.456 --> 00:31:09.456
VIVIANA OLEN: Thank you.

00:31:09.456 --> 00:31:12.094
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:12.094 --> 00:31:14.010
AARON ZEMACH: Thanks so
much guys. much, guys.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.010
VIVIANA OLEN: Thank you.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:16.400
MATT HARKINS: Thank you.
