00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.180
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.000
Movies go through a lot of changes to get made.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.600
A lot of rewrites, a lot of reshoots, a lot of re-editing,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.260
and often that affects what many people consider the most important part of the movie: the ending.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.960
It's the last thing people see, so 
most storytellers agree it's best to go out on top.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.420
But doing so isn't always so easy.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.040
Many movies either rewrite, re-edit or even reshoot their ending to make sure it has a satisfying conclusion.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.880
Meaning, there's other endings 
that changed a large outcome of the film.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.540
Sometimes the outcomes are so different, you just gotta say: "What the f*ck?"

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.400
Whether for the best or for the worst,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.380
these are the alternate movie endings that have us scratching our heads in total confusion.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.820
And we're gonna look at the top 11 of them here today.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.220
Why top 11?

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.740
Because the alternate version 
didn't test well with focus groups.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.000
This is the top 11 WTF Alternate Endings.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.260
[music plays]

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.420
Nostalgia Critic: Number 11.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.580
The Stanley Kubrick classic had people 
rolling in the aisles and questioning their safety.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.120
Not at all like today's politics...

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.480
But not many know that this movie
 had a very strange alternate ending.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.920
Believe it or not, this classic 
Dark Comedy ended with a pie fight.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.180
Yeah, no joke! Or...
Actually, too much of a joke as Kubrick put it.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.440
The scene was shot and edited but the director pulled it out saying it didn't match the tone of the rest of the film.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.200
Apparently, the world still blows up, but before it does

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.860
the war room has a battle of their own at the buffet table where things get out of control and they start throwing pies at one other.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.680
The footage is not available to the public, 
but there are plenty of pictures on set.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.540
While certainly an entertaining visual,
 it just seemed...odd.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.160
And this is coming from a movie where 
a guy rides a bomb down to the ground.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.340
In a film where a guy as strange as this could exist, 
this still just seemed one step too goofy.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.920
Super weird to say the least, such madness is so bizarre you wouldn't think it'd be possible to even be considered.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.360
"It is not only possible..."

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.100
"It is essential."

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.940
As the song goes: "We'll meet again" 
but not with this scene put in.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.240
Nostalgia Critic: Number 10

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.200
Yeah! I'm really going for the hits on this one!

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.420
The climax to this film, most people agree, 
is one of the highlights of the flick.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.900
Involving space travel, Duck Dodgers, lasers, 
lightsabers, Marvin the Martian, Spy Battles,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.600
but the original ending had almost none of that.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.300
And yet was somehow even stranger.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.560
It's a battle in the jungle where a 
magical device de-evolves our characters,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.840
resulting in Timothy Dalton becoming a monkey, 
Bugs Bunny becoming a cave bunny,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.660
and Tweety Bird becoming a dinosaur 
who ends up murdering our villain.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.640
"Uh. Th-Th-The, Th-Th-The...That's all, folks!"

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.780
[yelps]

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.940
That's kind of grim.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.100
As weird as this got though, it did have one essential line that would have made up for one of the film's biggest problems.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.000
The romance.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.700
"Dad, uh...this is Kate. 
Um, we haven't kissed yet or anything."

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.620
"Um, we don't really get along and 
we have virtually nothing in common."

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.480
Kate: "But this could be the one."

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.300
That line fixes everything!

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.040
The love story in this was done so awkwardly that nobody could tell if it was intentionally bad or not.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.160
This ending not only says that it was intentional

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.720
but is making fun of how little chemistry 
romantic leads often have in adventure movies.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.440
It suddenly made what was mostly painful to sit through a nice bit of trolling on the audience.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.640
So, how strange.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.080
We have one really great idea that would have
 saved one of the biggest problems of the film

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.800
in a clumsily handled climax 
that's inferior in every other way.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.920
I guess that's just part of the 
give or take process of filmmaking.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.100
Proving that sometimes you just gotta say:
"That's all, folks!"

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.680
Number nine.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.180
This Die Hard film ends like most Die Hard films do.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.300
Shooting some bad guys, blowing sh*t up and saying a bada** line in the process.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.520
"Yippie-ki-yay motherf***er."

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.900
But the original ending had practically none of that.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.820
It was bizarrely quiet, talk-heavy and 
even sophisticated.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.500
After Simon gets away with his millions, he tries hiding out only to be discovered by McClane.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.260
You see, he was apparently fired from the NYPD because they thought he was involved with the robberies.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.540
So, he has no trouble putting a 
Christmas present on the table,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.380
and yes, that would make this a
 Christmas movie like the last two,

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.920
and it turns out to be a rocket launcher.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.040
He turns the tables as he plays a game of 
"McClane Says."

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.340
When Simon gets an answer wrong, he has to fire the launcher, hoping it's pointing in the right direction

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.120
seeing how the aim was taken off.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.020
[explosive bang]

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.900
"I got a flak jacket."

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.480
"Yippie-ki-yay."

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.480
It's so different that a Die Hard movie 
would end this way.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.460
It's almost completely off 
from the rest of the tone.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.160
Some people say "That's what makes it cool!" 
"That it's a battle of wits in a totally different setting."

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.760
But others say "It's Die Hard!" 
"Give us the ***damn explosions!"

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.400
I just wanted in because there was a greater chance they would sing "Let it Snow" at the end like the last two.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.760
But I think that ship has sailed for that 
with the other sequels anyway.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.840
[tearful] Breaking a Christmas tradition!

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.140
Good, bad, hard to say.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.120
Unique from any other Die Hard movie?
Definitely.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.540
[chuckles]
"I'm sorry, that is the wrong f***ing answer."

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.040
Number eight.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.900
Okay, there's already some major issues with this movie,

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.700
particularly with the ending where Rose dumps 
a priceless jewel into the water.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.580
Yeah, f*** all the starving people that money could have saved, it belongs at the bottom of the ocean!

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.640
But unlike the original where she performed the act alone,

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.620
in the alternate ending, she has people around her frigging congratulating her for it!

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.740
After a reasonably funny line delivered 
by the late Bill Paxton,

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.900
"I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking and then jumps back on when it is."

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.640
Okay, that is legitimately well written.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:36.060
Rose spells out the ***damn message for us and it still makes as little sense as if she didn't say it out loud.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.780
"Only life is priceless. And...making each day count."

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.920
But what makes it stranger is she lets Bill Paxton touch the jewel, throws it over and then he laughs joyfully.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.720
[laughter]

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.460
Yeah, I'd be laughing like a madman too 
if I lost millions of dollars to a crazy windbag.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.040
This makes everyone look like a self-indulgent prick!

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.160
At least in the original, it was her doing it in secret.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.620
Here, "Oh, he figured out the meaning of life 
and you didn't! Teehee! HAHA!"

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.680
"God knows how much money 
wasted on this expedition there was! 
Your loss, financiers!"

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.380
They even throw in a ***damn shooting star, 
oh, blow me!

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.040
I almost get less fairytale sh*t 
from the animated Titanic movies!

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.900
Almost.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.740
Some say "Titanic" is a masterpiece, 
others say it's corny and clichéd,

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.160
but there's no arguing that this 
would've pushed everybody over the rails.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.200
"That really sucks, lady!"

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.000
Number seven.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.160
So, for the most part, 
this movie ends like in the original theatrical cut.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.280
The alien is destroyed, the baby-eyed splooge we're apparently supposed to feel sorry for is destroyed,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.700
and they return to Earth.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.160
In the alternate version though, they land on Earth.
In France for no particular reason.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.040
They pretty much say the same lines about being a stranger to this world when the big TWIST is revealed,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.960
Earth is blowed up!

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.680
You maniacs! I...totally don't get the point of this.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.460
Seriously, what did this add?
What does it amount to?

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.440
If we're able to send tons of people into space, hell, there's so many people even got pirates up there,

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.060
why the hell is Earth just left to rot?

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.120
Why was she even concerned about 
saving mankind from the alien?

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.960
It looks like we did a pretty good job 
destroying ourselves anyway!

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.060
Was this the prequel to Wall-E?

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.820
There's something always kind of nerve-wracking when you find out the action of the previous films 
adds up to nothing.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:45.140
I guess this technically started in Alien 3, but that was just a few characters, this is the friggin Earth!

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.300
The friggin Earth! What the hell?!

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:53.280
It's not like a ton else made sense in this movie, but this would have been the icing on the cake of pointlessness.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.220
You think you're a stranger, Ripley? 
Well, things don't get much stranger than this.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.160
Number six.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:13.800
Again, most of the overly complicated plot of this film is kept the same, except for one tiny detail:

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.200
Peter's father is still alive.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.380
WHAT?!

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:23.200
Okay, this movie tries to throw every 
plot thread it can at you and then suddenly,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.500
after the death of a main character, 
you throw this immediately after?

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.660
Dude, even comic books need a panel to breathe!

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.360
Richard Parker: "I had to die to keep you alive. 
I had to disappear to keep you safe."

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.000
Yeah, he had to stay hidden to keep 
Peter safe apparently.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.600
And only now, NOW is a good time 
to come out of hiding.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.000
Yeah, sure, not when his uncle died,
 he turned into a half spider,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.400
his girlfriend's father got axed and
 the city was in peril twice,

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.880
No, no, no, ONLY NOW was the time to reveal that!

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.900
Uh, a little late to your own funeral, don't you think?

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:57.780
Literally?

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.480
The sad thing is, we actually get some 
really good acting from Andrew Garfield.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.900
"What? What? Say it! Say what you wanna say!"

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.680
"What do you wanna say?! Where've you been?!"

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.440
"You're dead..."

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.420
Had the scene been in a better movie or, hell, even just a better time, maybe it could have worked.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:19.800
But as is, not only does it feel tagged on, 
it makes little to no spidey sense.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.240
Number five.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.280
Again, this one is very similar to the original.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:51.020
It's still a bunch of pilots led by the President of the United States to take down the aliens.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.220
But this time, there's a major change.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:59.460
When Randy Quaid comes in to save the day, it's not in a fighter jet, it's in his f***ing crop plane!

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.640
"It's okay, sir! I got it!"

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.340
"Alright, boys, this is it!"

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.420
First of all, that's the 
stupidest f***ing thing I've ever seen.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:13.980
Second, who the hell in the military just 
let him strap a missile onto his plane?!

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.140
Why, sure, you can attach that 
to your crappy crop duster,

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:22.920
it's not like we need every single missile available for this mission and you totally look ready for combat.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.780
Take her, she's yours!

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:30.620
In a movie that's already pretty damn corny, this is probably the corniest thing you can muster.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.660
Could this have been the moment that was maybe too corny and might have pushed people over the edge?

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:42.160
Hard to say. It still has Will Smith and landmarks blowing up that seemed to overshadow all the other corny things in it

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:48.540
But one thing's for sure, this ending deserves a hard
"UP YOURS!!!"

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.200
Number four.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:05.680
This ending is so bad, even the director admits it would have ruined the majority of good will the film built up.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:11.360
Everything goes pretty much the same as the original, with Dante closing up the store after a big fight with Randal.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:17.100
But the story continues as a guy walks in after he's closed, takes out a gun and f***ing shoots him.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.480
[gunshot bang]

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.920
He robs the cash register and Dante dies.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.580
Fitting?

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.960
Director, Kevin Smith, admitted 
he just didn't know how to end the flick,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:34.280
And after being recommended that he just cut the scene off a little earlier, he agreed it was a much better choice.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.460
Yeah, no kidding. This has nothing 
to do with anything in the rest of the film.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:44.820
It's not funny, it's not poignant, it's not even really that dramatic, it's just shocking for the sake of being shocking.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.940
Thankfully he caught onto it pretty quick 
and it's edited out.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.240
Because of this, "Clerks" remains one of the 
most unique and funniest generation movies.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:13:00.120
And granted, this probably wouldn't have ruined the film, but it would have been a pointless downer that would have diffused an otherwise hilarious comedy.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.140
What were they thinking? Who knows.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.980
But thank God they knew to cut 
the final shot...before the final shot.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.620
[gunshot bang]

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.720
Number three.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.940
The third film in the Evil Dead Trilogy 
knew how to keep the splatstick coming,

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:29.100
but there was a big difference of opinion between the director and the producer about how the film should end.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.880
Because the movie was marketed more 
as its own film and not third in a cult trilogy,

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.420
the producers said the ending had to reflect that.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.340
So, in the theatrical version, Ash is the hero 
saving the day and getting the woman.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.900
But if you know the Evil Dead movies, you know 
it has to end with Ash getting screwed!

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.000
So, in the alternate ending, he's given a sleeping
 potion which will knock him out for years and years

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.720
until he returns to his own time.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:57.480
But, like a doofus, he screws up and takes too much, resulting in him waking up in a future that's...

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.240
Well...similar to France in Alien Resurrection.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.620
"I SLEPT TOO LONG!"

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.760
On the one hand, the producers 
are kind of right about this ending.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:14.440
If this was a stand-alone movie, 
the theatrical cut would make more sense.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.800
But as a third film in a trilogy, 
the other ending makes a lot more sense.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.060
I guess it all depends on what you want to see, 
Army of Darkness or Evil Dead 3.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.340
Whatever version you prefer, there's an 
ending for each one and they're very different.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.300
So pick whichever groovy version you like best.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.160
Number two.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.240
The original ending to this movie 
has practically entered legend.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.860
It's amazing how different it is from the theatrical cut.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:58.920
Seymore saves his girlfriend from the killer plant, confronts him and ends up destroying both the plant and the evil offspring, saving the world.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.260
That seems about right for a 
musical comedy with a dark quirky edge.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.860
But the original goes as dark as it can f***ing go!

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.940
Seymore doesn't save his 
girlfriend from the plant, she dies!

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:16.160
And when he goes in to confront him, the plant wins, taking Seymore into his vines and eating him alive.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.500
Yeah, so, both our main characters are dead, 
killed in bizarrely horrific ways.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.040
But it doesn't stop there.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.720
The plant allows himself to be sold all over the world and when the time is right, they attack!

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:35.020
People are defenseless to stop them, the plant grows bigger and bigger until they completely take over and gobble up mankind.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.120
The end!

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.380
This ending is incredibly dark 
and remarkably depressing.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.740
On the one hand, yeah, this ending does 
kind of make sense for a campy horror film,

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:53.020
but on the other hand, the music was so bouncy and romantic and even...inspiring,

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.240
which, I guess you could argue just 
makes the original ending more funny,

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.800
but really, it's just kind of a big downer!

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.020
The theatrical version seemed to 
fit the film's identity a lot more.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:07.660
But...yeah this is one hell of a ballsy ending 
and you kind of gotta give it props for that.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.640
It pulled no punches, it went all the way.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.740
Would people have related to it if it was kept in?
Who knows?

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.040
But, it's out there for people to see and 
you can decide yourself which one is better.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:24.320
Whether it's the happy ending or the "good God, what the hell" ending, it's an out there experience all the way.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.780
And the number one WTF alternate ending is...

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.960
This is declared as one of the biggest 
"f*** you" endings if you're aware of the original story.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.000
I'll admit, going into the movie, I didn't know it 
or why it was hailed as a classic,

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.720
but once I discovered the original ending, 
it all made sense.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:58.800
In the film about an apocalyptic future taken over by mutant people, Will Smith tries to kill/study 
these mutants to find a cure.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:03.060
In the theatrical cut, he sacrifices himself 
to kill off them damn mutants,

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:07.940
leaving the side characters to give the cure he discovered to the military to start getting Earth back to normal.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.920
When I saw this, I remember it leaving no impact.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.940
What was the point in watching this? 
Why is it considered one of the great stories?

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.640
Then, I saw the alternate ending.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.400
It turns out, the mutant trying to get in 
was looking to save his girlfriend.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:27.300
Shocked that there's still humanity in them, 
Smith lets them go and realizes he's the bad guy.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:32.020
The new civilization that inherits the Earth 
isn't made up of his kind anymore.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:38.960
It's a brand new species and he's the Boogey Man, the rare breed that feeds of the majority of everyday life.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:44.740
He realizes, whether he likes it or not, 
he is the monster in the eyes of the new world.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.560
Holy sh*t  is that powerful,
thought-provoking and challenging!

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.200
Talk about an eye of the beholder 
message in a brilliantly done way.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:00.300
Even though he lives in this version, it's by far the downer ending that a film about the end of the world deserves.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.180
But nope, the theatrical version takes the entire reason the story was made and completely changes it.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:09.200
I guess stuff like that has been done before, 
I mean, look at the Disney films.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.200
They totally change the meaning 
of classic stories around,

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.640
but with this one, the tone of the film 
matches the original ending.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.640
It's dark, it's gritty, it's heavy, it's dramatic.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:27.120
It really wants you to feel like you're in a world that has been taken over by a new lifeform and your species is going extinct.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.820
The tone of The Little Mermaid is 
completely different from the tone of the original,

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.880
so we can buy the changes more.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.600
But with this one, of course, the original ending is better.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.320
Suddenly, everything falls into place.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:45.680
This isn't just shot like a summer action flick, it's shot like it has something important and timeless to say.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.960
But, the studio disagreed and said "Mankind rocks and we're gonna get our happy ending!"

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:57.380
What a letdown! What a betrayal! What a total castration of what made the story last for so many years!

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:02.740
This is the "not-so-great" ending given to a great story that should have us all saying:

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.760
"What the f***?"

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.920
Are there any that we missed?

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.020
Are there any that you think are worse?

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.180
Well, leave them in the comments 
below and share the "what-the-f***ery."
