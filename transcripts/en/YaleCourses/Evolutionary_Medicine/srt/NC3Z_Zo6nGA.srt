1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:06,040
Let's conclude our look at mental
disorders by examining autism and

2
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:10,570
schizophrenia, which are two of the
most troubling of the mental disorders.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,230
We're going to look at some evidence
that comes from genetic copy number

4
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:16,064
variants.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,390
Then we'll examine the CRESPI
Badcock hypothesis, which, uh,

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,560
is generated by cases of rare mutations
that cause mental disorders but which

7
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:28,820
they generalized.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,220
Then we'll look at a Meta
analysis of copy number variation,

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,920
and at size, at birth as a marker of
risk for autism and schizophrenia.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,400
The insight that led to the Crespi
Badcock hypothesis came from David Hague's

11
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:53,780
comments on the contrast between
Angelman and Prader Willi Syndrome.

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,020
These are generated by deletions
and duplications of genes. In fact,

13
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:06,021
these are generated by deletions that
produced copy number variation deletions

14
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:11,490
of genes that are imprinted differently
in mother or father produced behavioral

15
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:14,910
syndromes that contain clues
to broader mental disorders.

16
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,460
So Angela and and prod or willy are
deletions of genes that are imprinted

17
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,240
differently in mother or father.

18
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,000
When the maternally inherited copy of
a region of chromosome 15 is deleted,

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,220
allowing the paternally inherited coffee
to be expressed unimpeded by maternal

20
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:35,280
influence.
The result has angelman syndrome,

21
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,590
angelman babies demand
suckling crying frequently.

22
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,680
They're hyperactive,
they sleep very little,

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,770
they tend to be very happy and they
have a high risk 40 to 80% of autism.

24
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,740
So this high risk of autism is associated
with over expression of paternal

25
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,300
interest unimpeded by maternal genes.

26
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,150
When the paternally inherited copy
of the same region is deleted,

27
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,840
allowing the maternally inherited
genes to be expressed unimpeded.

28
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,690
The result is Prader Willi Syndrome,

29
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,320
Prader Willi infant suckle poorly cry
weekly are inactive and sleepy and have

30
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:20,970
high risk 30 to 70% of psychosis,
which includes schizophrenia.

31
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,020
So when maternal interest is overexpressed
unimpeded by paternal resistance,

32
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,980
the result is an infant that doesn't ask
for very much parental investment and

33
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:36,480
is at high risk of psychosis.

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,380
Yeah,

35
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,670
so similar patterns of deletion and two
other regions produce similar contrasts

36
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,950
in autism versus psychosis.

37
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:46,820
Yeah.

38
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,640
This led to the crispy Badcock hypothesis.

39
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,680
It sees a the a spectrum
ranging from hyper mentalism,

40
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:59,590
which is psychosis through a
normal area to Hypo mentalism,

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,150
which they define as autism.
If there is maternal bias,

42
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,180
then with small deviations
in this direction,

43
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,470
you have less demanding offspring and
lower birth weight and larger deviations

44
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:16,471
lead to psychotic type behavior deviations
in the autistic direction or caused

45
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:21,400
by paternal bias in gene expression.

46
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,080
Smaller deviations lead to more demanding
offspring, higher birth weights,

47
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:30,760
longer gestation times, larger deviations
lead to autistic type behavior.

48
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,750
This explanation is seen as being
layered onto the effects of non imprinted

49
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:41,260
genes and onto environmental effects.

50
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,620
So maternally biased imprints are seen
as part of a multi causal explanation of

51
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:51,811
psychosis and paternal imprints are seen
as part of a multi causal explanation

52
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,393
of autism.

53
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,140
Okay,

54
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,000
so in this view,

55
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:04,001
autism and psychosis are seen as
opposite extremes in the social brain.

56
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,440
If the human social brain is
overdeveloped, it leads to schizophrenia,

57
00:04:09,441 --> 00:04:14,441
bipolar syndrome and depression that's
associated with auditory hallucinations,

58
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,510
Megalomania, paranoia, delusion,

59
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,280
major depression or elation
thought disorders. And meniam

60
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,110
under development leading to autism
can lead to people who cannot speak,

61
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,650
who have a reduced sense of self,
no mentalistic skill.

62
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:37,550
That means very little
ability to understand what's
going on in other people's

63
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:41,480
heads. Very basic
emotions, mechanical logic.

64
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,650
And no goal pursuit.

65
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,550
So this syndrome is seen as
varying along a spectrum.

66
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,190
There was some support for this,
uh,

67
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,340
that comes from a Meta analysis
of copy number variation.

68
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,030
So this was carried out by
Crespi and his colleagues.

69
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,720
One Meta analysis of 18 papers found
a significant and striking contrast of

70
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:09,180
deletions and duplications
in Chromosomal region.

71
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:14,181
One Q 21.1 deletions raise the risk of
schizophrenia and duplications raise the

72
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:18,330
risk of autism.

73
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,080
So this is a highly significant contrast
in risks as mental disease where you

74
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:27,930
have copy number variation in
the same region of a chromosome.

75
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,980
They did seven such analyses for
including that one we just saw revealed

76
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,080
diametrically opposed reciprocal risk
that supports the idea that autism and

77
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:46,460
schizophrenia are in some sense opposite
ends of a single dimensional spectrum.

78
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,750
However,
in two are in two of these four deletions,

79
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,360
raise the risk of
schizophrenia and duplications,

80
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,200
raise the risk of autism in
two of those four deletions,

81
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,560
the risk of autism duplication's
raise the risk of schizophrenia.

82
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,460
So we're getting this diametrically
opposed effect. However,

83
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,170
in the other three regions,
uh, there was no such contrast.

84
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,490
So coffee number variation contributes
to risks of autism and schizophrenia,

85
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,570
but that's not the whole story for
each of those. Also has other causes.

86
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,630
When a mother's interests
are overexpressed,

87
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,910
infants tend to be born smaller and
earlier when the father's interests are

88
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,300
overexpressed,
infants are born larger and later

89
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,560
we can contrast Angelman, which leads
to paternal bias with prodder Willie,

90
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,130
which leads to maternal
bias and Beckwith Wiedemann,

91
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,380
which leads to paternal bias with Silver
Russell, which leads to maternal bias

92
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,890
and analysis of 1.7 5 million births
in Denmark between 1977 and 2009 showed

93
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:58,480
that infants with these
syndromes of maternal bias,

94
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,070
we're heavier at birth and had longer
gestation periods than infants with

95
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:04,900
syndromes of maternal bias.

96
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,690
If the imbalance input
parental transcripts that
influence size of birth was

97
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:11,800
expressed in the brain,

98
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,850
we would expect size at birth to be
associated with risk of mental disorder.

99
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:17,840
Okay.

100
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,840
This in fact is the risk of mental
disorder in that population in Denmark,

101
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,900
these are 1.7 5 million people.

102
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,370
The bars here in the histograms are the
numbers of births and you'll notice that

103
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:36,371
they're going up to a factor of this
would be a 100,000 so this is about a

104
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,310
hundred thousand births here
and this is relative risk.

105
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,820
So you can see that the relative risk
of psychosis is much higher for infants

106
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:53,900
that are small and much smaller.
For infants that are born in large,

107
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,760
the relative risk of autism is very
high for infants that are born large,

108
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,050
it drops and then it rises again in very,

109
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:07,610
very small infants. So there's needs to
be something about very small brains,

110
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,720
which is resetting the
circuitry, uh, and for,

111
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:16,380
for both kinds of disease.
So to summarize

112
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,650
in,
in this lecture,

113
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,730
we've looked at the connection between
genomic conflict in mental disorders and

114
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:27,520
it's made by inferring the imbalance
of genetic transcripts that influence

115
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:30,210
behavior is usually normal and healthy.

116
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,680
Autism and schizophrenia are
not thought to be selected,

117
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,160
but they are to be thought
to be pathological byproducts
of the disruption of an

118
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:43,890
equilibrium that usually
results in normal children.

119
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,980
This interpretation is supported both by
the contrast of rare monogenic diseases.

120
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,840
Such as proud or willy and angelman in
which either the maternal or the paternal

121
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,183
is deleted.

122
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,630
And this also was supported by the
Association of birth weights with disease

123
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:02,520
risk in an entire country.

124
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,920
The portion of variation in risk
of autism and schizophrenia,

125
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:10,710
that's accounted for by
this sort of explanation.

126
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:15,711
Genomic conflict is probably not more
than 2020 5% so this is interesting and

127
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:19,380
it's only a part of the story.
