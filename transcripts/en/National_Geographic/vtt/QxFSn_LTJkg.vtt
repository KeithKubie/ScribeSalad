00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:05.033
This mission has been
anything but straightforward.

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:07.300
We have to adapt, we
have to be agile to make

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.967
sure that we don't put a $3
billion asset in harm's way.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.667
If you want to effect
what's coming up you need--

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:17.500
These flybys are planned
out many, many months

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.867
and sometimes years in advance.

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:20.200
And so if something
is discovered

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.066
and we can do something about
it, we'll stop at nothing,

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.500
well work literally
day and night in order

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.400
to make these new observations
that the scientists you

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.767
know desperately
want to make happen.

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:36.433
NARRATOR: Pressure is building
to rethink the route map.

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:39.667
Immediately, the scientists
wanted to get much, much closer

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:42.200
to get high resolution imaging
but also move the closest

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.567
approach from the
northern hemisphere

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:45.266
to the southern hemisphere.

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.000
We finally arrived at a
solution and we lowered

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.800
the altitude from
1,000 kilometers

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.867
all the way down
to 165 kilometers.

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:53.867
NARRATOR: This
pass is seven times

00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:56.000
closer than the first flyby.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.400
The discoveries are
worth the diversion.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.333
This was the fly
by where we saw,

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.667
for the very first
time, these fissures

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:06.200
in the south polar regions.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.467
What was later named
The Tiger Stripes.

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:10.467
NARRATOR: The stripes
are gaping wounds

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:13.834
where pressure from below
opens vents to the surface.

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:16.266
Their marked by
whiter, fresher ice

00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:19.300
solidifying along the cracks.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.133
We saw about a
dozen or more jets

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:25.734
erupting 200 or more
kilometers above the surface

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:27.433
of the south pole.

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:30.667
We strongly suspected
that these were geysers.

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:33.700
That this was
vapor and particles

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.934
coming from these fractures.

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:40.967
NARRATOR: Nothing now is more
important than Enceladus.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:43.734
We wanted to go
back again and again

00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:47.600
to learn more and even
fly through and taste what

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.066
was coming out of those jets.

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:54.066
NARRATOR: The scientists
thirst for knowledge

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:57.800
can but up against the
need for spacecraft safety.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.333
And the guardian of
that is Julie Webster.

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:03.166
JULIE WEBSTER: The engineering
team is the 900 pound gorilla.

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:06.533
If we don't think
it's safe, we win.

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:09.900
But you're there to take science
so if you don't take the data

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.967
because you're too
scared you're not going

00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:14.467
to get what you're there for.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.367
BRENT BUFFINGTON: We had to
learn a lot about this plume.

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:17.400
What was it made of?

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.667
How dense was it?

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:20.533
Was a variable in time?

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.734
Variable in geometry?

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:24.767
NARRATOR: To answer
such questions,

00:02:24.767 --> 00:02:27.567
Cassini dices with real danger.

00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:29.133
BRENT BUFFINGTON: We're
talking about an object

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:32.166
that over a billion
kilometers from Earth.

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:36.934
We went all the way down to 25
kilometers from the surface.

00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:39.000
A very, very hard surface.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.867
Going in excess of eight or
10 kilometers per second.

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:43.567
So we're moving.

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.100
NARRATOR: The terrifying
maneuver reveals

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.033
how active this moon is.

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:54.200
We found over 101
geysers and material

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.100
coming from the fractures.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.667
And other teams found
that the vapor contains

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:00.567
simple organic compounds.

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:04.333
Those geysers are coming
from an ocean that is salty.

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:07.734
Comparable to the salinity
of the Earth's ocean

00:03:07.734 --> 00:03:10.333
and it's shooting in to space.
