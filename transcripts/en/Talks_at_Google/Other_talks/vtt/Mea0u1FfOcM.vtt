00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.570
DOLORES: Hello and welcome
to today's Tech Talk.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.790
I'm Dolores Bernardo and
I'm with People Development.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.380
I'm so pleased to be
introducing Bill George today.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.140
Bill is an inspiring leader.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.300
His work is often quoted in
Google's leadership development

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.550
programs as well as he's
been quoted in Meng's book,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.600
"Search Inside Yourself."

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.260
So lots of Google connections.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.800
Bill has spent over 30 years in
executive leadership positions.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.720
As CEO of Medtronic,
he built the company

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.470
into the world's leading
medical technology company.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.510
From a market capitalization
of $1 billion to $60 billion.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.610
So he knows business.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.170
Currently he is professor
at Harvard Business School.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.210
His 2004 book,
"Authentic Leadership"

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.670
was a "Business
Week" bestseller.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.510
We're lucky to have
him with us today

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.820
to tell us about
his follow on book

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.510
to authentic leadership,
"Discover Your True

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.630
North." which features over
100 profiles of leaders.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.600
In "Discover Your
True North," bill

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.180
has profiled what's changed
in the last 10 years

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.170
about leadership.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.670
On a personal note, I
turn to Bill George's work

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.910
on values centered
leadership whenever

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.510
I'm facing a tough challenge.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.150
And I know many
Google leaders do.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.600
"Discover Your
True North" offers

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.340
a concrete, comprehensive guide
to becoming an authentic leader

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.310
and reveals how you can
chart your path to success.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.624
So please join me in
welcoming Bill George.

00:01:37.624 --> 00:01:38.534
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:39.492
BILL GEORGE: Thank you.

00:01:39.492 --> 00:01:42.300
Here, you can take [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.600
Thank you guys for coming.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.200
I'm really excited
about being here.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.720
I want to do a talk today that
goes well beyond the book.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.970
I feel it's a privilege
to be at the world's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.120
most innovative company.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.286
This is something I've said
in writing about Google.

00:01:57.286 --> 00:02:00.860
And I really believe that,
that you are indeed that.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.850
I have great admiration
for your leaders.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.330
Eric Schmidt and
I serve together

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.780
on the Mayo Clinic board.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.440
And he is an amazing leader,
what he's done in this company.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.790
Larry and Sergey, of course, as
founders have stayed with it,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.280
have grown as
leaders, have wisely

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.260
looked to other leaders
like Eric to coach

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.170
them through the processes.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.480
And I think it's
pretty remarkable

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.030
how this company has grown.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.560
But now I think the
opportunities in front of you

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.396
as Alphabet are staggering.

00:02:29.396 --> 00:02:30.770
I mean, when I
first heard you're

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.347
going into self
driving cars I said,

00:02:33.347 --> 00:02:34.430
have they lost their mind?

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.210
And then I started learning
more about it and I said,

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.160
this is amazing.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.290
And that's just one
of many, many ventures

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.480
you're going in to.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.030
And so I think the future
is virtually unlimited.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.590
And your new
organization-- I wrote

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.620
an article a few weeks back,
I believe in really setting

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.110
the standard for all
innovative companies

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.430
because the toughest
problem that companies have

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.870
is how do you
sustain your growth.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.300
For 30 years, my role model of
a company was Hewlett Packard.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.716
I met Dave Packard
back in 1968 when

00:03:05.716 --> 00:03:06.840
I was leaving the Pentagon.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.550
He was coming in as
Deputy Secretary.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.740
He and Bill Hewlett taught
us a lot about management,

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.520
wandering around, being engaged.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.070
But the company lost it.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.977
They went over the hill and
today I don't think any of you

00:03:17.977 --> 00:03:20.060
would consider them a
terribly innovative company.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.590
It's true they're a big
company, but not innovative.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.570
So how do you sustain
that innovation?

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.110
Because oftentimes bureaucracy
pushes against innovation

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.600
and wants to kill it, and
it wants to starve it,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.290
and mavericks get pushed
out of organizations.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.090
And it's a tragedy
when that happens.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.200
And so I want to thank Dolores
for not just your introduction

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.820
but for inviting me
here, for Meng Tan who's

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.325
done so many great things here.

00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:47.170
I interviewed him.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.140
He's in the book talking
about his work on meditation.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.590
And also to Trudi McCanna.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.310
Where'd Trudi go?

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.580
There she is.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.830
For the work she's done here.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.580
And I think you've all
done wonderful work

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.800
in leadership development.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.930
But I want to talk about
something different today.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.304
It builds on the
book, but I want

00:04:03.304 --> 00:04:05.010
to talk about
innovation leaders,

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.300
because my conclusion
is that there

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.671
are literally tens of thousands
of excellent innovators

00:04:11.671 --> 00:04:12.170
out there.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.631
You see them throughout the
world, throughout the country.

00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:17.589
This is the most innovative
place in the world,

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:18.970
but there are lots
of innovators.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.060
And if you go to
any of the schools--

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.640
I teach at Harvard
Business School-- everyone

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.670
wants to be an innovator.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.753
And everyone at Stanford
wants to be an innovator.

00:04:24.753 --> 00:04:26.190
And it is a very
innovative place.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.570
And Caltech and I
went to Georgia Tech,

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.480
or I'll be later on, they
all want to be innovators.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.260
But the real gap is
with innovation leaders.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.930
Not many people know
how to lead innovation.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.400
So that's what I want
to talk about today.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.960
I'll talk a few minutes about
what the challenges we face

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.020
and how leadership has
changed over the last decade

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.350
and then kind of move on to what
it takes to be an innovation

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.305
leader in today's world, because
I think this is something that

00:04:55.305 --> 00:04:57.520
is not well understood.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.560
So let me start with
talking about how

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.420
leadership has changed
dramatically over the last 10

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.220
years.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.630
You know, when I was
growing up, leadership

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.750
was very hierarchical.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.130
And we had very highly
structured companies

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.480
like AT&amp;T and General Motors.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.860
And today it's all
about empowerment.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.520
And, to be honest, those of you
who are millennials or Gen Xers

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.637
like my family is
aren't going to work

00:05:26.637 --> 00:05:27.970
in an hierarchical organization.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.219
You don't want to be directed.

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.590
You want to have the freedom to
go out and innovate yourself.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.010
And I think that is-- why not?

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.849
But why do we create these
hierarchical structures?

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:39.140
They made everyone comfortable.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.880
Even the military's
gone away from it.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.410
So the second thing
is bureaucracy.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.650
No one wants to work in a
bureaucratic organization.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.000
How do you create a series
of interdependent units?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.625
You're trying to do
that with Alphabet.

00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:51.000
You've done it within Google.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.690
How do you have
interdependent teams

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.810
so you can learn from each
other, build on each other,

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.850
but have the freedom to go
off and do your own thing?

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.760
The third thing is
we've gone from an era

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.760
of limited information
to full transparency.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.490
Obviously Google's mission is
to support that and help that.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.220
But think what
happened last week

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.990
in the congressional testimony.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.680
The CEO of Volkswagen
US, after having admitted

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.970
that the engineers intentionally
falsified emissions tests

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.640
in cars for 11 million
cars, blamed it

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.320
on the lowest level engineers.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.210
I'm very cynical.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.668
I wrote in the
article that's going

00:06:26.668 --> 00:06:28.350
to come out tomorrow
on this subject

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.112
because we'll blame
it on the engineers.

00:06:30.112 --> 00:06:32.070
Let's forget about the
fact that the high level

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.210
executives support it.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.170
And he said, no, we're not
going to disclose any documents.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.480
They've committed a crime.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.590
That's the reality.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.770
It's against the law to
falsify emissions tests.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.920
And they're going to
be held to account.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.210
And you know that the
courts and the lawyers

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.870
are going to get out
all the documents.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.680
So today you have to
be fully transparent.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.320
I always tell CEOs
you're a public figure.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.569
Everything you say
and think in private,

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:58.110
it's going to be
outside the company.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.864
Everything you do
on your own time,

00:06:59.864 --> 00:07:02.030
somebody is going to take
a Facebook picture of you,

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.650
or a movie of you, or
tape record what you said.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.210
It's all public, so be
careful what you say.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.095
You just get over there,
that's the reality.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.970
And a lot of people at
heads of organizations

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.030
are very uncomfortable.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.864
But today we live in
a transparent world.

00:07:13.864 --> 00:07:15.030
I think that's a good thing.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.730
I think we should have access
to all the information.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.355
In my day, it was
all about charisma.

00:07:20.355 --> 00:07:21.730
So you didn't feel
like yourself.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.563
I'm not charismatic,
so I can't be a leader.

00:07:23.563 --> 00:07:27.260
Yeah, a lot of the best leaders
are not very charismatic.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.147
Do they have to be
like Jack Welch?

00:07:29.147 --> 00:07:30.980
Do they have to learn
to fake it to make it?

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.240
I don't think so.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.960
I think it's really all
about being who you are.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.220
It's being authentic
and being real.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.080
And that's what
leadership is all about.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.790
And then I think we were trained
in an era of self interest.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.390
Today's era, particularly
with Gen Xers and millenials

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.502
has really changed.

00:07:50.502 --> 00:07:52.960
I think we're in an era where
we're actually trying to make

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.840
a difference in the world.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.716
We're not just trying
to make a lot of money.

00:07:55.716 --> 00:07:57.965
You can make a lot of money
and live a miserable life.

00:07:57.965 --> 00:07:59.510
We could all do
well financially,

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.677
but that's not the question.

00:08:00.677 --> 00:08:02.843
The question is, what are
you going to leave behind?

00:08:02.843 --> 00:08:04.540
How are you going to
make a difference?

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.220
And how can you work
to serve others?

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.576
Because I believe the best
leaders are servant leaders.

00:08:09.576 --> 00:08:11.700
So let me site for things
that have really changed.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.410
The first of them
is globalization.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.040
We live in a global world.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.480
Why would we fight immigration?

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.300
We're a nation of immigrants.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.790
All of us-- except
if anyone in the room

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.940
is a pure native American-- have
all immigrated from somewhere.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.300
Our families have
come from somewhere.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.680
We live in a global world.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.000
Let's honor that global world.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.940
And the global
diversity that brings us

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.940
makes us that much stronger.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.590
The second thing, technology
has changed everything.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.370
It's brought us
this transparency.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.340
Its brought us
instant communication.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.150
It's brought us instant
access to what's going on.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.072
You can't just read
the newspaper anymore,

00:08:47.072 --> 00:08:48.780
you have to be on
Google News to find out

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.650
what happened in the last hour.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.120
Third, I think the millennials
have changed everything

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.270
because they are going to
not just ask for, but seek

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.520
out and demand
opportunities to make

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.750
a difference at a young age.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.400
I had my first general
management position at age 27.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.810
Someone gave me an opportunity.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.720
It was my first leadership role.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.000
But, I tell you, it was
the best learning I had.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.630
I made a lot of mistakes, but
it was the best learning I ever

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.730
had having that kind of role.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.480
And then finally back to the
whole immigration question.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.180
We should honor diversity.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.520
See, I don't believe in quotas.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.986
I never have believed in quotas.

00:09:23.986 --> 00:09:26.360
What I think you should bring
is people with diverse life

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.730
experiences around the table.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.230
I don't care what their gender,
their race, their religion,

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.130
their sexual preference,
national origin.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.130
That's not what matters.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.470
It's getting diverse
people around the table,

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.740
and I think you're going
to make better decisions

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.060
and you're going to
learn a lot more.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.970
If you're just with people of
your own tribe, so to speak,

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.350
you won't really learn about how
the rest of the world operates.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.250
OK?

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.520
So let me just compare the
old world we grew up in

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.490
and how it has changed
today in what I call

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.170
the authentic leader's view.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.310
And, unfortunately, we
haven't overcome our tendency

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.030
to maximize short term value.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.480
In fact, one of the clever
things about the Google two

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.510
class voting structure gives
you some freedom from that.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.830
But I worked a lot with DuPont,
and last week Ellen Kullman

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.400
resigned, was fired,
draw your own conclusion,

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.460
but it's a real sad
thing because she

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.060
was doing, in my opinion,
a terrific job for DuPont.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.570
But it is such a
short term world.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.070
She had a bad quarter.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.370
I can tell you as a leader,
you can have a bad quarter.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.760
You will of a bad quarter.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.760
You'll miss your budget.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.020
The numbers won't go your way.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.300
If you're generating revenues,
they won't always hit.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.070
There's no such thing as
up, up, and straight up.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.040
It's not like you're
on a rocket ship

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.640
to the moon with no deviations.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.061
You're going to hit bad times.

00:10:39.061 --> 00:10:40.560
Things are not going
to go your way.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.429
And, frankly,
that's a real test.

00:10:42.429 --> 00:10:44.470
So I think you've got to
build for the long term.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:45.910
How do you sustain success?

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.200
Achieve short term results,
but sustain success

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.800
for the long term.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.370
I think we've lived
in a world which

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.070
is very shareholder focused.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.020
And I think it's really
all about the customers.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.730
One of the people
I really admire--

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.240
and I focus in the book--
is Narayana Murthy,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.420
the CEO of Infosys, and he
said something very perceptive.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.160
He said, unless you
create sustainable value

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.060
for your customers, you cannot
create sustainable value

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.402
for your shareholders.

00:11:13.402 --> 00:11:15.860
In other words, unless you're
providing value to the people

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.640
you serve-- Medtronic at
providing genuine value

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.800
from its products,
its defibrillators,

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.020
its spinal products,
its diabetes products--

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.541
unless it's better than
any of the competitors,

00:11:25.541 --> 00:11:27.290
Medtronics is going
to go out of business.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.960
That's what happened
to General Motors.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.730
They lost 65% of
their US market share.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.370
And they wound up in bankruptcy.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.490
The reason was not because
of any exogenous factors.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.742
It was all because
they had failed

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:42.450
to meet their customer's
needs and no one

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.100
drove their automobiles anymore.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.320
So I think it's all about how
do you provide sustainable

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.610
value to your customers.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.830
Third, most companies have
been driven as multinationals.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.060
You have a strong center and you
branch out to the other areas.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.190
Today we're learning what we
can learn so much by engagement

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.020
of the markets.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.340
We let that come back here.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.010
And what people really
want is very different.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.590
Unilever, a great
consumer products company,

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.820
has got 65% of its business
comes from emerging markets.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:16.040
Not from non-US, but
from emerging markets.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.140
And they have a formula where
they go in and really learn

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.010
about the markets.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.170
So the soups people
want in Vietnam

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.750
are different than the
soups people want in China.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.500
Sometimes they come
up with great products

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.583
that are a result of that.

00:12:28.583 --> 00:12:31.740
And then they leverage
their corporate strengths

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.140
against those needs.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.960
But it all starts
with understanding

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.380
what are people's needs.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.320
And I know you face
some difficulties

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.390
in certain countries like China.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.490
We'll find a way eventually
I think through that.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.219
It's too important of a country.

00:12:45.219 --> 00:12:46.510
And there are ways around that.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.450
But there are differences
in laws and regulations.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.750
And so got to find
our way through that.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.714
Leadership is no longer
just from the top.

00:12:53.714 --> 00:12:55.880
And I think this company
illustrates that very well.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.820
We need leaders at all levels
and we need ideas bubbling up.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.400
I've found and I
tell leaders today

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.840
find out who the informal
leaders in your organization

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:05.990
are.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.530
Maybe they have
no direct reports.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.452
Maybe they're an innovator
in one of your labs.

00:13:10.452 --> 00:13:12.410
Those are the people I
learn from at Medtronic.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.330
Find out who those people are
and really listen to them.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.920
Let them guide you.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.500
If you do that, your
company is going

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.070
to be much more successful.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:21.930
I can tell you.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.580
So you need leaders
at all levels.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.440
We were just working on a
video for future leaders.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.850
It's hard to develop leaders.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.360
It's hard to develop
enough leaders.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.510
At Medtronic we never
had any bench strength.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.470
We never felt like we
had enough leaders.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:35.790
But you need to do
that, otherwise you'll

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.240
get very stale.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.150
And I think today you
need to really flatten

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.380
your organization
at the same time.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.570
So I think the key is
not getting tied up

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.760
in an internal focus
where all your time is

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.840
spent at internal
meetings or in meetings

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.375
to talk about customers.

00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:53.000
You got to get out
there and figure out

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.060
what it is that they
want, what do they do,

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.110
be a customer yourself, use the
products, but figure it out.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.240
When I get to Medtronic I
had 25 years of experience

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.820
in high tech industries
but zero experience

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.117
in the medical field.

00:14:07.117 --> 00:14:08.700
The way I learned
the business was not

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.340
from the engineers teaching me
how to design a defibrillator,

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.600
because I never
could do that anyway.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.380
I went out and gowned up and
saw between 700 and 1,000

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.810
procedures over 12 years
where I put on the greens,

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:22.670
go to Stanford University
Medical Hospital,

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.050
meet a doctor there at
6:30 in the morning.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.840
I went in to watch
one doctor do heart

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.920
surgery and another
doctor doing angioplasty

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.120
and a third doctor do
a different procedure.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.969
And so that's how I
learned the business.

00:14:33.969 --> 00:14:35.510
And it was the most
invaluable thing.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.340
And I came back and
said to our people,

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.490
you need to get out
with the customers.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.680
I remember one guy who
had a masters from MIT.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.790
And he said, look, I didn't
get a masters from MIT

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.684
to sit around some
hospital operating room.

00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:46.850
I'm here to design products.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.556
I said, how do you
know what to design?

00:14:48.556 --> 00:14:50.680
How do you know how people
want to use the product?

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.860
How do you understand it?

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.180
So I think today it's
having that external focus.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.820
I don't care what
business you're in.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.910
And, finally, you need rules.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:59.500
You can't run a
company without rules.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.666
You have to have compliance.

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:02.140
But the fewer rules, the better.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.760
What's important
is having a culture

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.160
that empowers people, that they
feel they can break the rules,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.262
go beyond the rules.

00:15:08.262 --> 00:15:09.970
If you don't do that,
you get very locked

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:11.760
into a stayed place.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.279
So here is four question
to ask yourself.

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:16.570
I'm going to talk more about
"True North," but how will

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:20.160
you discover your true north
as an innovation leader.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.090
How are you going to
continue to develop?

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.040
As leaders, we're no different
than musicians or athletes.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.150
We may have been born
with certain skills,

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.760
but we have to
continue to develop

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.800
our skills-- our capabilities.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.422
If you're going to
be a great cellist

00:15:35.422 --> 00:15:37.130
and go to Carnegie
Hall, you're certainly

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.340
not going to go there
without practicing everyday.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.840
And the same thing
is true if you're

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.210
going to be a tennis player
and play at Wimbledon.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.668
You're going to
practice every day.

00:15:43.668 --> 00:15:45.010
Well, same is true of a leader.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.260
And I say to everyone
in this room,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.900
get leadership
opportunities early.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:51.892
Jump in and take them.

00:15:51.892 --> 00:15:53.350
Even if you have
no direct reports,

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.950
take the opportunities to lead.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.300
You learn by bouncing
off the world.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.760
You learn from your
own experience.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.560
I haven't explained what a sweet
spot is and I'll come to that.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.790
But basically, are you
operating in your sweet spot

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.670
where you are highly
motivated by your work

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.384
and you're using your
greatest strengths?

00:16:09.384 --> 00:16:10.550
Don't play to your weakness.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.720
Surround yourself with people
who complement your weakness.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.840
If you're not a
genius in finance,

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.530
find yourself a good
financial person

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:19.460
to complement what you're doing.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.120
And then, finally, what's
the purpose of all this?

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.970
You're working, what,
60, 70 hours a week,

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.510
less time with families.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.530
What's the purpose
of what you're doing?

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.030
Because if you don't
have a purpose,

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.610
why would anyone
want to follow you?

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.320
But if you have a
clear sense of purpose,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.160
you communicate to
people, you get people

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.370
together out of common purpose,
passion, things they really

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:44.420
agree on doing, I think you'll
have an unbeatable team.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.240
So why does leadership
even matter?

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.480
In my experience, leadership
makes the difference

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.500
between success and failure
of all organizations.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.370
I don't know of any exceptions.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.350
And if I looked back
to the financial crisis

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.770
of '08, '09, or go all the
way back to the Enron WorldCom

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:02.500
disasters when 200 companies
restated billions of earnings

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.290
for each company, the reality
was every one of these can be

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.920
traced to failed leadership.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.359
It's not about factors
like credit default

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.750
swaps or subprime mortgages.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.170
That's just the vehicle.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.869
The leaders failed.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:15.630
Why did they fail?

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.390
I think they failed because
they put the short term

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.930
over the long term.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.480
They played the short term game.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.660
They were gamesmen.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.700
They played the short
term gain and they failed.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.319
You know, you can be a gamesmen,
you can play the game and you

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.440
can make it for a while,
but in the end you won't.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.190
People know whether
they trust you or not.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.344
People know who is
authentic and who's not.

00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:36.135
And if you're trying
to fake it to make it,

00:17:36.135 --> 00:17:37.550
you're trying to be something
different than you are,

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.369
in the end it'll
catch up with you.

00:17:39.369 --> 00:17:40.410
And that's what happened.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.868
It caught up with a lot of them
that were playing the game.

00:17:42.868 --> 00:17:45.240
And eventually it all
caught up with them.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.580
And I think the other thing is,
I think the cardinal sin, when

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.390
we're in leadership roles we're
called not to act in our self

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.260
interest but to act in the best
interests of the organization

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.460
as we see it.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.990
And if leaders on top think it's
their organization, it's not.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.365
Even if you own
the organization,

00:18:02.365 --> 00:18:04.820
you have the responsibilities
of all your employees,

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.240
all your customers, and
all your other shareholders

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.530
and everyone else who has
a stake in the enterprise.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.571
And this is an organization
where a lot of people

00:18:11.571 --> 00:18:12.160
have a stake.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.210
And so I think you
have an obligation

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.510
to put the institution's
interest first.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:18.460
OK?

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.201
So why did they fail?

00:18:20.201 --> 00:18:22.700
Leaders don't fail-- this is
going to surprise some of you--

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.100
but they don't fail for
lack of IQ in my experience.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.820
It's not the smartest
person in the room

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.150
who makes the best leader.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:35.240
What you need to have
is a mix of IQ and EQ.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.640
EQ-- Emotional Intelligence--
written about by Dan Goleman.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.520
Knowing who you are,
having a self awareness,

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.560
and how to read a crowd.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.730
Knowing how to
motivate other people,

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.840
how to build your teammates,
how to be authentic,

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.330
how to be real.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.930
And I remember
going to a session

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.150
35 years ago out
here in San Francisco

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.809
with the famous Buddhist
monk, Tich Nhat Hanh.

00:18:54.809 --> 00:18:56.350
And he said something
I never forgot.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:59.230
He said, the longest
journey you'll ever take

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:02.361
is the 18 inches from
your head to your heart.

00:19:02.361 --> 00:19:03.860
The longest journey
you'll ever take

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.170
is the 18 inches from
your head to your heart.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.961
The integration of your
head and your heart

00:19:07.961 --> 00:19:09.880
is one of the hardest
things you have to do.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.100
But I think great
leaders do that.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.160
And what does it mean
to operate with heart?

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.760
It means to have a sense of
passion for what you're doing.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.220
If you don't have passion
for what you're doing,

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.800
people aren't going
to work with you.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.630
Do you have compassion for
the people you're serving?

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.110
Medtronic is serving patients.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.860
You're serving people
all over the world.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.760
Do you have compassion for
those people and the challenges

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.410
they face?

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:34.826
Do you have empathy
for the people

00:19:34.826 --> 00:19:37.350
you work with who are going
through difficult times?

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.220
There was that long
article on Amazon.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.936
And whether that was
true or not-- this

00:19:42.936 --> 00:19:45.300
was in the New York Times--
they were putting forth

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.410
an organization that
didn't have any empathy

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:48.934
for their employees.

00:19:48.934 --> 00:19:50.350
If you don't have
that, you're not

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.517
going to sustain them and
retain them for very long.

00:19:52.517 --> 00:19:54.224
You're not going to
get the best of them.

00:19:54.224 --> 00:19:55.620
They'll look at as just a job.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.870
And, most importantly,
do you have courage

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.270
to go against the grain
and make tough calls,

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.870
make hard decisions.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.720
Those may be the best
decisions you ever

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.790
make where you have to
go against the grain.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.985
So do you have the
courage to do that?

00:20:07.985 --> 00:20:09.610
So if you think about
these qualities--

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.740
passion, compassion,
empathy, and courage.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.830
These are all
matters of the heart.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.540
We can't teach these
in the classroom

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.360
at Harvard or anywhere else.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.195
We don't try.

00:20:20.195 --> 00:20:21.820
What we do is we
provide an environment

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.140
where people can learn about
themselves in that environment,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.040
because it's critical that
you have those qualities.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.580
You learn about those by
bouncing off against the world,

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.511
gaining experience,
finding out what works

00:20:32.511 --> 00:20:34.260
and what doesn't work,
by offending people

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.170
and they'll tell you, by getting
open and honest feedback.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.070
Whatever it is, you seem to lack
passion for what we're doing.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.800
Or you seem to be totally
clueless about how

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.280
I'm feeling about this.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.360
Those are the qualities that
help make you a great leader.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.169
So you've got the IQ or you
wouldn't have been hired here.

00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:53.210
This organization is well
known for hiring people

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.530
with very high IQ.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.120
In fact, Laszlo Bock
has a great chapter

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.460
in his book on that about
how we hire the best people

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.010
and how important that is.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.630
But you have to develop
your EQ over time.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:05.800
So I want to talk more
about that as we go.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.980
My mentor was Warren
Bennis who died a year ago.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.060
And he said, I think,
some important things.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.460
He said the most dangerous
myth is that leaders are born.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.830
And that's nonsense.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.570
In fact, the opposite
is true-- leaders

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:16.686
are made rather than born.

00:21:16.686 --> 00:21:18.019
Now, I actually think it's both.

00:21:18.019 --> 00:21:22.360
I think all of you are
born with leadership gifts.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.600
Even if you have
no direct reports,

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.120
you have gifts of leadership.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.500
But you have to develop those.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.870
He went on to say
leadership is character.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:34.000
It's not just a superficial
question of style.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.770
It has to do with who we are
as human beings and the forces

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.610
that shaped us.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.350
And the process of
becoming a leader

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:44.580
is much the same as being
an integrated human being.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.890
My colleague,
Michael Porter, who

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.634
is the guru of strategy
at Harvard Business School

00:21:49.634 --> 00:21:51.300
and the most sited
person in the academy

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.300
said, unless you're
a good human being,

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.990
you can't be a
good leader, which

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.635
is a really interesting
statement if you think about it

00:21:57.635 --> 00:21:58.640
for him to say that.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.973
I said, can I quote you on that?

00:21:59.973 --> 00:22:02.130
He said, sure, go ahead.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.227
Well, what's the
missing element?

00:22:04.227 --> 00:22:05.810
We have plenty of
innovators, we don't

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.690
have enough innovative leaders.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:08.330
What do I mean?

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.457
Here are just a few examples.

00:22:10.457 --> 00:22:11.790
I mentioned Packard and Hewlett.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.860
Today we have Page and Schmidt.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.410
At Intel we had to Gordon
Moore, Bob Noyce, Andy Grove.

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:22.730
We got Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl
Sandberg, the early act one

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.370
of Steve Jobs, which is getting
way overplayed in movies,

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:26.946
in my opinion.

00:22:26.946 --> 00:22:29.070
And I don't know if we're
telling the truth or not.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.890
But, you know,
they aren't really

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:37.150
distinguishing between Steve
Jobs, act one, and what

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:38.029
he did in act two.

00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:39.570
And he went through
a tough crucible.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:41.528
And he learned from two
of the great innovation

00:22:41.528 --> 00:22:44.980
leaders in the world that
I visited with-- Ed Catmull

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:45.940
and John Lasseter.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.940
They're at Pixar
and they've created

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.597
the 12 most successful
animated films of all time.

00:22:50.597 --> 00:22:51.680
There's a reason for that.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.520
That's why Bob Iger at Disney,
who is a great innovation

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.520
leader, went out to
them and he said, hey,

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.100
you guys take over
Disney Studios

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.900
and reform it because we
got a moribund studio here.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.804
And so he recognized
those skills.

00:23:02.804 --> 00:23:03.970
They're not just innovators.

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:09.040
And they talk to us about how
they are leading and enabling

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.300
other people to innovate.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.930
And so I just got a few
other examples up there.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.430
I think in the medical
field, Roy Vagelos

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.380
was a great innovation leader.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.720
His successor, Ken
Frazier, is as well today.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.590
Arthur Levinson at
Genentech is one

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.170
of the most spectacular
innovation leaders of all time.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.436
You look at what Martin
or Gilead is doing.

00:23:29.436 --> 00:23:31.060
He's done some pretty
outstanding work.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.850
But what are the
characteristics?

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:38.000
I think that innovation leaders
need to be we leaders, not

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.837
I leaders.

00:23:38.837 --> 00:23:40.670
I think you're not going
to lead anyone just

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.200
doing it for yourself.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.940
You need to have, as I
said, the mix of IQ and EQ.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.350
And I think you need to
have passion, compassion,

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.650
and courage, and need
to be able to align

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:54.270
your teammates around
clear mission and values.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.130
Do you believe in the
mission of Google?

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.720
Do you believe in the
values of the company?

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.140
If you don't, you're probably
working in the wrong place,

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.380
just to be blunt about it.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.190
But if you believe that, that
gives you tremendous basis.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:07.130
And that's what you
as leaders need to do.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.950
And I think all good leader draw
upon the talents of their team.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.090
It's never just about
getting people to follow you.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.560
It's figuring out how can you
draw out the best of people.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.190
And this is really hard.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.110
And I've seen so many
organizations stop doing this.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:23.060
They protect the mavericks.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.760
At Medtronic, I
remember Earl Bakken,

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.314
the founder who founded
the company back in 1949.

00:24:28.314 --> 00:24:30.730
The first thing he talked
about, supporting the mavericks.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.457
And it's something we
really worked hard.

00:24:33.457 --> 00:24:35.540
Some of those innovators
in the labs who were real

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.650
mavericks, they didn't
follow the rules,

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.907
they were difficult to
deal with, a lot of people

00:24:39.907 --> 00:24:41.865
didn't like them, they
wanted to force them out

00:24:41.865 --> 00:24:44.242
of the organization, and I
found I had to get in there

00:24:44.242 --> 00:24:44.950
and support them.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.200
They wanted to
cut their budgets.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.616
They wanted to do everything
negative because these people

00:24:48.616 --> 00:24:52.460
were a threat, but they actually
produced the best innovations

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.710
Medtronic came up with in the
13 years that I was there.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:57.380
And I've seen
organizations, in fact,

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.100
my successor
unfortunately squeezed

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.185
out most of the mavericks.

00:25:00.185 --> 00:25:02.060
I mean, you don't have
to fire them, you just

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.970
tell them we don't want you to
do anything creative anymore.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.400
They'll leave on their own.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.450
And I think it's
really important

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:09.550
that that doesn't happen.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.508
It's not the top management
that often does it.

00:25:11.508 --> 00:25:14.020
Oftentimes it's down here
and no one even sees it.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.670
They don't do it by
intent, they just

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.740
make the environment so
bureaucratic and so negative

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.540
that they leave.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.100
And I think it's a great
loss to your organization

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.300
when that happens.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.940
Collaboration is
key, but I think

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.470
what's really important
is yes we have

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.820
to make the numbers, and
particularly people on top

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.430
they must make the numbers,
but you don't do it

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:36.650
by cutting the long term.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:40.190
I used to say to any leader,
if they made their numbers

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.560
by cutting out the
investments, they

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.930
were not going to get their
bonuses because that was not

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:45.520
acceptable.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.460
To cut out the ventures, to cut
out emerging market innovation,

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.480
to cut out R&amp;D was
not acceptable.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.490
And new marketing
ideas, that they

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:58.880
had to make it to good
management, good leadership,

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.620
but not in that way.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:04.600
Well, I have mentioned
that the longest

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.047
journey you'll ever take
I think is from your head

00:26:07.047 --> 00:26:07.630
to your heart.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:12.130
But also that journey from being
an I leader to a we leader.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:13.750
So I want you to
think about yourself

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.770
as you look at this chart.

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.330
And how do you measure up
on the we leadership side?

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.540
I'm going to focus on that.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:23.440
Are you authentic?

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.110
Are you real?

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.880
Can you feel comfortable
being yourself,

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.770
or are you trying to be
something you're not?

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:31.730
And I think that's all people
can ask from you as a leader,

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:35.100
that you be yourself.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.890
Do you do your decisions
based on purpose,

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:40.875
or are they based
on serving yourself?

00:26:40.875 --> 00:26:43.100
And are you willing to work
together and bring people

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.110
together for the mission
focused around the values

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:47.970
of the organization?

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:49.320
What's it mean by humility?

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.460
You know, there are
times when you have

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:52.990
to make really hard decisions.

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.150
I don't think this is about
having any kind of fixed style.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:56.733
I think you have
very flexible styles.

00:26:56.733 --> 00:26:59.110
There are times you
have to let people go.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.840
I don't think that's
lacking humility.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.850
But you kind of know
it's not about me.

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:05.910
It's about us and about this
team who has produced this.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.160
Who is the person here
that created Google Maps?

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.660
I understand they
started doing this

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.544
on their own time in their
spare time and they're 20% time.

00:27:12.544 --> 00:27:13.710
What a brilliant innovation.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.280
How could we survive
today without it?

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.570
That's the kind of thing.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.694
It didn't come from on top
that Larry Page had this idea

00:27:20.694 --> 00:27:21.610
sitting in his office.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.940
He designed the whole thing
at night and passed it on.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:24.440
No.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.970
It came gurgling up from
people taking their time

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.570
to do these kind of innovations.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:32.940
And that's where a lot of
the breakthroughs come from.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.364
But that requires
certain humility

00:27:34.364 --> 00:27:36.780
to recognize that I don't have
all the great ideas, so I'm

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.370
going to coach and
mentor other leaders.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:42.200
I'm not going to direct them,
I'm going to mentor them.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.480
I've had the privilege
of coaching hundreds

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.624
of leaders from MBAs to CEOs.

00:27:47.624 --> 00:27:49.040
And I consider it
a real privilege

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.870
because all mentoring
is a two way street.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.690
And, you know,
it's really about,

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:56.510
as I said, serving customers
and empowering people.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.310
But, in the end,
who gets the credit?

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:00.740
Do you take credit for all
the things your people do?

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.460
Or do you pass them
on to other people?

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.180
Does the team get the credit?

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.650
And what you found
with a lot of I

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.150
leaders is they take the credit.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.400
And a lot of people get
really annoyed because they're

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.800
taking the credit for
what other people do.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.050
So what's an authentic leader?

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:16.710
Authentic leaders align
people around shared mission

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:17.660
and values.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.600
At Medtronic, our mission
was to restore people

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.180
to full life and health.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.554
And that became what
was really important.

00:28:25.554 --> 00:28:27.720
And I say to people, if
that doesn't turn you on, go

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.095
to work for Merrill Lynch and
trade stock, because you'll

00:28:30.095 --> 00:28:31.120
make a lot more money.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.954
But if that turns you on, you
can't have a better career

00:28:33.954 --> 00:28:35.870
than restoring people
to full life and health.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:39.290
Everything we did was focused
on that singular mission.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.840
And that defined the values.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.950
Did it serve the patients?

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:47.342
Was that product good enough
to put in my mother or my son?

00:28:47.342 --> 00:28:49.050
And if it's not, it
doesn't go to market.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:50.720
It doesn't pass
our quality tests,

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.510
it doesn't pass our design test.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:56.220
It's about empowering
other people to lead,

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.380
not exerting power over them.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.370
And it's about serving
all your stakeholders.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.021
I'm not a great
believer that you just

00:29:02.021 --> 00:29:03.020
serve your shareholders.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.394
I think the
shareholders are only

00:29:04.394 --> 00:29:06.690
served because we create value.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.050
Why do you have such
great advertising revenues

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.190
here at Google?

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.220
Because you're obviously
serving customers

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.350
who are advertising with you
because you're getting access--

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.750
I advertised-- give
them access to what they

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.090
want to get the information.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.640
And people want to see that.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.860
And it's a great
platform for doing it.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.600
Better than going on NBC or
something like that today.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.530
And so the end we know we
have sustained results.

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.480
But I really believe
that in the end,

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:36.650
authentic leaders
are servant leaders.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.520
So what's your true north?

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.220
I think your true
north is really

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.100
your essence of who you are.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.630
It's your most
deeply held beliefs.

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:47.954
The values and the
principles you lead by.

00:29:47.954 --> 00:29:49.120
So think about those things.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.994
If I ask you to do that,
you could write down

00:29:50.994 --> 00:29:53.840
what it really is for you.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.400
The problem is you
get pulled off course.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.890
You get seduced or pressured off
to go in a different direction

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:03.630
and you lose sight
of why you're there.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:05.730
See, each one of you--
there's no such thing

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.510
as two people having
the same true north.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:10.970
We all have our own
unique view of who we are.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:12.800
And it comes out of
our life stories.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.690
It comes out of the
difficult times we face.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:18.810
It comes out of times
that we had lost our way.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:21.660
It really gets to the
essence of who we are.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.590
And it's in those
difficult times in life

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:25.220
you learn who you
are when you had

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.720
to fight your way
through something,

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.303
you were raised in
a difficult family,

00:30:28.303 --> 00:30:31.810
you had a health problem, you
were confronted with poverty,

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:35.480
or whatever it was, that's
when you learn who you are.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.400
Or you really lost sight
of your true north.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.024
I'll talk about a
time in just a minute

00:30:39.024 --> 00:30:42.587
where I lost sight of
what my true north was.

00:30:42.587 --> 00:30:44.920
But, see, I think the tough
things today are seductions.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.150
And the three main seductions
are money, fame, and power.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:51.180
Abraham Lincoln once said,
if you want to test a person,

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.699
give them ultimate power.

00:30:52.699 --> 00:30:54.740
And that's putting them
in a difficult situation.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.370
You'll find out how they use it.

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:58.220
And the people that
don't have a sense

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.530
of who they are overuse that
power and they self destruct.

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:02.090
We know that.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.080
We know that people
with ultimate power

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.130
do self destruct.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.810
And so you get
pressured off course

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.790
because you're not willing
to face difficult situations.

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:13.417
See, I think it all starts
with your life story.

00:31:13.417 --> 00:31:15.125
You look at a guy like
Howard Schultz who

00:31:15.125 --> 00:31:17.435
grew up in the Bayview
housing projects.

00:31:17.435 --> 00:31:18.810
He takes his
daughter back there.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.101
He's proud of where he grew up.

00:31:20.101 --> 00:31:22.080
It was a terrible place.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.520
He had to walk up 12 flights
of stairs to his apartment

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.770
because the elevators didn't
work and there were drugs

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:30.525
and there was crime and
his father lost 30 jobs.

00:31:30.525 --> 00:31:33.580
As Howard later
said, 30 rotten jobs.

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.940
They never had any money.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.530
In fact, when his father lost
his job one time and his mother

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:41.820
was seven months pregnant,
they couldn't pay the bills.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.670
He couldn't wait to
get out of there.

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.350
Howard said the
saddest day of his life

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:47.430
was the day his father
died because he'd

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.850
been very critical of his
father for being negative,

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:52.550
not fighting his
way through, and not

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:53.950
taking more responsibility.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:55.450
He said he realized
the die he died,

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:57.020
his father never had a shot.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:00.840
He said, my dream is to create
a company that my father would

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.144
be proud to work at.

00:32:02.144 --> 00:32:04.060
And that's what he's
tried to do at Starbucks.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.280
Try to create a
company where everyone

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.590
is proud to work there.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:09.630
And never lose sight of
why we're in business.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.180
We're only make a couple
of bucks above minimum wage

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.980
as a barista, but we treat
customers really well

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.350
because we enjoy working here.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:19.670
The company gives us stock
in a rapidly growing company.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.790
The company gives us healthcare,
even though I work part time

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.910
here for 30 hours a week,
they give me healthcare.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:28.820
So Howard created those
things all coming out

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.276
of his life story.

00:32:30.276 --> 00:32:31.650
And he never loses
sight of that.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:34.640
But he also has a sense of fear.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.970
We all have that.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.330
We have the positive
narrative about the dream

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:39.740
of creating a great company.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.390
We also have a
negative narrative.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.192
I could feel like
my old man did.

00:32:43.192 --> 00:32:44.525
Whole of Starbucks it collapsed.

00:32:44.525 --> 00:32:47.220
He went back in there
about six, seven years ago

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.900
because he was afraid
it was collapsing.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.090
And, by the way, it's
done spectacularly well.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:53.950
Howard said, I never lose
sight of that fear of failure.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:55.390
And that drives me, as well.

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:59.210
So there are negative factors
that drive him, as well.

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.450
But it all comes out
of his life story.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:05.670
And many of us face
very difficult crucibles

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:06.730
in our lives.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.640
Very difficult times
we go through when

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.460
things don't go our way.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.570
Early in my life, I thought
I wanted to be a leader.

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.900
I was kind of making up
for my father's failures

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.290
in leadership roles.

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:20.670
He wanted me to be head
of a major company.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:23.980
As a kid, I was never
selected to lead anything.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.201
I joined everything, never
selected to lead anything.

00:33:26.201 --> 00:33:28.200
Thinking I could be a
leader I never was chosen.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.090
I never liked student council.

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:33.500
I never was chose as
head of an organization.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.030
I was good enough tennis
player to play college tennis

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:39.320
and I wasn't even co-captain
of my high school tennis team.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.720
So, finally, my senior year
I put my hat in the ring

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.547
against one other guy to run
for office against president

00:33:44.547 --> 00:33:45.380
of the senior class.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.310
I was clear I was a
better leader than he was.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:48.300
I was better organized.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.710
I knew what to do.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:51.420
The votes came in.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.850
I lost by margin of two to one.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.030
So, you see, no one thought
I was a great leader.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:59.370
So I went 800 miles away from
my hometown to Georgia Tech

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:00.092
to school.

00:34:00.092 --> 00:34:02.050
I could have gone to
Michigan just across town,

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.180
but I was really
escaping myself.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.440
And I was trying to
find an opportunity

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.560
to get a fresh start.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.810
But I didn't realize that
wherever you go, there you are.

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:15.600
If you change venues-- you could
leave Google and go somewhere

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.638
else-- but if you take
your same self with you,

00:34:17.638 --> 00:34:18.679
just repeat what you did.

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:20.150
And that's what I did.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:24.800
Georgia Tech I ran for office
six times, lost all six.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.080
And I'll never forget,
a group of seniors

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.667
took me aside and said,
Bill, no one is ever

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:32.000
going to want to work with
you, much less be led by you,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.820
because you're moving
so fast to get ahead.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.800
You don't take time
for other people.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.060
And that was like a
blow to the solar plexus

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.909
because I realized
that I was never

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:41.243
going to have the opportunity.

00:34:41.243 --> 00:34:42.909
And I had to do a lot
of soul searching.

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:44.190
I spent a whole year doing that.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:45.856
I eventually came
back and held a number

00:34:45.856 --> 00:34:47.370
of leadership positions.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.650
And then I had a second set
of crucibles in my early 20s.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:52.412
My mother died one day.

00:34:52.412 --> 00:34:54.620
And I'd been very close to
my mother, but never close

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.161
to my father.

00:34:55.161 --> 00:34:56.790
I'm an only child
of older parents.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:59.450
And she died very suddenly
of a heart attack.

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:02.800
And I went into a period of
mourning and depression--

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.470
not quite depression,
but certainly

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:09.240
a real difficult
grieving process.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.917
And I recovered from my
mother's death-- this is 1968,

00:35:13.917 --> 00:35:15.750
about a year and half
after my mother died--

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:17.880
I fell in love, got
engaged to be married.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.380
I was living in Washington
with a bunch of guys.

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:23.220
I fell in love with a woman
who lived three blocks away.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.110
She was from Georgia.

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:27.490
And I remember we got
engaged to be married.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:29.020
It was August of '68.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:32.735
And she'd gone home to Georgia
to prepare for the wedding.

00:35:32.735 --> 00:35:34.110
She'd been having
some headaches,

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.590
we didn't think much of it.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:38.190
And she was preparing
for the wedding.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:42.080
And the very next
morning I learned

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.340
that she'd died of a
malignant brain tumor.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.680
It was three weeks to the
day before our wedding.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.979
And I was totally devastated
because I could explain--

00:35:50.979 --> 00:35:53.020
even though I am a person
of faith-- my faith had

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:53.830
no explanation.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:55.320
I could explain
my mother's death

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.320
in the natural order of things.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.470
Some of you in this room
may have lost parents.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:02.349
It's sad, but is the
natural order of things.

00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:04.390
I just got word of somebody
we were very close to

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:08.430
lost an 8-year-old daughter-- we
have a granddaughter that age--

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.680
in a skiing accident yesterday.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.580
And it's just tragic.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:15.377
But I'd lost my fiance and
she was doing great work

00:36:15.377 --> 00:36:16.960
in the Appalachia
Regional Commission.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.650
What happened up there?

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:24.360
And I lost and I really
felt like I was lost.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.490
So that was my crucible.

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:28.040
A pair of crucibles.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.920
But one of the
things I realized--

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.490
and I would say
this to all of you--

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:33.100
I wanted to change the world.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.790
But you can't change the world.

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:36.040
You want to eliminate poverty.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.150
You want to eliminate
all health in the world.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.720
Maybe some people can.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.240
But, I tell you, the biggest
impact you can have to do

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.490
are the people all around you.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:46.682
The people you touch every day.

00:36:46.682 --> 00:36:48.140
And I had to learn
that because I'd

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.800
been looking so far ahead
that I wasn't thinking

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.970
about every single action.

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.803
The people you have the
greatest impact with

00:36:52.803 --> 00:36:56.090
are the people you work with
every single day of your life.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:57.950
And that's what I want
you to think about.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:02.950
So my defining leadership
experience came in 1988.

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:05.090
I was en route to
the top of Honeywell.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:07.210
I was one of two leading
candidates to be the CEO,

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:08.980
maybe the leading candidate.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:11.860
My father always wanted me to
be the head of a great company.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.350
I thought Honeywell
was a great company.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:16.180
My wife had a great job.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.190
But I was doing a
series of turnarounds.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.010
Instead of being the
growth oriented leader

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:22.710
I wanted to be, I was trying
to turn businesses around.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:25.010
And I got through one set of
them in about three years,

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:27.270
then came another set
for a year and a half,

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:29.090
and then they gave
me a third set.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:31.730
And one day I'm driving home--

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:32.824
[TONE]

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:34.590
You OK here?

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:38.761
I have to tell you at this
time that I have a good life.

00:37:38.761 --> 00:37:40.010
I had two kids in high school.

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:42.790
My wife has a good job.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:43.850
And I'm driving home.

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:45.310
I have a good career.

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:46.320
We have lots of friends.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.310
Driving home and I look at
myself in the rearview mirror

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:50.720
and what did I see?

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.096
A miserable person.

00:37:52.096 --> 00:37:53.010
Me.

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:54.990
How can you be
miserable when you

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:56.840
got everything going for you?

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.930
I was miserable inside
because I was losing it.

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:00.900
I was losing site
of my true north.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.020
I didn't use that
phrase in those days,

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:05.160
but I was losing site
of who I am as a person.

00:38:08.064 --> 00:38:09.980
And I went home and told
my wife, Penny, this.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.800
Penny has always been my
closest, confident advocate.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.770
I met her the year
following my fiance's death.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.020
And we've been together--
we just had our 46th wedding

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:17.894
anniversary.

00:38:17.894 --> 00:38:19.310
But I told her
what I was feeling.

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:20.740
And she said, Bill,
I've been trying

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:21.970
to tell you that for a year.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.299
You just refused to listen.

00:38:24.299 --> 00:38:26.840
See, it's the person closest to
you that sees you as you are.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.590
And I couldn't fake her.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.710
I couldn't fake it out with her.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:32.307
And so I have a men's group.

00:38:32.307 --> 00:38:33.890
Actually, you guys
won't believe this.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:39.410
We have a meeting every
Wednesday morning 7:15 to 8:30.

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:40.920
Eight of us the last 40 years.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.917
We had four of us that
started, four have been added.

00:38:43.917 --> 00:38:45.250
Then a couple of them went away.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.070
One died.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:47.680
Anyway, we have eight of us.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.040
No change in the last 20 years.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.300
So I went and told
my men's group.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:51.920
And they said, Bill, you turned
down Medtronic three times.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.370
Why'd you do that?

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:55.649
And I said, you know, well--
listen to the ego here--

00:38:55.649 --> 00:38:57.065
I always thought
I was going to be

00:38:57.065 --> 00:38:58.880
head of a really large company.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.467
Medtronic is a mid-size company.

00:39:01.467 --> 00:39:03.550
And they said, why don't
you give it another shot?

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.590
So I called Win Wallin,
the CEO, back, I said,

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:07.964
is the job I just turned down
four months ago still open?

00:39:07.964 --> 00:39:09.800
He said, yeah, but we
got other candidates.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.540
You're going to
have to get in line.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.170
I remember talking
to the founder.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:15.654
And eventually I accepted the
job in the number two role

00:39:15.654 --> 00:39:17.320
for a business about
a third of the size

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.850
I was running at Honeywell,
about a quarter as many people.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:23.549
And I had to overcome some
ego challenges with that.

00:39:23.549 --> 00:39:24.340
But, you know what?

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.787
I walked in there and I
felt like I was coming home.

00:39:26.787 --> 00:39:28.620
Kind of like how I feel
when I come in here.

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.390
To a group of people that I
can really learn from you,

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:34.620
and we can come together and
really make a difference.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.120
And I can tell you
that the 13 years

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.690
I spent there were
the greatest 13 years

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:39.889
of my professional career.

00:39:39.889 --> 00:39:41.930
And everything that has
happened to me since then

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:44.140
opened up because of that.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.630
And I wasn't passionate
about Honeywell's business.

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.327
I loved being head
of a global company.

00:39:48.327 --> 00:39:49.660
I didn't even love the business.

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:50.985
I didn't like going
down to the boiler room

00:39:50.985 --> 00:39:52.736
and looking at valves
and stuff like that.

00:39:52.736 --> 00:39:55.318
And I wasn't interested in the
aerospace and defense business.

00:39:55.318 --> 00:39:57.570
And that was a third
or 40% of the business.

00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:59.153
And that's part of
what I was running.

00:39:59.153 --> 00:40:00.529
That wasn't where
my passion was.

00:40:00.529 --> 00:40:01.944
My passion was
making a difference

00:40:01.944 --> 00:40:03.350
in the lives of
people we served.

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:04.516
And I hadn't seen Medtronic.

00:40:04.516 --> 00:40:08.100
I had to close that Honeywell
door behind me psychologically

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.360
before I could open
the door to Medtronic

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.940
and see the opportunity
right there.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.470
So I resigned from Honeywell
and went to Medtronic,

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:17.380
and it was the best
thing I ever did.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.300
I just wanted to show
you my crucible and my,

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.612
what I call, defining
leadership experience,

00:40:21.612 --> 00:40:23.320
because that opened
up everything for me.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.590
And sometimes midlife you
hit those kind of things.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.870
You hit the wall.

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:29.216
And you hit those
difficult times,

00:40:29.216 --> 00:40:30.840
but you can't see
the opportunity right

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:31.540
in front of you.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.160
You can't see it's right there.

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.210
And that's what I had to do.

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:36.680
I guess we're back live.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.610
So quick comment on Steve Jobs
from his Stanford commencement

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:40.297
address.

00:40:40.297 --> 00:40:42.630
You can't connect the dots
of your life looking forward,

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:44.540
you must connect
them looking back.

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:47.070
See, you can see the
connecting the dots

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:50.810
in my own life between losing
those elections because of ego

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:54.810
and being ego driven to
try to be CEO of Honeywell

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:56.830
when I didn't love the business.

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:58.420
Your time is limited,
so don't waste

00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:59.670
it living someone else's life.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:01.628
Why am I trying to carry
out my father's desire

00:41:01.628 --> 00:41:03.440
to have me be CEO
of a large company?

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:07.300
I mean, that wasn't my
desire, that was his desire.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.450
My poor, deceased father.

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:10.450
Don't let the noise of
other people's-- it's one

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:11.710
of the hardest things to do.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:13.542
Everyone is telling
you to go left,

00:41:13.542 --> 00:41:15.000
and you know you
ought to go right.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.249
And everyone is going to be
mad at you for going left,

00:41:17.249 --> 00:41:18.480
but you make that turn.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.980
You know it's the
right thing to do.

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:22.710
And to do that, you
have to have courage.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:24.740
And no one can teach you
that in the classroom.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.020
You experience that in life.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:28.802
To follow your heart
and your intuition.

00:41:28.802 --> 00:41:31.010
I remember I said that to
a group of Harvard Business

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:33.640
School students who all wanted
to go to work for hedge funds

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.314
and they laughed at me.

00:41:36.314 --> 00:41:37.730
I was visiting one
of the classes.

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:39.620
They said, what's your
one piece of advice?

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:42.470
I said, follow your heart.

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:43.921
And they laughed.

00:41:43.921 --> 00:41:46.170
But I tell you, a lot of
them have come back and said,

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:47.940
you were right.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.900
That wasn't what I wanted to do.

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.230
In fact, one of them that did
go to work for a hedge fund

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.340
is now working at Google.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.256
He said, I finally found
where I wanted to be.

00:41:54.256 --> 00:41:56.400
So that's kind of cool.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.860
So, very quickly, and then
I want to have a chance

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.370
to answer some questions.

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:02.990
I'm going to skip
over a lot of this.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.571
I'll put it online for you.

00:42:04.571 --> 00:42:06.820
But, basically, if you want
to be an authentic leader,

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.067
you have to be self aware.

00:42:09.067 --> 00:42:10.900
You have to test your
values under pressure.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.000
No one can tell you
what values to have.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.160
You need to find your
sweet spot, which I want

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.469
to describe a little bit more.

00:42:16.469 --> 00:42:18.260
You need to build a
support team around you

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.600
like I have my wife and my men's
group and my couples group.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:25.940
And you need to lead
an integrated life.

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.050
So the way you gain self
awareness-- two ways.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:31.980
One is I think you have
to process your life

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:33.870
story and your crucibles.

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:35.920
In other words, you have
to know who you are.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.930
Second, I think you need an
ongoing practice of reflection.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:41.450
I meditate.

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:45.850
I've been meditating 40
years, 20 minutes twice a day.

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:47.650
My friend, Meng, teaches this.

00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:48.900
We need to have some practice.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.320
Maybe that's not your thing.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.600
Maybe it's prayer.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.760
Maybe it's a jog.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.420
Maybe it's a good walk with
someone you care about.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.810
Maybe it's a walk by yourself.

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:57.660
Something.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.215
Maybe it's just
sitting in your room

00:42:59.215 --> 00:43:00.200
and staring at the ceiling.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.283
It's something where you
have a chance to reflect.

00:43:02.283 --> 00:43:04.540
Because if you go hard
24/7 all the time,

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.250
you'll never get the clarity.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.752
You'll have all this stuff
going around in your head.

00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:10.460
You'll have 40 things
on your to do list,

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.300
you'll never get the clarity
about what you want to do.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.530
In addition to that, I
think you need feedback.

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:18.870
Feedback is what we call
the breakfast of champions.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:21.890
In other words, you need
to get honest feedback.

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:22.800
It's hard.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.640
My men's group gives
me honest feedback.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.014
Do you have mentors
in your life?

00:43:26.014 --> 00:43:29.607
Do you have people in your life
who will tell it like it is?

00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:31.940
That's really essential,
because without honest feedback

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.434
we can be off track.

00:43:33.434 --> 00:43:34.850
Who would pull you
back from that?

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:37.200
I've seen some people
lose their way.

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:41.070
They need people to pull
them back and get on track.

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:43.733
I'm going to skip ahead
here because I want

00:43:43.733 --> 00:43:46.280
to talk about your sweet spot.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.500
I hope you're in
your sweet spot now.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.302
It's the place where you find
you're most highly motivated.

00:43:51.302 --> 00:43:52.760
Not just by money,
fame, and power.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.350
But you're
intrinsically motivated.

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:56.808
You can create a product that's
going to make a difference.

00:43:56.808 --> 00:43:59.910
You can have a situation where
you're helping a customer--

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:01.504
in my case-- helping a patient.

00:44:01.504 --> 00:44:03.420
It's something you're
really passionate about.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.378
I wasn't passionate about
Honeywell's business,

00:44:05.378 --> 00:44:06.956
so I wasn't in my sweet spot.

00:44:06.956 --> 00:44:08.580
And you want to play
to your strengths.

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:10.962
If you get a job here, you
ask for a higher level job,

00:44:10.962 --> 00:44:13.170
and there are a lot of areas
you're not very good at,

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:15.510
you better surround yourself
with people who are.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:17.220
That's why at
Medtronic I had a vice

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.553
chairman who knew everything
about the medical business.

00:44:19.553 --> 00:44:21.780
I had a CFO-- even though
I was very analytical-- who

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.590
knew a lot more about
financial markets.

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:25.048
And so you got to
surround yourself

00:44:25.048 --> 00:44:27.940
with a team of people who know
more about things than you do.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.010
That's pretty critical I think.

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:33.100
And so I just as you to look
at these intrinsic motivations

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.150
and say, does your job fulfill
one or more of these things?

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:38.630
Do you find meaning
in your work?

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:40.600
Are you able to
make a difference?

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.230
Do you feel like you can
be true to your beliefs?

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.360
If the answers to
all these is no,

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.760
you may fall back on
money, fame, and power,

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.220
and you may live to regret
it because it may take you

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.660
off course.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.320
Just play to your strengths.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.130
And I think in the
end you're never

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:01.240
going to get perfect
balance in your life.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.272
You're not.

00:45:02.272 --> 00:45:03.730
Life is such that
you don't get it.

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:06.580
But I can say this, put
this test to yourself,

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:12.200
are you the same person at home,
at work, with your families,

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.317
and in your personal life?

00:45:13.317 --> 00:45:15.900
You know you're going to spend
more time at work than anything

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:17.930
else, including
sleeping, by the way.

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:20.430
If you do the studies, you'd
like to say you sleep more than

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:21.388
you work but you don't.

00:45:21.388 --> 00:45:23.020
You work more than you sleep.

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.620
Some of us actually
during your sleep.

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:26.360
So you're thinking about
things or waking up

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.450
in the middle of the night.

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:28.741
But can you be the same person?

00:45:28.741 --> 00:45:32.240
And that's having that sense
of integration or integrity.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.200
The French word is "couer,"
it means from the heart.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.210
And if you can operate
there from your heart,

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:39.270
you'll be an effective leader.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:41.830
So here's just a checklist
we'll put up online for you

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:47.050
to ask yourself a few questions
about am I staying on track.

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:49.300
And I think it's really good
to have a list somewhere.

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.290
Make up your own list.

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:51.810
But have a list
where you're doing

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:54.570
a daily check in with yourself.

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:56.620
Am I staying true
to what I believe?

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.950
That's really important.

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:03.057
Let me just close with a little
exercise I'd like to ask you.

00:46:03.057 --> 00:46:03.890
You're 97-years-old.

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:09.310
Some of you probably
can't think about that.

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:10.640
You're on your death bed.

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.860
You've got three hours to live.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:16.089
And the good news
is you lived to 97.

00:46:16.089 --> 00:46:17.630
The bad news you're
on your deathbed.

00:46:20.241 --> 00:46:21.740
All your adult
children have come in

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.698
and gathered around you
and your grandchildren.

00:46:23.698 --> 00:46:25.120
Coming in from all
over the world.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.350
And your favorite
granddaughter looks up at you--

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:29.600
and I'm thinking of my
granddaughter, Dylan, who is 8,

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:32.070
came in this morning as I
was leaving Dallas where

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:34.600
I'd spent the weekend taking
care of her-- I can't call it

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.220
babysitting, child care I
guess, with her and her younger

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.862
sister.

00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:41.070
And she looks up at me--
and she calls me Papa Bill--

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.570
and she says, Papa
Bill, what did

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:46.460
you do to make a
difference in the world?

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:47.820
How are you going to tell her?

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:48.360
Don't wait.

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.114
Take it now.

00:46:49.114 --> 00:46:50.780
What are you doing
to make a difference?

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.510
What's your lasting mark?

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:54.530
This world has 7 billion people.

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:55.760
You can make a difference.

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.612
You may not change
the whole world.

00:46:57.612 --> 00:46:59.320
You may not be able
to eradicate poverty.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.890
You may not be able to
eradicate health problems.

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:04.410
But you can make
a big difference.

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:08.550
Robert F. Kennedy in 1966 went
to Johannesburg, South Africa

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:10.910
and he said, few will
have the greatness

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:13.240
to bend history itself.

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:16.160
Now, he was sitting in the
shadow of Nelson Mandela, who

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.490
actually did bend history.

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:19.740
And your leaders here
are bending history.

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:20.990
But I know I will not.

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:22.574
And maybe some of you will.

00:47:22.574 --> 00:47:24.490
But he went on to say
something very profound.

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:26.930
Few will have the greatness
to bend history itself,

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:28.620
but each of us can
commit ourselves

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:32.680
to a series of actions to make
this world a better place.

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.110
And the sum total
of all those actions

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:37.390
will write the history
of this generation.

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:38.592
Your generation.

00:47:38.592 --> 00:47:40.300
And that's what I'm
doing when I'm doing.

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.390
That's why I write books.

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:42.260
That's why I'm teaching.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:44.676
It's trying to ensure that we
have better leadership going

00:47:44.676 --> 00:47:45.320
forward.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.430
We don't have people like
the head of Volkswagen

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:50.260
denying the problem or the
head of FIFA getting involved

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:51.550
in corruption scandals.

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:54.380
We have people who are authentic
and real who really can

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.340
make a difference in the world.

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.280
Margaret Mead, the
great anthropologist,

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:01.930
once said, never doubt the
power of a small group of people

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:03.700
to change the world.

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.735
Indeed, it is the only
thing that ever has.

00:48:06.735 --> 00:48:08.360
You're part of a
small group of people.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.860
It's getting big, but you're
part of a small group of people

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:13.160
that is changing the world.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.260
And I just think how exciting
that is and what you can do.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.760
Because when you
do leave this life,

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:21.070
the only thing you can take with
you is what you leave behind.

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.160
And I think you can leave
behind a legacy that

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.510
really makes a difference.

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:26.890
And the time to think
about that is now.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:30.110
And to stay on track of your
true north throughout your life

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:32.800
and to create great innovations
and to be that innovation

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.260
leader that can really have a
positive impact on the world.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:38.467
Thank you very much.

00:48:38.467 --> 00:48:41.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:43.736 --> 00:48:44.700
Thank you.

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:48.110
So we have a few
minutes for questions.

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:48.890
Questions?

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:49.720
I hope you'll ask.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.490
Please ask.

00:48:53.549 --> 00:48:55.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for being here today.

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:56.260
BILL GEORGE: Thank
you for having. me.

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.426
AUDIENCE: It's really a
privilege to learn from you.

00:48:58.426 --> 00:49:01.340
I was very much struck by your
comment about the men's group

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.360
that you've been a
part of for 40 years

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.910
because I find that it
seems like leaders today are

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:09.610
incredibly isolated given
how much they have going on

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:11.570
and lack that kind
of support system.

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:14.195
So I'm curious about
how that formed

00:49:14.195 --> 00:49:16.570
or what we could learn from
you in that, because whenever

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:19.380
we try and construct them
if they're overly engineered

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:20.760
they don't really work.

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:22.160
So that was one question.

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.660
The second part of that is,
have you ever in the 40 years

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:28.470
talked about including a
woman as part of that group?

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:30.804
BILL GEORGE: Good question.

00:49:30.804 --> 00:49:33.220
I think it's invaluable to
have a small group in your life

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:33.890
you can talk to.

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:35.848
They're the ones I want
to talk to about moving

00:49:35.848 --> 00:49:37.180
from Honeywell to Medtronic.

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:39.510
They encouraged me
to make the move.

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:44.114
When my wife, Penny, had breast
cancer almost 20 years ago,

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:45.530
I was in denial
and they helped me

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:47.820
see I was in denial
because of my fiance

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:50.760
dying and my mother dying
that I couldn't face the fact

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.660
my wife might die--
the three women I've

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:53.884
been closest to in my life.

00:49:53.884 --> 00:49:55.050
And they helped me see that.

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.530
And that was extremely helpful.

00:49:57.530 --> 00:50:01.740
So I've learned so
much from these guys.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.410
We've all gone through
difficult times.

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:04.701
And it's a group to share with.

00:50:04.701 --> 00:50:07.057
I think it has to come from
chemistry between the people

00:50:07.057 --> 00:50:09.140
and a group of people who
are willing to go there.

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:10.700
They're willing to share openly.

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:13.550
It doesn't work if one
of us won't share openly.

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:15.430
If you go around and
tell me the challenge

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:17.930
that you're facing but they
come to me and I say, I'll pass.

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:19.570
I'm not going to
share with you guys.

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:21.195
It's got to have a
group of people that

00:50:21.195 --> 00:50:22.840
are really explorers, seekers.

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:26.430
We came out of a retreat we
went off to at a seminar.

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:28.890
And four of us decided
to form 40 years ago.

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:30.640
And we've just stayed
together ever since.

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:31.181
You know why?

00:50:31.181 --> 00:50:32.635
Because we get so
much out of it.

00:50:32.635 --> 00:50:34.140
We actually have a program.

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:36.470
Everyone gets two weeks
to do the program.

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:38.640
And so it rotates
throughout the group.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.640
And I've not been a
very good member lately

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.031
because I've been teaching at
Harvard a lot and gone a lot.

00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:46.030
I'm going to be gone this
Wednesday because I'll

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:47.590
be in North Carolina.

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:50.140
But I'm there when I'm
in town, I assure you.

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:52.360
And everyone else is there.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.640
We also have a couples group.

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:54.780
No, we don't have a
woman in the group.

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:55.880
We've talked about expanding.

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.463
We can't get anyone
to want to expand.

00:50:57.463 --> 00:51:00.410
But we have a couples group
that we all went to Burgundy

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:01.390
on a little barge trip.

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:04.740
In fact, that's where I
read Laszo's book last week.

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:05.740
It was fantastic.

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.530
We had a whole week just
with our couples group

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:11.740
and had a chance to do
a lot of reflecting.

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:15.070
But this is a group that has
similar types discussions.

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:17.839
And we get together and
share the difficulties

00:51:17.839 --> 00:51:19.380
but the good times
we're having, too.

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:22.030
So this group meets once
a month, the men's group

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:23.050
meets once a week.

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:24.220
But it's chemistry.

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:25.510
And maybe you can find
it in the company.

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:26.030
It's great.

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:29.390
You get into some issues
with that in terms of-- I

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:31.720
think everything's got
to be confidential.

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.180
And I even wrote a book
called "True North Groups"

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.263
to explain how this works.

00:51:34.263 --> 00:51:36.447
But we all sign a
contract to say everything

00:51:36.447 --> 00:51:37.530
will be kept confidential.

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:38.819
Nothing goes outside the room.

00:51:38.819 --> 00:51:41.110
And we've been forming these
groups at Harvard Business

00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:43.720
School and now have had 6,000
people go with these groups.

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.220
It's been the most
significant thing

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:47.053
we've done in the last
decade at the school.

00:51:47.053 --> 00:51:49.660
It's very threatening to
the faculty, I might add,

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:51.740
because it's kind of
threatening to someone

00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:54.279
who has been practicing their
teaching in a classroom for 25

00:51:54.279 --> 00:51:55.820
years to find out
people would rather

00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:59.049
be with five of their
peers in a six person group

00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:01.090
than they would be hearing
a lecture from someone

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:03.200
or even engaging in
a dynamic discussion.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.890
So thank you for the question.

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:06.070
Other questions?

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:06.720
Abby.

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:11.180
This is Abby [INAUDIBLE] who has
formed a fantastic organization

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:14.410
to provide a gap year-- or
a year between high school

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:16.910
and college-- that I
think is an amazing thing

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:19.660
to help people go off
into emerging markets

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.410
and learn about themselves
through that experience.

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:23.840
So ask your question please.

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:24.300
AUDIENCE: Well, thank you.

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.660
I mean, I just I wanted to
thank you for the opportunity

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:28.140
to be here with all of you.

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:30.300
BILL GEORGE: She is
a real entrepreneur.

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.300
A social entrepreneur.

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.591
AUDIENCE: A lot of what you're
describing speaks to me.

00:52:33.591 --> 00:52:36.640
We first met when I was at
Harvard Business School.

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:41.910
And I can see in the five,
six years since leaving there

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:45.970
my own trajectory and how much
of what you teach actually

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:48.110
proves to be so true and
so valuable in practice.

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:50.276
And so my question to you--
the organization I lead,

00:52:50.276 --> 00:52:52.970
Global Citizen Year, is
structurally a not for profit.

00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:55.620
We like to say that's our tax
status and not necessarily

00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:58.347
our management style,
which is part of why

00:52:58.347 --> 00:52:59.430
I went to business school.

00:52:59.430 --> 00:53:02.780
But what interests me in this
notion of the innovative leader

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:06.800
and the idea that you need to
be focusing on long term value

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:09.610
and not making short term
decisions is how constrained

00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:11.140
we often are in
the not for profit

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:14.930
sector where if we're reliant
on philanthropic capital

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:17.880
there are rarely
opportunities to really invest

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:21.680
in R&amp;D, in marketing, in all of
the things that drive long term

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.450
value in the corporate sector.

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:25.680
And so I can feel like
my hands are sometimes

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.287
tied because I've got
a long term vision

00:53:28.287 --> 00:53:30.620
and I know what it would take
to get from here to there,

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.550
but it's going to
require taking some risks

00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:33.620
and having some failures.

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:35.619
And, traditionally, again,
in the not for profit

00:53:35.619 --> 00:53:39.030
sector-- which I wish we
called the for impact sector

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:42.610
to frame it as what we are
and not what we're not.

00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:44.450
I feel like it's
much harder to do.

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:46.340
And, candidly, these
are some of the problems

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:48.881
that we all would agree are the
most important to be solving.

00:53:48.881 --> 00:53:50.760
So how do we reconcile?

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.010
BILL GEORGE: Let me get on
the other side of the table

00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:56.010
and say that what we've
done about 20 years ago--

00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:58.820
and the last 12 years my wife
has run our family foundation--

00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:00.990
which we took about a third
of our net worth which

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:02.220
we gained in Medtronic stock.

00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.928
Eventually we're going
to put it all over

00:54:03.928 --> 00:54:06.390
there into a foundation.

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:10.240
And we believe that
philanthropies are-- my wife,

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:13.260
Penny-- calls a passing
gear of society.

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.320
And so where other things
are funded routinely,

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:16.660
this is the thing that
makes it go ahead.

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:18.390
What you're talking about is
being in the passing gear.

00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:21.030
Other people could fund their
kids to go overseas and living,

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:23.840
but you're providing
that breakthrough idea.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.200
And I think that's why--
and I'm excited, actually,

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.260
that there's so much
philanthropy in the Valley

00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:30.265
and so much philanthropy
in general right now.

00:54:30.265 --> 00:54:32.390
I think it's a tragedy that
Steve Jobs made so much

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:34.450
and he never gave
any of it away.

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:36.180
Again, you can't take
it with you, guys.

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:38.740
And so we're going to
eventually give everything away.

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:40.200
And why not do it
in your lifetime?

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:43.120
So I think that
philosophically we just

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:45.661
have to find those
people that resonate

00:54:45.661 --> 00:54:46.910
with what you're trying to do.

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:48.390
And I know what
hard work that is.

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:50.889
And I know what Wendy Kopp went
through in Teach for America

00:54:50.889 --> 00:54:52.990
in a similar way of
starting from scratch

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:54.654
and being totally
dependent and not

00:54:54.654 --> 00:54:57.320
having an institution to come in
and put a lot of money into it.

00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.660
But I hope and pray that
you'll find those people that

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.640
will allow you to do that
because that's all we

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.030
fund in our foundation
is people that

00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:04.864
want to do leading edge
breakthrough things.

00:55:04.864 --> 00:55:06.780
We don't want to just
find the routine things.

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:08.780
We want to fund the things
at the leading edge.

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:11.430
And, by the way, that's what
Google has to keep doing, too.

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:13.820
Keep funding things
that leading edge

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:16.447
that don't pay the bills but
[INAUDIBLE] the opportunities,

00:55:16.447 --> 00:55:18.530
because they're the ones--
back to Margaret Mead--

00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:22.384
they're the ones that
really make the difference.

00:55:22.384 --> 00:55:23.050
Other questions?

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:26.380
Yes?

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:26.880
Thank you.

00:55:29.384 --> 00:55:31.050
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned kind of going

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:32.950
against the grain,
which is something

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:35.340
quite challenging to do
especially in these bigger

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:36.660
organizations.

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:39.467
What are some tips that you
have for authentic leaders

00:55:39.467 --> 00:55:42.050
kind of going against the grain
and going for things that they

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:44.012
believe are true?

00:55:44.012 --> 00:55:45.970
BILL GEORGE: Well, the
question is, what do you

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:49.450
do to go against the grain, and
what are some tips you have?

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:50.950
It does take a lot of courage.

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:54.240
And I think you want to
consult with a lot of people

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.880
before you go against the grain.

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.990
But, you know, again, the
people that are really

00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:59.110
making a difference
are ones that

00:55:59.110 --> 00:56:01.160
are going against the
grain or not just playing

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:03.340
the game by yesterday's rules.

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:06.239
And so I think making
sure you have some support

00:56:06.239 --> 00:56:08.780
team around you that's giving
you that courage to go forward,

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:10.970
even though there is
opposing forces out there.

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:13.490
Even though people say what
you're saying is crazy.

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:16.550
A lot of ideas when I came
out with them 10-12 years ago,

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:18.160
everyone said was crazy.

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.200
No one thinks like this.

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.240
Well, I think that's
the way it's moving.

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.800
I think the best leaders
today are authentic leaders.

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.800
And they're the ones
making a difference.

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:28.260
There's a few jerks left, but
we'll try to get rid of them

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:29.620
as fast as we can.

00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.510
I try to work on that
in the classroom.

00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:33.610
But I think there really
are authentic leaders.

00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:34.985
So you make progress
and you have

00:56:34.985 --> 00:56:36.970
to have the courage to
keep going, keep going,

00:56:36.970 --> 00:56:38.990
keep going because
you believe in it.

00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:41.240
So you have to have
the passion behind you.

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:45.196
And, again, it's the
bandwagon effect.

00:56:45.196 --> 00:56:47.070
I did some things early
in my career you guys

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:48.568
will think, well, old fashioned.

00:56:48.568 --> 00:56:50.526
We started the consumer
microwave oven business

00:56:50.526 --> 00:56:51.800
in the United States.

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.490
We had to get people
on the bandwagon.

00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:55.510
Need to do the same thing
when you have an idea.

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:59.780
Get people behind it and then
it becomes, oh, that's obvious.

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:00.430
Google Maps.

00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:01.180
That's obvious.

00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.138
Well, it wasn't so obvious
when it got started.

00:57:03.138 --> 00:57:05.390
I still haven't figured
out how anyone did it.

00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:10.090
But, again, you need mentors
to help you to stay on track.

00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:13.029
And you need to have the
courage to your convictions.

00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:15.070
And you need to have
someone like my wife, Penny,

00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:18.120
who can be your counselor
to say, Bill, OK, so you're

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.220
getting this opposition.

00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:20.280
Keep going.

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.470
Don't stop.

00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:23.620
And sometimes you have to
put it all on the line.

00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:24.710
At Medtronic a
couple of times I had

00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:26.930
to put it all on the line to
go totally against the grain.

00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:27.890
And I thought we were losing it.

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:29.431
Everyone wanted to
go this way and we

00:57:29.431 --> 00:57:30.990
decided to go the other way.

00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.550
OK.

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:32.910
Took some huge risks.

00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:35.890
I might have destroyed my
career, but sometimes you do.

00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:37.320
And sometimes it
doesn't work out

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:39.590
and you have to start all
over, but it's worth it

00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:41.590
because that's what
really makes a difference.

00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:44.180
So thank you for
that great question.

00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:47.120
So how we doing time wise?

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:47.700
One more.

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:50.050
Do I have one more question?

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:50.700
Yes.

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:51.590
One last question.

00:57:51.590 --> 00:57:52.090
Here we go.

00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:52.744
Thank you.

00:57:52.744 --> 00:57:54.410
AUDIENCE: I think
it's somewhat related.

00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:57.070
But if you are trying
to follow this,

00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:59.240
but then your leads and
the leads above them

00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:03.430
are not, how do
you deal with that?

00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:05.860
Like going against the grain
when the rest of the culture,

00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:08.740
and especially people
above, are a little more

00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:12.130
self interested and are
like the lefthand column.

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:12.880
BILL GEORGE: Yeah.

00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:13.930
I got it.

00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:15.450
AUDIENCE: So any
suggestions on how

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:16.950
to handle those
kinds of situations?

00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:18.220
BILL GEORGE: Be yourself.

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:19.780
I know some people
in organizations

00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:21.640
where they're
really lone rangers.

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.510
They're really going
against the grain.

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:25.070
But just be yourself.

00:58:25.070 --> 00:58:27.030
Build a team around
you that believes

00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:31.414
in that and gains success from
doing it and just stay with it.

00:58:31.414 --> 00:58:32.955
My son, I was telling
him last night,

00:58:32.955 --> 00:58:35.430
he's facing a lot of this
kind of opposition of people

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:36.680
saying don't go there.

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:37.260
Just do this.

00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:40.240
Well, I said, Jeff, that's
what made you successful.

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.160
Stay in the direction
you're going.

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.180
Don't get off course.

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:45.200
And believe in
what you're doing,

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:48.160
but also get your team to
produce results so they

00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.820
can see that it produces.

00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:52.010
That it's getting
whatever the results are

00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:53.529
that it is actually working.

00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:56.070
And I think you'll find, again,
back to the question that she

00:58:56.070 --> 00:58:57.620
asked, that bandwagon effect.

00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:00.380
When they see you're successful,
people want to get on board.

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:02.240
And maybe your boss
learned a little bit

00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:03.970
about from the way you operate.

00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:06.720
And that may just
influence them to the good.

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.720
And it's hard for people
to change, particularly

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.570
when they get older.

00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:12.759
But I think we all have
the capacity for change

00:59:12.759 --> 00:59:14.300
if we're willing to
be introspective,

00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:18.070
look Inside ourself, and say
what's really important to me.

00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:20.780
And so I think if we can
use this organization

00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:23.030
to create more innovation
leaders that can really

00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:26.610
do breakthrough innovations
in a wide range of fields,

00:59:26.610 --> 00:59:29.360
it'll be a great gift that
Google gives to the world.

00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.735
So thank you very
much for having me.

00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:32.360
DOLORES: Great.

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.032
Thank you so much,
Bill, for coming.

00:59:34.032 --> 00:59:34.990
BILL GEORGE: Thank you.

00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:36.077
DOLORES: Great talk.

00:59:36.077 --> 00:59:38.410
And for those of you that are
interested in book signing

00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:40.076
and whatnot, we're
going to be moving it

00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:43.740
outside because this room's
for another customer.

00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:46.220
So thank you so much for coming.

00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:48.620
And thank you so much, Bill.

00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:49.120
OK.

00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:51.570
BILL GEORGE: Thank
you very much.
