00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:12.610
SPEAKER: Woo-hoo!

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.630
Way to set the scene.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.500
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.150
Welcome.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.854
Welcome, Arinzé.

00:00:17.854 --> 00:00:18.520
ARINZÉ KENE: Hi.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.103
How you doing?

00:00:19.103 --> 00:00:20.390
SPEAKER: Welcome to Google.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.190
Absolutely delighted
to have you here.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.150
ARINZÉ KENE: It's a
pleasure to be here.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.020
SPEAKER: Fabulous.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.060
We're going to kick off
straight into it off the bat.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.970
I'm going to first
do a quick intro

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.340
about "Misty," what
we just saw here,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.260
and then a snippet about you.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.690
And then we'll start
to really just unpack

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.525
with questions, if
that's cool for you.

00:00:37.525 --> 00:00:38.620
ARINZÉ KENE: That's cool.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.640
SPEAKER: So "Misty,"
following a sold out

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.940
run at the Bush Theatre, it
then transferred to the West End

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.957
at Trafalgar Studios--

00:00:46.957 --> 00:00:49.040
which, to my understanding,
it's a limited season.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.200
But did it just
recently get extended?

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.157
ARINZÉ KENE: It just got
extended to November the 17th.

00:00:54.157 --> 00:00:55.990
SPEAKER: Which is
amazing, so no small feat.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.656
This is awesome.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.010
Well done.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.410
It's described in one line--

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.780
if I had to block a line
out-- a lyrical journey

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.800
through the heart and
soul of inner city London.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.301
So we'll unpack
that in a minute,

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:08.300
if that's cool with you.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.140
ARINZÉ KENE: It's cool.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.140
SPEAKER: Off the bat from
my perspective, having

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.440
seen the show last week--

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.330
it's undoubtedly a phenomenal
performance, I have to say.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.420
And it's a really
captivating show.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.540
For me, I thought
that the formats--

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.230
like there's genres from
physical theater is in there--

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.747
prose to verse, music that
sometimes feels like you're

00:01:27.747 --> 00:01:29.330
at a concert for a
moment, and then it

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.420
switches to something else.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.530
There's comedy in
there, as well.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.460
But underlined you have some
really meaningful themes

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.520
and storyline.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.650
And so I thought it
seamlessly blended together.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.410
And for the X amount of time--

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.260
I don't even know, frankly,
how much time I was there for.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.002
But I was just--

00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:47.710
ARINZÉ KENE: You were
there for 10 years.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.626
SPEAKER: For 10 years?

00:01:48.626 --> 00:01:49.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.930
ARINZÉ KENE: For 10 years,
I didn't want it to stop,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.935
'cause it was fantastic.

00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:52.580
And it was.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.880
Yeah.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.510
I was like, no.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.020
I wasn't ready.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.478
I was saying at the ending I
wasn't ready for it, actually.

00:01:56.478 --> 00:01:57.890
I won't spoil anything.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.240
So seamlessly blended.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.822
So congratulations
on the acclaim

00:02:00.822 --> 00:02:02.780
you've had for the play,
and through the press.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.490
Because I certainly
understand it.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.684
ARINZÉ KENE: Thank you.

00:02:05.684 --> 00:02:07.100
SPEAKER: And then,
of course, just

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.009
to set the scene and sort
of mentioned your CV--

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.230
as it were-- you're
not new to this.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.540
You've done extensive
stage work--

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.660
"Lion King," "Girl From
the North Country,"

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.400
"One Night in Miami,"
just to name a few.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.390
Starred in a variety of films,
TV, including "Eastenders"

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.470
for a while, and then
an upcoming movie,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.655
"Been So Long," with Michaela.

00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:29.780
Is it Michaela or Michaela?

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.120
ARINZÉ KENE: Michaela.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.580
SPEAKER: Michaela Coel.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.070
And then, of course,
you write books, plays.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.520
Did I read seven?

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.120
Seven?

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.204
ARINZÉ KENE: I don't know.

00:02:37.204 --> 00:02:38.411
SPEAKER: You don't even know.

00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:38.990
OK.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.500
Let's go with--

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.100
ARINZÉ KENE: I stopped counting.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.080
SPEAKER: --a good number of
plays and screenplays, as well.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.360
So you're part of--

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.460
is it-- well,
you'll tell me what

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.460
you're a part of in a
minute, if that's OK.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.210
This is sort of like your--
so in a nutshell, that's

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.940
part of a very small
part of your CV.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.800
Beyond that I just
want to also just give

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.310
a snippet about beyond the CV.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.692
So you're born in
Lagos, Nigeria.

00:03:02.692 --> 00:03:03.400
ARINZÉ KENE: Yes.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.104
SPEAKER: You were raised then--

00:03:05.104 --> 00:03:06.770
when you were young,
you moved to London

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.030
and then based in Hackney.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.780
ARINZÉ KENE: Yeah.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.410
Decided to leave
when I was three.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.582
SPEAKER: You just
decided to leave?

00:03:11.582 --> 00:03:12.064
ARINZÉ KENE: I was
like, I had enough.

00:03:12.064 --> 00:03:13.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.370
SPEAKER: I had enough.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.870
Yeah.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.190
I'm going to try something new.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.550
OK, awesome.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.112
And then years later--

00:03:19.112 --> 00:03:20.570
obviously not when
you were three--

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.880
you then, so cast your mind
forward many, many years--

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.930
you went to university.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.480
I want to pick on this point.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.029
And you studied--

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:27.820
ARINZÉ KENE: Well--

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.327
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:28.327 --> 00:03:29.660
ARINZÉ KENE: --this is the bit--

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.785
SPEAKER: Tell me
about your journey--

00:03:30.785 --> 00:03:31.510
ARINZÉ KENE: This
is the bit where--

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.802
SPEAKER: --to becoming
a successful actor.

00:03:32.802 --> 00:03:34.940
ARINZÉ KENE: --there's
some misinformation.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.542
SPEAKER: OK.

00:03:36.542 --> 00:03:38.000
ARINZÉ KENE: So I
didn't go to uni.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.805
SPEAKER: Ah.

00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:39.305
Great.

00:03:39.305 --> 00:03:41.260
ARINZÉ KENE: I was accepted.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.150
I decided instead to
give acting a shot.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.740
Yeah.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.630
I was going to go and
study physiotherapy.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.040
SPEAKER: Right.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.980
ARINZÉ KENE: And
then I was like,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.605
I don't want to be
fixing Tony's knee.

00:03:56.605 --> 00:03:59.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.760
Yeah.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.540
I'd rather be on
stage Messing up

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.520
my knee, which I've been doing.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.780
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.017
ARINZÉ KENE: So yeah, that's
what happened in 2006.

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:11.600
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.130
So you just went--

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.590
so tell us a bit about that
journey to now becoming

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.910
a successful actor.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.267
Because I suspect many,
many people-- certainly

00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:22.100
I know it having been
an actor for a while--

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.100
that it is no easy industry.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.990
And it genuinely isn't.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.500
So how did that come about?

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.750
And what does that entail?

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.320
Tell us about that journey.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.850
ARINZÉ KENE: Sure.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:40.280
Well, I guess, so one thing that
I kind of got from my family,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.380
I would say, is grit is
just like, hard work.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.360
I realized early on when
I started performing,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.850
that a lot of people had
the same dreams as me.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.470
And I was like,
how do I stand out?

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.020
You know, what do I do in
order to kind of just excel,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.860
but also to be undeniable.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.370
You know?

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.540
To kind of people
to kind of go, yeah.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.730
We want that guy, not
like, one of these guys.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.340
You know?

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.852
Yeah.

00:05:13.852 --> 00:05:15.060
I know it sounds a bit weird.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.860
But that's actually
what I saw as success--

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.750
people knowing that they want
me, specifically-- not just

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.310
a guy who can fit this thing.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.295
You know?

00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:33.710
And so over the last
12 and a half years

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.305
I've been working on that--

00:05:37.305 --> 00:05:43.800
on being quite specifically me
as an artist, as a creative.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.870
And I guess acting has
been a massive part of it--

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.110
showing people what I can
do on stage, on screen.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.710
But also, the work
that I create,

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.753
which I've been quite nervous
about over the years--

00:06:00.753 --> 00:06:04.910
about being honest about
what I love to make.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.900
Because I feel like the type
of work that I make now,

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.130
"Misty" is closest to--

00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:16.900
it's probably my
most honest work.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.100
In fact, it is by far.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.950
I've written other plays
that have been honest.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.290
But I have been kind of
battling with, I guess,

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.190
the creative mind.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.740
You battle with second
guessing your own work.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.180
And you kind of read
pre-existing work.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.650
And you kind of go, OK, cool.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.980
So maybe mine has this
kind of be similar to that.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.100
And, you know, also
with certain things

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.580
I've written in
the past, I kind of

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.770
was writing to this phantom
structure that existed,

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.920
and some people call it
like an orthodox kind

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.980
of structure or a traditional
approach to play writing.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.820
And over the last few years,
I don't know what's happened.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:11.810
But I just kind of really
quite tired of having

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.360
a lack of structure to write to.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.000
And so I've really
kind of wrestled

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.930
with my demons artistically,
and "Misty" came out.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.900
And "Misty" is like--

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.130
everyone who's been involved
in it feels pretty proud of it.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.360
Because I don't think
there's much like it.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.770
SPEAKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.078
ARINZÉ KENE: I mean, you sat
there for 10 years and you

00:07:37.078 --> 00:07:37.786
didn't even know.

00:07:37.786 --> 00:07:39.210
SPEAKER: Didn't know I
was there for 10 years.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.350
I could've gone on longer.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.190
No, exactly.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.620
I think that, yeah, I
certainly would echo.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.750
That was my impression
of that work.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.837
And it sounds like you
had to get there, and to

00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:50.670
where you are today.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.920
That grit, tenacity,
determination,

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.644
knowing what you want--

00:07:54.644 --> 00:07:55.560
I guess two questions.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.630
How did you know
what you wanted?

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.150
And what support have you
had, you know, whether it's

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.980
your family or your
friends on that journey?

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.380
'Cause it's a tough journey.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.130
ARINZÉ KENE: Yeah.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:05.880
It was tough.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:12.330
So from, I guess, when
I was a kid when I moved

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.640
to London to East London--

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:22.530
'91-- I have a kind of
very traditional Nigerian

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:28.396
family in the sense
that you had I

00:08:28.396 --> 00:08:31.320
guess three or four options
about what you could be.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:31.820
You know?

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.612
You can either be--

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:33.111
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:34.020
You guys-- doctor--

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:34.270
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.210
I hear laughter there.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:35.429
Yeah.

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:36.010
ARINZÉ KENE: What's
the other one?

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:36.801
AUDIENCE: Engineer.

00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:38.100
ARINZÉ KENE: Engineer.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.130
Lawyer.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.034
Accountant.

00:08:42.034 --> 00:08:43.710
That's about it, isn't it?

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.580
You know, it's kind of like--

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.660
and then all the other
bits that kind of, I guess,

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.840
it you're a pharmacist,
then that's all right.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.430
Because you studied medicine.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.305
You know what I mean?

00:08:54.305 --> 00:08:56.130
It's close enough.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.220
If you don't have the
doctor, then who are you?

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.700
Yeah.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.208
So that was the kind of like--

00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:10.110
that was the path that was,
I guess, laid out for me.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.800
You know?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.240
That was the reason why my
dad brought us all over,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.040
so we could become those things.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.990
And so while later
in life I was given

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.560
the freedom of what
to study, this thing

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.330
had been instilled in me.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.430
And even when I had
the choice of what

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.190
to choose to study
in sixth form,

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.820
I went and chose chemistry,
biology, photography,

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:37.320
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.870
You know, but the
chemistry and biology--

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.850
I wasn't really into
it-- not really.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.290
I mean, I knew I was--

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:50.480
I knew I could memorize
things, you know?

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.110
And so that kind of
gave me the impression

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.940
that I was sort of good at it,
because I could memorize stuff.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.400
But you have to have a
passion for it, don't you?

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.390
And so we came to a compromise--

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:08.460
my family-- my dad and I, that
I would study physiotherapy.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:14.220
However, there was this kind
of raging undercurrent in me

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.330
all through my teens.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.320
And it was just saying, perform.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.300
Get on stage.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.320
Do your thing.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:19.920
You know?

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.710
And I would have these secret
conversations with people,

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.480
like relatives, like
imagine if, I don't know,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.774
I was to just jump on a
stage and do something.

00:10:30.774 --> 00:10:35.070
But I would never kind of
really give myself a chance.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:41.880
Over the years-- so for example,
when I was in my early teens

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.830
I joined a youth company.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.430
And I was doing stuff
on the weekends when

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.280
I wasn't playing basketball--

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.080
never invited my
family to see anything.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.240
Because I knew it would
just be shut down city.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:59.910
Yeah.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.450
Yeah.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.990
So this gap year
thing, you know,

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:08.310
I kind of went into it
knowing that I would never go,

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.510
because that would have
been soul destroying.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.120
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.642
ARINZÉ KENE: Yeah.

00:11:13.642 --> 00:11:15.100
I wouldn't change
a thing, as well.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:20.020
Because by the time that things
started kicking off as far

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:26.670
as by getting professional
work, I was so grateful.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.650
Because if it was something
that I felt like I couldn't do,

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:33.160
like I felt like I
wasn't allowed to do.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:38.642
And yeah, even for a
few years when things--

00:11:41.813 --> 00:11:45.380
I guess when I got
the ball rolling,

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.870
it was still very
hard to convince

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.150
my family that this
is going to work

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.401
and this is what I'm doing now.

00:11:53.401 --> 00:11:54.734
SPEAKER: Are they convinced now?

00:11:54.734 --> 00:11:56.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.650
Surely now they're convinced.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:57.890
ARINZÉ KENE: No.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:58.130
They are.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.630
They are.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:59.300
SPEAKER: OK.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.950
ARINZÉ KENE: But it's funny.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.620
It's weird.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:07.900
The job that convinced
my dad that I

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.040
was going to be all right--

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.498
all he wanted to know was that
I was going to be all right.

00:12:11.498 --> 00:12:12.100
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.720
ARINZÉ KENE: I mean, you know, I
won't criticize him for wanting

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.700
me to be a doctor or
a lawyer, or whatever.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:23.020
Because those were the things
that, according to him,

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.070
kind of ensured that you
would have a really good life

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:32.074
and you would be able to look
after your family and so on.

00:12:32.074 --> 00:12:32.980
Yeah.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.150
You mentioned "Eastenders".

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.780
You know, and the
thing is right.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.510
It's funny.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.710
It's just funny, the ones
that, I guess, family respond

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.530
to-- people really respond to.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:51.390
But when I got that, which
was my first television job,

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.180
he was--

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.430
I guess it was a massive
weight off his shoulders.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.700
And he was like, you know what?

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.880
I'm watching my
son on television

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.074
with these characters
that I've been

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:04.240
watching for like, 10 years.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.260
And you're there.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:06.760
Yeah.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.100
After that I was given a much--

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.310
I don't know, a lot
less of a hard time.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.000
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.610
ARINZÉ KENE: Even though he
did still ask me a couple years

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.111
after that, so when
you going back to uni?

00:13:19.111 --> 00:13:20.964
I was like, I don't know, man.

00:13:20.964 --> 00:13:22.630
I was like, that
degree is going to have

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.570
to be an honorary thing.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:26.446
SPEAKER: It might be.

00:13:26.446 --> 00:13:26.945
Absolutely.

00:13:26.945 --> 00:13:28.390
ARINZÉ KENE: I'm
not going, Pops.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.160
SPEAKER: I'm not going.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.070
ARINZÉ KENE: I'm not going.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.236
SPEAKER: I'm not going, Dad.

00:13:31.236 --> 00:13:32.060
No.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:32.560
Yeah.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.380
No, absolutely.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.650
As a parent, I can
definitely understand.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.690
Although I was
very much like no,

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.640
I'm going to do what
I'm going to do--

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.910
but now that I am a parent
and that's four of them,

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:43.977
I can definitely see.

00:13:43.977 --> 00:13:45.310
I have actually said the words--

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.143
I couldn't believe it--
where I was like oh,

00:13:47.143 --> 00:13:48.950
what about being a doctor?

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.190
Like, yeah.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.130
Pharmacist came up.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.080
I couldn't believe
what I was saying,

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.430
from the background that I had.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:57.370
So it's interesting, as well.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:02.560
So now that you are
where you're at,

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.290
how aware are you
of the influence

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:06.550
that you can have on others?

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:08.260
You said that you
knew what you wanted,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.000
and you wanted to
convince others

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.220
that you need they needed
you-- the world needs you

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.010
in doing what you do, So
how aware are you one,

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.380
of the influence you
have on others now.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.840
And what are they-- if
you know the influences

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.670
you have on people?

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.170
ARINZÉ KENE: Well,
that's the thing.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.860
You can never quite
know, can you?

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.110
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:30.160
ARINZÉ KENE: I mean, some people
wait after the play is done

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.590
and kind of tell me what
they thought of it and how it

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.190
affected them.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.890
Or some people write.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.235
I always read everything.

00:14:39.235 --> 00:14:40.050
SPEAKER: Do you?

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:40.960
ARINZÉ KENE: Yeah.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.170
You know, some people write.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:48.850
And it's always humbling
to see, I guess, the impact

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:53.250
that I have as a creative.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.791
And it's also eye opening.

00:14:54.791 --> 00:14:56.790
And I've really thought
about it over the years.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.123
I think that's a great question.

00:14:58.123 --> 00:15:01.260
Because I've learned so much
through story in my life,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:05.070
as in from when you're a kid you
know you're watching cartoons

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.760
and you're learning about how
to share through this cartoon

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.740
episode you watched
that's about sharing.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:17.130
And it's like, never stops--

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.590
learning through story.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.100
And you also learn really
bad things about yourself

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.890
through story, which
happened to me growing up.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.530
You know, it's no
secret but some

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:36.420
of the depictions of young
black men and women in the world

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.320
is shocking.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.390
You know?

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.030
And kind of repeating
certain work over and over--

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:46.620
you know, as a young man I'd
sit there and not having--

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.170
I guess not knowing what to
watch, I'd watch that, too.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.620
And then I'd start thinking
a certain thing about myself.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.780
Because every time
I turn on the telly,

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.320
it's like the black guy
has got to be the criminal.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:05.980
And so, you know, it's about I
guess thinking about all that--

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.610
how complex that whole thing is.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.460
Yeah.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.750
It has informed
my work, in a way.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.220
It's a real thing-- story.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.430
It can change people's lives.

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.630
It can make them--

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:24.150
you know, I mean, it can
take a person off the ledge.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:30.360
It's like, if you have
the capacity or the will,

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:36.580
the want to tell story,
then you do have a freedom.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:41.280
But I also feel a sense of duty.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.960
Because if I just know a little
bit about what impact creating

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.550
can have, and that's
just creating as a whole.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.682
Not even particularly play
writing, but just that.

00:16:52.682 --> 00:16:55.140
SPEAKER: Just being that person
out there who's aware of it

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.290
and doing whatever it is
that you might be doing.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:57.510
ARINZÉ KENE: Yeah.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:58.093
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:16:58.093 --> 00:17:03.600
So segueing into "Misty" now and
just thinking about-- actually

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.760
there's a point
in your play here

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.270
where you mention
around the point

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.160
that you just mentioned
now around what

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.461
do people see on TV.

00:17:12.461 --> 00:17:12.960
You know?

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.540
And so anyway, so that's
mentioned in the play.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:18.224
And I thought that was
a really apt moment

00:17:18.224 --> 00:17:20.849
in the play, when you mentioned
like, what are the role models?

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:21.829
What do we see?

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:24.386
Why are certain films super
successful and others not?

00:17:24.386 --> 00:17:25.510
Why can't we just see this?

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.926
I'm not trying to
spoil it, so I'm

00:17:26.926 --> 00:17:28.953
kind of talking cryptically.

00:17:28.953 --> 00:17:36.420
So anyway, so what drove and
inspired you to write "Misty?"

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.680
Yeah.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.030
How did it come about--

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.090
either tactically, tangibly,
or like, from within the heart?

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.080
How did this come about?

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.340
ARINZÉ KENE: So I was
commissioned in 2012

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.080
by the Bush Theatre.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.880
I had no idea what to write.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.040
And I told those guys.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.750
Those were like
Madani Younis, who's

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.220
the artistic
director of the Bush.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:01.350
I told him at a time that
I might not write anything

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.970
for a hot minute.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.736
With me, with my head--
a hot minute was a year.

00:18:05.736 --> 00:18:06.516
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:06.516 --> 00:18:08.390
SPEAKER: And had you
written-- just to check,

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:09.577
had you written before that?

00:18:09.577 --> 00:18:10.410
You've been writing?

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:10.600
ARINZÉ KENE: Yeah.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.100
SPEAKER: OK.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.392
So they commissioned based
on stuff they'd seen you do?

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:14.141
ARINZÉ KENE: Yeah.

00:18:14.141 --> 00:18:15.270
SPEAKER: Or just a hunch?

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.830
What was it?

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.580
ARINZÉ KENE: Yeah.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.700
Madani had seen a play called
"Little Baby Jesus," which

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.790
I had on at the
Oval House Theatre.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.970
And then it went to
Latitude Festival.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:30.190
And I think he
saw it at Latitude

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.810
and then met with me in 2012.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:33.710
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:34.460
ARINZÉ KENE: Yeah.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.820
That hot minute turned out
to be three hot minutes--

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.440
three years later.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.270
That's when I kind
of, I got the idea

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.210
about what I wanted to write--

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:46.920
sort of, anyway.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.484
And then I kind of
challenge myself

00:18:48.484 --> 00:18:50.525
and I thought it was a
little bit too challenging

00:18:50.525 --> 00:18:51.517
to tackle that idea.

00:18:51.517 --> 00:18:53.100
And so I kind of
tried to chicken out.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.122
I tried to pay Madani
the commission back.

00:18:56.122 --> 00:18:57.360
Yeah.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.100
I was like, look, man.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.450
I can't really--
I can't deliver.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.800
And he said, just
take your time.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.940
I didn't commission a play.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.770
A commissioned the writer.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.090
You know, there is no deadline.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.660
Just kind of take your time.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.110
And I'm so glad he did that,
because we wouldn't have

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.540
"Misty" if he didn't.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:19.560
Because I just kind of
thought about it again,

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.890
but from a different place.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:25.320
This is when, as
I said, I decided

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.180
to be more honest
about it-- you know,

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.010
about the work I was making.

00:19:32.996 --> 00:19:34.490
Yeah.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:38.640
"Misty"-- inspirations
around it.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.280
One, growing up in Hackney.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.570
Coming back to Hackney.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:46.640
Seeing how much
Hackney has changed.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.200
I guess meeting up
with mates in cafes

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.890
and talking about that
place that used to be there,

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.400
now that's gone and it's
turned into this now.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.000
Kind of like putting all
those ideas together and all

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.200
those feelings together
and laughing about it--

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.780
and also kind of
like just helping

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.625
to organize your thoughts
and your emotions.

00:20:13.165 --> 00:20:14.640
"Misty" is kind of--

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.920
and I don't think this
gives away too much.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.050
But I play two
characters in "Misty."

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:19.680
Right?

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.960
And it's kind of like a--

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.370
so there's two storylines
running parallel.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.440
And then they begin
to interweave.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.550
One of them is the character--

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.310
well, we can call him Lucas.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:38.940
And I guess he's wondering
what's happening in this area.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.670
You know, he's quite
frustrated with what

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:45.330
we learn through the
play is gentrification.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.430
That story is like
an extended metaphor.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:51.180
You know, it's told in
quite a separate world.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.950
It feels quite surreal.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:21:00.330
And then there is this
other quite absurd story

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.520
line, which I'm playing.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.760
I'm playing a character whose
name is Arinzé, who is--

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.110
it's a fictional, kind of
surreal version of myself.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:12.060
And those scenes
are quite absurd.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:16.710
But that is me navigating
through this creative industry.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.370
That Arinzé is
also a playwright,

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:23.370
and also has to deliver
plays, and also has to talk

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:25.730
to producers, and his agent.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:29.230
And the play that he's writing
is the play that we're seeing.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.730
So that's the Lucas story.

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.370
And then they begin
to kind of crossover,

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.650
and you're not sure in the end--

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.160
you're not sure who's who.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:49.470
But that is what Misty is.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:55.280
It kind of holds a mirror
in between Lucas and Arinzé.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.560
It shows you, I guess,
similarities in their world--

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.590
similar challenges.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.790
Because I've had
my own obstacles

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:06.480
as a writer-- trying
to create honest work,

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:13.565
and also trying to, I guess,
to basically to just battle

00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:14.870
these demons all the time.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.040
You know?

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.640
And yeah, without
giving too much away,

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.590
that's kind of like--

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.240
SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:21.830
That's great--

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:25.480
ARINZÉ KENE: That's kind
of the overlook of it all.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.800
SPEAKER: And I'll
say final question

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.130
before we move to the audience.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.150
So I have your questions ready,
because I could talk all night.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:35.340
But it's not fair.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.010
How have the
audiences responded?

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:38.770
How do you feel it's
been responded--

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.150
they've responded
to specifically

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:42.890
in this branch of
Trafalgar Studios?

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:44.765
I don't know if it's
any different than Bush,

00:22:44.765 --> 00:22:45.974
but tell us.

00:22:45.974 --> 00:22:46.640
ARINZÉ KENE: No.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.750
Yeah, it's not actually
that different.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:52.460
I mean, the Bush
was really good.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.632
Because, well, it
was really good.

00:22:54.632 --> 00:22:55.340
SPEAKER: You out.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.460
ARINZÉ KENE: We sold out,
and then we extended.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.043
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:22:58.043 --> 00:22:59.480
ARINZÉ KENE: And
then we sold out.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.380
And now we have been doing
really well in the West End--

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.941
so much so that we've sold out.

00:23:04.941 --> 00:23:06.440
I mean, well, not
sold out-- sorry--

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.820
but we've extended
to November the 17th.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.740
And so we're going for
another month on top

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.040
of what we were meant to do.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.450
That is a treat.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.940
More people get
to see this story.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:26.470
For me, I mean, if you ask about
what the audience feedback has

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.540
been, we wouldn't
be in the West End

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.130
if it weren't for audiences.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.557
You know, they brought us here.

00:23:33.557 --> 00:23:34.390
You know, they came.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.348
And they came to the Bush
and they sold us out.

00:23:36.348 --> 00:23:38.260
You know, and then
they extended us,

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:42.840
and then they were the ones who
were demanding that they wanted

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.780
more "Misty" because their
family members hadn't

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.280
come to see it, and because
of like, more people need to.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.020
And so that would
be the kind of--

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.510
for me, that's number one.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:24:00.580
Because if there's no demand,
then what do you have?

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.860
So that's why we're
there in the West End.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:06.910
And then on the nightly
basis, you know, it's good.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:08.750
The play is really--

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:12.430
I mean, it's a play that I
get to play with the audience

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:13.060
every night.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:13.559
You know?

00:24:13.559 --> 00:24:15.150
I break the fourth wall.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:18.700
You know, I talk to you
guys about something.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.210
If stuff gets weird
in the theater--

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:24.370
which sometimes it does--

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:29.560
I have the capacity to stop
the scene and to engage.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.675
And so yeah, it's
been really special.

00:24:34.675 --> 00:24:35.620
You know?

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.150
It's really like, I can't--

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:43.270
I mean, I think we all
struggle to describe "Misty,"

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.190
including my director, as well.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:49.060
Because it's so different
on every night, because

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:55.390
of this kind of relationship
that I have with the theater,

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:58.630
and what the audience are
giving me at that time.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:02.650
Because I'm clowning a little
bit in that show, as well.

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:06.640
And just like a small
element like that

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.660
can change everything.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.360
Because with clowning,
you're responding to what

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.860
an audience is giving you.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.350
And so like, if
you're really loving

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.080
when I do this thing
tonight, then I

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.440
might go a little bit further.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.801
And if you love it even more,
then I'll go even further.

00:25:21.801 --> 00:25:24.050
And if you love even more,
then I'll go even further--

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.330
until the point where--

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.321
I mean, and literally,
we're milking it.

00:25:27.321 --> 00:25:27.820
You know?

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:30.280
But that's the thing.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:30.780
You know?

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.340
And we've had quite a
few of those moments

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:37.430
where the difference between
one scene the night before

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:39.590
and that night is
like, night and day.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:43.210
You know, it's because of
the audience are giving me

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.290
something, I'm responding
to it in the moment.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:47.380
SPEAKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.791
That definitely was the
impression I got when I saw it.

00:25:49.791 --> 00:25:50.290
Yeah.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:50.790
I like it.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.690
I'd specifically use a
word like captivating.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.090
Because when I was wondering
in my head like gosh, you know.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:57.520
Also, you do this every single--
like, eight shows a week.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.660
Right?

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.394
But it felt very much like
your energy was just like,

00:26:01.394 --> 00:26:02.060
this is one off.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.340
I've never done this before.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.689
So kudos to you on
that, just the energy.

00:26:05.689 --> 00:26:07.480
And it's good to hear
that you kind of read

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.592
and feed off the audience.

00:26:08.592 --> 00:26:10.550
And I think it does make
a holistic experience.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.220
So thank you for that.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.630
ARINZÉ KENE: Thank you.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:16.810
SPEAKER: Shall we
move to Q and A?

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:21.015
Let's move to Q and A. So
there is a mic at the back.

00:26:21.015 --> 00:26:22.640
ARINZÉ KENE: Just
standing there alone.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.223
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:26:23.223 --> 00:26:25.670
So we do need folks to
stand up at the mic.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.010
Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:27.940
So thank you.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:28.440
Yeah.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.650
I should probably
mention that there will

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:30.930
be a mic stand at the back.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:36.130
Wonderful.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:39.690
So if you could state your
name, if you're happy to.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.320
And then, yeah,
question nice and loud.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:41.950
Thank you.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.180
AUDIENCE: My name is [INAUDIBLE]
raised the same way as you

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.180
in Nigeria and Hackney--

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.340
still in Hackney.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.112
So I completely understand
the frustrations

00:26:50.112 --> 00:26:51.820
that you illustrated
throughout the play.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.450
I wanted to ask a few things,
but I'll start with this one.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:27:00.200
The cross media convergence
in the play was incredible.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.660
And I wanted to know, how did
you come up with that idea?

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.469
Because even with the
use of space as well,

00:27:06.469 --> 00:27:08.510
it's unlike anything I've
seen before in my life.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.093
You are literally breaking the
fourth wall with those mediums,

00:27:11.093 --> 00:27:11.610
as well--

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.920
which again, I don't think
I'll ever see anyone do it

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.120
as well as you.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.830
So I wanted to know how
did you come up with that?

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.670
And did you predict
the effect it would

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:24.040
have on the people watching?

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.020
Because it's so seamless.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.072
Yeah.

00:27:27.072 --> 00:27:28.030
ARINZÉ KENE: Thank you.

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:32.180
Yeah, thank you.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.610
Yeah.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.610
I've actually never been
asked so specifically

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.680
that question before.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:50.380
But that is-- as in the
question about predicting what

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.880
an audience would respond to.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:59.380
So we're being smart asses in
"Misty" quite a bit, actually.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.210
So we think you're--

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:02.830
we try and take
you a bit this way.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:04.750
And then oh, you think
you're going that way.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.210
And then things take
a right you know?

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.650
And then we go, all right, cool.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:11.200
We're staying on course for a
bit, and then pull the rug--

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.895
but without making an
audience feel silly.

00:28:13.895 --> 00:28:14.770
You know what I mean?

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:17.876
Because that's a fine line.

00:28:17.876 --> 00:28:20.730
You have to kind of do
it playfully and make

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:25.340
them feel like, ah,
didn't see that coming.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.520
But one of our
ways of doing that

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.335
is through playing
with the form.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:34.860
OK.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:39.401
We got lucky, because "Misty"
is a telling of that story.

00:28:39.401 --> 00:28:39.900
Right?

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:46.260
But we decided-- and by we I
mean me and Omar, my director--

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:51.120
to approach it from a way
where so we're just doing what

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.680
is best to serve the story.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.180
Right?

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.050
So we're not restricted
by any sort of,

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.600
as I mentioned earlier,
pre-existing structures as far

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.870
as what a traditional play looks
like on the page, or wherever.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:08.460
Even if you open
the play text, it

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.500
doesn't look like
a traditional play.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.310
Because we're using
many different mediums.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.540
And as well, the play
text wouldn't even--

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.330
it's not even possible
to completely--

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.765
I mean that doesn't show you--

00:29:22.765 --> 00:29:24.640
you can't read it and
know what the play is.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.820
Because there's performance
art in there, as well,

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.110
that you can't--

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:32.570
I mean, you'd need
100 pages to explain

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:38.620
every thing, every turn that
I do, and repetitive movement,

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.505
or whatever.

00:29:40.505 --> 00:29:41.005
I digress.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:47.550
So because we approached
this from a standpoint

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.810
where we were saying
let's do whatever we can--

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.490
whatever's best in order
to tell the story--

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.350
it meant that some
bits we were like, OK.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.230
Some days you can
do direct address.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:00.830
And some bits you can jump
into song, into number.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.430
And it feels like a gig.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:06.270
And then because of at this
point the writer feels this,

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:09.240
let's just undercut that
and go into this over here.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.780
Now when you're creating
a play that does that,

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.860
you come up against
certain challenges.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:21.780
Certain people might think
oh, it's too experimental.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.360
Will it work, or whatever.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:31.200
And we came up against those,
I guess, types of feedback.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.587
Good feedback, I'd say.

00:30:32.587 --> 00:30:34.170
It's just because
of people, you know,

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.830
they're used to a certain thing.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:39.480
And they would read what
I've written and think,

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.030
oh, I thought this
was a bit jarring.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.570
You know, I don't know.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:46.010
I'm used to reading something
that kind of flows better.

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.930
But "Misty" was,
like every play,

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.410
is written to be performed.

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:50.910
You know?

00:30:50.910 --> 00:31:00.870
And so we knew that we needed to
do some sort of sharing of it.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:05.290
We needed to show you, rather
than send you a script.

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:10.100
And so there was a radar
festival at the end of 2015.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:16.210
The Bush do a festival of
work that is work in progress.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.080
And they also receive work
from outside, as well,

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.170
that might be complete.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:22.957
But as I was on
commission there,

00:31:22.957 --> 00:31:24.540
we thought this is
a great opportunity

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.390
to do 40 minutes
of this crazy ish

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.270
that we've been kind of
throwing around the wall,

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:33.825
and just show people that
actually this might work.

00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:35.700
And we didn't even know
if it'd work, anyway.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.540
But we had a feeling
that it would.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.930
So yeah, we did two performances
to paying audiences.

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:44.850
So that was like,
a normal audience.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:48.687
So it's not like an audience of
peers, or friends, or whatever.

00:31:48.687 --> 00:31:49.270
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:50.010
Honest feedback.

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.570
ARINZÉ KENE: It was
an honest-- yeah.

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:54.750
And we realized that oh,
we have something special.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.370
Let's do more of this.

00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:04.110
And also, as far as kind of
changing me being on stage,

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:07.320
slash, me like a
prerecord or this, that--

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.630
we realized that all
that stuff works.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:11.040
You know?

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.450
And after that sharing,
I think the main kind

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:19.380
of thing we gathered was to go
even further down the rabbit

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.010
hole.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:25.020
And so that's why
we have "Misty."

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.125
And also, we're not
even done with it,

00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:28.590
if I'm honest with you, bro.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:33.720
Like as in this is
where we are now.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.630
But the "Misty" in West
End-- we improved on it.

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.430
With a week's rehearsal,
we improved on

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:40.640
is from when it
was on at The Bush.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.560
Some people come and
see it in the West End

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.610
and say that they
feel like they're

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:45.930
watching it for the first time.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:49.150
It's because we tweaked so much.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:53.010
We changed small things that we
thought people wouldn't notice.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:54.810
But people have come
away and gone like,

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:56.040
that wasn't there before.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.310
That was not there before.

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:57.990
Was it?

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.860
I didn't miss that.

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.460
SPEAKER: They hold you to it.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.590
ARINZÉ KENE: And I think
if it has another leg,

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.820
there's also some more things
out myself and Omar are willing

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.730
to want to put in there.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:09.480
SPEAKER: Fabulous.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.200
Thank you.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.894
Next question?

00:33:11.894 --> 00:33:13.060
We've got time, don't worry.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:13.726
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:33:13.726 --> 00:33:14.700
SPEAKER: Hey.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.880
AUDIENCE: So you've said
that making honest mark

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.380
is really important to you.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.100
And I think you've
always done that.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.250
So I've known you since
you was an artist called

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:24.450
Street Journalist.

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:28.200
I remember listening to the
album and just tweeting you,

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:28.750
I love it.

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:29.250
I love it.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:34.020
Street Journalist, "I am, I
am," is like, my favorite track.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:39.600
Did you ever foresee this
journey from that space?

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.130
So when you were
Street Journalist,

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:45.460
did you foresee this
journey from that space?

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:55.360
ARINZÉ KENE: Firstly,
frickin' gold stars.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:58.110
Wow.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.946
You took me back.

00:34:00.946 --> 00:34:05.380
Street Journalist was my artist
name when I was in a few bands,

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.060
and I used to write rhymes--

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.130
hip hop.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:12.980
Released mix tapes
and stuff in my teens.

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.810
Yeah, yeah.

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:14.620
In my teens.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.370
SPEAKER: And did your
dad know about this?

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:16.949
Did you keep that--

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:17.400
ARINZÉ KENE: Listen.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:17.949
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:19.740
ARINZÉ KENE: He don't
know about this, too.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:27.760
That would have been the
end of Street Journalist.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.171
But, no.

00:34:30.171 --> 00:34:30.670
Yeah.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:31.628
You're right, actually.

00:34:31.628 --> 00:34:35.949
I was honest when I was writing
rhymes when I was a teenager.

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:37.956
I felt like I was being honest.

00:34:37.956 --> 00:34:39.330
Something happened
along the way,

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:43.840
when I got into playwriting,
where I definitely

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.730
took a step away.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:47.860
I feel like with Street
Journalist, I was writing.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:51.219
I was writing for me, as
in the was no character.

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:54.710
You know, it was like that
was the name of the artist.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:56.620
But those were my
words and I was

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.210
speaking about my experiences.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:04.010
And then when you start to
create characters, you know,

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:06.070
I feel like maybe
that was what it was.

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:06.760
Who knows?

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.330
But yeah, I just started
getting a bit phony.

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:15.790
And then I would still say that
I guess the plays I've written

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:16.540
are--

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.820
you know, they have a
lot of my heart in it.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.500
But I definitely know that--

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.640
and a lot of writers will
say this, as well-- but

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.270
some things you write are
more honest than others.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:30.970
And it's just the case where
you can kind of get deeper.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:34.540
I didn't foresee this happening.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.250
In fact, when I
started writing plays,

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:42.990
I think I started
writing when I was 19.

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:46.990
And I actually gave up music.

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:49.480
I kind of stepped back.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.274
I stepped away from it.

00:35:52.274 --> 00:35:53.270
Yeah.

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:58.620
"Misty is the first time I've
put music back into my work.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.680
And I quite like it.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.370
You know, that's why it
was also really quite fun.

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:05.920
It felt like I was
in my bedroom again,

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.780
you know, just kind
of writing bars.

00:36:10.672 --> 00:36:12.190
But no, I didn't see this.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.000
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.340
Yeah, definitely the musical
aspect-- the enjoyment--

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:20.470
I got that impression
that you were really

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:23.740
enjoying it, the music
piece of the performance.

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:24.930
So it was good.

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:26.013
ARINZÉ KENE: I feel lucky.

00:36:26.013 --> 00:36:26.800
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.310
Tony.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.960
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's Tony.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.671
I know--

00:36:29.671 --> 00:36:30.920
ARINZÉ KENE: Your name's Tony?

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:31.270
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:32.110
ARINZÉ KENE: Who are you, man?

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:33.670
AUDIENCE: I know Arinzé
from playing basketball--

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:34.630
ARINZÉ KENE: We go way back.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.380
AUDIENCE: --when I
first moved to London.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.120
Great guy.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.286
Not a great basketball
player, but we're not going--

00:36:39.286 --> 00:36:40.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.480
I'm just kidding.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.690
I'm kidding.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:44.230
But one thing I do want to say--

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.938
I got to see the show
a couple weeks ago.

00:36:45.938 --> 00:36:47.620
It was excellent.

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:49.260
It was interesting.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:50.844
I was excited to
come see you perform.

00:36:50.844 --> 00:36:52.926
I'd seen you in the "Girl
from the North Country."

00:36:52.926 --> 00:36:54.160
I was excited to see this.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.390
I was a bit skeptical.

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:58.120
I was like, it's going to be
you for however many hours,

00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.500
or however many years.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.870
I was like, what's this
going to feel like?

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.230
But I think the
real testament to it

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.960
was when we got to
the intermission.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.434
And my partner was there, and
she had a half a drink left.

00:37:10.434 --> 00:37:11.350
And she was like, wow.

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:12.670
I didn't even drink this.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:14.620
And she's Scottish, and
that was a big thing.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:19.180
So we were absolutely
captivated, right?

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:19.946
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:19.946 --> 00:37:22.520
She's going to kill me
for telling that story.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:25.120
But the one thing I do want to
say, or I want to ask you by

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:29.710
is around the comedy
aspect-- the humor to it.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:32.980
I personally find there's
one particular song in it

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:36.820
that I was like,
really taken back by.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.560
And I was in it,
and I was really

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.990
kind of upset, challenged
thinking about it.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:44.290
It was pretty hard
going, and you're talking

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:45.730
about some serious issues.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:48.790
And then you jump to an
interesting kind of scene,

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:51.580
just before the intermission for
those that have seen it-- where

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.255
you add humor and comedy to it.

00:37:53.255 --> 00:37:54.880
So I'm really interested
in the journey

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.840
around how you effectively
try and use humor

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.160
to kind of soften that blow.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.440
Or what's the thinking behind
using comedy alongside very,

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.610
very serious issues?

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:05.770
ARINZÉ KENE: Yeah.

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:08.061
That's a really good question.

00:38:08.061 --> 00:38:08.560
Yeah.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:14.680
It's just weird.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:15.180
It's Tony.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.236
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:16.236 --> 00:38:18.190
It's Tony from the courts.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.061
You know, I'm just--

00:38:19.061 --> 00:38:20.560
SPEAKER: He's asking
you a question.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.280
ARINZÉ KENE: I'm just used to
playing basketball with Tony.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.900
No.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:29.640
First of all, I'd just like to
say that I'm coming back from

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.200
my frickin' mate--

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.470
I'm coming back to the courts.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:35.270
I haven't been for a while, and
Tony's getting pretty cocky.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.770
You know?

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:36.235
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:38:36.235 --> 00:38:36.734
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:36.734 --> 00:38:39.430
ARINZÉ KENE: And I think he's
forgotten about my crossover.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:41.835
So I'm coming back
to lace you, mate.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:46.140
No.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.598
I love playing
basketball with you.

00:38:47.598 --> 00:38:52.990
But yeah, I guess it's
like music, isn't it?

00:38:52.990 --> 00:39:00.100
So we definitely know what we're
doing whenever we kind of take

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.530
an audience.

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:03.370
It's like we kind of
grab them by the hair,

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.920
and then we take 'em, take 'em,
take 'em under, deep, deep.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.830
And then it's like,
it's really dark.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:13.630
And then we just kind of go
woo, and just pull them up.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:17.630
And then they're
gasping for air.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:19.300
We do that a lot in the play.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:24.820
We undercut quite serious
moments with levity,

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:29.700
with humor, with something
quite absurd or unexpected.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.510
And we did it a few times.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:36.877
And the reason why is because
we know that audiences

00:39:36.877 --> 00:39:37.710
like how that feels.

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:43.820
You get to purge, don't you?

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.860
You know, you get
to kind of just--

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:49.730
you know, you kind
of go, oh, man.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:50.570
Woo!

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:52.010
Well, that wasn't-- yeah.

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:55.970
I mean, I'm glad that
I'm in there anymore.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:57.820
And it's playful.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:58.810
It's a dance.

00:39:58.810 --> 00:39:59.880
You know?

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:05.170
The comedy, as well, the
humor, and the clowning,

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:10.570
and the absurdity, and also
some of the surreal moments

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.750
that feel quite comical--

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.400
those are things that we--

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:23.710
well, as a performer I
want to be doing more of.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:28.480
In my work, I haven't been given
the chance to a great deal.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.794
But I love comedy.

00:40:30.794 --> 00:40:31.960
I love to make people laugh.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.190
I think that when you do--

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:36.880
So another thing that we've
realized is that when you do

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:43.550
make them laugh, then
you could actually--

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:44.390
I'm saying them.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.780
I mean, fuck it.

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:51.590
But with story, it's
a give and a take.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:52.330
You know?

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:58.170
And you don't have
to do anything.

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:09.560
I like to entertain and then
educate, or entertain and then

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.690
challenge.

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:12.361
And that's it.

00:41:12.361 --> 00:41:12.860
You know?

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:21.290
It's like, you know, sometimes I
see as basic as a boxing match.

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:21.890
You know?

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:24.170
So you get your three
minutes in the ring,

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:25.807
and then you get rest.

00:41:25.807 --> 00:41:27.140
And that rest feels really nice.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:32.000
You know, you get some
sugary drink and some old man

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:32.960
rubbing your shoulders.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.609
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:33.609 --> 00:41:35.900
And you're getting told in
your ears that you're great.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.750
You know?

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:42.230
And you know that
there's more to go.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.430
There's a longer fight.

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:47.650
And with audiences, it's
like there's a push and pull.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:50.210
And that's how I like
to tell a story, anyway.

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:54.200
I like to talk about
something that's meaningful.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.780
I like to challenge something
that is very often quite

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.760
a difficult challenge for me.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.940
But then while I'm
doing it, I always

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.557
ask are they being entertained.

00:42:04.557 --> 00:42:05.140
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:07.299
And comedy can
really build rapport.

00:42:07.299 --> 00:42:09.590
And then you can talk about
the more meaningful things.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:10.000
ARINZÉ KENE: Start
building rapport.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:10.980
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.480
Thank you.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.247
That's awesome.

00:42:12.247 --> 00:42:14.330
We'll go with final question,
if that's all right.

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:15.290
And then we'll wrap up.

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.120
Because we've got
a show to go to.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:17.726
Hello, hi.

00:42:17.726 --> 00:42:18.600
AUDIENCE: Hi, Arinzé.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.780
My name is Ivan.

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.640
I had a question
around-- so I'm really

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.360
interesting in the
creative process.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.520
And what advice would
you give in someone

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.520
that's creating something--
it could be anything.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.200
How do you manage
your mindset, and then

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.350
to go you're trying to achieve?

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:38.030
So basically, just
what is your advice

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:39.863
in terms of going through
this crazy process

00:42:39.863 --> 00:42:40.660
to produce "Misty?"

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.460
ARINZÉ KENE: If I could
say one thing only,

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:47.750
it would be start
before you're ready.

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:54.170
Because everyone-- everyone--

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:57.200
myself, yes, always
waiting for a moment.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.350
You know?

00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:01.190
We're waiting until I'm smart
enough to tell that story,

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:04.730
or until I know enough about
that subject to tell a story,

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:09.140
or until I feel whatever,
or whatever, until my son

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.650
graduates.

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:13.321
You can be waiting forever.

00:43:13.321 --> 00:43:13.820
You know?

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.040
Just start.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.390
Just kick off.

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:21.650
Find out what-- in whichever
way you choose to do it.

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:25.000
Whether it's that you want to--

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.400
you set a very basic goal for
yourself and say, OK, cool.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.610
Let me just write one
line of this thing, first.

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:34.250
Or whether it's like
you go, all right, cool.

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:38.630
I'm going to write the
end of the play now.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:42.520
Or if it's a play, or whatever.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.680
That would be why would say if
I had one thing-- just start.

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:52.880
Because I feel like if you
have a creative mind, one

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.170
of the best things--

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:56.210
one of the things
that are incredibly

00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:59.250
useful for the
creative mind is doubt.

00:43:59.250 --> 00:43:59.750
Right?

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:04.580
And the reason why my opinion,
is because without doubt you

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.420
wouldn't have scrutiny.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:11.270
And I think in order to
scrutinize your work, in order

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:13.160
to interrogate it yourself--

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:16.910
that's what makes good work.

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:19.292
You have to test it.

00:44:19.292 --> 00:44:23.240
However, that is also the
thing that prevents people

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.385
from making work--

00:44:25.385 --> 00:44:30.320
over testing, or interrogating
it too much before

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.510
you've even begun.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:38.910
So while that doubt is
incredibly valuable,

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:41.722
don't let it prevent
you from beginning.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.240
SPEAKER: Fabulous.

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:50.470
So one final question
to close out.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:52.090
What's next for you?

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:56.110
And people can go look on and
IMDB for what's up next for you

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:57.250
in terms of your role.

00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:00.240
But share with us one
dream or one aspiration.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.490
What do you really want to do?

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.810
Just share an
aspiration with us.

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:06.512
I'm putting you
on the spot here.

00:45:06.512 --> 00:45:07.470
ARINZÉ KENE: I feel it.

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:08.534
I can feel it.

00:45:08.534 --> 00:45:09.200
I'm on the spot.

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.116
SPEAKER: We have time.

00:45:12.384 --> 00:45:13.300
ARINZÉ KENE: Just one?

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:19.350
Yeah.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:23.850
Creatively, to be even more--

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:27.610
to tell even just one
story, one more story,

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:31.530
where I've been as honest
as I have been there.

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:32.930
I'd be very happy.

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:36.060
I'll be incredibly
happy-- just one more.

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:40.042
Because for me, that is the--

00:45:40.042 --> 00:45:41.700
that's why "Misty"
has been the hardest

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.410
thing I've ever done, ever.

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:46.920
Because of being so open.

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.990
Yeah.

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:51.270
And, you know, I actually
have a story in mind

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:55.990
that I plan to be
as honest with,

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:57.830
and I keep chickening out.

00:45:57.830 --> 00:45:58.940
You know?

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:02.400
Because even knowing this--
like, even knowing that--

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:15.070
knowing that I have to be
brave to tell that story,

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:17.240
doesn't make you
brave to tell a story.

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:17.740
You know?

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:18.340
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.620
ARINZÉ KENE: I still have
to kind of work my way up.

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:23.530
At the moment, I know what
I'm doing by procrastinating.

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:26.490
I'm kind of like, putting a
team together and going oh,

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:29.045
let's meet this
composer and let's--

00:46:29.045 --> 00:46:30.920
SPEAKER: Getting the
infrastructure in place.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.160
ARINZÉ KENE: I really
want that director.

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:32.415
Yeah.

00:46:32.415 --> 00:46:34.680
SPEAKER: But you're not
focusing on actually the core.

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:34.940
ARINZÉ KENE: No.

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:35.770
SPEAKER: I think that's fair.

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:37.320
ARINZÉ KENE: I'm kind
of like, messing around.

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:37.822
You know?

00:46:37.822 --> 00:46:39.280
I'm playing with
my food, you know?

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.095
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:46:40.095 --> 00:46:41.302
Yeah.

00:46:41.302 --> 00:46:43.760
ARINZÉ KENE: But yeah, that
would be great, man-- you know,

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.480
for that one, anyway.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.477
If I can be brave.

00:46:46.477 --> 00:46:47.060
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.640
Well, I mean, you've
definitely set the foundation

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:49.210
with "Misty."

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:52.660
So I think it's probably
very achievable.

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:55.140
I think many, many
people around the world

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.030
would probably really value
that, appreciate that, and look

00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.730
forward to that.

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:00.520
So some people might
hold you to that.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.920
But I'm wishing you
all the luck with that.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.880
In the meantime,
"Misty," fantastic.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.130
Have a wonderful show tonight.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:06.490
ARINZÉ KENE: Thank you.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:07.390
SPEAKER: Thank you
for coming to see us.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:08.810
Please come see us again.

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:09.680
ARINZÉ KENE: I will.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.930
SPEAKER: It's been a pleasure.

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:11.290
Yeah.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:12.123
Come see Tony again.

00:47:12.123 --> 00:47:13.076
ARINZÉ KENE: Yeah.

00:47:13.076 --> 00:47:13.739
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:13.739 --> 00:47:15.030
SPEAKER: Big round of applause.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.170
Thank you so much.

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:15.430
ARINZÉ KENE: Cheers.

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:16.304
Thanks for having me.

00:47:16.304 --> 00:47:19.240
[APPLAUSE]
