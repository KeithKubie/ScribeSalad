00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.840
Welcome back.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.960
I now want to play a little
bit of devil's

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.190
advocate with myself.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.860
I made this argument where
I show that for the exact

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.590
identical house, if these are
the numbers -- I mean you'd

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.430
have to work it out based on
your market, and what the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.530
numbers are at the time.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.600
But if this is the comparable
rent for a $1 million house, I

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.220
showed you that for the $1
million house you're burning

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.070
$40,000 a year.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.110
This is not money that is
going to build equity.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.400
This not money that's going to
the principal of your house.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.390
This is money that just going
out of your pocket, you'll

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.320
never see again.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.130
In a way, and actually not in
a way, in reality, you can

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.390
view this $40,000 as rent on the
money that you borrowed.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.460
Interest is nothing but rent.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.150
So when you have an asset, if
the asset is cash, the rent on

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.390
it is interest. If the asset is
a house, the rent on it is

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.120
your monthly rent payment.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.880
So when you think of it this
way, when people say home

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.010
ownership, they really aren't
homeowners yet.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.000
You're not a homeowner until
you don't have debt.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.870
You are a money renter.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.950
So your choice is either to be
a money renter here, or to be

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.220
a house renter here.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.200
And I show that you are burning

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.590
almost double the money.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.530
But then there's the argument of
well, there are advantages,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.830
still, to buying this house.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.090
And what are they?

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.200
Well one example is, in this
situation, if I did get a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.200
fixed-rate mortgage -- and we
learned, when you look at all

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.146
those adjustable-rate mortgages,
we know that a lot

00:01:16.146 --> 00:01:17.040
of people didn't.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.550
But if I have a fixed-rate
mortgage, I know what my

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.920
payment is for the foreseeable
future, for the next 30 years.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.470
While my landlord, in this
case, they could

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.960
keep raising my rent.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.260
So this might look good right
now, but what if my landlord

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.590
raised the rent to, I don't
know, $3,500 a month.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.300
Well then, out of your pocket,
0.5 times 12, you'd be

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.210
spending $42,000 a year.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.270
And then of course you get the
interest from the money that

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.050
you put in the bank.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.050
Plus 10.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.410
Oh, minus 10 actually, sorry.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.280
So in that case, if the rent
goes up, then out of your

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.250
pocket is $32,000 every year.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.910
Right?

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.060
Or what if the interest that
you get on your cash in the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.950
bank goes down?

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.870
Then this $10,000 thousand
will become lower.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.720
But as we can see, the rent
would have to go up a lot to

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.650
make up for $41,000, to make
this a break-even situation.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.840
Let's figure out how much
it would have to go up.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.130
So in this first scenario, in
order for your net outflow to

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.940
be $41,500, assuming you're
getting $10,000 from the money

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.560
in the bank, your rent would
have to be $51,500.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.675
Right?

00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:35.130
Because you're getting $10,000
from the bank.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:45.400
And so divided by 12, your rent
would have to be $4,300

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.290
in this situation to make this
a break-even proposition.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.180
This is another way
to view it.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.540
If I were to buy the house,
and if I were to move, how

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.100
much would I have to rent this
house out for, in order to not

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.360
be losing money every month?

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.750
Well I would have to rent it out
for $4,300 a month, even

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.130
though maybe the market rents
are only at $3,000.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.440
And there is another devil's
advocate argument.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.390
And that's, well, housing -- and
this is something that you

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.300
heard a lot about
three years ago.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.730
And a lot of these people aren't
talking as much now.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.780
But they would say, housing has
never -- housing has done

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.550
nothing but gone up, and I will
build equity just from

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.990
housing appreciation.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.190
So how much does my house have
to appreciate every year?

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:36.890
Well, to make up this
difference-- $41,500 minus

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:45.180
26-- so to make up that $15,500
difference every year,

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.960
this is $15,500 favorable.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.360
My house would have to
appreciate by a comparable

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.570
amount, right?

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.530
So how much appreciation
is that on my house?

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.270
Well that's a $1 million
house, right?

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.590
So $15,500 appreciation
on a $1 million house.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.690
I'm doing everything in
thousands, so 1,000 thousands

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.705
is a million.

00:04:04.705 --> 00:04:07.760
So that's only 1.5%
appreciation.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.450
So if my house appreciates by
1.5%, that's it-- 1.5%.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.440
If my house just appreciates by
1.5%, I'm going to make up

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.899
this $15,500.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.019
And so it is worth it for me.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.110
It is worth it for me to blow
this money by having kind of

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.900
an increased -- by renting the
money for more than I would

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.970
have to pay to rent the house.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.330
And that might sound like a very
reasonable proposition,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.780
that the house will appreciate
by 1.5%.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.060
From 2001 to 2005, 2006, houses
were appreciating like

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.900
10%, 15% a year.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.350
So it seemed -- and a real
estate agent would often do

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.260
this very math with you, and
say, well, you're definitely

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.470
going to get 1.5%.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.410
In fact, you're probably going
to get 10% appreciation.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.950
And you're going to make
much more than this.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.590
But think about, in the
presentation of the balance

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.210
sheet and leverage, what happens
if housing prices go

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.290
down by 1.5%?

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.240
What happens if it's
minus 1.5%?

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.740
Well, then you're going to spend
this much to rent the

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.390
money, right?

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.870
And you're not going
to gain this much.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.690
You're going to lose this
much every year.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.220
And so the proposition
becomes even worse.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.280
So this is a big deal.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.540
Now that, I think, on a
nationwide basis, a lot of the

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.470
housing indices show that
housing prices have gone down,

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.560
I think by 6%.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.280
That's what the Case-Shiller
index says.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.600
6% is a lot.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.980
Especially on a $1 million
house, that's $60,000 a year

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.130
that's just evaporating.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.990
That's wealth that someone
thought they had, that's just

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.690
disappearing out of
their equity.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.880
So this is rationale of pay more
to rent the money for a

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.140
house than to rent the
house is justified if

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.270
housing prices go up.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.610
It becomes 10 times worse when
housing prices are flat.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.240
Or, God forbid, if housing
prices actually go down.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.270
And now we see that housing
prices actually go down.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.150
In the last couple of years
especially, in the areas

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.170
where, like the Bay Area, or
Florida, or California,

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.690
especially Southern California,

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.760
where this is happening.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.560
And back even two or three years
ago, when people used to

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.020
make this argument.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.460
People used to make the
argument, well you know, my

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.290
house just has to go up 1% or
2% percent, and I'm going to

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.500
make up the difference.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.000
I'd say well, why is
your house going to

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.430
go up 1% or 2% percent?

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.750
I mean, there has to be some
reason why next year someone's

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.420
willing to pay 2% more
for that house.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.880
Is it because rents are going
up 2% a year, so the income

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.650
stream is going to
be 2% higher?

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.150
And actually in the Bay Area,
from 2001 to roughly 2003,

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.440
rents were going down.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.760
And there were actually
people moving out.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.610
All the tech workers were
getting laid off.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.640
You had a lot of programming
jobs being outsourced to India

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.580
and wherever else.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.025
So you had this whole situation
where the population

00:06:35.025 --> 00:06:36.570
was actually decreasing.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.500
Demand for housing
was going down.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.280
But for some reason housing
prices were going up.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.210
So people said well, they've
been going up for the last

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.260
five years, so they'll
continue.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.760
And they've never gone down,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.450
But it didn't make an
economic argument.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.960
And I'll show in a future video
that the only reason why

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.230
housing prices did go up is that
it just became easier and

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.300
easier and easier
to buy a house.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.830
The standards that banks used
for giving out a loan became

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.730
lower and lower and lower.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.430
There are actually examples in
Southern California, and in

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.790
San Jose and some of the
suburbs, where people who had

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.930
incomes of $30,000 or
$40,000 a year.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.360
The bank actually gave them a
$1 million loan to buy a $1

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.700
million house, based
on stated income.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.900
There's things called stated
income loans, where you just

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.600
tell the bank what you earn.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.070
You don't have to prove
it to them.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.540
And so every year that went by,
it just became easier and

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.560
easier and easier.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.910
More and more people just
thought that housing always

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:30.480
appreciates.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.610
So that's why they want to pay
more and more to essentially

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.380
rent the money for a house.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.360
And this became a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.720
But as we see on the
way down, it works

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.800
completely against you.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.240
So in the situation where we
are now, where nationwide

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.360
housing prices are actually
declining-- and actually they

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.530
will decline until this
rent-versus-buy equation

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:54.270
starts to make a little bit more
sense-- it really hurts

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.220
the home buyer.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.100
And what's even worse, and this
is kind of adding insult

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:03.330
to injury, is that this guy,
if I bought this house, and

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.250
all of a sudden I lose my job,
and I can't pay the house

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.260
back, I might lose my entire
$250,000 down payment because

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.750
maybe I can't sell the
house, or the house

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.470
is selling for less.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.770
Or maybe I want to move, and
there's no one out there who

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.070
can buy a house because the
banks all of a sudden got

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.930
smart again, and realized that
they should become more

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.170
serious in terms of who
they give money to.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.170
And so I'm stuck holding this
house, and my flexibility in

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.950
terms of where I can
move is limited.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.330
Actually a friend of mine was
telling me that they've

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.020
actually done studies.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.760
And there's a correlation
between

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.440
unemployment and home ownership.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.309
Because when you own a home, you
have less flexibility in

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:37.110
looking for a job.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.530
If I have a house in San Jose
but there's a job in LA, I

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.049
might not be able to take
that job because I

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:42.919
can't sell my house.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.910
Or I might not even want to
look for a job in LA.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:49.340
While the renter, of course,
my lease ends and I leave.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.870
So this is just a rough sense
of the rent versus buy.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.490
And I know I get very
impassioned about this.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.710
But that's just because
I explain this a lot.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.850
And when I'm at parties and
I start talking about the

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.520
calculations, people's
eyes glaze over.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.190
But I made this video now
and I'll just tell

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.010
people to watch it.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.950
See you in the next video.
