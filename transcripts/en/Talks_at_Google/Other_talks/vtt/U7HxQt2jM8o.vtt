TOM OGREN: I'm Tom Ogren.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.290
And I'm the author
of a number of books

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.910
on plants and allergies.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.360
And I've been studying this
for more than 30 years now.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.850
And the question I'm asked
most often is, how did I

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.510
get into this and why?

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.450
Do I have terrible allergies?

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.600
And I don't.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.920
But I've been married 48
years to the same lady.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.460
Her name's Yvonne.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.790
And she was 15 when I met her.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.680
And she was having
allergies and asthma.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.880
And that's how come she
wasn't able to run away.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.440
The asthma was slowing her down.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.940
But at some point in our life
we were buying another house.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.380
And I had in my mind it
would be nice if I could--

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.440
the landscape didn't impress me.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.677
I was a horticulturalist
and a horticulture teacher

00:00:56.677 --> 00:00:57.385
and a landscaper.

00:00:57.385 --> 00:00:59.770
And I thought, what
if I landscape this so

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.930
nothing in this yard will
ever make Yvonne sick,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.880
so at least she'll have
her own cocooned area.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.840
And the more I thought about
it, the better I liked the idea.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.550
And so I went out to buy a
book on allergy-free gardening.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.690
And the first librarian I asked
about it was at a university.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.310
And she laughed.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.150
And I said, well,
what's so funny?

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.770
And she said, well
it's the gardens

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.280
that cause all the allergies.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.400
But I had already learned
a few things by that point.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.090
And I had learned at some
plants did and some didn't.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.490
I didn't know all of
that at all, believe me.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.650
But I had been doing sniff
tests with my students

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.070
teaching landscape
gardening in a prison.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.760
And we didn't beat
them or anything

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.050
to make them do the sniff.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.840
It was voluntary
and I did it myself.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.420
But the very first plant--
in fact, the thing that

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.780
got the idea in my head
is my sister Rachel,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.860
she lives in Berkeley.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.250
She likes to get me
to come up and do

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.570
landscaping work for free
whenever she can, you know?

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.800
She's got her own expert
and the price is right.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.725
And so I was up there
doing some work for her

00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:27.436
and put in water lines
and so on in Berkeley.

00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:28.560
And everybody was sneezing.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.550
It was spring time.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.870
And she was having asthma.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.514
And a week later,
I was driving home.

00:02:36.514 --> 00:02:37.680
And I was thinking about it.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.735
I live in San Luis Obispo.

00:02:39.735 --> 00:02:41.060
And I was thinking about.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.490
And I thought, you know--
because at this point

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.320
I was still thinking
allergies were psychosomatic,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.640
because I had read
a book by an MD

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.050
about psychosomatic illnesses.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.920
And he basically claimed that
asthma and allergies were

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.950
a head trip and that if you
really had your act together

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.960
you wouldn't have them.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.340
And since I didn't have them,
I believed it, you know.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.800
So I would tell
my poor wife when

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.246
she'd have an
asthma attack, well,

00:03:09.246 --> 00:03:10.835
why don't you get
your act together?

00:03:10.835 --> 00:03:12.200
It's just a terrible thing.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.070
And so when I finally
did get into it,

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.700
I felt very guilty, of course.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.630
But the moment, that sort
of ah moment when I suddenly

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.510
felt guilty was I'm driving
back from Rachel's to San Luis

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.010
Obispo.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.210
And I'm thinking of this.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.962
And I thought, what-- and
I knew nothing, really.

00:03:29.962 --> 00:03:30.920
I knew a lot of plants.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.086
I was a good horticulturist.

00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:33.436
But I knew nothing.

00:03:33.436 --> 00:03:37.230
I thought, what if we go with
my students and we all sniff,

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.990
we start one flower and
everybody in the class sniffs.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.540
We do another, and we record,
see if anything does anything.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.415
And so I explained it to
the class on Monday morning.

00:03:47.415 --> 00:03:48.290
They were like, yeah.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.650
Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.930
Let's try it.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.080
And so the first flower
we ever did was pansies.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.350
And everybody in the whole
class, maybe 30 guys,

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.000
they all sniffed
pansies, including me.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.665
Nothing.

00:04:00.665 --> 00:04:03.280
And we did some double dianthus.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.680
And everybody sniffed it.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.300
Nothing.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.840
And already I'm thinking, see,
direct right in their face,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.530
nothing.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.610
And then they were growing
a bunch of bottlebrush

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.380
and we had them in gallon cans.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.250
They're flowering.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.864
And I sniffed it, nothing.

00:04:17.864 --> 00:04:21.350
And my foreman
sniffed it, nothing.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.770
Gave it to this one
big muscle-bound,

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.240
tattooed tough guy
and he sniffed it.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.020
And he sneezed so
hard, it like almost

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.030
knocked everybody
including him down.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.120
And everybody was
like, whoa, you know.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.870
And everybody thought
it was really funny.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.700
But by the time we
went around the class,

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.610
I think we had a
dozen guys sneezing.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.330
And this was on Monday.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.550
And they don't give you
Allegra or Zyrtec or Claritin

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.250
in the prison.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.110
And on Friday,
some of these guys

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.700
were still sneezing,
off of one direct sniff

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.940
off that bottlebrush.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.670
Now as soon as that
happened, I was like,

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.155
oh, this is not psychosomatic.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.070
This isn't something just
most-- and the doctor

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.490
had said it mostly
affected women,

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.670
because they were hysterical,
or prone to hysteria.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.890
And for years I would never even
admit this part of the story,

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.440
because I found it
embarrassing, as I should have.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.550
But I guess enough
time has passed.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.610
But that was my motivation.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.240
And so when they laughed at
me about a book about it,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.270
I thought, well, I'll
just figure it out myself.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.140
And I started studying.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.730
This was pre-computers,
and I soon

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.550
had stacks and stacks of
things off my typewriters.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.140
And then people started
finding I was doing this work.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.890
And so they would ask
me about some plant.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.305
I would have to dig through
all these unorganized files.

00:05:51.305 --> 00:05:53.410
And at one point, I
decided I was just

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.110
going to start doing all
the landscape plants A to Z

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.280
if it took me 10 years.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.760
And it took me 12 years, A to Z.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.340
And somewhere along
the line I decided

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.690
I would rank them, 1
to 10, every plant.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.775
I developed this
whole criteria list

00:06:10.775 --> 00:06:14.780
that would use close to
140 different criteria.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.650
And that's called OPALS.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.639
And so a person could
know no horticulture.

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.180
They could see the
name of the plant,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.470
look it up, see it's
an OPALS 3, 1 being

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.480
the best, 10 being the worst.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.360
They could go, ah, 3,
I could live with that.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.750
And that's simplified it.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.130
My brother Paul told me,
yeah, get some laughs.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.550
Well, I'm doing better at
that than I expected already.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.440
Anyhow, I started
thinking about it.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.900
And I'll get in depth
here in a minute.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.260
But I started thinking
about this talk.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:51.799
And I thought, well,
I'm getting to the point

00:06:51.799 --> 00:06:53.340
where I've been
studying this so long

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.920
and I've given so
many talks on it

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.820
and I have been published on
it in "The New York Times,"

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.660
last week in
"Scientific American."

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.910
I've been published
three, four times

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.725
in "New Scientist," all
sorts of great publications

00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:10.350
and everything.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.680
And things are
starting to happen.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.560
But I'm getting impatient.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.630
And I thought, well,
I'm coming to Google.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.540
And Google is known to hire the
brainiest people in the world,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.790
and then to coddle them with
free lunches and free lattes

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.450
and stuff, you know.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.440
And I noticed when I was
getting my coffee that there

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.160
was a-- or somewhere
here, yeah, there

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.949
was a little sign about
allergens in your food.

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:38.240
And I thought, well, you
know, that's worth mentioning.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.906
They're worried about
the food allergens

00:07:39.906 --> 00:07:43.614
but nobody seems to care about
the allergens in the air.

00:07:43.614 --> 00:07:45.030
And by the way,
the food allergens

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.110
are all related to
the pollen allergens.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.820
That's usually how you end up
getting the food allergens.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.230
They're all cross-reactive.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:57.610
And so I thought the focus in
my mental head about this talk

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.380
is going to be to
challenge Google.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:05.700
So Google, I
challenge Google here.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.610
I'm quite serious about it.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.320
I talk to people
and I say, OK, I'm

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.550
going to give a Google talk.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.360
And they go like,
oh, that's awesome.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.380
And you ask people what
do they think about Google

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.690
and they say, innovative.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.410
They say, really smart.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:26.830
They say, make things happen.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.910
They say, they like a challenge.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:36.900
And so my challenge would be
we take this very complicated

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.429
Google landscape-- and I
came up here a few weeks ago

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.900
and spent some
time looking at it.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.090
And we take this very
complicated, actually quite

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.320
allergenic landscape
and we transform it

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:55.930
into the most allergy-friendly
landscape in California,

00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:00.790
the most allergy-friendly
landscape in the United States,

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.850
the most healthiest,
allergy-friendly landscape

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:05.770
in the entire world.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.450
And we do it right
here at Google so

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.050
that the people
that work at Google

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.570
will be the ones that
benefit the most.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.000
Now as I get into this, you'll
see that my talk is a lot more

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.300
than just about allergies.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.570
Not to minimize allergies,
for people that have

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.450
them they can be miserable.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.720
Fire away there, Stewart.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.570
All right.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.128
That's a picture I took.

00:09:30.128 --> 00:09:32.520
The pollen didn't
come from my house.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.330
This is at my house.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.880
And in the background,
by the way,

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.650
there's the largest
dawn redwood,

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:42.700
Metasequoia glyptostroboides
in the entire United

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.860
States in my front yard.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.400
It's cracking my
foundation and everything.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.710
I can't do anything about it.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.260
It's ruining my sewer pipes.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.000
But it's the biggest one
in the United States.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.080
And the pollen comes
off-- this thing

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.260
was parked next to a row of male
juniper bushes that showered it

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.470
and-- OK, flip, Stewart.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.400
The story behind this.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.590
Two years ago, Johnson
&amp; Johnson hired

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.690
me to drive-- to go
coast to coast in Canada

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:19.220
and do an allergy audit
of their urban forests

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.180
in the 11 largest cities.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.600
So I start on Vancouver
Island and I drove my truck

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.820
all the way to Halifax.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.980
And in each city I
spent a week or two just

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.730
walking around with a
clipboard and a camera

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.130
and binoculars for looking
up in these tall trees,

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.250
and sexing trees.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:40.630
And I was in a hotel
room in Toronto.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.520
Now an ash tree is
a big massive tree.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.210
There are literally thousands
of them right here at Google.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.340
And they're separate sex,
so one tree is all male

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.410
and one is all female.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.260
Probably 99% of them
at Google are male.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.830
The males produce the
pollen, not the females.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.420
So I picked a couple of
these little clusters

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.571
that were not shedding pollen.

00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:04.110
I brought them up
to my hotel room

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.830
and I set them on
a piece of paper.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:13.020
And I printed out something,
or maybe they did that.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.640
But the next day when I gave
them a little tap, that's

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.380
how it looked.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.200
That's how much pollen
was just coming off

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.630
a couple of little clusters.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:26.440
Now, on a big tree, there's tens
of thousands of these clusters.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.360
Fire away.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.290
All right.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.340
I threw this up here
because I'm not an MD.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.415
I'm not a PhD.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.060
I'm a horticulturalist
with extreme deep interest

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.030
in health and allergies.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.200
But I've been
shopping the new book.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.380
And I guess we can
only see part of this.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:54.780
But these are some very,
very good big time allergists

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:59.320
around the world that are pretty
much saying that my work is

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.180
right on the money.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.550
But you notice it says,
alternative and complementary

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.300
approach to this.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.050
And I'm not trying to take the
place of doctors or anything,

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:10.980
believe me.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.800
But this is an alternative.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.740
And it is complementary.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.260
It will make everything
better big time.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:19.945
Go for that.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:28.775
Botanical sexism is what I'm--
I'm credited with discovering

00:12:28.775 --> 00:12:30.710
a number of things.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.900
And one of them is
botanical sexism.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.090
And this is the fact
that every time they

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.280
could make a choice between a
male and female bush or tree

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.290
in the cities, pretty
much everywhere

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:46.879
in the civilized world, from
New Zealand to Nova Scotia,

00:12:46.879 --> 00:12:48.170
they always went with the male.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:52.670
And that's because the females
drop seeds or pods or fruits

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.070
or something.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.620
But the males drop stuff too.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.950
This is a male cedar tree.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:01.082
And that's pollen on the ground.

00:13:01.082 --> 00:13:04.580
I'm not going to get
too technical here,

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.240
but-- I guess I won't
even have a chance,

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.400
if Stewart doesn't let me.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.970
But there's basically
three types of flowers.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.160
And actually there's
20, but I'm not

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.180
going to get into
the fine details.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.605
There's perfect-flowered,
like a rose bush.

00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:23.275
You've got male and
female in the same flower.

00:13:23.275 --> 00:13:26.450
A bee only has to move the
pollen from the male part

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.790
to the female part, maybe a
quarter of an inch or less.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.860
The pollen is typically
sticky and large,

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.810
not causing a lot of allergies.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:39.270
However, there are exceptions.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:45.140
Monoecious, monoecious trees
have like typically one branch

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.940
is all male, one is all female.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.020
These used to trap a
lot of their own pollen.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.780
The parking lot where
we're parked in today

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.540
looks to be about 100 or
more monoecious trees.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.840
There are no female flowers.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.860
They've been grafted
with parts from the male.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.550
That means they won't
drop any messy pods.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:10.440
But it means that the parking
lot is already allergenic.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.320
And 5 years from now, it's
going to be 20 times more.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.150
Three of the ones that I'm the
most interested, dioecious,

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.640
separate sex.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.150
Everybody here is dioecious.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:24.650
Some of us are boys
and some are girls.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.575
I'll tell you a quick story
here before I go any further.

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:29.490
I like to work my
wife into all this,

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.080
since we've been
married so bloody long

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.960
and she's put up with me.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.620
But around 30 years ago I was
sitting in bed with my wife.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.450
And I was reading a book
on pollen, big thick thing

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.330
that almost nobody reads.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.430
And she was reading a novel.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.690
And I kept reading
about those separate sex

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:53.430
dioecious species that's
causing so much allergies.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.990
And some were even saying,
don't plant any of these.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.490
And they include
hundreds of plants.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.170
And I suddenly got
this bright idea.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.700
And I said to my wife,
I said, Yvonne, I said,

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.750
I've got this idea.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.833
And she said, what's that?

00:15:06.833 --> 00:15:09.290
And I said, if these
plates are really

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.967
separate sexed, that
means one's the male,

00:15:12.967 --> 00:15:13.925
another one's a female.

00:15:13.925 --> 00:15:15.840
She says, OK.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.930
And I said, they say that
like willows and poplars

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.980
and maple trees cause
all this allergy.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.280
But I said if they're separate
sexed, think about it.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.140
The male is putting
all that pollen out.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.120
That's his job.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.670
The female doesn't
produce any pollens.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.430
Females don't produce pollen.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.280
And my wife said, huh.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.600
I said, in fact, if you think
about it, the female that traps

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:51.040
pollen but never produces any
is a true allergy-free plant,

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:51.990
isn't it?

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.780
And she said, oh, you might
be on to something, Tom.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:16:00.410
And I probably wasn't
on to anything.

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:05.850
But it kept me talking and
running my mouth for 30 years.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:06.350
OK.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:12.560
So the epidemic of allergies
in epidemic asthma in the '50s,

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.120
probably around 3%, 4%
had pollen allergies.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.360
By '88, I was already
into this and studying it.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.640
And I was reading about
the huge jumps to 12%.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.060
By '99, in the American
College of Allergy, Asthma,

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.380
and Immunology said it was now
38%, appeared to be growing.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:37.660
We don't even know what it is
now, but go ahead and flip.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.930
OK, so Charity Allergy in the UK
said that-- you can read that.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.510
The last one is
probably more important.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.240
Getting pollen
allergies more than

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.640
doubles the chance that a
child will develop asthma.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.640
Once you've got asthma,
you've got asthma.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.540
You don't cure it.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:05.270
And it would be much better
if children didn't develop

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.900
allergies in the
first place and that

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.220
makes them double the
susceptibility to getting

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.980
asthma, which is
a life-long thing.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:16.220
But when I look at landscapes,
the very worst ones I see

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.589
are typically in
elementary schools.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:20.270
And the very
highest pollen count

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.800
ever recorded United States was
taken at an elementary school

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.310
in Las Vegas.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.920
And I went there
and visited and took

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.760
some photos a couple years ago
and there were 24 mature shade

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.110
trees and 23 of them
were clonal males.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:38.770
And all the bushes were
clonal juniper males.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.400
We're just setting these kids
up with that sort of landscape.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.430
All right, so these
are all related.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:52.201
Asthma increase chance of
getting diabetes, heart

00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:52.700
disease.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:57.890
In the last 20 years,
all these huge increases

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.180
and all of these
things are related.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.280
This is where to
me it is starting

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.200
to get much more serious.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.990
This is just data coming
from about five years ago,

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.715
maybe six.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.090
Women who have
airborne allergies

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.140
are at increased risk from
leukemia, ovarian cancer,

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.350
and breast cancer.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:23.180
Let's see what the
next slides says.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.120
To me that's a very big
deal, especially if we

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.400
can do something about it.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.830
It doesn't seem right.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:35.040
I think my favorite is
one, two, three, four.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.120
These were off of newspapers.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.820
No rain, lots of pollen.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.170
And then, rain triggers
avalanche of pollen.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:46.610
Tidal wave, a pollen vortex.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.736
I've given all these talks
across the United States

00:18:48.736 --> 00:18:50.318
and in a bunch of
different countries.

00:18:50.318 --> 00:18:52.730
And I will go places and
people will come up afterwards.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.270
And they say I don't
know if you know it,

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.600
but this place right
here is the worst place

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.350
in the whole country
for allergies.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:06.810
And I'll be like whoa, actually,
you've got a lot more company

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:07.590
than you think.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.820
Can you see the
pollen on the ground?

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.570
On the cement?

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.330
I wish that have been
blacker black top.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:20.080
But this is a male red maple
tree and this is up in Toronto.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.570
When I drove by
it, I thought you

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:26.630
know that's quite illustrative
of pollen dispersal.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.710
The big problem is that there's
been so much misinformation.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:33.550
They would say pollen
blows for 1,000 males.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.900
There's nothing you
can do about it.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.580
Well, we now find
out that things

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.410
we do even affect the weather.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:44.590
And believe me,
it affects pollen.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:48.810
But the pollen
typically on a tree

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.935
falls very close to the
drip line of the tree.

00:19:51.935 --> 00:19:54.600
The drip line is just
about what it looks.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.560
And so if you were to come
ten feet this direction,

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.430
you would trap a little bit
of pollen from that tree,

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.000
but not very much.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.950
And if you got 50 or 100 feet
from it, you'd trap hardly any,

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.500
maybe not enough
to make you sick.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.360
But if that tree was right
over your front porch

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.210
or if that tree was
over the school benches

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.660
where your children
were eating their lunch,

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.990
you be showering them
with that and that pollen

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.710
is exceptionally allergenic.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.013
So everything is to
deal with proximity.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:32.450
You get the best
things in proximity.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.310
They talk about
grass pollens a lot,

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.720
again, as though there's
nothing we could do about it.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.280
So I brought an example, I
brought some of the flyers

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.779
and I don't sell
this stuff myself,

00:20:42.779 --> 00:20:44.070
but I know people that grow it.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:50.270
But this is a clone developed
at UC Davis, called UC Verde.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.450
That's UC Verde buffalo grass.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:53.970
It's a native grass.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.190
It's separate sexed.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:21:00.180
The entire grass, which is
planned from plugs or sod,

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.950
is a female clone.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.160
It stays very low.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.290
It needs very little water,
very little fertilizer.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:12.470
And it produces zero
pollen and it traps pollen.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.060
It's wonderful stuff and yet
you don't see it used much.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:20.310
I'm replanting all the
grass areas in my front yard

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.150
to this same clone.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:27.690
And you may be have to
mow it two three times

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:32.170
in a whole year,
wonderful stuff.

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.340
And then there are
other female grasses.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.840
I've got six different
cloned out female grasses

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.460
at my house, all of which
are useful for different--

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.300
so we could have female
grasses if we wanted.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.107
Go ahead.

00:21:46.107 --> 00:21:48.190
I don't know if everybody's
familiar with the term

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:49.300
xenoestrogens.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:54.200
But a xenoestrogen is something
that's an estrogen mimicker.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.960
It's a chemical
that's very potent.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.810
And typically, we think of
them in plastic water bottles

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.830
and so on.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:07.880
There are xenoestrogens in
those plastic water bottles.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.620
The worst thin you
could possibly do

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.930
would be to stick
one in a microwave,

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.340
warm it up and then drank it.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.620
I mean you might as well just
shoot yourself in the foot.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:21.610
But there was a group of college
students not too long ago.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:23.030
I don't remember where.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.520
But they took water
out of a tap water

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.920
and they put a flat
of soybeans here

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.612
and another flat over here.

00:22:30.612 --> 00:22:32.320
One they just watered
with the tap water.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.890
The other one they took and
they put it in the water

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:38.290
in a plastic baby bottle.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.170
And then they warmed
it up in a microwave,

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:41.461
and then they let it cool down.

00:22:41.461 --> 00:22:43.514
The water the other
flat with that.

00:22:43.514 --> 00:22:45.930
They grow the soy bean plants
until they're about this big

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.700
and then they pulled
them out and tested them.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.730
And one of them
had almost no PBAs

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.750
and the other one was saturated.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.780
Now, picture the urban trees.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:04.280
And as a crow flies, how far
we from the 101 freeway here?

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.090
Anybody?

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.260
A mile?

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.230
Maybe less, as the crow flies.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:11.350
Yeah.

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.490
OK, so there's
extremely good data

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.940
and has been for awhile
that the closer in the

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:20.480
to a major freeway, the shorter
your life, up to 10 years

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.500
if you're quite close.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.680
And yet, they're of course
building these house is

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.390
very close to the freeways.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:30.660
After a mile, that effect
starts to weaken out

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.760
because you're not getting
as much fumes in the air

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.110
from all this exhaust.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.420
The PBAs and a thousand
other chemicals

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.320
like them are all
in that exhaust.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:48.635
And our defense against this
are the trees, the city trees.

00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:51.580
So if we were smart, we
would plant massive amounts

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.260
of huge trees along
those freeways

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.980
to be the first line of defense.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.700
And then we would do similar
things as we went away.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.100
But the picture the
situation, and let's just

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.040
say we're back at the
elementary school again,

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.400
and say we're within a
mile of a major freeway.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.400
We've got a lot of
little kids there.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.720
And we've got a huge
shade tree that we

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:20.130
planted growing where the kids
are going to eat their lunch.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:25.690
Let's say it's a diaceous
species, as is typically used.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:30.170
Say that tree is a female ash.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:34.360
At a certain point,
it will sprinkle seeds

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.130
all over the tables,
all over the ground.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.610
Little kids pick them up and
throw them at each other.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:45.400
But we could say to the
kids don't eat those seeds.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.330
They're are not good for you.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:54.660
And because that tree is
absorbing all these pollutants

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.680
from all these cars
and all this industry,

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.460
they're absorbing
it from the water.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.850
They're absorbing masses
of it from the air.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:07.350
Now, say instead of that tree
being this big female ash

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:09.430
dropping the messy seeds
that we could rake up

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:11.830
and throw in the
trash or compost,

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.950
say instead it was a male.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:19.620
Now, we shower our kids
with all this pollen

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.800
and the pollen is the
trees way of releasing

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.300
all those same pollutants
that went into it.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:32.340
Now when we think
of this, it's not

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:36.460
hard to see how
people with inhalant

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:40.770
analogies-- and why it
affects women more than men,

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:41.580
I'm not sure.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:46.000
But I think it's because
pollen is strongly hormonal,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.080
and even the pollen that's
androgenic in the body

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.700
will, through what's
called aromatase,

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.470
will shift to an estrogen form.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:58.730
And so we are bombarding women
will all these extra estrogens

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:04.460
that they don't need, and
we're trashing their system.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.850
It's a very, very big problem.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.490
It's happening everywhere.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.680
And it's like power of Google.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:17.410
I want Google to
make an example.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:22.770
I would be so proud of myself
if I could pull that off.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:24.590
It's like the
people who know me,

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:25.935
I don't have experience tastes.

00:26:25.935 --> 00:26:27.920
It's not like I'm trying
to get rich on you.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:34.290
I started this for a fairly
noble, but guilt ridden

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.930
sort of thing.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:39.160
And I'm at the point where I'm
seeing how big it's becoming,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.320
how important it is to
literally millions of people

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.510
and more so for
children and women.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:47.210
I'm like whoa, wouldn't
that be fabulous

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:50.180
if we really made
something happen.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:50.770
Good!

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:54.860
All right, let's flip
and see where we're at.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.720
OK, so it's not just sneezing.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.970
And then, it's not just the
women getting in on this.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.820
So you notice that
there is a link

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.860
to increase in prostate cancer.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.280
OK so real quickly, all
trees are not equal.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.520
And I get very
irritated when the city

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.060
says we're going to plant
a million new trees.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.736
My question, yeah, OK,
what kind of trees?

00:27:15.736 --> 00:27:17.480
Uh, trees.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.100
But trees are like people.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.680
Some of us are hard working.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.880
Some are lazy.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.750
Some are dumb.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.140
Some are smart.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.140
Some are friendly.

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.030
Some are not friendly.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.050
Trees are the same way.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.520
At some point here, I'm talking
basically about tree selection.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.150
But I'm also going to talk about
pruning because in an existing

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.750
landscape like this,
there's a pruning scheme

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.012
to take care of most of this.

00:27:42.012 --> 00:27:44.590
That I just thought
I should throw it up.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.490
It was interesting 10 Speed
Press and Berkeley wanted

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:51.210
to change the name of the
book from Allergy Free

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:54.740
Gardening, which went
through several publications,

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.610
to the new book which
has a lot of new material

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:59.290
to the Allergy Fighting Garden.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:00.830
They want to be more proactive.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.650
And the more I think
about it, I liked

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:06.860
that because a female
tree is not just there.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.180
It's not that it
doesn't produce.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.480
It's also pulling
pollen out of the air.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.670
Quickly on how that happens, you
have a female the and her roots

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:17.920
are in the ground.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.500
She's grounded.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.340
When she blooms,
she has millions

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:26.300
of little tiny flowers with
feathery little stigmas

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.290
that are slightly sticky.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:32.560
And those stigmas give off
a slight negative electrical

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.790
impulse that's measurable.

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:36.870
Pollen grains from
a male get in there

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.440
and they tumble
around on the wind.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.810
They pick up a positive
electrical charge.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:44.090
So when you got
positive and negative,

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:47.430
you have what's called
mutual attraction.

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:48.700
Boom, pulls it in there.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.870
Mother nature did not
intend for the pollen just

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.670
to get there by accident.

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.480
She designed it this way.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.370
Very, very clever.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.920
But the problem is that
our urban forests are out

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.077
of balance.

00:29:00.077 --> 00:29:02.160
We've got huge amounts of
males and in some plants

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.390
we almost never find
a female anymore.

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:10.480
I just toss this up because
like if everything else fails,

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.550
there is the basis
for lawsuits now.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:14.550
And I was an expert
witness on a case

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:20.090
in New Zealand that was one, by
the doctor whose daughter went

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.790
to the school.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:24.870
And it resulted in, he had
to sue the school board

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.310
to make it happen, but they
removed all these males trees

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:30.300
out of the place
and replaced them

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.080
with the clonal
female red maple.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.960
And they're now big and
beautiful shade trees

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.200
and they're not
producing any allergies.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.730
I see a lot more of
that down the road.

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:44.940
But there was a Minnesota
Law Review article on it,

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.550
and so the stage is
sort of set for that.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.890
But it'd be better if we could
do it without litigation.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:51.696
Go ahead.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:59.385
I just mentioned for a
second the one big change

00:29:59.385 --> 00:30:00.260
in the United States.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:04.260
When I was a little kid,
almost every street in America

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.010
was lined with
American elm trees.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.400
They're big beautiful trees
and they grew over and made

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.450
a canopy over the road.

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.330
I grew up on Pine
Street, which was

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.170
line with these American elms.

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:16.880
There was only one pine.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.880
And street after
street was that way.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.310
And then in the
'60s and the '70s,

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:25.580
the Dutch Elm Disease came over.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:29.730
And it started killing these
trees off by the millions fast.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.480
And whole cities had no trees.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:37.140
By then, the universities and
the USDA had gotten together

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.780
and they were developing these
new smart trees, if you will,

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.690
which were the male clones.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:46.880
And so the USDA put out
more than 100 different

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.420
named clones of red maple
alone, plus a lot of hybrids,

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.350
every one of which was a male.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:56.780
This was going on at
the universities too.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:02.030
And so this was the new
litter free landscaping.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:05.800
But they had set the stage
for where we're at today.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.350
All right, so that's the bottle
brush that I was talking about.

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.510
I'm going to tell another
story about bottle brush

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:13.280
before I'm done here I hope.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.360
But go ahead and flip.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.050
That was a name
of my second book.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:24.910
And it was my dad who told me he
said you've got to write a book

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:28.120
and put something about sex
right in the name of it.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:32.300
My dad was a lovely
guy, but he was old sort

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.740
of-- what's the word-- prude.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.840
He was a Puritan.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:40.550
He was Swedish and he
didn't believe in drinking,

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.260
he didn't even want
to talk about sex.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.270
You know it's my dad.

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:44.130
I was shocked.

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:45.940
He was like yeah,
you need to put it.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.880
People don't realize
that plants have sex,

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.800
much less that one of them's
a male and one's a female.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.260
And so we came up with that.

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.460
It got me on NPR.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.610
We had some fun with it.

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.750
That's a carob tree, and
that's a female carob.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:02.537
But there are totally
male carobs too,

00:32:02.537 --> 00:32:04.495
which if you had a child
with peanut allergies,

00:32:04.495 --> 00:32:10.400
as a legume would cross react
with soy allergies, all these.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:16.000
This is a female bay
tree, very, very rare item

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.800
and very hard to find.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.090
The only person I know
besides me that has one

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:24.280
is Lorraine, because
I gave her one.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.670
But I looked for years before
I found one of these with fruit

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:28.190
on it.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:30.690
Then it took me long time to
figure out how to clone it out,

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:32.740
but I'm now doing it.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.160
I have an associate
in Europe who

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.720
is doing these on
a massive number.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.880
And yet, the big, big
nurtures are turning out

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.040
the males, millions of them.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.280
Go ahead.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:51.550
This is one grain of
pollen, magnified a lot.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.131
And a grain is so
small that if it

00:32:53.131 --> 00:32:55.380
was in the palm of your hand,
and you're looking down,

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:56.620
you could not see it.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.405
You can only see
clumps of pollen.

00:32:58.405 --> 00:32:59.400
It's very tiny.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:03.830
It's probably maybe
15-20 microns in width.

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:07.270
But you see it's not a
warm and fuzzy thing.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:13.480
The very shape of this
thing can cause problems.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.280
Go ahead.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.410
This is not a very good slide.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.510
But what I like about it
is that particular tree

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.350
is said to be 1,500 years old.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:25.740
It's planted outside
an old church in Poland

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.360
and it's a yew.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.470
Yews are 100% male or female.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:33.040
And this particular
tree is a female.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.870
Now whoever planted that
yew, if it had been a male,

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:37.551
that pollen would
go into the church

00:33:37.551 --> 00:33:39.050
when they were there
and everything.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:41.670
But no, this tree
was protective.

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:44.100
It was trapping the pollen.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:48.180
And 1,500 years it sat there
and it still looks pretty.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.190
We should look so good at 1,500.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.710
Go ahead, Stewart.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:58.300
All right, now I want to talk
about yews and Podocarpus.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.020
And in this area,
you can find both.

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:04.890
There seem to be a surprising
amount of the yews in Berkeley.

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:08.050
But if you get to the
east coast, lots of them.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:12.300
Now, this is a Podocarpus,
one of the most

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:16.520
common plants around, a lot
of them planted at Google.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:20.940
And this one you'll
notice is, what sex?

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.659
Female, it's got fruit on it.

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:24.889
This is the one they
don't want because it's

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:26.659
got the messy fruit.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:29.440
But what's interesting
about that plant-- which

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.199
is a relative to
this, it just takes

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:36.650
more cold weather-- is that
that plant is poisonous

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:41.130
and this plant is poisonous, but
the fruits are not poisonous.

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:43.260
But the seeds are poisonous.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.320
But the pollen is poisonous.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:50.600
Now from that plant, they make
Taxol, a chemotherapy drug

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.620
for breast cancer.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:56.210
From this, they make
[? Podocarpaceae ?] it's called

00:34:56.210 --> 00:35:01.060
or something, and it's a
chemotherapy drug for leukemia.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:06.590
Now chemo drugs have all these.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:10.800
The idea is to kill the cancer
before we kill the patient.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.670
So I've encountered many people
over the years who are sick.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.400
Nobody knows what's wrong.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.540
None of the testings
show what the cause is.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:24.900
I go to their house and
I find a big Podocarpus

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.600
growing right next
to the bedroom window

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.860
or hanging over the house.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.095
Or in a colder
climate, a big yew

00:35:31.095 --> 00:35:33.529
is right by the bedroom windows.

00:35:33.529 --> 00:35:34.320
The pollen is tiny.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.150
It'll go right through a window
screen like it's not there.

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:41.570
And these are very potent drugs.

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:44.180
And people are
getting drugged it

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.230
in a very negative
way by these plants

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.020
because we're selling males.

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.230
We should only be
selling the females.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:53.050
If you would.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:55.930
OK, these are simply
male cones, the opposite

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:57.320
of the last slide on a yew.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:02.070
Go ahead, they're about
to burst full of pollen.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.090
Go ahead, flip.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:03.920
That's a female.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.470
This is a male
Podocarpus and I hope

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.010
the next slide looks better.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:11.400
There, that's a little better.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:15.370
That gives you an idea of
what these things will do.

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:23.140
A real quick story, I hope it's
quick-- a couple years ago, I'm

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.630
at the National Press
Club in Washington,

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:33.280
DC to give a talk about April
being National Gardening Month.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.410
I'm also known as quite the
gardener or something, garden

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:39.920
guru.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:46.685
So afterwards, there's party
in the evening at the National

00:36:46.685 --> 00:36:49.060
Arboretum which is right across
the street from the White

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:49.875
House.

00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:51.500
I don't know if you've
ever been there,

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.150
but it's like a giant
glass fabulous greenhouse.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:59.960
And this is longer ago than
that, but it was after 9/11

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.020
and they were checking
everybody going in.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.780
You had to go through a metal
detector and everything, show

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:06.030
ID.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:09.160
So we come into this
huge glass foyer

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:13.990
which was about as big as this
room except three times taller.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:19.580
And there were six of
them, huge, huge pots.

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.500
And in each one,
a huge Podocarpus

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:27.780
trained to perfect giant
pine cone if you will.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.330
And I had my brother Paul with
me and he knows about my work.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:34.350
And he walked up to the first
one, and he looked at it

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:35.034
and he went pop.

00:37:35.034 --> 00:37:36.450
And he flicked it
with his finger,

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:40.390
and a little the cloud
of like dust came off.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:43.300
I was like oh boy.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.165
And Paul says I wonder
if they're all male.

00:37:45.165 --> 00:37:46.790
I said look at them,
they're identical.

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:47.720
I bet they are.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.190
And they were.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:53.050
So Paul goes in and
there's a young security

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:54.530
guard, big strong fella.

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:56.550
He's standing right there.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:00.190
And I said to him
how long do you

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:02.540
stand in this particular
spot every day.

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.460
He said eight hours.

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.440
I said eight hours.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.460
I said just out of
curiosity, do you ever

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.670
get the feeling
that tree behind you

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:14.250
is somehow messing with you.

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.585
And his eyes got like saucers.

00:38:16.585 --> 00:38:21.510
He's like what's with that tree?

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:25.160
So I explained to him when
I just explained to you.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:29.500
And I said there's no data
on what that will do to you,

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:33.400
but if you think it out, it
can't be a healthy situation.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.100
I said the only good
thing I can think

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.990
is that they only bloom
for about two months.

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:39.030
He goes no they don't.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:40.300
This is a greenhouse.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.750
They bloom all year round here.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:43.750
I was like oh boy.

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:45.624
I said you know, I think
this should probably

00:38:45.624 --> 00:38:47.050
be a union issue or something.

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:48.630
I gave him my card.

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:55.340
And right about then,
somebody brought the head

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.815
of the arboretum out, a lady.

00:38:57.815 --> 00:39:00.220
And she said I want to talk
you and took me outside

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.900
and chewed me out, didn't
know what I was talking about,

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.750
causing trouble.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:09.730
I hadn't even gotten a
free drink or anything yet.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:11.510
I said I'll be a
good boy, you know.

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:14.070
But when I went back in, I
told the guy, if they don't

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:16.570
move him, contact me you know.

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:20.136
And so I thought that
was the end of the story.

00:39:20.136 --> 00:39:22.510
But then six months later, I
got an invite from the place

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:25.910
to come give a talk on this.

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:28.720
And I got there early.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.870
And it was closed.

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:31.120
It wasn't open the public yet.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.970
And I got in with my pass
and I roamed all over.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:38.050
First, the foyer,
those trees were gone.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:42.470
And there had been other
different podocarps in there,

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.380
some males and some females.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.766
But now, the whole
place there wasn't one.

00:39:46.766 --> 00:39:48.390
They just took them
all out, they never

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:49.790
wanted to see them again.

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:52.170
So I did do that fellow a favor.

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:54.910
But anyhow of this
would be the last thing

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:57.980
you would want by
your bedroom window.

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:01.190
And why is there
no data on this?

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.480
Because an allergist
told me years ago.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.760
He said the pollen of
the plant is poisonous.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:10.640
If we skin test people,
every single person we test

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.390
will react to it.

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:13.620
It won't prove anything.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.550
I won't prove allergy.

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:17.211
It's a poison.

00:40:17.211 --> 00:40:19.710
I said well OK, I don't care
if it's an allergy or a poison,

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:20.820
it's not healthy.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.120
And that's all.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.970
All right, go ahead and file on.

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:26.910
This is a very typical--
this is down in LA--

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:29.120
but they're very typical.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.830
You've got Windows that
actually open by a living room.

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:34.846
You've got male
Podocarpus on both sides.

00:40:34.846 --> 00:40:37.220
And when they bloom just when
the weather's nice and warm

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.440
and you want some fresh air.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.080
You open them up and that's
what you get, all right.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.960
This is what you get.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.960
This was taken
through my microscope.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.640
And it's a little fuzzy
here, but it was clear

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.190
when I took it.

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:56.040
What is over-- what
are these grids?

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:56.720
What's the grid?

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.570
Anybody know?

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:02.070
Oh, you're a smart lady.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:03.900
Yeah, it's a piece
of window screen.

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.770
I put a little piece
of window screen.

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:07.280
I shook some of
this pollen on it.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.890
I wanted to see.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.860
I knew it wasn't going
to be very protective.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:12.960
It's not protective at all.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.380
You could probably put
a thousand at the time.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.660
Go ahead.

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.790
Sometimes I give a talk
and I have to ask that.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:23.220
I get a big crowd and
nobody figures it out.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.290
She's the mother of
a Google employee,

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:28.650
so I guess passed on her brains.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:31.950
All right, on the
Isle of Guernsey,

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:33.645
which if you've never
been there, do go,

00:41:33.645 --> 00:41:37.180
a lovely place--
which is a Channel

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:40.210
Islands in between
England and France,

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:44.270
there's a fellow who has been
following my work for years.

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:48.883
And he owns a
large nursery, used

00:41:48.883 --> 00:41:50.900
to be called Queux Patio Plants.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:56.550
But I think it's now just
Queux Plants Center, Q-U-E-U-X.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:42:00.670
It's old Guernsey
French or something.

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:05.120
And he made tags
with a woman shape

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.210
and put the opals
numbers on them.

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:09.540
And he tagged every single
plant in his nursery.

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.540
I said well, who's
going to buy anything

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.790
that you've got nine or
ten on, that's the worst.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:19.350
And on the back, it
explains what the system is.

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:23.570
He said while I want people
to know what they're getting.

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:28.660
And it turned out that people
liked this system very much.

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:34.505
And in truth, he doesn't
sell many nine to tens, seven

00:42:34.505 --> 00:42:36.120
to eights.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.380
But the people have the choice.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:42.030
And as he restocks, he's
trying to get more and more one

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.060
to five, so to speak.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.490
But his name is Nigel Clarke.

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:50.270
He's doing something
really remarkable.

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:53.000
It's starting to
spread into Europe.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.980
In South Carolina, we have
a guy named Grady Roscoe.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.340
He's doing the same thing.

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:00.860
We don't have anybody
in California yet,

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.180
but hopefully we will.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.800
This is a male cedar.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.310
Go ahead and flip again.

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:09.420
This is a female.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:13.920
They almost look like
the males and females.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.720
This is the one that
produces no pollen.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.610
This is a male.

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:23.930
This here it is a male willow
tree, a weeping willow.

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:29.760
When I was as young as say 20,
25, almost everyone weeping

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.030
will I saw was a female clone.

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.840
Now everywhere I go,
they're a male, very few

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.220
of the female ones.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.340
The females are quite
beautiful, but they've now

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:40.750
switched to the male.

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:43.320
Go ahead if you would.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.970
These are called Skyrocket
junipers, again by the windows.

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:48.310
They're all male.

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:50.620
Go ahead.

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.620
This is a blue moffet.

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:53.360
It's a female.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.740
It looks about the same.

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:56.810
Harder to fine.

00:43:56.810 --> 00:44:00.242
Go ahead, no pollen.

00:44:00.242 --> 00:44:02.450
This is another clone, I
don't remember the name now,

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:03.970
but again, males.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:06.320
All right, this
is female juniper

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.330
and those are the berries.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:12.050
Anyhow, here's a couple
of red cedars or junipers,

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:14.180
very common landscapes.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.760
This is female.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.980
This a male those are
little tiny pollen cones.

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:23.180
At certain times,
twice a year now, I

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:26.290
guess because of global
warming or something,

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:28.540
the males are now blooming
twice a year in the cities.

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:30.290
They're blooming in
the spring and they're

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:31.570
blooming again in the fall.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.360
The females, are
trapping pollen.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:35.990
Go ahead.

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:40.470
This is a female tree.

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:45.190
It's an African sumac,
hard to find, hard to buy.

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:47.100
Go ahead.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:52.680
This, OK there I
picked that out there.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:57.760
This is a Chinese pistache
tree, Pistache chinensis.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:01.260
I have seen these trees 70
foot tall and 60 feet wide

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:02.380
that were male.

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.690
And every time a puff
of wind hit it, it just

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:06.860
looks like the tree was
on fire there was so much

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:08.810
smoke coming off.

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:14.280
Now bear in mind
that's male, and that

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.440
is related-- direct kissing
cousin to poison oak,

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:21.600
poison ivy, poison sumac,
poison varnish tree, extremely

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.210
allergenic pollen.

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:27.717
And yet, last time I was
here, I found at least 200

00:45:27.717 --> 00:45:30.050
of these that had been planted
in the last couple years.

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:32.490
And 100% were grafted trees.

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:34.930
And they were all males.

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:36.390
But they're still small.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.370
And we could regraft these.

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:43.930
So Paul says talk
about Bruce Jenner.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:47.350
I didn't make the
Bruce Jenner slide.

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:53.720
But Bruce is giving himself
a sex change, male to female.

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.710
We could do the same
thing with trees.

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:57.830
We can graft it to female wood.

00:45:57.830 --> 00:45:58.825
We could change it.

00:45:58.825 --> 00:46:01.380
It would've been a lot simpler
to plant the right thing

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.522
in the first place.

00:46:02.522 --> 00:46:04.750
But dealing with the
existing problems,

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:06.460
we don't want to wipe
out all the trees.

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.520
There are things to do.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.970
This a female Chinese pistache
with little red berries on it.

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:13.675
The berries are red.

00:46:13.675 --> 00:46:16.614
They're ripe at Christmas
time, quite attractive.

00:46:16.614 --> 00:46:18.530
I don't know why people
don't use them anyhow.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:21.440
They're prettier,
but they don't.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:27.830
Female mulberry,
again a rare plant.

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:29.710
The males huge
amounts of pollen.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:30.940
Go ahead.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.160
That's the male.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.620
Go ahead.

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:38.000
This is a female red maple and
those are the little feathery

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.830
stigmas.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:42.090
And then show the male.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:44.970
Yeah, there's the male.

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:48.680
That trees only job
is to put out pollen.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.650
Go ahead.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:57.800
This is a Lombardy poplar
tree, tall skinny ones.

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:01.280
I'll show you a slide
from Google where they're

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.500
planting small ones now.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:07.022
That's a male clone top to
bottom, a lot of pollen.

00:47:07.022 --> 00:47:08.170
Go ahead.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:11.070
The Olive family, the
first time I was here,

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:12.980
I didn't see olives.

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:17.100
But today walking around, I
saw a bunch of olives planted.

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.330
They're fairly young.

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:20.440
They're a clone.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:26.090
They're one that doesn't make
olives or very few, Swan Hill,

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:27.582
Majestic Beauty.

00:47:27.582 --> 00:47:29.040
And the reason they
don't make many

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.800
is they're basically all males.

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.730
Now, this large family
of plants includes

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:36.380
ash, privvets,
many, many things.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:39.300
There's a huge amount of
cross-reactive allergies

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:40.336
goes with all that.

00:47:40.336 --> 00:47:41.085
Go ahead, Stewart.

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.970
OK, so what could you get?

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:50.430
You could get react with latex,
tomatoes, kiwis, potatoes,

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:55.410
peaches, probably a bunch
of others, birch pollen.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:57.590
They're planning
lot of birch here.

00:47:57.590 --> 00:48:01.320
The birch reacts with half the
foods you eat it seems like.

00:48:04.034 --> 00:48:05.950
These aren't always just
allergies with what's

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:06.836
called sensitivities.

00:48:06.836 --> 00:48:08.210
But what difference
does it make?

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:13.150
As long as you apple and you
feel miserable, it's not good.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:14.410
That's olive pollen.

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:24.350
All right, now that is
a new clone owned by me.

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:25.390
I say owned by me.

00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:27.140
It's not patented.

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:29.150
This a little one of them.

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:33.060
I've been looking for this
tree for, oh man, 20 years.

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:34.610
This a desert olive.

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:36.350
That's what the fruit
on it looks like.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:38.570
This is a female.

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:44.565
And you can't buy these yet,
but I've grown several hundred

00:48:44.565 --> 00:48:46.120
of them.

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:49.030
It took me years and
years to find a female.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.950
It's a native plant.

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:51.160
It grows out in the deserts.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:54.270
They're very hard to find.

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:55.220
I found males.

00:48:55.220 --> 00:49:00.400
But anyhow, outside of Barstow
in a gulch, away on a dirt road

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.100
a few years ago, I found
a stand of females.

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.500
And I brought back
some wood and started

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.180
growing these from cuttings.

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:11.970
But this makes a beautiful
medium, small size tree.

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:15.270
It's as drought tolerant
as you could possibly get.

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:19.420
They grow out there with
no water at all almost.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.500
It's hardy into Canada.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.340
It'll take extreme cold.

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.040
There should be
millions and millions

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:29.930
of these desert girls used.

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:32.610
And it is related to olive.

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:35.420
And the birds like those.

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:36.050
Stewart.

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:37.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:38.770
TOM OGREN: Yeah it
is, but it's like

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:40.632
if you were to eat an
olive off the tree.

00:49:40.632 --> 00:49:42.090
I don't know if
you ever done that,

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:45.399
but you don't want to do that.

00:49:45.399 --> 00:49:47.440
There's a whole process
you've got to go through.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.900
This is another olive, privets.

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.170
This is a chinensis.

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:54.820
This is a rarer female.

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:58.990
You could see again a
little olive like fruits.

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:00.930
This is that same
one that they're

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:04.140
planting at Google, the
male olives, Swan Hill.

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:08.590
You could see the pollen
on the leaves on that.

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:10.510
Flip again, and
see where we're at.

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:13.790
And you could see pollen
on the leaves there too.

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:17.010
Now, olive pollen is
exceptionally allergenic.

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:19.820
I, who do not have
allergies and look at pollen

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:23.090
on slides all the time on
the microscope, whenever

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:27.940
I handle any olive pollen,
I try to be very careful.

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:30.070
And I still end up
sneezing usually.

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:35.440
And on a grain per grain,
it's exceptionally potent.

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:36.290
Go ahead.

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:39.420
The ash is of the olive family.

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:41.050
This is called shiny xylosma.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:42.600
And there's some here at Google.

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.500
In California, it's
all over the place.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:51.530
And I gave a talk
up in San Bernardino

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:53.760
once to a group of
master gardeners.

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.800
And afterwards-- I
mentioned this plant.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.520
This is a male
with male flowers.

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.500
A 90-year-old
botanist came up to me

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.850
and he said do you know
that every single xylosma

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:05.430
in California is a male.

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:07.219
And I said I've know
that for a decade,

00:51:07.219 --> 00:51:08.760
but you're the first
person I've ever

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:12.490
met that noticed besides me.

00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:13.170
Flip.

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.140
There are no females
in California.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:19.850
This is a female
hedge of wax myrtle.

00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:22.530
A female hedge is a
very protective item.

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:24.480
It traps pollen coming in.

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:27.740
It produces no pollen.

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.980
That hedge could be
taller if they want it,

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:33.000
but it's very effective.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.130
Pollarding, Pollarding and this
is not the most attractive,

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:39.090
but I just use that.

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:42.150
But anyhow, a lot
of the big trees

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:43.580
could be pollarded every year.

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.470
And if they pollard them,
you will get no pollen.

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:51.590
And in London, they now
are pollarding large areas

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:53.950
of downtown London
with the London

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:57.286
Planes which are sycamores, and
produce quite a bit of pollen.

00:51:57.286 --> 00:51:59.160
But they pollard them
and then they get none.

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.820
And the reason is, you
pollard them and they get all

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:03.612
this new growth in the spring.

00:52:03.612 --> 00:52:05.570
But the pollen doesn't
come off the new growth.

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:09.350
It comes off the second year
growth and some trees three

00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:10.450
year growth.

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:12.510
So depending on the
species of tree,

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:17.230
there's a pruning system where
we could prune away the pollen

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:22.400
if we want, if we have
the will to do it.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.495
So this is an alder.

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:34.220
These are all male
cones in the winter.

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:38.130
Alder's bloom early,
produce loads of pollen.

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:42.420
If we, in the winter, before
this picture was taken, say

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:45.500
we just pruned that much off
the ends of the branches.

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:47.850
We wouldn't have any
pollen then next season.

00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:50.140
Go ahead.

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:53.370
Alder relative No,
not alder relative.

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.050
This is an oak.

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:58.550
Oak makes the-- these
are all male flowers.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:02.425
It makes those on
a second year wood.

00:53:02.425 --> 00:53:05.790
It makes the females on
first year wood, interesting

00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:09.840
So the more we prune the
oak, the messier she'd be

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.370
would become because
of more acorns.

00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:16.170
But picture those things are
trapping pollen and no pollen.

00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:18.450
So an oak that we did
this to, would have

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:20.960
lots of acorns but no pollen.

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.900
These are birch catkins.

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:24.820
These are the male catkins.

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:27.520
And they form the year before.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:34.870
So if you look at a
birch tree in November,

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:37.390
it's already got the
male parts formed.

00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:39.990
They haven't swollen up
and released the pollen.

00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:41.740
That'll happen next spring.

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:43.570
But again they're on the ends.

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:46.500
And so if we sheer
those ends, boom,

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.340
there's next year, that birch.

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:51.870
Google all over the place,
has planted typically three

00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:53.780
at a time right by the doors.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.370
That means it comes in
the room, one the worst

00:53:57.370 --> 00:53:58.701
pollens you could use.

00:53:58.701 --> 00:54:00.450
But those could all
be sheered every year,

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:04.660
and that would
stop that Go ahead.

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:06.110
I don't know how
I had that twice.

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:13.200
This shot I just put in because
this is my idea of everything

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.680
in it is allergenic.

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:21.270
The junipers are all male.

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:23.930
Somewhere in there, there's
male coyote bush, a native,

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:27.110
but it's all male,
a ragweed relative.

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:28.860
The trees are male
and in the back

00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:30.190
there's another type of trees.

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:31.980
And then in the
very back, there's

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:34.895
Italian cypress, which used
to have both sexes on them,

00:54:34.895 --> 00:54:37.940
but now they've managed to
turn on them in the males too.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:41.440
So everything in it
is allergy causing.

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.120
Go ahead.

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.220
Let's get to Google.

00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:48.410
All right, so one
of the things we

00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:52.480
want to do if we want to
eliminate health problems

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:56.290
is we want diversity.

00:54:56.290 --> 00:55:02.240
It's like say you wanted
a really great workforce,

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.560
you don't just want men.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:06.384
You want men, you want women.

00:55:06.384 --> 00:55:07.800
You don't want
everybody to be 20.

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.130
You want different ages.

00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:12.060
You don't want everybody
to be lily white,

00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:16.210
you want all nationalities
if you can get them.

00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:18.420
Diversity, it's a
good, wonderful thing.

00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:20.670
It's very important
in landscaping.

00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:23.440
Now here we go, this is in
front of some buildings.

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:27.200
Every single tree is not the
high allergy tree, but not

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:29.730
a low allergy tree,
some flowering pears.

00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:31.920
But every single tree
is the same exact tree.

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.370
On the next one,
this sort of scheme

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:36.290
is done over and over here.

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:41.190
OK, so you walk down block after
block, and when I walked down,

00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:43.100
there was a lot of
pollen on the sidewalk.

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.980
And every single one
is a liquid amber tree.

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:49.130
Now one or two liquid ambers
on the block is not a problem.

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:51.710
Every tree on a block
being a liquid amber,

00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:53.190
now you've got allergy problem.

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:57.220
You've created what allergists
call pollen corridor.

00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:00.830
We've got a lot of those here.

00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:03.190
Then again those
could be pruned.

00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:07.340
But to do it from scratch,
this is not how you do it.

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:10.170
These are the birch trees
by entrances or something.

00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:14.970
Go ahead, more birch trees
by entrances, male podocarpus

00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:17.020
by doors.

00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.190
What else have you got?

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:23.430
Male poplar trees just planted
that'll grow very big very

00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:27.160
fast, male junipers.

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:29.650
I didn't find any females.

00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:34.000
Go ahead and all these males
Chinese pistache trees.

00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:39.660
Maybe my number
one concern would

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:42.810
be to deal with those
before they get real big,

00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:46.270
otherwise this could
be like pollen city.

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:48.440
Let's see what we've got next.

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:51.280
OK, here's the bottle brush,
again right by the door.

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:53.790
Now bottle brush pollen
does not travel far.

00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:59.040
If you put it 20, 30 feet
further away or something,

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:02.270
not a problem unless you
walked right into it.

00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:06.560
But by the door is
not a good situation.

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:11.670
And male restios, these
are newly planted.

00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:12.170
Go ahead.

00:57:15.335 --> 00:57:18.000
Ah, a female ash tree.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.480
There are number of ash trees
around here that are female.

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:23.380
But if you look at those,
they're huge trees.

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:26.690
They were maybe planted by
birds or squirrels or something

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:28.260
a long, long time ago.

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:31.830
Maybe they came
with the property.

00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:34.290
And this is typical,
when I go to a landscape,

00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:36.779
the female trees are the
oldest biggest things.

00:57:36.779 --> 00:57:38.570
They were planted back
when they grew trees

00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:43.830
from sees rather than asexual
tissue cultures or something

00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:44.370
like today.

00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:45.930
Go ahead.

00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:48.666
But that's an air
cleaner tree there.

00:57:48.666 --> 00:57:51.180
Ah, where we ate the
last time I was here,

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.850
they had this big bamboo.

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:54.340
Bamboo is monocarpic.

00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:58.490
Anybody know what monocarpic
would mean in Latin?

00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:02.830
Mono, one, carpic,
life, so one life.

00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:04.530
That bamboo may
live for 100 years,

00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:06.080
and it will only bloom one time.

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.400
Once it blooms,
what happens to it?

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.600
It dies, right.

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.550
So we don't know how
long it will live.

00:58:13.550 --> 00:58:15.760
But since it's only
going to bloom one time,

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:19.150
we consider that pretty
allergy friendly.

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:20.400
And that is at Google.

00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:27.230
All right so, I googled this and
came up with this-- Larry Page.

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:32.150
He says he is not interested
in you doing 10% better.

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:35.300
He wants 10 times better.

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:40.180
Well OK, so how about instead
of replacing a couple male trees

00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:42.790
and plant a couple token
females, how about you actually

00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:46.230
like did a serious
landscape job.

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:51.320
How about there's apparently
a big Google, whole new campus

00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.710
being put in
somewhere near here.

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:56.810
And they're getting new
buildings, new landscaping.

00:58:56.810 --> 00:59:01.420
How about from the get go
they do this like this shining

00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:03.820
example where people
would be like oh yeah,

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:07.930
this is like the healthiest
place in the world to live.

00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:12.210
I also noticed that Google is
number one on Forbes America's

00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:16.009
best employees list, or it was.

00:59:16.009 --> 00:59:16.550
I don't know.

00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:19.250
But I'm impressed
with the place.

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:20.060
It's fun here.

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:21.690
I like your Google bikes.

00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:22.950
I like the Google food.

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.550
Google has a
wonderful reputation.

00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:30.838
It does.

00:59:30.838 --> 00:59:35.170
It sparkles with the
intellectualism and creativity.

00:59:35.170 --> 00:59:37.380
Here's a few native plants.

00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:43.220
This is a male coyote bush
and then we have a female.

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:46.690
They will say, we are
landscaping with natives.

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:48.910
But bear in mind, almost
all plants I'm talking about

00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:50.790
are native to some
part of this country.

00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:52.880
And so, whether
it's native or not,

00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:56.130
they've totally manipulated
all the natives.

00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:58.210
This plant ground
sil or coyote bush

00:59:58.210 --> 01:00:02.280
is very drought
tolerant, good plant.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:07.540
They sell six different
clones, all of which are males.

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:11.220
It's also a ragweed
relative, so the pollen.

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:14.010
All right, go another one.

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:17.640
I guess I'm like-- I was
worried about the time,

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.000
so I'm like talking fast.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.830
But I'm not talking fast.

01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:22.070
No.

01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:24.150
I was camping and this came up.

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:27.250
And I'd only seen him in books.

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:30.010
Anybody know what he is?

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:32.300
It was in southern Arizona.

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.320
I was with my son in
law and he came up

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.570
and we were teasing him
with cheese, which he came

01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:40.630
up and ate, very cool looking.

01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:45.667
It's coatimundi and they've
got a tail about this long.

01:00:45.667 --> 01:00:47.250
He can run up and
down trees, and he's

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:49.540
very tough, cute little fellow.

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:54.555
I'm an animal lover, so I
just had to throw him in.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:00.300
I guess I'm about for questions.

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.370
Where we are at?

01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:04.250
Oh, I was suppose
to tell this story.

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:08.250
So I'm giving a talk in Anaheim,
Anaheim Convention Center.

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:12.850
I'm told about the bottle brush.

01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:14.630
A lady came up
and she says to me

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:18.970
she says I started to cry when
I heard what you were saying

01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:21.170
about the bottle brush.

01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.450
I said why.

01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:27.210
She said well, I can't tell
you I'm embarrassed by it.

01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:32.960
I said well, tell me it'll
be our secret you know.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.060
I've been sharing it with
the world ever since.

01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:41.730
She says we had this
dog, a golden lab.

01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:44.130
He's just a wonderful dog.

01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:50.550
And she said the dog would
come into the living room,

01:01:50.550 --> 01:01:51.796
then he would sneeze.

01:01:51.796 --> 01:01:54.890
And then he would
shake himself and then

01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:56.010
I would start sneezing.

01:01:56.010 --> 01:01:58.180
My husband would start
sneezing and our children

01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.710
would start sneezing.

01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:02.270
It seemed to get
worse and worse.

01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:06.810
And she said finally we
decided he had to go.

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:08.770
And it was a fairly old
dog and I was thinking,

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:12.500
oh I don't want to hear
any more about that part.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.560
Then she said, our
backyard is very open.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.300
It's just lawn.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:19.065
And then in the corner of it,
there's a big bottle brush

01:02:19.065 --> 01:02:20.967
and the branches go
right to the ground.

01:02:20.967 --> 01:02:22.550
And that's the only
shade in the yard.

01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:25.180
And the dog would sit until
the tree all the time.

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:27.220
Well, bottle brush
pollen is tiny and shaped

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:30.500
like little ninja stars,
sticking to his fur.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.750
So he was come in and he was
getting allergic reaction

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:33.820
and shaking it.

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:38.380
So anyhow, they got rid of
the family dog rather than

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:42.170
the bottle bush tree
which is a pity.

01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:47.330
But I don't know why that's
why I keep telling that story,

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:51.190
but it's just illustrative
of acting without quite

01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:52.725
having all the information.

01:02:52.725 --> 01:02:54.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I have a question

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:58.530
about all the pollutants
the threes take in.

01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:00.210
TOM OGREN: Yes.

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:03.490
AUDIENCE: A city
like Chico that has

01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:06.110
orange trees as their
street trees, which

01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:07.950
I thought were fabulous.

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:09.374
Are they--?

01:03:09.374 --> 01:03:10.790
TOM OGREN: So this
is the question

01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:12.270
that I don't like to be asked?

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:13.130
AUDIENCE: Oh sorry.

01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:15.780
TOM OGREN: Asked
by my own sister.

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:18.800
This opens up a sort
of a nasty can worms,

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:25.120
because I was asked the
same question on a BBC radio

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:25.810
last fall.

01:03:25.810 --> 01:03:28.000
And I sort of fudged.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.880
But I'll go ahead
and address that.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.350
I would say that the closer
you live to that freeway,

01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:36.890
the less healthy those
oranges are for you to eat.

01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:40.600
There's no other way
to figure this out.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:46.160
I would say that if we took
a microbiologists or chemist

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:50.870
and had him test it, it would
be proven rather quickly.

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:55.020
I would also say that growing
fruit in your own yard

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:58.490
is a wonderful way to
introduce children to the fact

01:03:58.490 --> 01:04:01.510
that trees are not
just ornamental.

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:04.210
And I would also say that most
of the oranges that you're

01:04:04.210 --> 01:04:08.530
talking about are
seedless oranges,

01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:12.880
meaning they're producing
parthenocarpic fruit, meaning

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:13.872
it's seedless fruit.

01:04:13.872 --> 01:04:15.455
It didn't even need
to get pollinated.

01:04:15.455 --> 01:04:16.940
It just makes fruit anyhow.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:27.600
Yeah, I'm afraid that is the
drawback to urban agriculture

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.300
if you want.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.370
And I used to do
community gardens

01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:32.920
and I still think
it's a great idea.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:36.450
It's just is it the
healthiest thing in the world.

01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:38.420
I'm not sure about
that part of it.

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:41.030
But you could do it
organically and at least it

01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:42.030
would be an improvement.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.730
Anybody's that's
listening to me,

01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:51.980
if what I'm saying makes
sense, join with me

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:59.030
and help me to make something
happen right here at Google.

01:04:59.030 --> 01:05:04.480
In 2008, the California
Department of Public health

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:09.150
put out their seven year
plan initiative for asthma.

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:13.920
I was one of the 25 experts
that they brought in.

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.670
It says in the plan that
we shouldn't plant anymore

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:21.950
male trees, shrubs, and we
should plan a lot more females.

01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:26.970
It said that the landscapes
at all the schools, at all

01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:30.520
the hospitals, at
all the public places

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.560
should be allergy friendly.

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.335
But that was 2008 and it
still isn't happening.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.470
I doubt is my last ditch.

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:44.260
I'll probably be pushing
this one way or another

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.380
just because I feel
strongly about it.

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:48.140
But if I could make
something happen just

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:50.700
by virtue of being
here-- and I'm here

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:56.120
because Lorine invited
me-- then a very wonderful

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:59.780
powerful thing-- and this
is a small group of us--

01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:03.850
but I appreciate you that
have stayed with me here.

01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:06.260
And it's impossible
to give a talk

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:10.210
without getting some
feedback from the audience.

01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:12.800
And it's like
everybody that's here

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:16.390
is giving me some good feedback
and so I thank you for that.

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:18.340
But I'll stop right there.

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:19.130
All right.

01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:19.730
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:21.280
Thank you.
