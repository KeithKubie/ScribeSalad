00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.510
f is a linear function whose
table of values is shown below.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.540
And they give us three
different x-values

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.980
and the corresponding
f of x values.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.210
Which graphs show functions that
are increasing faster than f?

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.720
So when we're talking
about increasing faster,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.090
we're really talking
about a higher rate

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.180
of change of y with respect to
f, or a higher rate of change

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.380
of the vertical
axis with respect

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.450
to the horizontal axis, which
is another way of saying which

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.890
of these have a steeper
slope than the function f?

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.150
So let's see what the
change in our vertical axis

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.270
is with respect to our change
in our horizontal axis.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.550
Once again, the Greek
letter-- this triangle

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.790
is the Greek letter delta, which
is shorthand for "change in."

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.180
So this is the change in
f over the change in x.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.460
So we see over
here, when x changes

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.930
by 1, the value of our
function changes by positive 5.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.310
And it's linear, so that's true.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.360
Between any two
points, the ratio

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.410
between our change in f and
our change in x is the same.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.710
If we go up 1 again, we have
plus 1 in the x-direction,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.302
we are once again
increasing by 5.

00:01:18.302 --> 00:01:20.510
If you start from this point
and go all the way here,

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.960
so if you go plus
2 along x, you're

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.040
going to go plus 10 along f.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.590
So it would be 10 over
2, which is still 5.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.930
So either way, the
slope, or the rate

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.090
of change of the vertical
axis with respect

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.630
to the horizontal
axis, is 5 for f.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.790
Now, let's see which of
these increase faster.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.110
Well, a isn't even increasing.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.730
So A is decreasing.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.620
As x increases, y is decreasing.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.270
So that definitely
can't be the case.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.610
If we look at this
one right over here,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.790
it looks like-- let's see,
if we start over here,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.540
if we increase 1 along the
x-direction, if our change in x

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.120
is 1, it looks like our
change in y is exactly 5-- 1,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.210
2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.410
So it looks like for choice
B, our slope is exactly

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.940
5, or our change in y over
change in x is exactly 5.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.820
So it's not increasing
faster than f.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.060
It's increasing the same as f.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.040
Now let's look at
C. So I'm going

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.494
to try to find a point where
it looks like I have an integer

00:02:29.494 --> 00:02:30.410
point right over here.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.610
So that's the point,
negative 3, negative 3.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.580
And if I move 1 in
the x-direction,

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.980
it looks like I'm
increasing by more than 5.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:47.650
I'm increasing 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, it looks like.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.320
So this one looks like
it has a slope of 8.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.110
So this one is
increasing faster than f,

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.924
so we'll circle that
right over there.

00:02:56.924 --> 00:02:58.340
And now let's look
at this choice.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.370
So if we start right over here--
and I just picked this point

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.500
because that's at a
nice integer coordinate.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.625
It's at the point 2, negative 4.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.310
If we increase x by 1,
then we increase y by 1,

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.850
2, 3-- looks like about 3
and 1/2, definitely not 5.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.790
In order for it to
increase as fast as f,

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.000
it would have to increase by 5,
so it would have to be up here.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.995
So it would have to
go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:26.620
It would have had to
have been up here.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.990
The line would've looked
something more like that just

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.030
to match f, much less
grow faster than f.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.230
So D does not meet the criteria.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.463
It is only C.
