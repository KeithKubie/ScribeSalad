00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.340
&gt;&gt; I say the answer to this question is definitely
yes. Role models are a very integral part

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.950
for what will make the Middle East in the
near future. There are some role models in

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.510
particular who really serve as a great example
for the youth in the Middle East today. Some

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.610
of these include [inaudible] seeking Abdullah
whose balanced moderation with his taking

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.980
of Western ideals and combining it with a
cultural aspects of the Middle East and make

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.390
for a great output in Jordan. And also other
examples include [inaudible] the Foreign Minister

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:41.039
of Iraq and [inaudible] who also serve as
great role models in that region. It really

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.760
doesn't come down to the fact that 70% of
the Middle East is now made up of the youth

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.239
and therefore what serves as an example to
them is an integral part to what will make

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.189
the Middle East as a whole in the near future.
