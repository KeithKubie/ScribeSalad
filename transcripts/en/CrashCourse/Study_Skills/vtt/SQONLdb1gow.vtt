Hi, I’m Thomas Frank, and this is Crash
Course Study Skills.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:09.020
Over the course of the past nine episodes, we’ve
covered the topics that you’d expect to fall under the
umbrella of this show’s “study skills” subtitle –

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.140
preparing for tests, planning, beating
procrastination, and so on.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.440
Today we’re going to step slightly out of
that umbrella’s shadow to talk about exercise.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.400
But don’t be fooled – this video will
still help you to become a better student.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.560
Exercise is crucial for keeping both your body and
your brain healthy, and as you’ll see later in this video,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.460
it’s also a simple way to improve your
ability to learn and focus.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.680
The problem is that our culture is becoming
less and less active.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.340
Here in the U.S., nearly a third of kids between the ages
of 2 and 19 qualifies as either overweight or obese.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.640
And on average, we spend over 10 hours a
day looking at screens – an activity that almost
always involves sitting down.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.200
And many schools aren’t helping the issue, as
physical education programs are constantly being
cut in favor of adding more time to other classes –

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.180
even though, as you’ll see in a minute, there is
evidence to show that the opposite tactic would
produce better academic results.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.420
So today we’re going to dive deep into the
brain benefits of exercise.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.920
And keep in mind here that we’re not talking
about a narrow definition of exercise, like
lifting weights or running.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.860
Exercise comes in many different shapes and forms, and
regardless of your skill level or physical limitations, you
can probably find something that gets your heart rate up

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.080
– which can, in turn, improve your mind.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:20.940
[Theme Music]

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.800
When we think about the concept of
“learning”, we often picture someone lost in
some kind of intellectual work –

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.840
doing research, reading a book, or maybe
working through a bunch of math problems.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.420
But it’s important to realize that all of these
activities are relatively recent inventions when
looked at on an evolutionary time scale.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.540
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.940
For the vast majority of the time that the
brain has been around –

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.880
be it inside the skull of a human or something else – its
ability to learn evolved right alongside movement.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.780
And this makes sense if you think about it.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.800
Lifeforms that don’t need to move really
have no use for a brain.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.620
Plants just need to take root in one spot
and then grow upward, and for that, a fixed set
of genetic programming will do just fine.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.640
The ability to learn, think, and strategize
only becomes necessary when you can move around,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.120
because now you need to be able to navigate a
complex environment, find food and remember its
location later on, and escape from predators.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.200
If you want a good example of this difference,
look at the sea squirt.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.539
These invertebrates start their lives in a
larval stage complete with a primitive eye,

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.730
a tail-like nerve cord that lets them move
around, and a brain.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.340
At this stage, their goal is to find a spot
on the ocean floor where they can attach themselves.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.900
Once they do this, that’s where they’ll
be staying for the rest of their lives.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.370
And to seal the deal, they absorb all of those
useful features that let them move around

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.820
– the eye, the nerve cord, and – you guessed
it – the brain.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.540
That's right – once a sea squirt doesn’t need
to move anymore, it basically eats its own brain.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.780
Thanks, Thought Bubble – I think?

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.920
The neuroscientist Rodolfo Llinás used the case of the
brain-eating sea squirt in his book I of the Vortex: From
Neurons to Self in order to illustrate his conclusion that:

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.120
“That which we call thinking is the evolutionary
internalization of movement.”

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.900
In other words, brains are for creatures that
move.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.720
Once you stop using it, you lose it.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.000
In fact, “use it or lose it,” is a principle that
applies to much of biology – not just brains.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.920
That’s why your muscles can start to atrophy
if you don’t use them for long enough,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.780
and why failing to stay active and learn new
things can greatly increase the risk of developing
dementia as you get older.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.000
To use an even more extreme example, astronauts
that spend a lot of time in orbit often suffer from a
condition called spaceflight osteopenia,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.920
which is a loss in bone density that happens
because the skeleton doesn’t have to constantly
fight against the pull of Earth’s gravity.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.640
On the whole, every part of your body is adapted
to allow you to do specific things.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.330
If you aren’t doing them, then those parts
of your body simply become resource hogs.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.040
But you can’t just decide you don’t need
them and turn them off –

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.840
your body’s systems are highly connected
and they depend on each other,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.560
which means that you need to do what your
body is built to do if you want to keep it all working.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.240
And in the case of exercise, it’s not just
a matter of “working” or “not working”

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.260
– in addition to keeping you healthy, getting
your heartbeat elevated on a regular basis
can also make you a better student.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.460
Just look at the school district of Naperville,
Illinois.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:49.030
Back in the year 1990, a P.E. teacher in Naperville
named Phil Lawler decided that the traditional structure
of P.E. classes just wasn’t going to cut it anymore.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.100
Since they were almost always based on sports,
the few kids who were already athletic would

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.620
naturally dominate the more active roles, and by
consequence, lots of other kids would end up just
standing around – not really doing much at all.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.950
Lawler decided to change things up, and he
shifted his class’s focus from traditional sports
to more fitness-based activities like jogging.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.420
He placed an emphasis on constant movement
and keeping heart rates in an elevated zone
during the entire period.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.840
And – most importantly – he graded his
students on effort rather than skill.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.260
By using heart rate monitors, he was able to tell that
students who clocked 10 minute mile times were still
working just as hard as those who could finish in 8.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.100
He called this program Zero Hour P.E., and it started
as an optional morning program before becoming
integrated into the school’s normal schedule.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.880
By the end of its first semester in 1990, his test
group of students showed a 17% improvement
in reading and comprehension,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.280
compared to a 10.7% average improvement
for the kids who didn’t participate.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.400
After that, the structure of Zero Hour P.E.
became the archetype for the entire district’s
physical education program.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.520
And today, the district consistently ranks in
the state’s top 10 academic performers,

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.620
even though money spent per student there
is much lower than other top-tier districts.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.840
The correlation between fitness-based P.E. classes
and higher grades isn’t limited to Naperville, either.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.500
After studying Lawler’s program, another P.E.
teacher named Tim McCord brought it to his own
school district in Titusville, Pennsylvania.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.700
And in 2008, eight years after the program had
started there, the district’s reading scores had gone
from below the state average to 17% above it.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.980
Likewise, math scores went from below the
average to 18% above it.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.320
So what’s going on here?

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.160
How exactly does exercise help you become
a better student?

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.100
Well, broadly speaking, regular exercise improves
your brain in three important ways.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.760
First, it optimizes the levels of neurotransmitters
like serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.260
These are all crucial for learning.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.940
Keep in mind that we are hugely oversimplifying
things here, but in general, serotonin helps to
regulate your mood and keeps you happy.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.300
Norepinephrine amplifies signals related to
attention and motivation,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.220
and dopamine is highly involved in learning,
movement, and operating the brain’s reward center.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.540
Regular exercise balances these neurotransmitters,
along with lots of others that are equally important
for keeping your brain healthy.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.560
Secondly, exercise can also stimulate
neurogenesis, which is the birth of new neurons
from neural stem cells in the hippocampus.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.620
This was once thought to be impossible.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.080
For a long time, the prevailing belief in the
scientific community was that you were born with
all the neurons you were ever going to get.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.420
But we now know that new neurons are
created even during adulthood, and exercise
increases their rate of creation.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.580
Now, one important thing to note here is that
these new neurons are born as stem cells that
don’t have an immediate purpose.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.900
As a result, many of them die – again, “use
it or lose it.”

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.630
In order for a new neuron to survive, it has
to get plugged into an existing neural network,
and that happens when you learn new things.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.420
So really, the crucial combo for this
particular bit of brain optimization is regular
exercise AND constant learning.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.540
Now if you’re a student, you’ve probably
got the second part down pat at the moment,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.320
but I do want to mention this, since it
remains true even as you get older and eventually
don’t have to go to school anymore.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:37.300
Lastly, exercise improves the ability of neurons to
bind to one another, which is how new neural
pathways are formed and how memories take hold.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.420
It does this by promoting the production of a protein
called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (or BDNF),

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.880
which in turn enables and improves a
process called long-term potentiation.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.020
This is the mechanism that enables learning.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.900
When new information enters your brain,
neurons start firing using existing stores of
another neurotransmitter called glutamate.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.820
If the firing continues, each active neuron
will also start generating building material
for the creation of brand new synapses,

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.660
which are connections between separate
neurons.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.920
As these new synapses are created, memories
form.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.340
And BDNF is the secret sauce that makes the
whole process possible.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.280
In fact, researchers have discovered that
depriving rats of BDNF causes them to lose
the capacity for long-term potentiation.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.350
And, on the flip side, they’ve also found
that injecting BDNF directly into a rat’s
brain increases that capacity.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:24.900
Now, this does not mean that you should go ask
your doctor to inject BDNF in your brain – they’re
probably gonna give you a pretty weird look.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:31.320
And it’s unnecessary anyway, because your
brain naturally produces more BDNF when you
learn new things and when you exercise.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.680
There are also other benefits that go
beyond learning;

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.940
research has found that regular exercise can also
improve your ability to focus and block out distractions,

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.880
it reduces stress, and it lets you control
the weather with your mind.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.300
We don’t have time to dig into the details
of these benefits here, but if you’re curious,

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:49.660
you can learn a lot more about each of them
in Dr. John Ratey’s book Spark: The Revolutionary
New Science of Exercise and the Brain.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.600
Except for that last one – I was lying about
that one.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:58.950
What we need to do now is answer the million-dollar
question: How, exactly, should you exercise if you
want to improve your brain’s performance?

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:03.520
Well, first off, don’t try to do traditional
academic learning during intense exercise.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:10.400
You think it’d be a pretty sweet productivity hack to
study your organic chemistry flash cards during a set of
heavy deadlifts, but it’s not going to work out so well.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.380
When your heart rate is elevated, blood actually
moves away from your prefrontal cortex,

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.160
which manages your executive functions, working
memory, and the intake of new information.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:25.600
However, that blood comes back almost immediately
after you finish exercising, so doing a workout or going
for a run right before you start learning is a great idea.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:33.600
As for how you should exercise – well, that’s mostly up
to you, but you’ll get the best results by combining an
elevated heart rate with complex, skill-based movement.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.260
One way to do this is to opt for a sport or
a skill-based activity that combines both,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.130
like figure skating, basketball, skateboarding,
martial arts, or even intense yoga.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:48.560
Alternatively, you can first do some aerobic exercise
followed by a lower intensity bout of skill based
movement, like going for a 15 minute run and then
doing some rock climbing.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.580
But beyond all else, just get started.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.560
Even going for a short walk once a day can
have a lot of benefits.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.320
So if you’re not getting a lot of exercise
right now, just start small, do what you can
do, and focus on building the habit.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.240
You don’t need to worry about finding the
perfect workout routine, or memorizing all the
details we covered about BDNF and neurons.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.520
If you can just build that habit, your brain
will take care of the rest for you.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.380
Over the course of this series we’ve covered
tips and strategies for dealing with many of the
biggest challenges you’ll face as a student,

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.420
and we’ve done our best to use research
and our own personal experiences to make
those tips as useful as we possibly could.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.760
But as you dive into your work, you’re gonna
discover other strategies that might be even
more effective,

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.720
or you’ll make tweaks that suit your style of working
better than anything we could come up with.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:33.820
And I’d encourage you to actively seek out these
improvements, as learning and productivity are two
fields where there’s no single set of “best” practices.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:39.740
As Bruce Lee once said, “Adapt what is useful, reject
what is useless, and add what is specifically your own.”

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:45.000
And just as Lee himself strove to make this
cycle of self-improvement a lifelong process,
so should you.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.720
We’ve covered a lot of ground over the past 10
episodes, but there’s always more to learn – both
in the realm of study skills and beyond.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.760
So keep learning, keep improving, and don’t
forget to be awesome.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:00.060
