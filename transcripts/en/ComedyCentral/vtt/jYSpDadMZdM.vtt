00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:03.636
Randy, I think we need
to have a talk.

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:05.104
No time to talk.

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:07.540
The agricultural inspector's
about to drop by.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.041
Once we get certified from him,

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:10.944
we can start selling
like a real farm.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.714
Have patience wife.
Soon our fortunes will change.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.385
Oh that must be him now.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:22.955
Yes, I'm with the state
testing board.

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:25.191
Is this Tegrity Farms?

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:28.328
Name's right there on the sign.
Come on back.

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.498
So with this festing device,

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:35.735
I can check not only
the TAC levels in your product,

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:39.004
but also detect any impurities
and give you a final score

00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:40.907
based on overall
chemical makeup.

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:48.514
Yep, that's good shit.

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:52.852
Now let me test the levels
in your organic house blend.

00:00:57.356 --> 00:00:59.059
Yep, that's good shit.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.795
Now what about
the Tegrity Jungle Bud?

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:04.497
Let's test it out.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.771
Whoa.
Yeah?

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:14.941
Whoa. Yeah!

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:18.611
I don't know what Tegrity is,
but that is some good shit.

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:21.147
All right!
