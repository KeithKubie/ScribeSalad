I want to tell you about a very famous

00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:00.989
I want to tell you about a very famous
 

00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:02.330
I want to tell you about a very famous
number that you've heard about before

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340
number that you've heard about before
 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.760
number that you've heard about before
but I'll tell you why it is what it is

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770
but I'll tell you why it is what it is
 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.230
but I'll tell you why it is what it is
and it's the golden ratio a lot of

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240
and it's the golden ratio a lot of
 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.190
and it's the golden ratio a lot of
people think the golden ratio is this

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200
people think the golden ratio is this
 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.900
people think the golden ratio is this
mystical thing it is but not for the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910
mystical thing it is but not for the
 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.250
mystical thing it is but not for the
reasons they think but I want to do that

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260
reasons they think but I want to do that
 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.140
reasons they think but I want to do that
and I tell you why it's interesting when

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150
and I tell you why it's interesting when
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.509
and I tell you why it's interesting when
I do that through a mechanism of flowers

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519
I do that through a mechanism of flowers
 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.740
I do that through a mechanism of flowers
and you may have heard a connection with

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750
and you may have heard a connection with
 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.939
and you may have heard a connection with
the coordination flowers before but I'll

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949
the coordination flowers before but I'll
 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.260
the coordination flowers before but I'll
show you why that connection is there

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270
show you why that connection is there
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.730
show you why that connection is there
for the sake of this nobody I'll I'll be

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740
for the sake of this nobody I'll I'll be
 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.290
for the sake of this nobody I'll I'll be
the scribe but I'd like you to imagine

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300
the scribe but I'd like you to imagine
 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.540
the scribe but I'd like you to imagine
Brady that you are a flower your job as

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550
Brady that you are a flower your job as
 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.640
Brady that you are a flower your job as
a flower is to deal with your seeds it's

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650
a flower is to deal with your seeds it's
 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.599
a flower is to deal with your seeds it's
kind of the job of everything living

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
kind of the job of everything living
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.859
kind of the job of everything living
you're gonna grow some seeds and we're

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
you're gonna grow some seeds and we're
 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:28.939
you're gonna grow some seeds and we're
gonna model this flower in a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949
gonna model this flower in a
 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:29.630
gonna model this flower in a
mathematical way

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640
mathematical way
 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.130
mathematical way
this is not how flowers actually grow

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140
this is not how flowers actually grow
 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.479
this is not how flowers actually grow
but there are connections this is the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489
but there are connections this is the
 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.280
but there are connections this is the
center when you grow a seed I'm gonna

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
center when you grow a seed I'm gonna
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.780
center when you grow a seed I'm gonna
represent that by putting a little blob

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790
represent that by putting a little blob
 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.100
represent that by putting a little blob
that's a seed that you've going from the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110
that's a seed that you've going from the
 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.049
that's a seed that you've going from the
center of your flower and one option you

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059
center of your flower and one option you
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.549
center of your flower and one option you
could have is is you've got it so where

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559
could have is is you've got it so where
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.840
could have is is you've got it so where
to put your seeds and I'm gonna give you

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
to put your seeds and I'm gonna give you
 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.209
to put your seeds and I'm gonna give you
the option of only how much do you turn

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219
the option of only how much do you turn
 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.610
the option of only how much do you turn
around before you grow your next seed so

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
around before you grow your next seed so
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.830
around before you grow your next seed so
you put a seed down and you could turn a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
you put a seed down and you could turn a
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.260
you put a seed down and you could turn a
bit and put another seat down kind of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270
bit and put another seat down kind of
 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.729
bit and put another seat down kind of
growing it if you don't turn at all

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739
growing it if you don't turn at all
 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.290
growing it if you don't turn at all
you're gonna grow seeds out like this

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300
you're gonna grow seeds out like this
 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.400
you're gonna grow seeds out like this
the first he goes there if you don't

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410
the first he goes there if you don't
 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.959
the first he goes there if you don't
turn the next he goes next to it then if

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
turn the next he goes next to it then if
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.250
turn the next he goes next to it then if
one goes next to it you're gonna grow

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
one goes next to it you're gonna grow
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.090
one goes next to it you're gonna grow
the seeds out there and you're gonna

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
the seeds out there and you're gonna
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.860
the seeds out there and you're gonna
push seeds out actually I'm adding them

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870
push seeds out actually I'm adding them
 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.060
push seeds out actually I'm adding them
on the end but it grow from there and

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070
on the end but it grow from there and
 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.979
on the end but it grow from there and
push this seeds out on the line this is

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989
push this seeds out on the line this is
 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.630
push this seeds out on the line this is
a really bad arrangement for a flower I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
a really bad arrangement for a flower I
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.890
a really bad arrangement for a flower I
hope you agree and I hope you weren't

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
hope you agree and I hope you weren't
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.480
hope you agree and I hope you weren't
imagining this when you were thinking of

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
imagining this when you were thinking of
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.539
imagining this when you were thinking of
a flower yeah there's a whole bunch of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549
a flower yeah there's a whole bunch of
 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.090
a flower yeah there's a whole bunch of
circle unused so the obvious thing if

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
circle unused so the obvious thing if
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.830
circle unused so the obvious thing if
I'm gonna do this model of like if a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
I'm gonna do this model of like if a
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.030
I'm gonna do this model of like if a
flower could just grow by putting a seed

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040
flower could just grow by putting a seed
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.410
flower could just grow by putting a seed
in and turning a bit what would happen

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
in and turning a bit what would happen
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.420
in and turning a bit what would happen
if you turn an amount of a turn so I'm

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430
if you turn an amount of a turn so I'm
 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.100
if you turn an amount of a turn so I'm
gonna talk about fractions of turns this

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
gonna talk about fractions of turns this
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.410
gonna talk about fractions of turns this
is a fraction return of zero if you do

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
is a fraction return of zero if you do
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.240
is a fraction return of zero if you do
no one here with an you turn half a turn

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
no one here with an you turn half a turn
 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.980
no one here with an you turn half a turn
each time then if the first seed goes

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990
each time then if the first seed goes
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.539
each time then if the first seed goes
here then I think if you turn half turn

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
here then I think if you turn half turn
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.640
here then I think if you turn half turn
the next one's gonna go there if you

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
the next one's gonna go there if you
 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.080
the next one's gonna go there if you
don't half turn again keep UN same

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
don't half turn again keep UN same
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.520
don't half turn again keep UN same
direction it's gonna go there and there

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
direction it's gonna go there and there
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.880
direction it's gonna go there and there
and this is also not exciting being kind

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
and this is also not exciting being kind
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.350
and this is also not exciting being kind
of see why the decision of turning a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
of see why the decision of turning a
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.390
of see why the decision of turning a
half has made two lines and maybe gonna

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
half has made two lines and maybe gonna
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.520
half has made two lines and maybe gonna
call these spokes because just to get

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
call these spokes because just to get
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.870
call these spokes because just to get
you in the mood Lister third you could

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
you in the mood Lister third you could
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.280
you in the mood Lister third you could
probably predict it pretty easily see

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
probably predict it pretty easily see
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.960
probably predict it pretty easily see
turn that third of a turn or roughly

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
turn that third of a turn or roughly
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.609
turn that third of a turn or roughly
there third of a turn roughly there and

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
there third of a turn roughly there and
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.590
there third of a turn roughly there and
you're gonna see these three spokes

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600
you're gonna see these three spokes
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.050
you're gonna see these three spokes
sticking out pretty easily happy enough

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
sticking out pretty easily happy enough
 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.130
sticking out pretty easily happy enough
with this I mean these none of these are

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
with this I mean these none of these are
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.929
with this I mean these none of these are
good flower designs but the consequences

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939
good flower designs but the consequences
 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.730
good flower designs but the consequences
of choosing a number is giving you some

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
of choosing a number is giving you some
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.609
of choosing a number is giving you some
patterns so if I jump say to a tenth of

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619
patterns so if I jump say to a tenth of
 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.010
patterns so if I jump say to a tenth of
a turn would you care to predict what

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020
a turn would you care to predict what
 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.700
a turn would you care to predict what
you'd see yeah and so I don't think the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
you'd see yeah and so I don't think the
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.559
you'd see yeah and so I don't think the
the spoke behavior is very surprising

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
the spoke behavior is very surprising
 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.150
the spoke behavior is very surprising
and it looks like the denominator of

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160
and it looks like the denominator of
 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.520
and it looks like the denominator of
this

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530
this
 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.020
this
fraction of attorneys controlling

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030
fraction of attorneys controlling
 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.910
fraction of attorneys controlling
everything now I think it's much less

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920
everything now I think it's much less
 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.070
everything now I think it's much less
obvious if I told you what would happen

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080
obvious if I told you what would happen
 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.230
obvious if I told you what would happen
three tenths so with three tenths if you

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240
three tenths so with three tenths if you
 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.520
three tenths so with three tenths if you
start here you have three tenths of a

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530
start here you have three tenths of a
 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.770
start here you have three tenths of a
turn you'd skip a couple of the branches

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
turn you'd skip a couple of the branches
 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.510
turn you'd skip a couple of the branches
and then that another three tenths you'd

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520
and then that another three tenths you'd
 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.010
and then that another three tenths you'd
skip a couple you get on here three

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020
skip a couple you get on here three
 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.900
skip a couple you get on here three
tenths you'd skip a couple go here and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910
tenths you'd skip a couple go here and
 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.040
tenths you'd skip a couple go here and
if you keep going around you'll end up

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050
if you keep going around you'll end up
 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.960
if you keep going around you'll end up
not repeating yourself for a bit until

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970
not repeating yourself for a bit until
 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.040
not repeating yourself for a bit until
all ten are done

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050
all ten are done
 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.540
all ten are done
you also get tens books so there's this

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550
you also get tens books so there's this
 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.680
you also get tens books so there's this
really nice thing in mathematics called

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690
really nice thing in mathematics called
 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.060
really nice thing in mathematics called
a conjecture we pretty much have one

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070
a conjecture we pretty much have one
 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.650
a conjecture we pretty much have one
here looks like it's the denominator of

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660
here looks like it's the denominator of
 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.210
here looks like it's the denominator of
the fraction is controlling number

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220
the fraction is controlling number
 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.070
the fraction is controlling number
spokes so here's a quick computer model

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080
spokes so here's a quick computer model
 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.600
spokes so here's a quick computer model
of what we've been talking about and we

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610
of what we've been talking about and we
 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.100
of what we've been talking about and we
can check that with other tests before I

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110

if you type in some other numbers there

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570
if you type in some other numbers there
 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.020

are some surprises so I do 11 out of 23

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030
are some surprises so I do 11 out of 23
 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.330
are some surprises so I do 11 out of 23
you do get 23 spokes but there's some

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340
you do get 23 spokes but there's some
 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.590
you do get 23 spokes but there's some
interesting behavior happening in the

interesting behavior happening in the
 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.030
interesting behavior happening in the
middle and that's actually it looks like

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040
middle and that's actually it looks like
 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.320

this kind of two spokes but they're kind

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330
this kind of two spokes but they're kind
 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.699
this kind of two spokes but they're kind
of twisted and that's because this

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709
of twisted and that's because this
 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.920

number is quite close to one over two

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930
number is quite close to one over two
 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.420
number is quite close to one over two
and it looks like what numbers you're

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430
and it looks like what numbers you're
 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.760
and it looks like what numbers you're
close to also affect what happens one

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770

can't actually and was it happening is

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750
can't actually and was it happening is
 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.479
can't actually and was it happening is
that four tenths is better described by

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489
that four tenths is better described by
 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.970
that four tenths is better described by
two fifths so you've seen lots of bad

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980
two fifths so you've seen lots of bad
 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.710
two fifths so you've seen lots of bad
flowers this is pretty but it's not what

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720
flowers this is pretty but it's not what
 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.180
flowers this is pretty but it's not what
flowers - what's interesting is if you

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190
flowers - what's interesting is if you
 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.460
flowers - what's interesting is if you
change this number very very slowly and

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470
change this number very very slowly and
 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.289
change this number very very slowly and
you realize that a tiny change gives you

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299
you realize that a tiny change gives you
 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.820
you realize that a tiny change gives you
very different behavior so this number

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830
very different behavior so this number
 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.920
very different behavior so this number
is changing ridiculously slowly but even

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930
is changing ridiculously slowly but even
 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.560
is changing ridiculously slowly but even
a small jump he's giving us spirally

shapes and very quickly they stop

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459
shapes and very quickly they stop

looking like suppose that the number is

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720
looking like suppose that the number is
 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.870
looking like suppose that the number is

the fraction of a turn before I grow you
 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.630
the fraction of a turn before I grow you
see so this number that's here is is

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:54.930
going in lines and they're starting to
bunch together and this is already

there is and I'll show it to you and
then I'll show you why so here it is if

going in both directions they're kind of
 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.430
going in both directions they're kind of

crossing over both ways and you could

it could be 4 plus a bit right then I

it could be 4 plus a bit right then I
could say this is 3 plus 1 over

could say this is 3 plus 1 over
 

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.260
could say this is 3 plus 1 over
something and I could find out what that

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:49.270
something and I could find out what that
 

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.150
something and I could find out what that
something is on a calculator I could

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:51.160
something is on a calculator I could
 

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.770
something is on a calculator I could
take away the 3 and I get into something

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:52.780
take away the 3 and I get into something
 

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.780
take away the 3 and I get into something
and then I could do 1 over there or X to

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:54.790
and then I could do 1 over there or X to
 

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.340
and then I could do 1 over there or X to
the minus 1 to find out what it is and

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:56.350
the minus 1 to find out what it is and
 

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.020
the minus 1 to find out what it is and
it actually is seven point something so

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.030
it actually is seven point something so
 

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.180
it actually is seven point something so
I'm gonna write this 1 over 7 plus a bit

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:00.190
I'm gonna write this 1 over 7 plus a bit
 

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.590
I'm gonna write this 1 over 7 plus a bit
the words a bit are not sort of

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:01.600
the words a bit are not sort of

but you get the idea so I could carry on

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:04.510
but you get the idea so I could carry on
 

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.560
but you get the idea so I could carry on
I know this 3 plus 1 over 7 plus a bit

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:07.570
I know this 3 plus 1 over 7 plus a bit
 

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:08.550
I know this 3 plus 1 over 7 plus a bit
and I could write that as 1 over

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560
and I could write that as 1 over
 

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.990
and I could write that as 1 over
something and that's on my screen now so

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000
something and that's on my screen now so
 

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.880
something and that's on my screen now so
I could take away the the 7 and get the

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:11.890
I could take away the the 7 and get the
 

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.330
I could take away the the 7 and get the
bit and do 1 over that and I get 15 and

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:15.340
bit and do 1 over that and I get 15 and
 

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.460
bit and do 1 over that and I get 15 and
a bit I can start writing 15 plus a bit

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:17.470
a bit I can start writing 15 plus a bit
 

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.570
a bit I can start writing 15 plus a bit
instead of doing me a bit now I'm just

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:18.580
instead of doing me a bit now I'm just
 

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.860
instead of doing me a bit now I'm just
gonna go straight in with 1 over

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:19.870
gonna go straight in with 1 over
 

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:24.000
gonna go straight in with 1 over
something take away 15 get the bit X to

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.010
something take away 15 get the bit X to
 

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.890
something take away 15 get the bit X to
the minus 1 do 1 over it and they get

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:25.900
the minus 1 do 1 over it and they get
 

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.310
the minus 1 do 1 over it and they get
one and a bit take away 1 through the

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:29.320
one and a bit take away 1 through the
 

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.620
one and a bit take away 1 through the
bits a very small bit this time and I

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:31.630
bits a very small bit this time and I
 

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.930
bits a very small bit this time and I
get to 9 2 and you can see that if this

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:33.940
get to 9 2 and you can see that if this
 

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.760
get to 9 2 and you can see that if this
number is truly irrational I could just

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:35.770
number is truly irrational I could just
 

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.260
number is truly irrational I could just
keep going and actually this thing here

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:37.270
keep going and actually this thing here
 

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.090
keep going and actually this thing here
is called the continued fraction for pi

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:39.100
is called the continued fraction for pi
 

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.770
is called the continued fraction for pi
and something very obvious happens with

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:40.780
and something very obvious happens with
 

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.270
and something very obvious happens with
the PI is that you get a very small

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:42.280
the PI is that you get a very small
 

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.380
the PI is that you get a very small
number here then you get a very large

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:43.390
number here then you get a very large
 

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.850
number here then you get a very large
number here in the trade they call it

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:44.860
number here in the trade they call it
 

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.740
number here in the trade they call it
truncating but if you chop the continued

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:46.750
truncating but if you chop the continued
 

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:47.560
truncating but if you chop the continued
fraction its own

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:47.570
fraction its own
 

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.390
fraction its own
you'll get an approximation so three and

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:49.400
you'll get an approximation so three and
 

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.850
you'll get an approximation so three and
a seventh is 22 over 7 it's a good

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:51.860
a seventh is 22 over 7 it's a good
 

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.530
a seventh is 22 over 7 it's a good
approximation for pi if you're talking

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:53.540
approximation for pi if you're talking
 

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.910
approximation for pi if you're talking
there you get a approximation if you

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920
there you get a approximation if you
 

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.010
there you get a approximation if you
chop it there I'll chop it there but

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:57.020
chop it there I'll chop it there but
 

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.330
chop it there I'll chop it there but
because this number is massive

00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:58.340
because this number is massive
 

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.930
because this number is massive
and it's one over that number this

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:00.940
and it's one over that number this
 

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:06.160

additional bit is tiny well actually

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:06.170
additional bit is tiny well actually
 

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.840
additional bit is tiny well actually
after that goes back to being someone's

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:07.850
after that goes back to being someone's
 

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.370
after that goes back to being someone's
in the continued fraction but that

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:09.380
in the continued fraction but that
 

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.990
in the continued fraction but that
particular point it means that you don't

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.000
particular point it means that you don't
 

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.970
particular point it means that you don't
add very much accuracy at those two

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:12.980
add very much accuracy at those two
 

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.050
add very much accuracy at those two
levels truncation which means it was

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:14.060
levels truncation which means it was
 

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.430
levels truncation which means it was
really accurate before which means the

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440
really accurate before which means the
 

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.620
really accurate before which means the
step before that was ridiculously good

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:17.630
step before that was ridiculously good
 

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.100
step before that was ridiculously good
which means pi is well approximated

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:21.110
which means pi is well approximated
 

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.840
which means pi is well approximated
quite early on by a rational number

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:22.850
quite early on by a rational number
 

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.370
quite early on by a rational number
which is why I'm gonna claim it's not

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:24.380
which is why I'm gonna claim it's not
 

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.660
which is why I'm gonna claim it's not
very irrational and why when you saw the

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:25.670
very irrational and why when you saw the
 

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.790
very irrational and why when you saw the
diagram of it looks like ants pokes so

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:27.800
diagram of it looks like ants pokes so
 

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.170
diagram of it looks like ants pokes so
looking in the continued fraction the

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:29.180
looking in the continued fraction the
 

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.400
looking in the continued fraction the
question is what would the most

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:30.410
question is what would the most
 

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.930
question is what would the most
irrational number look like it would be

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:31.940
irrational number look like it would be
 

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.250
irrational number look like it would be
the one with a continued fraction that

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:33.260
the one with a continued fraction that
 

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.990
the one with a continued fraction that
doesn't have any large numbers in it so

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.000
doesn't have any large numbers in it so
 

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.820
doesn't have any large numbers in it so
I'm gonna claim that this is a pretty

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:36.830
I'm gonna claim that this is a pretty
 

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.080
I'm gonna claim that this is a pretty
good candidate I'm gonna call it X so

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.090
good candidate I'm gonna call it X so
 

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.490
good candidate I'm gonna call it X so
the continued fraction would be let's

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:39.500
the continued fraction would be let's
 

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.360
the continued fraction would be let's
just start with one

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:40.370
just start with one
 

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.560
just start with one
but then the continued fraction would go

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:41.570
but then the continued fraction would go
 

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.890
but then the continued fraction would go
one over the smallest whole number one I

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:44.900
one over the smallest whole number one I
 

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.510
one over the smallest whole number one I
know have one here I don't have a one

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:46.520
know have one here I don't have a one
 

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.490
know have one here I don't have a one
here I have a one here and this is

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:48.500
here I have a one here and this is
 

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.540
here I have a one here and this is
something that a lot of people do

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:49.550
something that a lot of people do
 

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.250
something that a lot of people do
recognize it's an odd thing to ask what

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:51.260
recognize it's an odd thing to ask what
 

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.170
recognize it's an odd thing to ask what
it is but whatever it is it will be

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:53.180
it is but whatever it is it will be
 

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.940

badly approximated anytime you truncate

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:54.950
badly approximated anytime you truncate
 

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.500

it because these numbers are small now

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:56.510
it because these numbers are small now

just as a little heads up I'm just gonna

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.130
just as a little heads up I'm just gonna
 

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.310
just as a little heads up I'm just gonna
tell you the root two has a continued

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320
tell you the root two has a continued
 

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.470
tell you the root two has a continued
fraction as well one plus one over two

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480
fraction as well one plus one over two
 

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.610

carries on like that which is

carries on like that which is
 

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.040
carries on like that which is
incidentally why root two looked pretty

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.050
incidentally why root two looked pretty
 

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.690
incidentally why root two looked pretty
good on our diagram because although

is that this thing is the same as the

is that this thing is the same as the
whole thing it is X which means I can

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:30.950
whole thing it is X which means I can
 

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.710
