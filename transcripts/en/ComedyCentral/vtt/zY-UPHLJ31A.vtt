00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:07.707 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THESE STARCHY DELIGHTS HAVE
BEEN THE STAPLE OF OUR FOOD

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.576 line:91%
SINCE THE DAWN OF MAN, BUT NOW
SCIENCE IS TRYING TO CHANGE ALL

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:11.744 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT.

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:13.880 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
AGRICULTURE HAS GIVEN THE GREEN

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:18.051 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIGHT TO A GENETICALLY MODIFIED
POTATO.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.086 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, POTATO!

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.287 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHY?

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.124 line:91%
AND THIS DEADLY G.M.O. TUBER,
DEVELOPED BY EVIL AGRICULTURE

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:28.594 size:78% position:39% line:91%
CORPORATIONS HAS MEN LIKE
JEFFREY SMITH TERRIFIED.

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:31.531 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE THAT GENETICALLY
ENGINEERED CROPS MAY BE ONE OF

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:37.036 line:91%
THE MOST DANGEROUS INTRODUCTIONS
OF AN ADDITIVE IN SUPPLY IN OUR

G.M.O. POTATOES WILL KILL US.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.882 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE PROCESS ITSELF IS
DANGEROUS.

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:54.887 line:91%
THEY CREATE A LITTLE PIECE OF
R.N.A., AND PUT IT INTO THE

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.090 align:start position:0% line:91%
POTATO SO THAT IT SILENCES SOME
GENES.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:01:01.094 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF WE EAT THE POTATO, IT MIGHT
REGULATE OUR OWN GENE

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:08.968 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF IT
GENERICALLY UNSAFE.

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.169 line:85%
&gt;&gt; ( BLEEP ) MONSANTO, RIGHT?

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:13.406 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, NOT IN THE CASE OF THIS
POTATO.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.242 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS IS SIMPLOT, J.R. SIMPLOT,
THE BIG POTATO PRODUCER.

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:18.511 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DID YOU SAY SIMPOT?
&gt;&gt; I DID.

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:22.648 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO ( BLEEP ). SIMPLOT? YOU
MAY NOT REMEMBER THEM,

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:23.983 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT I DO.

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:27.320 line:91%
A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT TO IDAHO
AND UNCOVERED A CONSPIRACY THAT

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:31.924 line:91%
INVOLVED SIMPLOT, POLUTION, AN
E.P.A. COVER-UP, A TWO-HEADED

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:33.860 align:start position:0% line:91%
FISH AND I WAS ALMOST
ARRESTED TWICE.

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:35.561 line:85%
IT COULD HAVE RUINED MY CAREER.

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:39.132 align:start position:0% line:92%
SIMPLOT!

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:40.366 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M NOT DOING IT.

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.269 line:85%
I'M NOT -- I'M NOT DOING SIMPOT.

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:43.669 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:44.537 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'VE DONE IT.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.505 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'VE DONE THAT.

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:48.107 align:start position:0% line:85%
BEEN THERE. ( BLEEP ).

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.375 align:start position:0% line:91%
NO! NO! NO YOU GET THE 
( BLEEP )

00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:50.476 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS YOUR ( BLEEP ) SHOW.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS YOU ( BLEEP ) FAULT.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:50.776 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY YOU ( BLEEP ). YOU DIDN'T
TELL ME IT WAS ( BLEEP )

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.343 align:start position:0% line:85%
SIMPLOT.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:58.985 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT.

00:01:59.018 --> 00:01:59.685 align:start position:0% line:85%
BENNETT!

00:01:59.718 --> 00:01:59.986 align:start position:0% line:85%
FINE!

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:03.389 align:start position:0% line:85%
FINE!

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:04.490 align:start position:0% line:85%
( BLEEP ) SIMPLOT.

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:11.497 size:84% position:42% line:91%
BUT STRANGELY, ACCORDING TO
CORNELL'S POTATO MOLECULAR

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.598 align:start position:0% line:91%
GENETICIST WALTER DE JONG,
SIMPLOT'S DEVIL TATER

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:14.734 size:78% position:39% line:85%
IS ACTUALLY AN ANGEL TOT.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.602 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE POTATO PRODUCES LESS
ACRYLAMIDE WHEN FRIED.

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:18.437 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.072 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ACRYLAMIDE IS A NEUROTOXIN,
A POSSIBLE CARCINOGEN.

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:21.340 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

00:02:21.373 --> 00:02:27.413 line:91%
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THE SIMPOT
POTATO CUTS DOWN ON POSSIBLE

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:27.847 align:start position:0% line:85%
CARCINOGENS.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.048 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:32.451 line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT WHAT ABOUT LIKE WHEN THE
R.N.A. GETS INTO MY BODY AND

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:34.253 align:start position:0% line:85%
CHANGES MY D.N.A.?

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:35.421 line:85%
IT'S MOVING ( BLEEP ) AROUND.

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:38.824 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS
DON'T ALTER HUMAN D.N.A.

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:39.825 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHAT IF THEY DID?

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:41.026 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THEY DON'T.

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:44.430 align:start position:0% line:91%
OUR BODIES HAVE BEEN SLICING AND
DICING D.N.A. FOR AS LONG AS

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:46.165 size:75% position:38% line:85%
WE'VE BEEN IN EXISTENCE.

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:48.201 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO THERE'S NO CHANGE TO THE
D.N.A.?

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:51.170 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE'S NO CHANGE TO OUR
D.N.A.

00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:54.574 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY WHO IS
WORKING FOR SIMPOT.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:55.541 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WORK FOR SIMPLOT.

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:56.542 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY PAY FOR YOUR
RESEARCH.

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:59.345 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO, THEY DON'T FUND MY
RESEARCH IN ANY WAY.

00:02:59.378 --> 00:03:01.047 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEN YOU GO TO THEIR PARTIES
AND YOU HANG OUT WITH THEM.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.248 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, I DO NOT.

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:09.121 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, OKAY, JUST BECAUSE HE'S
NOT ON THE POTATO'S PAYROLL,

00:03:09.154 --> 00:03:12.959 align:start size:91% position:9% line:91%
DOESN'T MEAN OTHER FRANKEN
VEGGIES WON'T KILL US.

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:14.193 line:91%
THERE'S ALSO CORN THAT
PRODUCES ITS OWN TOXIC

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:16.629 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
INSECTICIDE THAT BREAK OPEN
LITTLE HOLES IN HUMAN CELLS AS

00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:17.663 align:start position:0% line:85%
WELL.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:18.264 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE BT PROTEIN THAT
YOU'RE REFERING TO DOES NOT

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:19.432 size:81% position:41%
CREATE HOLES IN OUR CELLS.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.133 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO, LIKE IT LIKE BURNS
THROUGH THE CELL AND CREATES

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:22.168 line:85%
A HOLE IN YOUR CELL.

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:24.337 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD MAKE A HOLE IN
YOUR CELL?

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.004 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.339 line:85%
NO, NO I HEARD THAT SOMEWHERE.

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:29.508 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT'S-- YEAH.

00:03:29.541 --> 00:03:32.345 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT
THESE POTATOES ARE NOT

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:33.513 align:start position:0%
DANGEROUS.

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:36.549 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE POTATO IS JUST AS SAFE AS
COCONVENTIONALLY DEVELOPED

00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:37.116 align:start position:0% line:85%
POTATOES.

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:38.651 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; PO-TAT-O.
&gt;&gt; POTATO.

00:03:38.684 --> 00:03:41.153 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; REALLY, IT'S NOT DANGEROUS?
THAT'S NOT DANGEROUS.

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:43.322 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S NOT DANGEROUS.

00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:44.690 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; PLEASE STOP DOING THAT.

00:03:44.723 --> 00:03:48.561 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT DANGEROUS. THAT'S
NOT DANGEROUS?

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:50.896 align:start position:0% line:92%
PRETTY DANGEROUS TO ME.

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:52.565 align:start position:0% line:91%
TURNS OUT THAT WALTER'S NOT
ALONE.

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:54.900 align:start position:0% line:91%
A RECENT PEW POLL SHOWS THAT 88%
OF SCIENTISTS BELIEVE G.M.O.s

00:03:54.933 --> 00:03:59.605 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE SAFE, WHILE ONLY 37% OF
AMERICANS BELIEVE THEM.

00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:01.574 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT LUCKY FOR US--

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:02.575 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:03.743 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:07.546 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WORK-- I INTERVIEW SCIENTISTS
AND TRANSLATE SCIENCE INTO

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.181 align:start position:0% line:91%
ENGLISH SO THAT EVERYONE CAN
UNDERSTAND.

00:04:09.214 --> 00:04:11.784 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO, YEAH, I'VE INTERVIEWED A LOT
OF SCIENTISTS, TOO.

00:04:11.817 --> 00:04:16.789 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SOMETIMES I PURPOSELY PLAY
DUMB SO THAT THEY EXPLAIN IT IN

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:18.824 align:start position:0% line:91%
A WAY THAT MAKES IT
REALLY CLEAR, AND--

00:04:18.857 --> 00:04:19.592 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DO THE SAME THING.
&gt;&gt; AND I -- YEAH.

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:21.227 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.862 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE ).

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:27.199 line:91%
&gt;&gt; DAVID SUZUKI, A GENETICIST
AND TV PERSONALITY SAID IF ANY

00:04:27.232 --> 00:04:30.369 size:78% position:39% line:91%
SCIENTIST TELLS THAT YOU
G.M.O.s ARE SAFE, THEY'RE

00:04:30.402 --> 00:04:32.338 size:88% position:44% line:85%
EITHER VERY STUPID OR LYING.

00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:36.609 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I SEE, SO SCIENTISTS ARE ALL
STUPID LIARS, WHICH I SUPPOSE IS

00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:41.347 line:91%
WHY NONE OF THE ACTUAL SIMPLOT
POTATO SCIENTISTS WOULD TALK TO

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.515 align:start position:0% line:85%
US.

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:44.950 line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO, THEY'RE WORRIED THAT
THEIR LABS AND FIELDS WILL BE

00:04:44.983 --> 00:04:45.450 align:start position:0% line:85%
TARGETED.

00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:46.652 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; TARGETED BY WHO?

00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:48.020 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; G.M.O. FOES.

00:04:48.053 --> 00:04:50.623 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO THE ANTI-G.M.O. PEOPLE ARE
THE ASSHOLES

00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:53.993 line:85%
AND SIMPLOT ARE THE GOOD GUYS.

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:55.127 line:85%
&gt;&gt; UNCHARACTERISTIC, BUT YES.

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:59.131 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, OKAY, BUT THESE
AGRA-BUSINESSES HAVE A MONOPOLY

00:04:59.164 --> 00:05:01.734 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
ON OUR ENTIRE FOOD SUPPLY AND
THAT IS A HORRIFYING FACT

00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:02.935 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT EVEN SCIENTISTS
CANNOT ARGUE, RIGHT?

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:08.841 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, THE GREATEST
DAMAGE DONE BY THE ANTI-G.M.O.

00:05:08.874 --> 00:05:09.942 align:start position:0% line:91%
LOBBY IS THE THE
INCREASED REGULATORY COSTS

00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:11.644 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT ANYONE NOW DEVELOPING A
GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROP

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:14.613 size:88% position:44% line:91%
HAS TO GO THROUGH MEANS THAT
ONLY THE BIG COMPANIES WITH

00:05:14.646 --> 00:05:18.417 line:91%
THE DEEPEST POCKETS CAN PLAY AND
IT'S LEADING TO A HAND FULL OF

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:24.523 align:start position:0% line:91%
COMPANIES CONTROLLING SEEDS OF
ALL OF OUR MAJOR CROPS.

00:05:24.556 --> 00:05:28.461 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO YOU'RE SAYING THE
ANTI-GMO LOBBY IS ACTUALLY

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:30.563 size:81% position:41% line:91%
RESULTING IN A MONOPOLY BY
COMPANIES LIKE SIMPLOT AND

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:31.430 align:start position:0%
MONSTANTO.

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:34.200 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S AN UNINTENDED
CONSEQUENCE, YES.

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:36.902 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S LIKE ( BLEEP ).

00:05:36.935 --> 00:05:38.037 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.907 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN THIS STORY IT'S NOT
SCIENTISTS OR AGRO-BUSINESS

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.009 line:85%
MESSING WITH OUR FOOD SUPPLY.

00:05:44.042 --> 00:05:47.913 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
IT'S PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONVINCED
THE WORLD THAT THE SIMPLOT

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:51.016 line:85%
POTATO WILL TURN THIS INTO THIS.

00:05:51.049 --> 00:05:53.652 line:85%
