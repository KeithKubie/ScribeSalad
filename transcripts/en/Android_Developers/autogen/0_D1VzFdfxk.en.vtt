I'm here today to tell you a couple

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.260
I'm here today to tell you a couple
 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.070
I'm here today to tell you a couple
stories about optimizing things for our

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080
stories about optimizing things for our
 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.730
stories about optimizing things for our
Android wear and uh well first off a

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740
Android wear and uh well first off a
 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.519
Android wear and uh well first off a
little bit about myself I'm an engineer

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529
little bit about myself I'm an engineer
 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.290
little bit about myself I'm an engineer
on the Android wear frameworks team I

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300
on the Android wear frameworks team I
 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.509
on the Android wear frameworks team I
spent a lot of my time doing battery

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:20.519
spent a lot of my time doing battery
 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.550
spent a lot of my time doing battery
life optimization among some other

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560
life optimization among some other
 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.290
life optimization among some other
things and I've been developing for

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300
things and I've been developing for
 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.019
things and I've been developing for
Android since the dark days of cupcake

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029
Android since the dark days of cupcake
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.950
Android since the dark days of cupcake
many many moons ago and yeah the I guess

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960
many many moons ago and yeah the I guess
 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.909
many many moons ago and yeah the I guess
the only other thing you mentioned I'm

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919
the only other thing you mentioned I'm
 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.010
the only other thing you mentioned I'm
Canadian so you see any funky spelling

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020
Canadian so you see any funky spelling
 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.340
Canadian so you see any funky spelling
and so on so forth that's because you

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
and so on so forth that's because you
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.560
and so on so forth that's because you
know that's how you spell English and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
know that's how you spell English and
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.250
know that's how you spell English and
it's real Queen's English and yeah so

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
it's real Queen's English and yeah so
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.290
it's real Queen's English and yeah so
well first off the most important part

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300
well first off the most important part
 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.389
well first off the most important part
about optimizing your Android wear is

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399
about optimizing your Android wear is
 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.869
about optimizing your Android wear is
well battery life pretty

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
well battery life pretty
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.340
well battery life pretty
self-explanatory the worst thing you can

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
self-explanatory the worst thing you can
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.200
self-explanatory the worst thing you can
possibly have when I watch these days is

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210
possibly have when I watch these days is
 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.830
possibly have when I watch these days is
one that has a blank screen we all kind

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840
one that has a blank screen we all kind
 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.290
one that has a blank screen we all kind
of like and our users all like having a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
of like and our users all like having a
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.479
of like and our users all like having a
screen that's always on so always got

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
screen that's always on so always got
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.430
screen that's always on so always got
information and you can always you know

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440
information and you can always you know
 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.370
information and you can always you know
glanced at it and see what's up so

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
glanced at it and see what's up so
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.040
glanced at it and see what's up so
there's a couple challenges when it

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050
there's a couple challenges when it
 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.780
there's a couple challenges when it
comes to optimizing for battery life and

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790
comes to optimizing for battery life and
 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.030
comes to optimizing for battery life and
well the screen being on all the time is

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040
well the screen being on all the time is
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.570
well the screen being on all the time is
actually a pretty big problem to

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580
actually a pretty big problem to
 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.010
actually a pretty big problem to
actually have the screen on we have to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
actually have the screen on we have to
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.710
actually have the screen on we have to
make a lot of compromises and there's

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720
make a lot of compromises and there's
 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.690
make a lot of compromises and there's
actually want just a pretty good they've

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700
actually want just a pretty good they've
 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.390
actually want just a pretty good they've
got enough performance run Android it's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400
got enough performance run Android it's
 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.730
got enough performance run Android it's
gotten a performance to run full videos

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740
gotten a performance to run full videos
 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.280
gotten a performance to run full videos
and that tends to be a problem because

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290
and that tends to be a problem because
 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.080
and that tends to be a problem because
if you run full videos and your watch

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090
if you run full videos and your watch
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.840
if you run full videos and your watch
they don't tend to last very long so

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850
they don't tend to last very long so
 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.000
they don't tend to last very long so
yeah there's quite a few things we have

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010
yeah there's quite a few things we have
 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.760
yeah there's quite a few things we have
to deal with if you want a very very

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
to deal with if you want a very very
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.530
to deal with if you want a very very
powerful device that can last a long

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
powerful device that can last a long
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.810
powerful device that can last a long
time you could strap your phone to your

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820
time you could strap your phone to your
 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.390
time you could strap your phone to your
want to your wrist but that's also not

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400
want to your wrist but that's also not
 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.080
want to your wrist but that's also not
very pretty so yeah we have now three

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
very pretty so yeah we have now three
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.830
very pretty so yeah we have now three
tails for about battery life these are

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840
tails for about battery life these are
 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.840
tails for about battery life these are
sort of cautionary tales sort of a

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850
sort of cautionary tales sort of a
 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.180
sort of cautionary tales sort of a
campfire ghost stories of things that

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190
campfire ghost stories of things that
 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.750
campfire ghost stories of things that
have well what's also happened but you

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760
have well what's also happened but you
 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.359
have well what's also happened but you
know lessons that we've learned so first

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
know lessons that we've learned so first
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.889
know lessons that we've learned so first
I want to start off with the watch face

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
I want to start off with the watch face
 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.110
I want to start off with the watch face
so this watch face wants to be really

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120
so this watch face wants to be really
 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.640
so this watch face wants to be really
really really pretty and how you make a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
really really pretty and how you make a
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.920
really really pretty and how you make a
really pretty watch face oh we start

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930
really pretty watch face oh we start
 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.760
really pretty watch face oh we start
with like go

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770
with like go
 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.090
with like go
gorgeous animations and i'm talking like

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100
gorgeous animations and i'm talking like
 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.930
gorgeous animations and i'm talking like
animations that have a slowly moving

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940
animations that have a slowly moving
 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.450
animations that have a slowly moving
second hand that sweeps gracefully

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460
second hand that sweeps gracefully
 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.770
second hand that sweeps gracefully
across the screen it's got cogs

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780
across the screen it's got cogs
 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.690
across the screen it's got cogs
basically taking away the background

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700
basically taking away the background
 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.550
basically taking away the background
gorgeous gorgeous luscious well there's

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560
gorgeous gorgeous luscious well there's
 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.880
gorgeous gorgeous luscious well there's
a big problem of that um animations are

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890
a big problem of that um animations are
 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.980
a big problem of that um animations are
very powerful they're great they're

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990
very powerful they're great they're
 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.780
very powerful they're great they're
gorgeous but they're really power-hungry

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790
gorgeous but they're really power-hungry
 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.510
gorgeous but they're really power-hungry
um if you have an animation that runs

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520
um if you have an animation that runs
 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.330
um if you have an animation that runs
every time your watch face shows up from

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340
every time your watch face shows up from
 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.940
every time your watch face shows up from
its ambient mode every time you look at

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950
its ambient mode every time you look at
 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.590
its ambient mode every time you look at
it it you know that's a little animation

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600
it it you know that's a little animation
 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.480
it it you know that's a little animation
yeah that's perfectly fine you know half

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490
yeah that's perfectly fine you know half
 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.970
yeah that's perfectly fine you know half
a second animation whatnot but you have

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980
a second animation whatnot but you have
 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.950
a second animation whatnot but you have
to keep an animation going all the time

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960
to keep an animation going all the time
 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.640
to keep an animation going all the time
well you're the application processor is

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650
well you're the application processor is
 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.110
well you're the application processor is
going to have to calculate all those on

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120
going to have to calculate all those on
 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.330
going to have to calculate all those on
all the pixels moving it's going

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340
all the pixels moving it's going
 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.920
all the pixels moving it's going
everything on your in watch is running

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930
everything on your in watch is running
 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.240
everything on your in watch is running
at full speed your watch is going to

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250
at full speed your watch is going to
 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.220
at full speed your watch is going to
heat up and that drains a lot of battery

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230
heat up and that drains a lot of battery
 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.860
heat up and that drains a lot of battery
life so probably want to avoid having

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870
life so probably want to avoid having
 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.580
life so probably want to avoid having
animations that run all the time so you

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590
animations that run all the time so you
 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.800
animations that run all the time so you
know you want to pick the best hot spots

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810
know you want to pick the best hot spots
 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.800
know you want to pick the best hot spots
for animation well the other problem

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810
for animation well the other problem
 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.330
for animation well the other problem
with animations and Android we're

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340
with animations and Android we're
 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.270
with animations and Android we're
actually well on phones you don't really

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280
actually well on phones you don't really
 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.660
actually well on phones you don't really
get screens that change in the refresh

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670
get screens that change in the refresh
 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.970
get screens that change in the refresh
rate very much almost all universally 60

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980
rate very much almost all universally 60
 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.210
rate very much almost all universally 60
Hertz so we target 60 frames per second

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220
Hertz so we target 60 frames per second
 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.620
Hertz so we target 60 frames per second
and parental unlatches because we're

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630
and parental unlatches because we're
 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.420
and parental unlatches because we're
using really small screens very power

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430
using really small screens very power
 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.070
using really small screens very power
efficient screens they're only

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080
efficient screens they're only
 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.190
efficient screens they're only
guaranteed to be an operating at 30

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200
guaranteed to be an operating at 30
 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.180
guaranteed to be an operating at 30
Hertz and this is sort of even more

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190
Hertz and this is sort of even more
 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.490
Hertz and this is sort of even more
compounded by the fact that some screens

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500
compounded by the fact that some screens
 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.380
compounded by the fact that some screens
work slightly faster some screens may

you turn on harder acceleration you're
 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.060
you turn on harder acceleration you're

we have watches that implement both just
so we have watches that have all LED

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880
so we have watches that have all LED
 

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.819
so we have watches that have all LED
screens and we have watches have LCD

00:08:43.819 --> 00:08:43.829
screens and we have watches have LCD
 

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:47.540

individual pixels you know it's fairly
 

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.720
individual pixels you know it's fairly
obvious but that means that if you go

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:53.730
obvious but that means that if you go
 

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.480
obvious but that means that if you go
with a darker palette it mitts need to

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:56.490
with a darker palette it mitts need to
 

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.890
with a darker palette it mitts need to
emit less light and therefore

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:57.900
emit less light and therefore
 

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.530
emit less light and therefore
takes less battery life on an LCD screen

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:00.540
takes less battery life on an LCD screen
 

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.000
takes less battery life on an LCD screen
it doesn't matter so if your watch face

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.010
it doesn't matter so if your watch face

comparison to say a completely white

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800
comparison to say a completely white
 

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.560
comparison to say a completely white
background so something to keep in mind

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:23.570
 

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.420
but you know if you take that into

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:26.430
but you know if you take that into
 

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.770
but you know if you take that into
account then you will have similar

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:27.780
account then you will have similar
 

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.950

great because what that does is that you
 

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.120
great because what that does is that you
can actually your app can actually give

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.130
can actually your app can actually give

improve it and one of the problems that

00:24:28.419 --> 00:24:28.429
improve it and one of the problems that
 

00:24:28.429 --> 00:24:31.090
improve it and one of the problems that
we were having was that we found out

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:31.100
we were having was that we found out
 

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.100
we were having was that we found out
that it was getting it was hitting
