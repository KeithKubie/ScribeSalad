00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.790
In the case of lactase persistence, one allele

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.530
has an effect. The t allele. Even when there's

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.770
only one copy. So if you're homozygous thymine or

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.770
heterozygous thymine cytosine, as long as you have one

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.500
of these thymine alleles or the, the plus alleles.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.510
We're going to be lactase persistent. And therefore, we're going to

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.723
be lactose tolerant. Only the homozygous combination of cytosines,

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:25.820
the minus minus combination, are we going to end up

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.760
with lactase non-persistence and a phenotype of

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.430
lactose intolerance. So out of the three

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.570
possible allelic combinations. Two of them result

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.980
in lactose tolerance and one of them results

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.290
in lactose intolerance. Thus, lactose intolerance is

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.130
considered a recessive trait. And by recessive we

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.940
just mean it's masked by the presence

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.500
of another allele. Whereas the other trait, tolerance,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.400
lactose tolerance or the T allele is

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.790
considered dominant because we only need one copy

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.020
to see an effect. These two words are used so often in genetics. And the way

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.069
we use them is only in a relative

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.870
fashion comparing one allele to another. The cytosine

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.230
allele is recessive compared to the dominant thymine

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.180
allele or T is dominant to C here.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.430
An allele can not be dominant or recessive in isolation. We can only define it

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.460
in this fashion when we're comparing it to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.640
another allele. With this information we're actually ready

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.370
to look at how lactose intolerance can be

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.370
inherited. Let's look back at Kate's pedigree of

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.230
lactose intolerance and focus specifically on Kate and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.300
her brother. Using information about dominance and recessiveness.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.643
You should be able to determine what the

00:01:43.643 --> 00:01:47.335
possible allelic combinations or genotypes could be for Kate

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:50.830
and her brother. Here in each column, I want

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.990
you to select any and all boxes that you

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.820
think could possibly apply. Remember, look at the pedigree,

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.840
take in all the information you can, synthesize it

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.220
with what you know about traits. And alleles that

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.850
are dominant versus recessive and remember that a shaded

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.090
individual means they're affected by lactose intolerance and if they're

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.890
not shaded, they're not affected

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.780
by lactose intolerance. They're lactose tolerant.
