00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.240
I have three word problems here.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.890
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.310
is not solve the word problems
but just set up the equation

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.990
that we could solve to get the
answer to the word problems.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.865
And essentially, we're
going to be setting up

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:13.670
proportions in either case.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.350
So in this first problem, we
have 9 markers cost $11.50.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.140
And then they ask us, how
much would 7 markers cost?

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.820
And let's just set x to
be equal to our answer.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.310
So x is equal to the
cost of 7 markers.

00:00:31.476 --> 00:00:33.100
So the way to solve
a problem like this

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.050
is to set up two ratios and then
set them equal to each other.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.910
So you could say that the ratio
of 9 markers to the cost of 9

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.720
markers, so the ratio of
the number of markers, so 9,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.740
to the cost of the
9 markers, to 11.50,

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.580
this should be equal to
the ratio of our new number

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:04.849
of markers, 7, to whatever
the cost of the 7 markers are,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.850
to x.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.970
Let me do x in green.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.500
So this is a completely
valid proportion here.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.870
The ratio of 9 markers
to the cost of 9 markers

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.309
is equal to 7 markers to
the cost of 7 markers.

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:22.100
And then you could
solve this to figure out

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.967
how much those 7
markers would cost.

00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:26.550
And you could flip
both sides of this,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.780
and it would still be a
completely valid ratio.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.595
You could have 11.50 to 9.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:38.570
The ratio between the cost
of the markers to the number

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:47.830
of markers you're
buying, 11.50 to 9,

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.300
is equal to the ratio of the
cost of 7 markers to the number

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.100
of markers, which
is obviously 7.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.470
So all I would do is flip
both sides of this equation

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.220
right here to get
this one over here.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.820
You could also think about
the ratios in other ways.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:11.380
You could say that the ratio
of 9 markers to 7 markers

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.360
is going to be the same as
the ratio of their costs,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.080
is going to be equal to the
ratio of the cost of 9 markers

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.120
to the cost of 7 markers.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.000
And then, obviously, you could
flip both of these sides.

00:02:27.895 --> 00:02:30.580
Let me do that in the
same magenta color.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.880
The ratio of 7
markers to 9 markers

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.790
is the same thing as
the ratio of the cost

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.060
of 7 markers to the
cost of 9 markers.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.340
So that is 11.50.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.140
So all of these would be valid
proportions, valid equations

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.840
that describe what's
going on here.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.729
And then you would just have
to essentially solve for x.

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:52.270
So let's do this
one right over here.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.740
7 apples cost $5.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.620
How many apples can
I buy it with $8?

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.720
So one again, we're going to
assume that what they're asking

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.620
is how many apples--
let's call that x.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.950
x is what we want to solve for.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.980
So 7 apples costs $5.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.790
So we have the ratio between
the number of apples, 7,

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.470
and the cost of
the apples, 5, is

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.520
going to be equal to the
ratio between another number

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.380
of apples, which is now x, and
the cost of that other number

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.490
of apples.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.200
And it's going to be $8.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.310
And so notice here in this first
situation, what was unknown

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.300
was the cost.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.000
So we kind of had
the number of apples

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.220
to cost, the number
of apples to cost.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.825
Now in this example, the
unknown is the number of apples,

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.975
so number of apples to cost,
number of apples to cost.

00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:50.350
And we could do all of the
different scenarios like this.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.610
You could also say the
ratio between 7 apples

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.320
and x apples is
going to be the same

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.110
as the ratio between
the cost of 7 apples

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.870
and the cost of 8 apples.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.390
Obviously, you can
flip both sides

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.430
of these in either
of these equations

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.530
to get two more equations.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.056
And any of these would
be valid equations.

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:16.180
Now let's do this last one.

00:04:19.775 --> 00:04:21.320
I'll use new colors here.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.140
A cake recipe for 5
people requires 2 eggs.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.935
So we want to know how many
eggs-- so this we'll call x.

00:04:32.935 --> 00:04:34.560
And you don't always
have to call it x.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.650
You could call it e for eggs.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.608
Well, e isn't a good
idea, because e represents

00:04:37.608 --> 00:04:40.360
another number once you
get to higher mathematics.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.680
But you could call them y
or z or any variable-- a,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.900
b, or c, anything.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.650
How many eggs do we need
for a 15-person cake?

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.620
So you could say the ratio of
people to eggs is constant.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:06.740
So if we have 5 people for
2 eggs, then for 15 people,

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.530
we are going to need x eggs.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.730
This ratio is going
to be constant.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.880
5/2 is equal to 15/x.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.670
Or you could flip
both sides of this.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:21.320
Or you could say the
ratio between 5 and 15

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.580
is going to be equal to the
ratio between the number

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:33.420
of eggs for 5 people-- let me
do that in that blue color--

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.330
and the number of
eggs for 15 people.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.320
And obviously, you could flip
both sides of this equation.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.820
So all of these,
we've essentially

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.650
set up the proportions
that describe

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.460
each of these problems.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.170
And then you can
go later and solve

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.980
for x to actually
get the answer.
