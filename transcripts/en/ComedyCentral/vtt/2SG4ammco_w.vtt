00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.934
&gt;&gt; Opposers this can't wait.

00:00:01.967 --> 00:00:03.569
Everyone's talking
about this royal wedding

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:05.538
between Prince Harry
and Meghan Markle.

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:06.739
But not me.

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:08.574
I don't need to look across
the pond for entertainment.

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:11.511
Believe me I've tried.
The pond is just an entire

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.179
fucking ocean.
Misleading.

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:14.714
We don't need Prince Harry.

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:18.451
No we have our old favorite
royal son. Jared Kushner

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:21.120
and he's way better than
Harry in every single way.

00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:22.688
I mean listen to Harry speak.

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:25.358
&gt;&gt; I Managed to persuade him
to come and join me.

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:28.594
&gt;&gt; We camped out with each
under the stars

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:29.896
Ugh. Nails on a chalkboard
right.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.330
Jared on the other hand.

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:33.766
My name is Jared Kushner.

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:36.569
Pure butter.
And what does Harry even do.

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:37.870
Oh that's right. Nothing.

00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:41.941
Jared meanwhile is in charge
of peace in the Middle East.

00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:43.009
And last I checked.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.111
Mission accomplished.
Harry lives at the castle.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:47.780
Meanwhile Jared has
a skyscraper in Manhattan

00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:49.516
that no one will buy.
You do the math.

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.718
And as for Meghan Markle
what she famous for the TV

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.787
show suits the USA Network.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.292
Ah well our princess Ivanka
makes suits by the China network

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.327
and they hold up
pretty well the first three

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.496
or four times
you wear them. Case closed.

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:05.832
So yeah enjoy the royal wedding.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.634
I'll be hate tweeting
about her dress.

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.403
Jesus.
Stunning.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:13.807
&gt;&gt; How is it both modern and
traditional at the same time.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:16.576
America first.
