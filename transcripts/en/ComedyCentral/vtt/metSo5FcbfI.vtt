00:00:02.368 --> 00:00:04.871
- Now they're all booing.

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:06.272
Now it's unanimous.

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:09.108
It's the loudest thing
I'd ever heard.

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:10.676
It was...

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:15.682
"Boo!
Boo!"

of all time--

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.892
I'm super stoked
he's on the show--

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:01.795
please give it up for
Mr. Brian Regan, everybody.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.429

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:11.738
- Years ago I was a campaign
manager for a dog.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.406
[laughter]

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:16.776
I'm not lying.
I was a campaign manager

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:18.478
for a dog.
I'm not making this up.

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:19.779
You guys know...

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:22.515
remember Bud Light
had Spuds MacKenzie?

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.283
crowd: Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:29.188
Well, I wasn't qualified
to be his campaign manager,

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:32.325
but I was the campaign manager
for Alex the Dog

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:36.529
from the Stroh's beer
commercials.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.865
Now, Stroh's beer used to be

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:42.268
one of the most popular beers
in the country.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:45.205
And then I got involved.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.942
The Stroh's ads,
they would have--

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:53.212
Alex would go get beers
for his owner,

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:54.847
and everybody loved the ad,
so they thought,

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:56.382
"Let's capitalize on this.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:59.786
Let's have him run for
president of the United States."

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.054
So...yeah.

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:05.057
So Alex can't talk
'cause he's a dog,

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:09.195
so they thought, "Let's get,
like, a funny campaign manager,"

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.731
and that's where
I failed miserably.

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.566
[laughter]

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.968
And what they would do is,
they wanted us to go around

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:19.038
to different cities,
and we had to do, like,

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:22.041
six, seven, eight events a day
with this dog,

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.810
and I had to do
this campaign speech

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.746
to get this dog elected.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:28.680
I'm not exaggerating
when I say that

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.883
every single one of these events

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:33.585
was worse than any hell gig

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:37.490
I've ever done before or since.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.692
And I had like, eight a day.

00:02:40.692 --> 00:02:42.561
We would have do radio stations.

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:46.399
We wouldn't bring Alex,
'cause he's a dog...

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.934
[laughter]

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.269
And can't talk.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.605
And we'd show up and they'd go,
"Where's Alex?"

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.674
And I'm like, "Well,
I don't know if they told you,

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:57.510
"but Alex is a dog.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.413
He ain't got no vocal cords
or nothing."

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:02.381
I don't know if that's true,
but...

00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:04.717
[laughter]

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:06.418
He can't talk.
And then--

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:08.954
I said, "I'm Brian.
I'm his campaign manager.

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:10.223
I'm gonna do all the talking."

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:11.624
They go, "Oh!"

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:13.959
I'm like, "Damn."

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.397
We go into the studio,
and they would have a microphone

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:19.799
on the floor,

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.635
with a bowl of water,

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.136
and they would say,
"We were hoping

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:26.139
we'd get him to bark
into the microphone."

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.309
And I'm like, I gotta get
a manager or something

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:35.315
'cause I'm getting upstaged
by a dog that ain't here.

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:39.952
We would have to go malls,
supermarkets, and I had to,

00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:43.823
like, try to get the dog
elected, and...

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:45.424
[laughs]

00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:47.427
I would say,
"Man, he's a great dog.

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:49.162
"You really--
look at him, man.

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:50.162
"You should vote for him.

00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:53.333
He's got great ideas."

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:57.403
And the handler for the dog
would sometimes just say,

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:58.737
"Alex needs a break,"

00:03:58.737 --> 00:04:00.673
and he'd just tug on his leash

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:02.908
and he'd just leave

00:04:02.908 --> 00:04:05.578
for like,
20 minutes to a half an hour.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:09.948
I needed a guy with a leash

00:04:09.948 --> 00:04:13.119
tugging on me,
"Brian needs a break."

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:14.954
I was getting no breaks.

00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:16.622
So I would tell
the Stroh's people,

00:04:16.622 --> 00:04:18.624
"What do you want me to do
while Alex is gone?"

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:21.994
And they would say, "Well, just
do the campaign speech anyway."

00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:24.363
And I'm like,
"There's no dog here."

00:04:24.363 --> 00:04:25.665
[laughter]

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.299
They say, "Do it anyway."

00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:29.702
So as people are walking by,
I'd go,

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:33.305
"Man, he's a fantastic dog.

00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:37.043
You really got to hear
his ideas."

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:38.310
People are looking, going,

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.646
"What--what is this guy
talking about?

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:42.048
"There's no dog.

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:44.716
Somebody should get
a straightjacket for this guy."

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:46.019
It was horrible.
Every--

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:47.387
I was having nightmares
at night.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:48.888
I was literally
having nightmares.

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:50.222
I would wake up
in the middle of the night

00:04:50.222 --> 00:04:51.857
go, "Aah! Aah!
Oh...oh."

00:04:51.857 --> 00:04:53.859
And then I didn't know
whether it was better to go

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:55.895
back to sleep or to stay awake,

00:04:55.895 --> 00:05:00.399
because both of them were
hell on Earth.

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:01.734
It ended up--
we were in Minneapolis.

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:03.169
This is true.

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.237
I get in the car in the morning
and they said,

00:05:05.237 --> 00:05:06.839
"All right, here's the deal,
Brian.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:09.809
"You're gonna bomb
in the morning on the radio,

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:12.078
"and then you're gonna bomb
at the supermarket,

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:14.080
"then you're gonna bomb
on local TV,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.415
"then you're gonna bomb
at a pub,

00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:20.419
"and then tonight we're going
to an NHL hockey game.

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.587
"It's between
the Minnesota North Stars

00:05:22.587 --> 00:05:24.056
against the Chicago Blackhawks."

00:05:24.056 --> 00:05:26.158
And I said, "Great.
So when we're done,

00:05:26.158 --> 00:05:28.194
we get to, like,
enjoy a hockey game?"

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:30.763
And he said,
"We're not gonna be done.

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:36.335
"You're gonna go on center ice
between second and third period,

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:40.106
"and you're gonna
do the campaign speech

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:41.574
to get this dog elected."

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:43.275
Now, at this point,
we were in the car

00:05:43.275 --> 00:05:44.777
going about 60 miles an hour.

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:49.448
If I'd been smart,
I would have opened the door

00:05:49.448 --> 00:05:55.188
and just taken my chances
with the roadside gravel.

00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:00.693
We get to the hockey arena
that night.

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:03.396
My heart is pounding.
I'm from Miami, Florida.

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:04.964
I've never been
to a hockey match.

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:06.732
I'd never seen ice.

00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:08.868
[laughter]

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.236
I don't want to do this.

00:06:10.236 --> 00:06:11.804
I don't want anything to do
with this.

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:16.042
During second period,
there's a fight, an NHL fight.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:19.212
Gloves off, blood,
teeth all over the place,

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.246
and I'm thinking,
"Wow, this is cool.

00:06:21.246 --> 00:06:23.315
I've never seen a hockey fight."

00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:25.284
And then I went,
"Wait.

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:28.621
I have to follow
a hockey fight."

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:31.157
[laughter]

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:32.992
Buzzer ended.

00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:34.994
Stroh's people came up and said,
"We're gonna do something

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:36.829
"a little different, Brian.

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:40.833
"What we're gonna do is we're
gonna put Alex on the Zamboni,

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:42.668
"and we're gonna
drive him around

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:47.439
and just let him circle around
the arena on the Zamboni."

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:50.676
I said, "Fantastic.
So you don't need me."

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:52.077
They said,
"Oh, no.

00:06:52.077 --> 00:06:54.913
"You're still going out
there to center ice

00:06:54.913 --> 00:06:56.281
"to do the campaign speech,

00:06:56.281 --> 00:06:59.018
but we thought
it would be nice if Alex"...

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:00.352
[laughter]

00:07:00.352 --> 00:07:04.690
"Is circling you
on the Zamboni."

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:08.327
I'm like, "Can't you think of
any more obstacles?

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:10.162
"Why don't we get an NHL guy

00:07:10.162 --> 00:07:14.199
to fire some slapshots at me?"

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:16.602
So they get on the voice of God.

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:19.271
"Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:24.143
from the Stroh's beer
commercials, Alex the Dog."

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:25.945
And the Zamboni comes out.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:28.114
Alex is, like, confused.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:29.514
[laughter]

00:07:29.514 --> 00:07:31.483
He's sitting next to the driver.

00:07:31.483 --> 00:07:33.518
The crowd is going berserk.

00:07:33.518 --> 00:07:35.721
They just saw a hockey fight.

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:38.657
Now they're seeing a dog
on a Zamboni.

00:07:38.657 --> 00:07:39.525
[laughter]

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:42.728
They're plenty entertained.

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:46.499
They don't need to see
what is about to happen.

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:48.234
[laughter]

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:54.173
"And now please welcome
the campaign manager:

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:55.842
Brian Regan."

00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:58.710
They don't explain
that I'm his campaign manager.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.379
They don't say
he's running for president.

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:03.749
There's no context whatsoever.

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:07.587
Just, "Please welcome
the campaign manager:

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:08.988
Brian Regan."

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.589
So I walk out.

00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:13.359
I'd never been on ice,
so I don't want to go fast.

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:18.030
I'm just walking slow
to 12,000 people going,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.601
"Who the hell is this guy?"

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:25.071
I slowly walk out to center ice
and I'm thinking,

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:28.573
who--who am I?

00:08:28.573 --> 00:08:30.443
Wh--why am I--
and I'm looking around,

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:33.746
I'm seeing just Alex going by
on the Zamboni.

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:36.181
And I keep turning
the opposite direction

00:08:36.181 --> 00:08:38.951
and I just keep seeing him.

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:42.088
And I'm like,
"What happened to me and my life

00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:44.022
"that I'm here now?

00:08:44.022 --> 00:08:49.962
What choices have I made
to be here now?"

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:53.632
12,000 completely confused
people.

00:08:53.632 --> 00:08:56.969
I'm not smart enough to reset
and go, "Hey, he didn't tell you

00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:59.304
Alex is running for pre"--
I don't say nothing.

00:08:59.304 --> 00:09:02.775
I just go, "Hey, how about
that election, huh?"

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:04.977
[laughter]

00:09:04.977 --> 00:09:07.946
12,000,
"Huh?

00:09:07.946 --> 00:09:10.549
What's this guy talking about?"

00:09:10.549 --> 00:09:12.317
And I said, "You know,
a lot of people think

00:09:12.317 --> 00:09:15.721
this election
is going to the dogs."

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.824
[laughter]

00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:23.162
"We might as well vote for
somebody who's qualified."

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:25.164
People start booing.

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:28.667
I start hearing this low,
"Boo.

00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:29.901
Boo."

00:09:29.901 --> 00:09:31.803
And I'm like,
"What the hell is going on?"

00:09:31.803 --> 00:09:34.506
And I just keep turning around,
and everywhere I look

00:09:34.506 --> 00:09:36.508
I just see round lips.

00:09:36.508 --> 00:09:38.510
"Boo.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.678
Boo."

00:09:39.678 --> 00:09:41.313
I see Alex going by,

00:09:41.313 --> 00:09:43.248
"What the heck's going on?"

00:09:43.248 --> 00:09:44.950
"Boo."

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.987
So I figure, "Well, maybe I'll
get them with the next joke.

00:09:48.987 --> 00:09:51.691
"Bush and Dukakis.

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:54.693
"Dukakis, that sounds like
something Alex might do

00:09:54.693 --> 00:09:56.028
in a bush."

00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:58.197
[laughter]

00:09:58.197 --> 00:09:59.865
Now they're all booing.

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:01.100
[laughter]

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.501
Now it's unanimous.

00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:05.270
It's the loudest thing
I'd ever heard.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.973
It was louder
than any jet engine.

00:10:07.973 --> 00:10:09.708
It was...

00:10:09.708 --> 00:10:12.511
"Boo!

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:14.880
Boo!"

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.316
And I--and I just--I thought,
"Well, it's not smart

00:10:18.316 --> 00:10:20.819
"to face the boos.
I'll turn around,"

00:10:20.819 --> 00:10:23.322
like over here it's gonna be
people throwing roses.

00:10:23.322 --> 00:10:24.790
[laughter]

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.791
Over here, "Boo!"

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:27.893
Everywhere, round lips.

00:10:27.893 --> 00:10:29.495
Kids, "Boo!"

00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:32.030
Little old ladies, "Boo!"

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.166
The Zamboni driver was booing.

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.233
[laughter]

00:10:35.233 --> 00:10:38.037
Alex was booing.
"Boo!"

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:41.340
So I'm thinking, "This ain't
doing nobody no good."

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.878
I said, "Well...
you guys have been great!"

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:49.548
[laughter]

00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:51.049
"I'm gonna get out of here.

00:10:51.049 --> 00:10:53.152
"I just wanted to come out
and have a good time

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:55.988
with you, so good day!"

00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:58.056
"Boo!"

00:10:58.056 --> 00:10:59.992
With all the circling,
I couldn't remember

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:04.763
what direction I had come from,
so I'm just walking going,

00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:06.999
"I don't think
this is the right way."

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:08.100
[laughter]

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.602
"Boo!"

00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:13.205
And I see this guy
with a security vest going...

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:15.707
So I have to turn.

00:11:15.707 --> 00:11:17.743
"Boo!

00:11:17.743 --> 00:11:19.878
Boo!"

00:11:19.878 --> 00:11:23.582
And from the fight there were
blood and teeth all over.

00:11:23.582 --> 00:11:25.584
I had to move--
I didn't want to go fast,

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:28.087
'cause I didn't want this
to be the end.

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:30.923
And I look at the exit
and it's this little square

00:11:30.923 --> 00:11:34.126
rectangle and it looks like
it's a million miles away,

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:37.897
and the closer I get,
the smaller the rectangle gets.

00:11:37.897 --> 00:11:40.966
It's, like,
mathematically impossible.

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:44.369
So I realized with the boos,
I didn't even need to walk.

00:11:44.369 --> 00:11:45.471
"Boo!"

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:46.939
All I had to do was stop,

00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:49.374
and the force of the boos

00:11:49.374 --> 00:11:53.045
was push--it was like
a boo sailboat.

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:54.279
I just put my arms out.

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:55.881
"Boo!"

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:59.218
And it literally pushed me
through the little hole,

00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:02.454
and the next day,
Stroh's filed for bankruptcy.

00:12:02.454 --> 00:12:04.490
[laughter]

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.626
You guys are great, man.
Thank you.
