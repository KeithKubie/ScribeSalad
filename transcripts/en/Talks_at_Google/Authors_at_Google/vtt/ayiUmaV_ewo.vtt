&gt;&gt;Male commentator: Hi everyone, and welcome
to another Google Authors event at the San

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.430
Francisco office. Today we're very pleased
to welcome Anand Giridharadas who writes for

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.889
the Currents column for The New York Times
and also the International Herald Tribune.

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.750
Currents explores fresh ideas, global culture,
and social meaning of technology among other

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.750
subjects.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.689
In 2009, he completed a four and a half year
tour reporting from India for the Times and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.640
Herald Tribune as their first Bombay presence
in the modern era. He reported on Indian's

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.610
transformation, Bollywood, corporate takeovers,
terrorism, outsourcing, poverty, and democracy.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.470
Is that, is that all? Did I get every --

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.470
[laughter]

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.560
He was appointed a columnist in 2008 Writing
a Letter From India series, as well.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.710
Today he is here to talk about his first book,
India Calling, An Intimate Portrait of a Nation's

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.040
Remaking, a work of narrative non-fiction
about his return to the India that his parents

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.040
left.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.290
Please welcome to Google, Anand.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.340
[applause]

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.550
[microphone static in background]

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.630
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: Thank you, Nick and
thanks to all of you for-for being here. I

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.060
know competing with Google's food is a very
tough thing to do, so I'm gonna try to compete

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.719
with what I know is the secret competitive
advantage of this company.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:18.719
[laughter]

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:24.780
And I know that because my sister used to
work here and some of you worked with her

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.960
and so even though she's not here a special
via YouTube thank to her --

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.960
[laughter]

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.649
for making this happen.

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:41.149
I wanna really keep about half of our time
together for a discussion so what I'm gonna

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.009
do is explain a little bit about how I got
to write this book and what it is and then

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.890
read to you a bit from it. And then we'll
talk.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.749
[pause]

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:09.209
The origin of my book on India was my encounter
with India through biography. And I grew up

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.750
in this country in Cleveland, Ohio first and
then Europe and then Washington D.C., as the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.520
child of Indian emigrates.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:28.390
And grew up always with this sense that India
was a place that had pushed my parents away

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.170
and that in my own way as a child I wanted
to continue pushing away. And that is of course

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.080
common to many immigrant families.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:49.040
But when I was growing up this sense of India
as this kind of remote, stifling, stifled

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.880
place was very vivid for me and it came first
in my parents' stories, many of which were

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.790
all about essentially why they left. Stories
that rationalized why they left; stories that

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.220
kind of sought to make sense of that for themselves
and in the process give my sister and I a

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.930
picture of what this country was.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:18.160
That picture was compounded by all of the
kind of press coverage and the zeitgeist of

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.880
what India was for the world in those days
which was a basket case, this third world

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.810
country or all those labels; some of which
were unfair some of which were fair, but all

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.500
of which again contributed to this sense of
a country better kept where it was in the

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.170
mind of a young first-generation child.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:45.010
And then we would actually go to India every
two years or so. And on those visits this

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.560
kind of vague sense that I had of wanting
to keep this place at bay was deepened by

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:58.040
the reality of that contact. And I suppose
it was partly growing up in this country which

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.320
more than any other country gives people the
feeling of head room and of being able to

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.850
become whatever they wanna be and fulfill
their potential and fulfill their dreams,

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.430
that India felt so profoundly different from
that in those days.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.919
It felt above all, a place where people had
so much potential within [microphone static

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.150
in background] them they had the resources
of a great civilization behind them and, is

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.009
that mine? No.

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:37.800
And at the same time there was this feeling
of, I'm sorry let me just

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.129
[laughter]

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:46.539
There was this feeling of so much intelligence
and possibility locked up in people. Women

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:53.729
who had a lot to say but didn't say it if
there were people who weren't women around.

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.849
Children who had brilliant ideas in their
head and heads full of kind of notes, but

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:08.431
who didn't feel as comfortable speaking in
the presence of adults. The poverty,the child

00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:13.430
beggars who I saw who looked eerily like me,
and I wasn't used to seeing children who looked

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.740
like me in this country. And all of those
things fed a certain picture of India that

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.310
had estranged me from it over those years.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:31.000
And I tell you that background because when
I was graduating from college in 2003, for

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.300
a set of reasons I wanted to be a writer and
I thought maybe I should just go somewhere

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.319
interesting in the world and kind of become
a writer through collision with the unfamiliar.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:47.810
I chose India as the site of the unfamiliar
and I chose to just to go, not because I had

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.870
changed my mind or because I love it at that
point, but because the idea of shocking myself

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.270
a little bit seemed to me the way you actually
become a writer. And I had no idea how to

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.400
become a writer so it was just a kind of a
guess.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.340
And I went and I was shocked, but I was shocked
by something that I didn't expect to be shocked

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:16.009
by. I was shocked by the many ways in which
the picture that I had of India, the picture

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.809
that I had maintained growing up, was now
outdated. And I was shocked by the fact that

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:27.479
India was very palpably on the way to becoming
another kind of country.

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:34.020
And the very thing that had most estranged
me from it, the sense that kind of the purpose

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:41.370
of life is to accept and be content and this
kind of serene acceptance of life as it merely

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:48.129
is, was giving way to a very different national
spirit.

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:51.889
It didn't mean everybody was rich overnight,
it didn't mean poverty had been eliminated,

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:56.319
it didn't mean all these material things had
changed, but the spirit of the country had

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:05.819
clearly rotated and become a spirit of grabbing
life by the horns, changing your destiny,

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:12.160
reinventing yourself. And a new and growing
generation of young Indians no longer had

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:18.939
to leave to reinvent themselves as fully and
abundantly as they did when they became immigrants

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:22.150
and pursued that kind of reinvention.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.199
So what I've set out to do in the book is
to tell the story in my own very personal

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:32.830
way of how that India became this India. What
was that India that my parents left? What

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.130
was Indianness within it? What did it mean
to be Indian in that world? And then how did

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.430
that change?

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.830
And I've tried to do so no through a lot of
the structural kind of economic things a lot

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.469
of people talk about when they talk about
India and China, this kind of GDP and growing

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:51.550
economy and urbanization, all these kind of
big forces.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:08:01.300
These are important things, but my sense of
what most was changing in India was human

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:06.150
things: people's conception of the purpose
of life, of the purpose of their relations

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:11.659
with other people, of their embeddedness in
the community. These very core elemental things,

00:08:11.659 --> 00:08:18.080
the things that novels tend to explore rather
than non-fiction books. Those were the things

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.309
that were most changing in my reportage.

00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:30.009
And so the chapters of the book explore different
states of minds. The chapters are Dreams,

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:37.740
Ambition, Pride, Anger, Love, Freedom, and
then an epilogue called Midnight.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:43.800
And each of them seeks to explore. In Ambition,
for example, you have a country with huge,

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:50.899
extraordinary underclass. India has many more
poor people than sub-Saharan Africa today,

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:55.829
for example, something that most people don't
talk about.

00:08:55.829 --> 00:09:00.950
But even among that underclass it is very
clear if you spend time with people on the

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:06.420
farms, for example, that people are now rejecting
the idea that that's all that they can be.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.320
And you find a lot of farmers' children who
suddenly say, "I refuse to be a farmer." Now

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.540
they don't necessarily know what step two
is, but they've broken a chain in their minds

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:21.500
of saying, "This is what my grandfather was,
this is what I am, this is what I have to

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.500
be."

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.500
[pause]

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:29.709
You also then see in the Pride chapter that
it's not just this kind of economic rise and

00:09:29.709 --> 00:09:34.820
these people rising up financially, there's
a growing cultural confidence in India, a

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.240
growing pride in being Indian that comes with
growth.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:46.490
And a previous generation of elites was very
much like the British who left India in 1947,

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:52.860
dressed in the same ways, spoke in the same
ways, have British accents, love to have high

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.820
tea.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:02.680
And one of the major shifts underway in India
is the replacement of that class of elites

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:09.060
or at least the expansion of the world of
elites to include many people who are not

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:17.750
British seeming, who dress and think and talk
and reason and read books that are of Indian

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.110
origin and that are much more deeply rooted
in the soil.

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:28.990
And then there are changes in the very private
world of family. One of the things that I

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:34.370
talk about in the book is how love is changing
in India and there's a real kind of Romeo

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.779
and Juliet revolution that's going on.

00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:41.360
Now the reason I say Romeo and Juliet is when
Shakespeare wrote that play the reason it

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:47.430
was quite a hit was that it was a subversive
idea at that time. At that time even in the

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:53.560
West the reason you married was for family
pragmatics, and marriage was a kind of M &amp; A

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.480
activity and you kind of two families came
together and their property interests were

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.630
aligned and it made sense and everybody was
kind of on board.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:07.060
And what Shakespeare chronicled was the rise
of this other idea which is that love actually

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.110
matters more. If two people love each other
then you make everything else work around

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.680
that, and that was a shift in Western society.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.990
And India is going through that shift today
where this idea of love mattering more than

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:23.480
all those other considerations is kind of
pushing its way in. And so I talk in the book

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.170
about a young woman who's wrestling with that
pushing in.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:34.319
And I spend time in a divorce court in India,
I spend a week in a divorce court seeing how

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:41.240
in a way this new idea of love is also bringing
with it a certain fragility to these marriages,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:46.080
because these new marriages are much more
loving but they gamble everything on the presence,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.780
continued presence of that love. They're not
held together by family ties and economics

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:55.340
and everything else. They're just held together
by love and they break much more easily than

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.579
the old kind of marriage.

00:11:57.579 --> 00:12:07.980
And final example, chapter on Freedom is about
what is happening to family in this modernization

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.820
journey. And we often think about, if you
asked many Indians what's changed between

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:18.250
then and now, they will share this narrative
of India being a kind of more restrained,

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:23.230
stifled place and now a place where people
can flower and fulfill their potential more.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:31.699
But people generally in India tend to blame
things like the old economy, socialism, poverty,

00:12:31.699 --> 00:12:36.759
and all of those things are true. One thing
that you don't hear said in India but that

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:46.370
I'm very clear from my work made a difference,
was that family which is something that Indians

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:52.680
celebrate about themselves was as much a source
of the limitation on human potential. It did

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:59.970
many good things and it also did many bad
things. And family was, I certainly know more

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:08.000
people whose potential was curtailed by family
than was curtailed by socialist economic policies.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.360
People who start with the half of the population
that is women, but you can go far beyond women.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:21.209
There's a style of raising children traditionally
in India that did not say, "Who are you? What's

00:13:21.209 --> 00:13:25.310
your inner potentiality, go find it," that
instead said, "Sit here, don't sit there.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:30.579
Drink that, don't drink this. Study this,
don't study that." And that slowly caused

00:13:30.579 --> 00:13:32.959
a lot of people to wither.

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:39.100
And now, a new idea of family is coming to
India and a new style of raising children

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:44.139
that allows that flowering and that creates
a whole new series of problems.

00:13:44.139 --> 00:13:50.839
So those are the kinds of changes I sought
to chronicle, and now I'd like to read to

00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:54.319
you from two different passages of the book.

00:13:54.319 --> 00:14:03.610
The first is from the very beginning and kind
of captures where I was when I first arrived

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:08.370
in this bewildering new country, trying to
figure it out. And before I kind of had seen

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:15.610
all this change, the first thing I saw was
linguistic confusion.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.389
You arrive and everybody seems to be speaking
English, but then you realize Indian English

00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:24.319
is like a whole different language all its
own.

00:14:24.319 --> 00:14:31.250
For example, I was working at a consulting
firm at the time and kept using this phrase

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:37.290
S and M. And it took me a very long time to
realize that this was sales and marketing

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.470
which is considerably more benign than what
I imagined.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:40.660
[laughter]

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:48.019
So I'll read to you from this passage about
linguistic confusion.

00:14:48.019 --> 00:14:53.320
"The most mystical new concept though was
native place, which I eventually discovered

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:58.290
was the village where my ancestors had most
recently milked cows, even if recent meant

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.319
the year 1500.

00:14:59.319 --> 00:15:04.500
'Ver are you from?' a typical conversation
would begin.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.600
'Washington D.C.'

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.529
'Yes, yes, that is okay, but ver are you from?'

00:15:10.529 --> 00:15:12.519
[laughter]

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:13.600
'America.'

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.769
'No, no that is very good. In fact my brother
is in New Jersey, Trenton. I've been to USA,

00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:26.459
New York and California also, twice. But what
I mean to say is what is your native place?'

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:29.459
'I was born in Cleveland, Ohio in the Midwest.'

00:15:29.459 --> 00:15:34.379
'No, no your native place. Basically you are
an Indian only you know.'

00:15:34.379 --> 00:15:36.740
'Yes, yes of course.'

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.069
'So what is your native place? That only is
what I'm asking.'

00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:43.339
'My parents grew up in Bombay.'

00:15:43.339 --> 00:15:49.100
'So basically you are a Maharashtrian, but
your name Giridharadas?'

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.779
'Actually I'm half Tamil and half Punjabi.'

00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:56.449
'Tamil and Punjabi!' my interlocutor would
exclaim eyes bulging at the thought of such

00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:58.190
brazen regional miscegenation.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.190
[laughter]

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.240
'But how could that be?'

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.749
'They met in Bombay.'

00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:05.920
'So basically, basically you are a Punjabi
correct?'

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.170
[laughter]

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.430
'Well.'

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.329
'Basically your father is a Punjabi?'

00:16:10.329 --> 00:16:12.230
'No my mother is Punjabi.'

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:16.860
'Okay, I see, I see. So your father is a South
Indian?'

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.069
'Exactly.'

00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:22.040
'Okay, okay, okay.'

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.110
Pause. Relief. The pigeon had been pigeonholed.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.949
'So basically speaking you are a South Indian?'

00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:30.139
'Sure, whatever you want.'"

00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:31.990
[laughter]

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.839
[pause]

00:16:33.839 --> 00:16:43.949
So that was the initial encounter with India,
and six years later I, as I finished this

00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:51.470
book, tried to reflect on what I'd taken away
after getting over that initial confusion,

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:57.319
and tried to think about what all of this
emotion and energy and dynamism in the new

00:16:57.319 --> 00:16:58.889
India what it meant.

00:16:58.889 --> 00:17:01.670
And here's part of that conclusion:

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:06.449
[pause]

00:17:06.449 --> 00:17:12.679
"Our parents' generation still participated
in India from afar. They sent money, advised

00:17:12.679 --> 00:17:17.910
charities, guided hedge fund dollars into
the Bombay stock exchange, attended emigrate

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:24.230
conferences. But many were too implicated
in India to return. To reverse their journey

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:29.260
threatened somehow to invalidate the years
spent away.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:34.700
Our generation, bearing less of the past's
baggage, was freer to embrace the India now

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:41.010
coming. I had grown up defining myself by
the soil under my feet, not by the blood in

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:47.820
my veins. The soil I shared with everyone
else. The blood made me unbearably different.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:53.720
Before I loved India, I loathed it. But the
more India called to me the more that feeling

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.530
began to seem like a relic from a buried past.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:04.740
And India now called not only to us, its far
scattered seeds, its sharpest call was to

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:11.799
its own; to those who had remained and may
once have felt outsmarted by those who left.

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:16.919
It summoned them now to seize hold of their
destinies and so they were becoming the unlikely

00:18:16.919 --> 00:18:23.669
long lost cousins of my parents in America;
restless, ambitious, with dreams vivid only

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:26.260
to themselves.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:31.140
In leaving India my parents had beaten the
odds in a bad system. What had changed since

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:37.230
they left was a systemic lifting of the odds
for those who stayed. From languorous villages

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:43.900
to pulsating cities, Indians were making difficult
new choices, rising to the occasion of history,

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:48.870
coming into their own in a thousand ways.
And it was addictive this improbable rush

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:53.270
of hope, these many answers of the call.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:59.460
I will never be able to relay the fullness
of what it was to live in India in that dawn.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:06.320
The world turned slowly. Nations, heroes,
visions of regeneration come and go. To history

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:12.309
we are ever chained and the new is seldom
as new as it seems. But there are moments

00:19:12.309 --> 00:19:19.150
sprinkled stingily among the centuries when
fate breaks, when souls open, when the shoreline

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:23.340
of the past falls irretrievably into the distance.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:29.270
Nehru spoke eloquently in that midnight in
1947, at the instant when the soul of a nation

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:35.549
long suppressed finds utterance. But it took
two more generations to bring utterance not

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:42.100
just to that collective soul, but also to
the millions of souls within, one by one by

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.049
one.

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:50.400
That idea first came to me in the dusty lanes
of Umred. It came in meeting Ravindra and

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:56.900
in hearing in his voice not just ambition,
not just hope, but also a sublime kind of

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:03.740
freedom; a freedom from the definitions of
the past, of his tribe, of rank; a freedom

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:09.640
to make himself new. And I wondered how he
judged the freedom that he had found in relation

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:14.179
to the freedom that Gandhi and Nehru had won
in 1947.

00:20:14.179 --> 00:20:19.190
For the world and for many well born Indians
those men were paramount heroes. They had

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:26.400
given India a voice; they'd ushered an improbable
country vast, fractured, argumentative into

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.840
being.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:33.299
But further away from the leading cities that
independence seemed to matter less. In places

00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:37.870
such as Umred the British had been a faint
presence. The Indians, once they took over,

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:45.210
improved little. The landlords, the humiliations,
the smallness of life, it all lived on.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:51.390
What was coming to India now was a sense of
awakening much as it had in 1947. But this

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:56.890
time if felt less theoretical. This time if
felt like another kind of independence; an

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.870
independence of the soul, not just of the
nation.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:06.450
'If these kinds of things are happening and
continue to happen in the future India will

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:13.241
become a real independent country,' Ravindra
said when I put the idea to him one day. 'Today

00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:18.570
we are independent, no problem. We do not
have anybody's kingdom over us, but still

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:24.650
we are not that much free. We are not living
a completely free life today. We need financial

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:29.520
freedom which we do not have now. So when
young people come ahead the new generation

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.530
will come ahead and they will start to live
in the way we're talking about. India will

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:38.440
really become independent and we will really
become a superpower. We will not depend on

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:44.640
anybody else. We will live the life of our
own dreams.'

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:50.580
To live the life of one's own dreams, this
then was a second independence for Ravindra,

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.159
the coming of a new midnight.

00:21:53.159 --> 00:21:57.820
That first midnight had expelled an empire,
had resolved the political question of whether

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:03.170
Indians could govern themselves, had shown
the world in the person of Gandhi a specially

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.940
Indian way of melting oppression.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:11.049
And yet so much of the Indian stasis, so much
of what challenged the life that Ravindra

00:22:11.049 --> 00:22:16.159
sought was not of British provenance and would
not just leave when the colonizers sailed

00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:23.490
away. The family relations of guilt, the never
questioned rituals, the intricate taxonomy

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:30.140
castes and sub-sub-castes, the rural cruelty,
the poverty, these facts would require their

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:37.330
own thousand Gandhis; a diffuse army of activists
and entrepreneurs and philosophers and farmers

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:43.100
toiling across the land, cutting these other
fetters, stretching the Indian idea of the

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:49.480
possible, making if more than lyrical to speak
of a life of one's dreams.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.730
That first midnight had anchored Indians in
place, they had lived for so long with smaller

00:22:54.730 --> 00:23:02.120
allegiances to the tribe, the caste, the faith.
Gandhi returned from South Africa and Nehru

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:08.440
returned from Britain, saw a wholeness in
India that many Indians did not see for themselves

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:13.190
and through the force of their actions they
made that wholeness a reality.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:18.740
This second midnight was, by contrast, about
the dissolution of place; about returning

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:25.399
to another kind of fragmentation. It was a
revolution of quiet refusals to no one's place,

00:23:25.399 --> 00:23:31.809
geographic place, place in time, place in
the tribe. It celebrated the lightness of

00:23:31.809 --> 00:23:39.419
being without roots, the possibility of reinvention,
the dignity of anonymity. It brought a kind

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:46.649
of independence that 1947 had not brought;
that of not depending on others for the discovery

00:23:46.649 --> 00:23:49.120
of what you might become."

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.120
Thank you.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:55.080
[applause]

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.290
Now I'm happy to take any questions and have
a discussion.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:57.290
[pause]

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:04.390
&gt;&gt;Nick: If everyone who asks a question if
you could just come up so we can capture it

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.029
for YouTube.

00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:08.360
[pause]

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:12.330
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hello.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:16.309
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: Hi.

00:24:16.309 --> 00:24:23.950
&gt;&gt;female #1: I wanted to get a better understanding
of what the state of arranged marriages is

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:28.279
in India. It's always been very fascinating
to me. I do have some friends in the Hyderabad

00:24:28.279 --> 00:24:32.840
Google Office and they have their own perspectives
and I know things have changed, but I'm not

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.350
sure how it is in other areas outside of Hyderabad.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:43.730
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: In some ways it's a
very good metaphor for tradition in India

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:49.059
more generally. What is happening to arranged
marriage is happening to the whole kind of

00:24:49.059 --> 00:24:53.710
landscape of the old traditional world, which
is there's not one clear picture.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:59.179
So there are places where a simple narrative
of everyone used to have arranged marriages

00:24:59.179 --> 00:25:03.260
now nobody does, where that it true. There's
certain spaces, certain levels of society,

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:08.960
certain geographic areas where you'd see a
very clear shift away from arranged marriage.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:14.080
There are other places where there's almost
no dent in the number of proportion people

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:20.480
who have arranged marriages, where tradition
very much is still with us. And then there's

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.679
a lot of spaces in between.

00:25:22.679 --> 00:25:26.909
And I think if you think about the new India,
the kinds of people who would actually work

00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:32.899
at Google Hyderabad, where I've actually been,
so I have a sense of who that demographic

00:25:32.899 --> 00:25:37.300
is. That demographic is in a way the most
interesting because they are neither this

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:41.330
extreme of like they've all rejected tradition
and are totally all having love marriages,

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.880
nor are they totally traditional for obvious
reasons.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.769
And they're on this in between kind of liminal
space where there's a lot of negotiation going

00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:54.713
on. And what I've found is a lot of those
people who are kind of in that in between

00:25:54.713 --> 00:26:02.500
zone, are very comfortable with multiple modes
of thinking about modernity and their own

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.500
identity.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:09.490
And so a lot of people in India are doing
multiple tracks at the same time. Their parents

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:14.070
may be looking for them and they're kind of
tolerant of that, they maybe in their [bad

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:18.059
audio] as parents and parents' networks. Then
they may be looking on the Internet with their

00:26:18.059 --> 00:26:21.900
parents. So they're kind of leading the Internet-based
search which is kind of like match.com but

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:27.970
it's called shaadi.com. So it's like marriage.com
instead of match.com. And they may be doing

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:31.370
that and kind of in the driver's seat but
with parents' help and parents' short listing.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:36.170
And they may be drinking and smoking and hooking
up and doing that also kind of in the Western

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:37.200
way.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.120
And what's really I think interesting about
Indians, is Indians are agnostic about which

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.230
of these is better. I think a lot of western
minds feel a compulsion to say, "I'm an arranged

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.669
marriage kind of person," or "I'm not an arranged
marriage kind of person. Philosophically I'm

00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:52.419
with that or philosophically I'm not with
that."

00:26:52.419 --> 00:26:57.080
You find a lot of Indians who are comfortable
doing all of those three things without seeing

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.419
contradictions between them; just accepting
that these are different things with different

00:27:01.419 --> 00:27:05.460
kinds of wisdom inherent in them. At least
now, maybe you'll move to an India that everyone's

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.630
doing love marriage. But I actually don't
think that's the pattern that's gonna emerge

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:13.500
even in the future. I think India will continue
to be a place with a kind of both and model

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:19.019
of modernization in which kind of different
kinds of truths about what it means to modern

00:27:19.019 --> 00:27:20.720
are simultaneously present.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.820
[pause]

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:34.360
&gt;&gt;male #1: Earlier you mentioned how children
of farmers are rejecting their family farms

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.330
and seeking other opportunities. How are they
becoming aware of these other opportunities

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:44.330
and what's your assessment of, is it a rural
to urban migration or your other elements

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:49.370
in terms of how they're thinking about leaving
the farming sector?

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:53.610
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: The question of how
people get this awareness is a very important

00:27:53.610 --> 00:28:01.549
one. And even I can tell you a lot of culprits
that I've seen, but I think in a way it remains

00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:06.799
for me this kind of big unfinished question.
There's only so much we know about. Something's

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:12.320
gotten into the air and there's a million
cues people take in a society for how they

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.650
should behave and what they should think about
being, and I think it's actually probably

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:20.110
millions of different little cues that people
are getting about where the future is, where

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:21.840
their possibilities are.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.919
The few things that I would say are really
important as forces, probably more important

00:28:26.919 --> 00:28:31.660
than any other is television. I think if you
think about the backgrounds of most of the

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.350
people in this room, we probably grew up with
the sense television was not good for us,

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:42.720
more television kind of makes you dumb, etcetera,
etcetera, etcetera.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.200
When you are at the very beginning of the
development arc and you have very little exposure,

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:51.730
your parents are not a useful template for
the kind of people you'd like to become; they're

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:56.270
poor, everyone around you is poor, etcetera,
television is this extraordinary and very

00:28:56.270 --> 00:29:03.389
different kind of force. It's a force of uplift
because it beams into very humble people's

00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:09.280
living rooms all the possible alternative
existences available to them. And these are

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.500
people whose parents are not saying, "You
can be an astronaut, you can be a teacher."

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:18.419
These are people whose parents are saying,
"Go clean that. Go fix that." And television

00:29:18.419 --> 00:29:25.710
is in a way an aspiring, aspirational, ambitious,
pushy parent for people who don't have those

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.630
kinds of parents themselves.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:33.809
And I remember something that Ravindra, who's
a young man who I met in a village, in a kind

00:29:33.809 --> 00:29:39.929
of very poor background but rose up; a self-made
man. And he said to me, "When you watch TV,"

00:29:39.929 --> 00:29:45.390
when you watch the Discovery Channel, for
example, "you're always seeing the best person

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:48.750
in the world doing whatever it is that they
do." So you're watching American Idol, you're

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:52.450
seeing the best singers in the world. If you
watch someone catching an anaconda on Discovery

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.700
Channel, they're like the great anaconda catching
expert.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:56.700
[laughter]

00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:01.010
Now that may or may not be literally true,
but it certainly is true that compared to

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:05.289
the social world in which they are, they don't
know anybody who's the best at anything, right?

00:30:05.289 --> 00:30:09.809
They don't know anybody who's in the top 50th
percentile in the world of being good at whatever

00:30:09.809 --> 00:30:14.580
it is that they do. And suddenly on TV it
is true. People who are kind of losers and

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:20.130
don't really do that well in life aren't actually
on TV. And so it's very inspiring to people

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:25.570
from those kinds of backgrounds to be pulled
up. So that's one thing I would say.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:29.710
And then I think it's a lot of other things.
The job opportunities in the big city, people

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.159
hear about this. It's interesting when you
go to small towns one of the things that really

00:30:33.159 --> 00:30:38.261
struck me is you can sit with a kid in a small
town in India today, 25 year-old kid, and

00:30:38.261 --> 00:30:42.269
you can ask them, "Who is everybody who's
left this town?" And they know everybody who's

00:30:42.269 --> 00:30:45.210
left the town. They know where they're working,
they know what they're doing, they know whether

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:48.539
they have a girlfriend or not, they know whether
they have a bike or a car, they know exactly,

00:30:48.539 --> 00:30:52.519
they keep very close tabs on every migrant
who's left.

00:30:52.519 --> 00:30:57.019
And the migrant stories come back kind of
resounding and echoing and they loom large

00:30:57.019 --> 00:31:00.240
in people's minds. And I think that has a
lot to do with it.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:06.990
They now say 31 people are leaving an Indian
village every minute and arriving in the city.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:11.419
Thirty-one people a minute. It's 10 million
people a year. So you've heard of partition

00:31:11.419 --> 00:31:19.769
in 1947, India's doing a partition worth of
human migration a year right now, and that's

00:31:19.769 --> 00:31:23.280
in a way if you were looking for the data
of people waking up and saying, "I don't wanna

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.059
be farmer's son," that's the data; it's 31
people a minute. Because all of those people

00:31:27.059 --> 00:31:33.929
are from agricultural backgrounds of some
kind and they're deserting it.

00:31:33.929 --> 00:31:36.019
[pause]

00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:49.580
&gt;&gt;male #2: Did you talk to people who went
back from U.S. or other parts of the world

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:54.530
and how did they feel about it immediately
and in longer term?

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:58.990
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: Yeah, I mean in a way
many of them were my friends; people like

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:03.409
me who grew up in this country or grew up
in India came to America and then moved back.

00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:07.200
But I knew and spent a lot of time with east
bound migrants.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:14.720
Obviously there was a range of experiences
that people had. But I think everybody, if

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:20.360
you think about what people tended to have
in common, everybody went with I think fairly

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:26.450
low expectations about their capacity to make
a difference in India, to be accepted in India,

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:33.680
to feel that they could have impact in the
world. And I think all of them in different

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.009
ways were very surprised and pleasantly surprised.

00:32:37.009 --> 00:32:44.929
All of us who formed that kind of wave of
people who made that move were surprised by

00:32:44.929 --> 00:32:51.200
the extent to which this country that had
seemed kind of immovable before to us, was

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.620
more moveable and more dynamic than America,
for example, a lot more moveable and dynamic

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:57.620
than America.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:04.230
America now feels to me to be a very kind
of aging, stagnant country and I never could

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:07.580
have imagined that it would be India that
would make America feel like that to me. But

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:11.410
America does feel like that in contrast. It
doesn't feel like everything and anything

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:16.851
is possible in America anymore, as many Americans
will tell you. It does feel like that in India

00:33:16.851 --> 00:33:21.820
even though so many people continue to live
such hard lives. The narrative has changed.

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:29.159
And I think a lot of us who made that migration
that's the kind, the overwhelming sentiment

00:33:29.159 --> 00:33:30.990
of the experience.

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:32.550
[pause]

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:45.540
&gt;&gt;female #2: Related to that previous question,
do your parents or your parents' generations

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:49.950
recognize this change that you've experienced
and seen as well?

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:51.929
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: It's interesting they
 --

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:57.519
[pause]

00:33:57.519 --> 00:34:04.370
clearly, I mean they read the paper, they
certainly read my articles in the paper. And

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:08.650
not just my parents but that whole generation
is obviously aware at a kind of very macro

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:12.790
level of what's happening in the world and
the fact that India is now getting this new

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:15.030
recognition and that it's changed.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:22.050
But I think that a lot of any human being
builds narratives in their life about their

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:27.220
life. And those narratives in a way acquire
a life of their own even when the data underneath

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:36.089
them changes, right? So just as in a way Google
has this narrative of being this kind of startup

00:34:36.089 --> 00:34:40.879
company where everybody wears jeans and is
very casual, even though you're now big brother

00:34:40.879 --> 00:34:44.300
in this big extraordinary, huge Fortune 500
company.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.340
[laughter]

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.230
And those narratives outlast the reality.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:54.139
And I think for immigrants the reality, the
narrative always has to be, "We left and there's

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:59.560
a reason we left." And it would cause too
much psychological friction for an immigrant

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:05.460
to kind of expose themselves to the question,
"Should I have left? Maybe actually India

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:11.400
was better." It's too much, you don't wanna
walk around your whole life kind of relitigating

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.770
the question of whether your entire life trajectory
was the right trajectory or not.

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:21.790
So I think a lot of people close that question,
and closing that question just as I don't

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:24.750
walk around wondering whether I should still
be a writer. I've made that choice and the

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:29.530
boat has sailed and now I organize my life
around the narrative of being a writer.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:35.839
And so I think for a lot of migrants you kind
of go and you freeze the question and so I

00:35:35.839 --> 00:35:41.030
think there is an openness and there's a delight
that India's doing well, but it's easier for

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:48.200
my generation to embrace the data of what
has changed I think then for people who themselves

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:52.630
made that very difficult choice to leave.

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:55.550
[pause]

00:35:55.550 --> 00:36:06.320
&gt;&gt;male #2: How important is someone's caste
to new opportunities and stuff? Does that,

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.610
does no one care about that or some people
care?

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:12.650
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: It?s a bit like the
arranged marriage answer I gave you which

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:18.221
is that it really depends on where you are.
I could take you on a tour of places in India,

00:36:18.221 --> 00:36:26.160
hundreds of places, where caste matters almost
as it did in 1500. I could take you to villages

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.490
where everybody knows who's who, where people
wear different markings that signals that

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:36.420
very clearly, where residential living is
still bounded in those villages by caste.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.069
So we could do a whole tour of places like
that. And if you only did that you'd think,

00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:43.040
"Gosh, nothing has changed in this place in
500 years."

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:47.859
I could also take you on a tour, a long tour
in India, of places where caste if absolutely

00:36:47.859 --> 00:36:53.740
irrelevant, it never comes up. People certainly
don't talk about it and even generally speaking

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:59.740
it's not a big part of life. If you went to
the Google Hyderabad Office, no one is sitting

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:03.619
around talking about their caste, I can assure
you.

00:37:03.619 --> 00:37:10.150
But even there I would be curious about what
percentage of people at Google Hyderabad are

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:15.070
former untouchables, right? It's probably,
if other companies are a guide, much lower

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:19.109
than the proportion of the population. I would
image that the proportion of the people that

00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:23.710
are Brahmins, even though Brahmins are a few
percentage points of India, is fairly high

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:25.109
in a place like Google Hyderabad.

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:31.930
So in a way it's a lot like race in America
that there are places, rural Mississippi where

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:36.180
it's kind of like it was and not very far
removed. There are places like New York and

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:42.109
San Francisco where it's moved on a lot and
certainly the old kind of lines have dissolved.

00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:48.260
But there's probably nowhere that is entirely
untouched by the fact that the society did

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:55.680
this to itself for a long time, which is arbitrarily
segregate people, make those traits inheritable

00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:04.140
and kind of stack people in this very nonsensical
hierarchy. And in a way that's a kind of trauma,

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:08.810
the way South Africa has a trauma of Apartheid,
the way America has a trauma of race, India

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:14.609
will continue to have that trauma of caste.

00:38:14.609 --> 00:38:22.670
And the way it most seems to assert itself
today is this kind of residual sense that

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:28.780
all men are not quite created equal. That
there's something natural about inequality

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:33.920
and there's this kind of sneaking suspicion
in India that lingers that inequality's maybe

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.160
a little bit natural, a little bit meant to
be.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:42.670
And I think it'll take a very long time for
that stain to be washed away, if that makes

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:44.040
sense.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.400
[pause]

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:52.211
&gt;&gt;Nick: Are there any other questions?

00:38:52.211 --> 00:38:57.820
Okay, I have one final question. So to bear
witness to that type of change and actually

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:04.310
be there and when you were comparing it to
your feeling now relative to the United States

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:08.801
and the classic American dream, is it something
you want to get back to fast? Do you envision

00:39:08.801 --> 00:39:12.720
that you would be almost a reverse migrant
and go back and actually be there to be part

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.720
of that?

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.940
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: I think in a way I've
thought about that a lot. I think in a way

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:22.510
two things have changed, not one. The first
thing that's changed is Indian's become a

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:26.520
relatively more attractive place and America
has perhaps become a relatively less attractive

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.260
place. But that's not the only shift.

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:34.180
The second big shift is in the very nature
of how people immigrate and how they migrate.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:43.840
And I think the idea in a way of what my parents
did the big one time, one way immigration

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.290
is fading.

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:51.760
And what for our generation I think is more
relevant and kind of appealing as a way of

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:56.579
life, is a kind of series, a circulation.

00:39:56.579 --> 00:40:03.250
So I think the choice that I've made for India
is India is now on my very short list of places

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:07.859
that is a core part of my life. But I don't
feel the need to make the same choice my parents

00:40:07.859 --> 00:40:12.369
did of this or this and now invest 30 years
and that's everything. I think it'll continue

00:40:12.369 --> 00:40:18.770
to be a part of every year. I think I'll probably
go live there again for extended periods.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:22.970
It's a part of my consciousness, but there
are other things for me that I wanna know

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:30.540
and do and experience and write about. And
so right now I'm very much thinking of those

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.329
places as well.

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:37.400
&gt;&gt;Nick: Great. Well Anand is gonna stay to
sign books afterwards so please stick around

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.420
and join me in thanking him for visiting Google.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.420
[applause]

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.610
&gt;&gt;Anand Giridharadas: Thank you all.

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:41.980
[applause]
