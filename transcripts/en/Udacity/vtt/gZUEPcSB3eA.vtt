All right. This time I have written out a fragment of HTML.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
&lt;font color = "red"&gt; Richard Stallman launched the link GNU project for software freedom.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Oh, we never closed the font. Bad HTML.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
There we go, and what I would like you to do is check each box that corresponds

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to a word that will be printed on the screen when we look at a in the web browser.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So, if you think the word "Richard" will appear on the screen, check this box.

00:00:25.000 --> 09:59:59.000
If you think the word "red" will appear on the screen, check this box. Try your hand.
