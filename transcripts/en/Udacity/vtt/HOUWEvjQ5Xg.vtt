00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.970
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.130
Today finally, finally,
finally we get to finish up on tracking.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.820
We've discussed tracking a few ways
from the inference perspective

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.850
where we have a dynamics model, and you
know the whole bit now at this point.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.900
Where we predict forward the state,
we take a measurement, and

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.180
we do our correction.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.940
One was a Kalman filter where
essentially we have a specific

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.340
representation for our densities,
namely Gaussians and

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.680
all the world's a Gaussian.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.630
Then we discussed,
particle filters where

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.790
because we're using samples you can
have much more arbitrary densities.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.020
You just have to have enough
particles to represent them.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.000
And also you need a generalized
censor model which works well.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.370
For this last section just talk
about a couple more methods.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.280
Just so
you should see that they're being done.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.650
And then at the end, I'm going to
talk about some issues that show up

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.980
in tracking,
no matter how you're doing it.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.120
And it's sort of outside of
the main tracking conversation and

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.550
yet, if you don't deal with
those issues, nothing works.
