00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.164
AARON CAMMARATA: Hi, Everybody.

00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:10.330
My name is Aaron and I'm
going to try and figure out

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.470
this on the fly.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.190
Hey there.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.060
That's me.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.802
So I'm a team lead in ATAP.

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:18.010
And I would like to show
you some of the technologies

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.080
that we're working on
that apply to games

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.580
and get you thinking
about what they

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.930
might mean for your designs.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.840
So let's start with
an obvious question.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.160
What's an ATAP?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.290
So that's what it stands for.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.840
The way I like to describe
our little R&amp;D group

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.670
is that if you think
of all the projects

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.740
that we can work
on in the world,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.400
there are those
that are possible

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.490
and those that require bending
the laws of time and space.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.580
So we try not to
work on those, but we

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.300
want to stay just as close
inside that bubble as we can.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.730
When we do it well,
we get technologies

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.540
like Tango, a 3D sensing
technology for phones

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.370
and tablets, which
some of you may already

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.870
be playing with
and understanding

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.885
how they impact game design.

00:00:57.885 --> 00:00:59.260
But I would like
to show you some

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.230
of the things we have going
going on back at the lair,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.560
I mean the lab, and we'll
start sort of near term

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.390
with Google Spotlight
Stories, and then

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.250
move a little bit further out
and show you JacQuard and Soli.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.720
So first things first--

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.210
Google Spotlight
Stories is a technology

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.030
for interactive
360-degree storytelling.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.290
So what it allows you to do is
create an immersive environment

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.720
for your viewers, who
can then use their phone

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.570
or device to look around
and control the camera,

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.520
and in so doing,
the story reacts

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.740
to where they're looking--
maybe opening up Easter

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.290
eggs or alternate storylines.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.480
We've worked with some
incredible partners.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.240
Most recently, if any of you
watched the Oscars last night,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.970
you would know that
"Pearl" by Patrick Osborne

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.790
was nominated for
Best Animated Short.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.820
So it's starting to get
a lot of recognition

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.360
as a really interesting
platform for storytelling.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.270
We also worked with Gracie Films
and we released a spotlight

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.480
story Day and Date
with the 600th episode

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.270
of "The Simpsons," which
we're very proud of.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.700
So you can download all
of these now for free

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.260
and check them out.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.820
The team tells me
that I'm allowed

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.320
to say that the toolkit
will be released soon.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.210
So if your design aesthetic
leans towards storytelling,

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.730
this is a technology to allow
you to author once and then

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.130
publish to multiple platforms.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.900
And so, I guess,
just start thinking

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.660
about what that might open
up in terms of your ability

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.812
to create very emotional
and emotive experiences.

00:02:29.812 --> 00:02:31.020
So we'll let that finish out.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.660
And as you can see, we've done
everything from live action

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.450
to hand-drawn and so on.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.280
So it's very powerful.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.260
Next, let's talk about Jacquard.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.720
Jacquard is touchable textiles.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.230
So we've created
a capacitant fiber

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.660
that we can weave
into any fabric.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.080
And so, here, you're seeing it
demonstrated inside of denim.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.870
And by connecting it
through the Bluetooth button

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.550
on the sleeve there,
we can connect it

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.010
to any phone or
Bluetooth device.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.230
Now we can start using
fabric to do things

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.810
like swipes and pinches
and holds and so on

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.020
and controlling devices and
games through any fabric--

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.850
chairs, hats, pants, shirts.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.700
So I want to see somebody make
the third-base coach simulator,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.500
you know, like--

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.340
OK, thank you.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.860
That was very kind to laugh at.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.530
OK so the first consumer
product for this

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.020
is going to be jackets
by Levi's, which

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.940
are coming out later this year.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.670
So keep an eye out and
grab yourself one of those.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.480
And last and certainly
not least, we have Soli.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.760
Soli is millimeter
wave radar, which

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.150
can detect very fine gestures
with fingers and hands.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.640
And it's small power
draw and form factor

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.950
have allowed us to put
it in objects and devices

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.760
as small as a smartwatch, as
you see demonstrated here.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.570
What we did last year is
release some alpha kits to some

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.310
of our, sort of, chosen partners
and just let them play with it

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.170
and see what they
came back with.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.210
And for those interested,
you can go sign up

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.040
for a beta dev
kit, which, again,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.180
will be out later this year.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.840
So let's take a look at two of
the examples that they made.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.380
First, one group did immediately
see the application to gaming

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.120
and they made a very
small prototype,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.100
where by detecting
how quickly you're

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.960
flicking your fingers
over the sensor,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.570
you can control how
fast the character runs.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.700
And then by moving
your hand up and down,

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.600
you can glide the paper
airplane higher or lower.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.110
The one that I found really most
fascinating is this last one.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.230
A group in the UK discovered
that by looking at the radar

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.750
returns and analyzing
those shapes,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.940
they could actually
detect what material

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.680
was being put on
top of this sensor

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.900
with a very high
degree of accuracy.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.430
So now all your
hidden object games

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.250
can actually require you to
get up and go find something

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.380
made of plastic, for example.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.054
So I ask you to look
beyond what we maybe

00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:48.720
are used to in terms
of gaming and start

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.270
thinking about how some of
this might create some very

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.530
transformative experiences.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.220
So with that, I would
like to introduce Michael,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.960
who will talk about VR and AR.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.310
