00:00:03.352 --> 00:00:06.282
Sal: This is Sal Khan
here of the Khan Academy,

00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:08.945
and we're going to do a really
fun experiment this morning.

00:00:08.945 --> 00:00:12.882
We're on Google Hangouts on
air with Secretary Duncan,

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:15.050
Secretary Arne Duncan,
Secretary of Education,

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.900
and we're just going
to have a conversation

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.397
about technology, about
education, about higher education,

00:00:20.397 --> 00:00:23.664
and I'll just hand it
over to Secretary Duncan.

00:00:23.664 --> 00:00:24.707
Secretary Duncan: Well,
I hand it back to you

00:00:24.707 --> 00:00:26.200
and take any questions you have;

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.406
but, just as you know, I'm
a big fan of your work.

00:00:28.406 --> 00:00:31.638
My children have really enjoyed
participating in Khan Academy.

00:00:31.638 --> 00:00:33.897
Lots of exciting things going on.

00:00:33.897 --> 00:00:36.510
Obviously came off the bus tour
last night with the President,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.341
we're really working hard
to reduce college costs.

00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:41.846
But whether it's talking about
college costs, or technology,

00:00:41.846 --> 00:00:44.912
or K to 12 reform, or try
and do more early childhood,

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:46.668
happy to take any questions you have.

00:00:46.668 --> 00:00:48.500
And again, thanks so
much for the leadership

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.295
and the extraordinary
amount of opportunity

00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:52.563
you're creating for children,
not just in this country,

00:00:52.563 --> 00:00:54.831
but across the globe. It's
pretty amazing to see.

00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:55.931
Sal: Oh, no, thank you.

00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:57.855
That means a lot to hear from you,

00:00:57.855 --> 00:00:59.369
and your children use Khan Academy?

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:02.528
Senator Duncan: They do use Khan Academy.

00:01:02.528 --> 00:01:03.827
(both men laughing)

00:01:03.827 --> 00:01:05.945
They actually enjoy it, I don't have
to beat them to make them do it.

00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:08.115
Sal: [unintelligible]
enjoy it. That's great.

00:01:08.115 --> 00:01:11.546
Senator Duncan: It's been fantastic.

00:01:11.546 --> 00:01:13.824
Sal: So, the place I
really want to start on,

00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:15.965
we get a lot of comments
here, especially because

00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:18.615
a lot of the news with the bus
tour that ya'll have been making

00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:23.052
around some of the announcements around
trying to reduce college education costs.

00:01:23.052 --> 00:01:27.217
We got on Facebook and on
Twitter from Science Guy,

00:01:27.217 --> 00:01:29.227
what element of the reform plan

00:01:29.227 --> 00:01:33.299
do you think is going to be
the biggest game changer,

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.547
and who's saying there's [unintelligible].

00:01:35.547 --> 00:01:37.615
They're all asking around this,

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:41.108
how are you going to address
the cost issue with this plan,

00:01:41.108 --> 00:01:43.553
and do you think it's
actually going to happen?

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:45.323
It seemed like there was some resistance,

00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:47.974
from at least comments,
from members of Congress.

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.305
Senator Duncan: Well, there's
always going to be resistance,

00:01:49.305 --> 00:01:51.006
and change is hard, as you know.

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:53.143
But, let me just start with
sort of explaining the problem.

00:01:53.143 --> 00:01:55.125
And I have to tell you,
virtually everywhere I go,

00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:56.611
whether it's to the grocery store,

00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:58.888
whether it's to the dry
cleaners, every plane I'm on,

00:01:58.888 --> 00:02:02.095
you have hard-working middle
class parents coming up,

00:02:02.095 --> 00:02:05.233
and it's almost heart-breaking,
basically pleading for help,

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:07.505
and college costs are just crushing folks;

00:02:07.505 --> 00:02:09.827
and when you poll the American public,

00:02:09.827 --> 00:02:12.318
it's pretty scary, a lot
of people started think

00:02:12.318 --> 00:02:14.434
that college isn't for
them, it's for the wealthy,

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.228
it's for the rich, it's
for people not like them.

00:02:16.228 --> 00:02:19.349
At a time when going to college
has never been more important,

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.917
unfortunately, it's never
been more expensive.

00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:24.931
So, we have to work together
to drive down costs.

00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:27.800
We have to have much greater transparency

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.940
and help young people and their
families make better choices.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.939
We have to challenge states
to continue to invest;

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.473
we can't do it by ourselves.

00:02:35.473 --> 00:02:37.684
We have to make sure
that young people have

00:02:37.684 --> 00:02:41.129
a set of good options to select
from and know what a loan is.

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.538
What's a grant? What are graduation rates?

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:46.466
What are the particular strengths and
weaknesses of majors of different places?

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:49.537
But to see the President
so engaged, it's fantastic.

00:02:49.537 --> 00:02:51.842
This is one simply where
we have to break through,

00:02:51.842 --> 00:02:53.061
and this should not be political.

00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:55.728
We want to lead the world
in college graduation rates.

00:02:55.728 --> 00:03:00.740
Right now we're on a path in terms
escalating costs that is unsustainable,

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.071
so having a honest
conversation with the public,

00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.344
how do we better encourage
states to do the right thing?

00:03:06.344 --> 00:03:09.199
How do we better rank universities
and rank them based upon

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:11.170
are they taking in low income students?

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.469
Are they graduating? Are they
keeping down college costs?

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.919
There should be nothing
political about any of this.

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.526
I look forward to working
with, not just the public,

00:03:18.526 --> 00:03:20.902
but with members that,
republicans and democrats,

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:23.777
in the House and Senate to do
the right thing for our country.

00:03:23.777 --> 00:03:25.866
This to me, again, is
not just about helping

00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:27.533
individuals and their families,

00:03:27.533 --> 00:03:29.907
but really fighting for our
country's economic future

00:03:29.907 --> 00:03:32.003
and to remain economically competitive.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:34.943
We need to have the best
educated work force in the world,

00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:37.958
and some form of higher
education has to be the goal

00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.922
for every single young person; a high
school diploma is no longer enough.

00:03:40.922 --> 00:03:43.696
4-year universities,
2-year community colleges,

00:03:43.696 --> 00:03:45.559
trade, technical, vocational training,

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.239
that has to be the goal for everyone.

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.466
Families have to have the
security that they can,

00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:52.295
if they work hard that they'll
have a chance to pursue that goal.

00:03:52.295 --> 00:03:54.652
That's what this is about.

00:03:54.652 --> 00:03:58.210
Sal: This is a kind of
over-arching theme of this plan,

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.494
especially around the rankings,

00:03:59.494 --> 00:04:04.009
is to rank universities based on,
essentially, value that they create

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.217
or the economic opportunities
for students the afterwards,

00:04:07.217 --> 00:04:09.213
so that the universities
that are really expensive

00:04:09.213 --> 00:04:12.416
and the students aren't
getting good jobs afterwards,

00:04:12.416 --> 00:04:13.841
they're going to be at
the bottom of the list

00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:17.582
and might not get a grant
funding or subsidized loans.

00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:18.952
Secretary Duncan: Well,
we're open to all of this,

00:04:18.952 --> 00:04:20.793
and want to have a really
public conversation

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:22.722
over the next year and get the best ideas.

00:04:22.722 --> 00:04:25.512
I'm always interested in
our universities improving.

00:04:25.512 --> 00:04:26.708
Is there growth and gains?

00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:29.896
Are graduation rates going up
or down, or are they stagnant?

00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:33.657
Are serving more low income and first
generation Pell Grant recipients?

00:04:33.657 --> 00:04:35.980
Are graduates being able to compete

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.624
successfully in the job market afterwards?

00:04:37.624 --> 00:04:38.971
But there's a whole host of things.

00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:42.706
I'm very aware that if you put
the wrong metrics out there

00:04:42.706 --> 00:04:44.257
you can create some perverse incentives

00:04:44.257 --> 00:04:46.307
and disincentives and
encourage bad behavior.

00:04:46.307 --> 00:04:48.643
That's obviously the
last thing we want to do.

00:04:48.643 --> 00:04:51.714
We want to be very thoughtful and
nuance and so no preconceived notions.

00:04:51.714 --> 00:04:55.322
We're going to go out and talk
to professors and presidents

00:04:55.322 --> 00:04:57.610
and parents and students themselves,

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.450
have a national conversation;
and at the back end of that,

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.256
come up with something
that makes more sense.

00:05:02.256 --> 00:05:04.654
What many folks don't understand is today

00:05:04.654 --> 00:05:09.705
we invest about $150 billion
each year in grants and loans.

00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:12.307
This is a huge investment
that we make happily

00:05:12.307 --> 00:05:15.667
that the tax payers support,
but all of that investment, Sal,

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:19.113
is based upon inputs, access to college.

00:05:19.113 --> 00:05:20.799
None of it is on outcomes.

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:22.534
Are students actually graduating?

00:05:22.534 --> 00:05:24.170
Are they graduating with
skills that will help them

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.936
be successful the rest of their life?

00:05:25.936 --> 00:05:29.377
So, having a greater
emphasis not just on access,

00:05:29.377 --> 00:05:31.532
which is important, but
really on the outcomes.

00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:32.700
That's where we want to go.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.837
Sal: Hm, that makes sense. Makes sense.

00:05:34.837 --> 00:05:38.936
With some of the statements
that ya'll have been making,

00:05:38.936 --> 00:05:43.204
we got a lot of tweets,
this is from Becky Bacala.

00:05:43.204 --> 00:05:47.430
Ya'll talk a lot about also the
importance of technology in education,

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.524
and how technology might be a
tool to increase accessibility,

00:05:50.524 --> 00:05:53.613
but it did raise some
concerns from several folks.

00:05:53.613 --> 00:05:55.171
Becky Bacala wrote, "Some
students' only chance

00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:57.648
"of carrying human

00:05:57.648 --> 00:05:58.984
"why is online learning better?"

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:01.638
Erica Kirshner wrote, "Replacing
teachers with computers

00:06:01.638 --> 00:06:03.501
"to save money only

00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:06.718
Also wrote, "Technology must
work in concert with the teacher,

00:06:06.718 --> 00:06:07.980
"it's not the teacher."

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.966
So, what are your thoughts?

00:06:09.966 --> 00:06:12.897
There's a lot of fear around,
when people talk about technology,

00:06:12.897 --> 00:06:14.695
and especially when
they're talking about it

00:06:14.695 --> 00:06:16.358
in the context of cost-savings,

00:06:16.358 --> 00:06:19.760
that it means that you're gonna
have fewer human beings involved.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.638
Secretary Duncan: Yeah, I always think

00:06:21.638 --> 00:06:24.582
there's false dichotomies, false debates.

00:06:24.582 --> 00:06:26.866
Technology is never going
to replace great teachers,

00:06:26.866 --> 00:06:29.777
and what all the research,
all the studies seem to show,

00:06:29.777 --> 00:06:32.622
is that blended learning,
great teachers empowered

00:06:32.622 --> 00:06:35.057
by great technology, is
what's leading to the best

00:06:35.057 --> 00:06:38.189
educational outcomes
achievements for students.

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.242
As I travel the country and get to go

00:06:40.242 --> 00:06:41.507
to hundreds and hundreds
of schools each year,

00:06:41.507 --> 00:06:43.893
which I love, I'm seeing amazing teachers,

00:06:43.893 --> 00:06:47.637
some young teachers, some 25
to 30 year veteran teachers,

00:06:47.637 --> 00:06:52.203
who talk very openly with me about
their initial apprehension and fear

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:53.873
about using technology in classroom;

00:06:53.873 --> 00:06:56.386
but how much more empowered they feel,

00:06:56.386 --> 00:06:58.596
how much more effective they feel,

00:06:58.596 --> 00:07:01.292
how much more engaged their
students are in their learning.

00:07:01.292 --> 00:07:04.264
So, this is neither, this is
never going to be either or,

00:07:04.264 --> 00:07:07.231
it's got to be both, and I
think technology can help

00:07:07.231 --> 00:07:10.393
to strengthen teaching, help
teachers not just teach,

00:07:10.393 --> 00:07:12.949
but actually know whether their
students are learning or not.

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:14.850
The goal is not to teach, the goal
is actually to have students learn,

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.239
to have students much more
engaged in their own learning,

00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:19.667
to have parents know what's
working and what's not,

00:07:19.667 --> 00:07:21.109
and have them be better partners.

00:07:21.109 --> 00:07:25.453
I just see tremendous upsides; I
think there's a huge equity play here

00:07:25.453 --> 00:07:28.885
to give students and communities
who have historically

00:07:28.885 --> 00:07:30.869
not had the best of
education opportunities

00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:32.703
to really level the playing field.

00:07:32.703 --> 00:07:35.164
But, it's also a chance to
raise the bar at the high end.

00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:38.005
If you can do both those things,
push equity very, very hard

00:07:38.005 --> 00:07:41.531
and raise the bar for the country,

00:07:41.531 --> 00:07:43.322
it's early, we're in our infancy.

00:07:43.322 --> 00:07:44.986
You and others are helping
to lead this field,

00:07:44.986 --> 00:07:49.927
but I'm actually extraordinarily
helpful about where this can go.

00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:51.552
Sal: Completely agree with that.

00:07:51.552 --> 00:07:53.650
What we've seen at Khan Academy is,

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.803
as you know, people a lot of times
have that knee jerking reaction,

00:07:55.803 --> 00:07:58.300
"Oh, this is technology versus physical,"

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.682
but it's the exact opposite.

00:07:59.682 --> 00:08:02.520
Secretary Duncan: Just to
give a couple quick examples.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.576
The President and I, we
made the announcement

00:08:03.576 --> 00:08:05.726
about increasing access to broadband.

00:08:05.726 --> 00:08:08.153
We went to Moorseville, North Carolina;

00:08:08.153 --> 00:08:11.715
this is a district that's
invested heavily in technology

00:08:11.715 --> 00:08:16.110
over the past 6, 7, 8 years in tough
economic times, no additional money.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.272
What they simply stopped
doing is buying text books.

00:08:18.272 --> 00:08:19.924
I continue to wonder as a nation,

00:08:19.924 --> 00:08:23.712
why we keep spending 7, 8,
9 billion dollars each year

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:26.184
on text books that are
literally out of date,

00:08:26.184 --> 00:08:28.521
basically, the day you purchase them,

00:08:28.521 --> 00:08:31.252
so they'd made that shift, and again,

00:08:31.252 --> 00:08:34.432
veteran teachers feel that they're
teaching an entirely different level.

00:08:34.432 --> 00:08:36.715
I've been to places like
School of One in New York,

00:08:36.715 --> 00:08:40.494
where you have larger
classrooms, 30, 40 children

00:08:40.494 --> 00:08:44.937
working in small groups, teachers
walking between different groups.

00:08:44.937 --> 00:08:48.320
Again, veteran New York teachers,
initially very scared about this,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.922
think they're changing kids'
lives in a really important way.

00:08:50.922 --> 00:08:54.232
Again, early on, a lot to learn together,

00:08:54.232 --> 00:08:57.102
but I'm very, very hopeful,
not just on the K to 12 side,

00:08:57.102 --> 00:08:59.824
but in higher ed with [mooks] as well.

00:08:59.824 --> 00:09:02.228
Sal: Absolutely, but
moving on in K through 12,

00:09:02.228 --> 00:09:03.683
a lot of the questions we've gotten

00:09:03.683 --> 00:09:06.936
have been around the
common core, in particular.

00:09:06.936 --> 00:09:11.402
Nathan Nasby wrote, we've already
had standards at a state level,

00:09:11.402 --> 00:09:14.238
"How is the common core
going to be different?"

00:09:14.238 --> 00:09:19.181
We have several questions;
Deborah [Debara Lomeo] wrote that

00:09:19.181 --> 00:09:22.465
in her state of New York, they're
already having issues with

00:09:22.465 --> 00:09:26.666
graduation rates, what is the
common core going to do there?

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:31.417
I'll throw in my 2 cents
is at Khan Academy,

00:09:31.417 --> 00:09:34.699
we're very focused on intentionally
creating material for the common core;

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:37.392
the thing that I see in it is it's
much deeper and much more rigorous,

00:09:37.392 --> 00:09:40.925
so in that world, it's really a higher
standard than we've had in the past.

00:09:40.925 --> 00:09:42.630
I guess, those are the 2 questions.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.601
How will it improve overall
learning and graduation rates?

00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:50.180
And is there a risk that
it's maybe too rigorous?

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.937
Secretary Duncan: These are all
great questions, important questions,

00:09:53.937 --> 00:09:55.222
but let me be really clear.

00:09:55.222 --> 00:09:59.670
One of the things I think has
hurt children in communities,

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.728
and ultimately our country tremendously,

00:10:00.728 --> 00:10:03.972
is we had 50 different states
with 50 different standards,

00:10:03.972 --> 00:10:06.345
and many of which got dummied down.

00:10:06.345 --> 00:10:09.529
They got reduced to make
politicians look good.

00:10:09.529 --> 00:10:12.428
We were actually lying
to children and families

00:10:12.428 --> 00:10:14.582
telling them they are
prepared to be successful,

00:10:14.582 --> 00:10:16.589
when frankly they weren't even close,

00:10:16.589 --> 00:10:19.898
and to me that is absolutely
insidious, it is heart-breaking.

00:10:19.898 --> 00:10:22.229
That's the worst thing
that can happen to a child

00:10:22.229 --> 00:10:25.633
and to families that think they're on
track to being college and career ready,

00:10:25.633 --> 00:10:28.821
and they get to senior year and find
out they're not even in the ball game.

00:10:28.821 --> 00:10:31.854
They have no hope of doing that, and they
think they've played by all the rules,

00:10:31.854 --> 00:10:34.956
and this has happened in
some places for far too long.

00:10:34.956 --> 00:10:37.484
So, the idea of having high standards,

00:10:37.484 --> 00:10:40.615
college and career ready standards
that are internationally bench marked

00:10:40.615 --> 00:10:44.875
so we will no longer be lying to
students and families is a game changer.

00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:47.235
Now, it's going to take a
tremendous amount of work

00:10:47.235 --> 00:10:50.980
to help to prepare students, to
give teachers the PD they need,

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.084
the implementation of
this is going to be rocky,

00:10:53.084 --> 00:10:55.298
and hard, and difficult, but I tell you,

00:10:55.298 --> 00:10:59.735
every time you raise standards, students
do better, they're more engaged.

00:10:59.735 --> 00:11:02.749
Sal, I'll argue, the vast
majority of students who drop out

00:11:02.749 --> 00:11:05.007
don't drop out because
high school's too hard,

00:11:05.007 --> 00:11:07.404
they drop out because
high school is boring.

00:11:07.404 --> 00:11:09.303
They're not connected,
they're not engaged,

00:11:09.303 --> 00:11:11.205
and your point, the chance to go deeper,

00:11:11.205 --> 00:11:15.074
more critical thinking skills,
more analytical skills,

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:16.870
we think it's hugely important.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.402
Teachers across the country
have really embraced this;

00:11:19.402 --> 00:11:22.023
it is hard work, they know
they're taking on more.

00:11:22.023 --> 00:11:25.200
We do a great job supporting
them, but I'm so hopeful

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.168
about where this is going to
go over the next 2, 3, 4 years.

00:11:28.168 --> 00:11:31.567
If we can have the courage to
stay the course as a nation,

00:11:31.567 --> 00:11:33.968
we will be at an entirely different place.

00:11:33.968 --> 00:11:37.561
I can tell you literally for the
first time in our country's history,

00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:41.360
a child in Massachusetts,
or a child in Maryland,

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.239
or a child in Mississippi, they're going
to be held to the same high standards.

00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:50.330
As you know so well, young people
today aren't competing for jobs

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.328
in their district, or in
their state in their country;

00:11:52.328 --> 00:11:55.177
they're competing for jobs
with children in India,

00:11:55.177 --> 00:11:57.399
in China, in Singapore, in South Korea,

00:11:57.399 --> 00:11:59.802
and I'm convinced our
children are as smart,

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:02.696
as talented, as creative as
entrepreneurialist children

00:12:02.696 --> 00:12:06.215
anywhere in the world. We just have
to level the playing field for them.

00:12:06.215 --> 00:12:09.243
We have to give them a chance,
and that's what this effort,

00:12:09.243 --> 00:12:11.197
which is being led by
states on a voluntary basis,

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:12.941
that's what this is all about.

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:16.590
Sal: And following up on that,
we've gotten a lot of folks here

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:20.032
who, with the common core,
also express fear that this,

00:12:20.032 --> 00:12:24.669
there's been a general trend,
more emphasis on testing,

00:12:24.669 --> 00:12:26.435
and the fear is that with the common core

00:12:26.435 --> 00:12:30.309
that seems like it's an even larger
emphasis on standards, possibly testing,

00:12:30.309 --> 00:12:34.235
what's your view on this
balance between the very,

00:12:34.235 --> 00:12:36.432
the objective things that
you can test in a test,

00:12:36.432 --> 00:12:39.757
and whether it should be high-stakes or
not for things like teacher evaluation,

00:12:39.757 --> 00:12:43.974
and the intangible skills, experiential
learning, things like that?

00:12:43.974 --> 00:12:46.070
Secretary Duncan: Yeah, I think
these are really important issues

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.502
that we have to work through together,

00:12:47.502 --> 00:12:49.824
but I will say part of
what I resented so much

00:12:49.824 --> 00:12:51.581
about the No Child Left Behind Law,

00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:53.785
and I lived on the other
side of it for 7 1/2 years

00:12:53.785 --> 00:12:55.248
when I led the Chicago public schools,

00:12:55.248 --> 00:12:57.029
and we wanted Congress
to fix the broken law.

00:12:57.029 --> 00:12:58.649
Unfortunately, Congress
is pretty dysfunctional.

00:12:58.649 --> 00:13:02.498
We provided waivers to 40 states,
so we're partnering very, very well

00:13:02.498 --> 00:13:04.557
directly with states across
the political spectrum.

00:13:04.557 --> 00:13:07.451
What No Child Left Behind
did, and I think it did lead

00:13:07.451 --> 00:13:11.395
to an over-emphasis on a test,
on a proficiency cut score,

00:13:11.395 --> 00:13:14.400
which I think is lots of
perverse incentives there,

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.357
lots of bad things for
kids and for educators,

00:13:16.357 --> 00:13:18.992
what you're saying
through the waiver process

00:13:18.992 --> 00:13:20.639
is states move in a very
different direction.

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:23.502
Yes, they're looking at
growth and gain improvement,

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:26.511
which I think should be part of multiple
measures of what you're looking at,

00:13:26.511 --> 00:13:29.511
but they're moving way beyond
a focus on test scores.

00:13:29.511 --> 00:13:33.299
They're looking at increasing graduation
rates, reducing drop-out rates.

00:13:33.299 --> 00:13:38.006
Are more high school graduates actually
going on to some form of higher education?

00:13:38.006 --> 00:13:41.237
Are they doing that not having
to take remedial classes?

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:44.003
I have to tell you so many
young people around the country,

00:13:44.003 --> 00:13:46.576
40, 50% in some communities,
are taking remedial classes.

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.438
Okay, these are the graduates.

00:13:48.438 --> 00:13:50.467
These are the ones that made
it through, they're not ready.

00:13:50.467 --> 00:13:52.009
Are they persevering in higher ed?

00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:53.904
So, what you're seeing in
terms of accountability

00:13:53.904 --> 00:13:56.595
is moving way beyond a
focus on a test score,

00:13:56.595 --> 00:13:58.571
which I think has lots of problems,

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:00.882
looking at much more long term outcomes.

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:03.344
I think that's a very, very healthy thing,

00:14:03.344 --> 00:14:05.464
so we want common core to
continue in that trend,

00:14:05.464 --> 00:14:08.480
but having states and
districts and schools

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.801
look not just at 3rd grade test score,

00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:13.267
but again, are we
graduating more students?

00:14:13.267 --> 00:14:16.289
Are they graduating prepared
to chase their dreams?

00:14:16.289 --> 00:14:19.169
Again, be that in a world of
higher ed, or in a world of work,

00:14:19.169 --> 00:14:21.795
on a much more holistic
sense of accountability

00:14:21.795 --> 00:14:24.722
and comprehensive absolutely
right direction to go.

00:14:24.722 --> 00:14:27.201
And states, again, I think are
showing tremendous leadership

00:14:27.201 --> 00:14:30.460
encouraging creativity in these areas.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:35.343
Sal: Yeah, absolutely, and another,
I guess, over-arching theme,

00:14:35.343 --> 00:14:39.586
we got a lot of tweets
that touch on this issue

00:14:39.586 --> 00:14:46.174
is that teachers themselves often are
feeling marginalized in the conversation,

00:14:46.174 --> 00:14:50.426
they're feeling that everyone's
solution is sometimes to blame teachers,

00:14:50.426 --> 00:14:55.700
and I think both you and I would
agree that education is literally the,

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.869
probably the most important investment
that we can make in society,

00:14:58.869 --> 00:15:02.750
and often times there's lip
service to the importance of that,

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.531
and the lip service to the
importance of teachers,

00:15:04.531 --> 00:15:07.234
but the way things are
structured right now

00:15:07.234 --> 00:15:10.809
that they don't get paid what a doctor
or a lawyer or engineer gets paid.

00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:13.729
They don't get, often
times, the same respect

00:15:13.729 --> 00:15:16.930
that a doctor or an engineer gets.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.904
What can we do to move
more in that direction?

00:15:19.904 --> 00:15:21.332
Secretary Duncan: Let
me say a couple things.

00:15:21.332 --> 00:15:24.158
First of all, anyone who's blaming
teachers is part of the problem,

00:15:24.158 --> 00:15:27.663
not part of the solution;
teachers do extraordinarily

00:15:27.663 --> 00:15:31.234
hard, complex, difficult
work every single day,

00:15:31.234 --> 00:15:33.051
often without enough resources.

00:15:33.051 --> 00:15:35.017
Again, i'm in hundreds
of schools each year,

00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:37.863
and teachers are working amazingly hard.

00:15:37.863 --> 00:15:43.072
Obviously literally just this week
you saw in DeKalb County in Georgia,

00:15:43.072 --> 00:15:47.709
teachers and school members
prevented what could have been

00:15:47.709 --> 00:15:51.603
just a horrific massacre and
just show tremendous courage;

00:15:51.603 --> 00:15:55.509
I mean, literal heroes,
[profiles and courage].

00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:59.375
The President and I talked to one
of those staff members last night,

00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:02.534
Antoinette Huff, I talked to
the entire team this morning.

00:16:02.534 --> 00:16:05.982
Teachers routinely go way,
way beyond the call of duty;

00:16:05.982 --> 00:16:09.362
so, what we need to do
together is to elevate

00:16:09.362 --> 00:16:11.506
and to strengthen the teaching profession,

00:16:11.506 --> 00:16:15.028
to do everything we can to
attract and retain great talent.

00:16:15.028 --> 00:16:18.764
We've put out a blueprint people can look
on our website to respect initiative.

00:16:18.764 --> 00:16:22.121
We think it's again, the
best thing we can do.

00:16:22.121 --> 00:16:23.537
I'll say 2 other things.

00:16:23.537 --> 00:16:26.532
As a country, I think we're
just this fork in the road

00:16:26.532 --> 00:16:28.963
of whether we see
education as an investment

00:16:28.963 --> 00:16:31.369
as you and I do, and I would argue
the best investment we can make

00:16:31.369 --> 00:16:34.399
or an expense, and every time
I go testify before Congress

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:37.629
we have a set of folks who say
we should cut back on education,

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:42.271
and cut back on head start, and
on K to 12, and on Pell Grants.

00:16:42.271 --> 00:16:46.779
I just think that's very, very troubling,

00:16:46.779 --> 00:16:49.329
and it's cutting off our
nose to spite our face.

00:16:49.329 --> 00:16:52.260
Again, we want to have the best
educated country in the world,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.074
and we have politicians
who refuse to invest.

00:16:55.074 --> 00:16:58.535
It makes no sense. I worry
desperately, right now in real time,

00:16:58.535 --> 00:17:01.105
about what's going on
the city of Philadelphia.

00:17:01.105 --> 00:17:03.479
I worry about as the school year starts,

00:17:03.479 --> 00:17:05.753
those children there who
deserve the best education,

00:17:05.753 --> 00:17:09.903
receiving that inferior education
because folks refuse to invest.

00:17:09.903 --> 00:17:13.852
North Carolina is a state
I worry tremendously about.

00:17:13.852 --> 00:17:17.878
North Carolina used to be sort of national
leader in reform in so many things.

00:17:17.878 --> 00:17:22.980
Teachers salaries have dropped
precipitously in North Carolina.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.372
I spoke last week with
some teachers and it was,

00:17:25.372 --> 00:17:27.573
these are fantastic
teachers in North Carolina.

00:17:27.573 --> 00:17:29.764
Sal, it was actually heartbreaking,

00:17:29.764 --> 00:17:32.308
you have teachers literally who
are making so little money now

00:17:32.308 --> 00:17:34.076
that they were on food stamps.

00:17:34.076 --> 00:17:36.789
They're receiving food stamps
to feed their children.

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:39.962
I spoke to another teacher
who was giving blood,

00:17:39.962 --> 00:17:44.178
who was selling blood like
twice a month to pay the bills.

00:17:44.178 --> 00:17:47.222
Again, for me, it just
makes no sense whatsoever;

00:17:47.222 --> 00:17:49.807
so how we elevate the
profession, how we strengthen it.

00:17:49.807 --> 00:17:52.846
I've already argued very
publicly that we should pay

00:17:52.846 --> 00:17:54.795
starting teachers a heck
of a lot more money.

00:17:54.795 --> 00:17:58.148
We should pay fantastic teachers
2 to 3 times as much money.

00:17:58.148 --> 00:18:00.278
It is the best investment we can make.

00:18:00.278 --> 00:18:03.034
Right now, as a country, in
too many states and localities,

00:18:03.034 --> 00:18:05.694
folks, I think, don't
quite understated that,

00:18:05.694 --> 00:18:07.943
and I would argue in tough economic times,

00:18:07.943 --> 00:18:09.899
education's not something you cut back on.

00:18:09.899 --> 00:18:12.164
You actually double down your investment.

00:18:12.164 --> 00:18:14.008
We have to educate our
way to a better economy.

00:18:14.008 --> 00:18:16.878
If you want more upper
mobility, more social ability,

00:18:16.878 --> 00:18:20.284
the only way you do that is to
strengthen America's classrooms

00:18:20.284 --> 00:18:23.296
and to support our nation's
fantastic teachers.

00:18:23.296 --> 00:18:26.103
Sal: I 100% agree with you, I just,

00:18:26.103 --> 00:18:28.488
it's scary, some of what
you just talked about.

00:18:28.488 --> 00:18:31.822
I think a lot of, we definitely agree

00:18:31.822 --> 00:18:33.512
that there has to be more investment.

00:18:33.512 --> 00:18:35.396
There has to be ways to
compensate teachers better,

00:18:35.396 --> 00:18:37.567
but at the same time, you have
these budgetary pressures,

00:18:37.567 --> 00:18:40.380
so I just hope that these 2 things don't

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.631
run into each other with negative.

00:18:41.631 --> 00:18:43.103
Secretary Duncan: Well,
what I would say, Sal,

00:18:43.103 --> 00:18:44.835
is that these are tough
economic times, and yes,

00:18:44.835 --> 00:18:46.519
there are budgetary
pressures, but I would say

00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:48.668
budgets aren't numbers
on a piece of paper.

00:18:48.668 --> 00:18:50.374
Budgets reflect our values.

00:18:50.374 --> 00:18:52.998
The question I always ask, when, you know.

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:54.395
Hold us accountable at the federal level,

00:18:54.395 --> 00:18:55.735
and you see the President's
tried to increase

00:18:55.735 --> 00:18:58.863
investment at every level, early
childhood, K to 12, higher ed,

00:18:58.863 --> 00:19:01.195
every single year; one of
the things I'm most proud of

00:19:01.195 --> 00:19:03.371
is an additional $40
billion for Pell Grants,

00:19:03.371 --> 00:19:07.180
serving almost 9 million, more than
9 million young people, Pell Grants.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.266
But we can't do it by ourselves.

00:19:09.266 --> 00:19:12.137
When states cut funding to education,

00:19:12.137 --> 00:19:14.758
but keep increasing funding for prisons,

00:19:14.758 --> 00:19:17.768
as many states do, they're
making a value judgement

00:19:17.768 --> 00:19:19.891
that would prefer to lock people to up,

00:19:19.891 --> 00:19:22.480
to incarcerate them, to
invest them at the front end.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.319
so, yes, we all have, in our own families,

00:19:25.319 --> 00:19:27.628
in our budgets,
professionally, personally,

00:19:27.628 --> 00:19:29.430
we all have to make tough calls.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.933
But the calls we make,
the investments we make,

00:19:31.933 --> 00:19:36.870
reflect our values, and
I just desperately hope

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:40.680
more states and more communities
and more elected officials

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.680
at the national level, in
Congress, House, and Senate,

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.649
understand that we have
to invest in education,

00:19:46.649 --> 00:19:49.702
that that means we have to
spend less on other things.

00:19:49.702 --> 00:19:53.765
That might be a tough call,
but is the right call to make

00:19:53.765 --> 00:19:57.290
for our children, for our families,
and ultimately for our country.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:01.473
Sal: Yeah, and with that,
obviously we should be investing

00:20:01.473 --> 00:20:06.063
in more education, and as we do, and we
do invest a reasonable amount already,

00:20:06.063 --> 00:20:08.654
what's your view, and there's
a lot of talk now as something

00:20:08.654 --> 00:20:10.415
that we get a lot of questions on,

00:20:10.415 --> 00:20:13.177
and we talk about a lot of this,
is thinking about the structure

00:20:13.177 --> 00:20:16.624
of education itself, that
the way that we teach,

00:20:16.624 --> 00:20:19.364
and right now is really
something we inherited

00:20:19.364 --> 00:20:22.626
from the 18th century [pressions]
where we group kids together,

00:20:22.626 --> 00:20:24.387
and we move them at a set pace.

00:20:24.387 --> 00:20:25.770
At least, to some of
what you talked about,

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.764
that kids get promoted because
they were in a chair for a year,

00:20:28.764 --> 00:20:31.397
and then they get to
community college or college

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:34.335
and they're testing at
a 6th grade math level.

00:20:34.335 --> 00:20:37.095
The other side of it is more
of a competency based model,

00:20:37.095 --> 00:20:40.279
where students take as long as
they need to learn something,

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:41.995
but then they get to a very high standard,

00:20:41.995 --> 00:20:44.759
and so, really that would make it
impossible that someone graduates

00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:50.314
and has to take remedial math.
Do you see things shifting there?

00:20:50.314 --> 00:20:52.194
Secretary Duncan: That they have to shift,

00:20:52.194 --> 00:20:53.381
and we have to continue to accelerate.

00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:55.699
The fact that we're still
teaching with a 19th century model

00:20:55.699 --> 00:20:59.187
makes no sense whatsoever,
and 25 or 30 kids

00:20:59.187 --> 00:21:02.632
sitting in rows all learning
the same thing at the same time,

00:21:02.632 --> 00:21:06.220
same pace, again, it's
just like Neanderthal.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.926
It makes no sense, and
so this idea, again,

00:21:08.926 --> 00:21:11.045
with technology being
a great tool to empower

00:21:11.045 --> 00:21:14.772
a moving from seat time, as you
said so clearly, to competency.

00:21:14.772 --> 00:21:17.028
I don't want to know
how long you sat there,

00:21:17.028 --> 00:21:18.760
I want to know do you know the material?

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.781
Do you know algebra or biology or physics
or chemistry, or whatever it might be?

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:25.075
If you know it, you
shouldn't have to sit there.

00:21:25.075 --> 00:21:27.232
So, we're doing everything
we can to encourage this

00:21:27.232 --> 00:21:30.920
on the K to 12 side, on the higher ed.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.686
We're starting to do some pilots,
some experimental programs in places

00:21:34.686 --> 00:21:36.860
like the University of
Southern New Hampshire

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.455
that is moving from seat time
to mastery to competency.

00:21:40.455 --> 00:21:42.382
This is absolutely where we need to go.

00:21:42.382 --> 00:21:45.346
What's still important for me, Sal,
is not just for the high flyers,

00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:47.074
yes it's going to benefit the high flyers,

00:21:47.074 --> 00:21:49.210
they need to be able to
move much more quickly,

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:51.446
but the average student should
be able to get the help they need

00:21:51.446 --> 00:21:54.551
and that student who takes
more time, doesn't matter

00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:56.081
how long it takes them to learn it,

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.876
they just need to master that content.

00:21:57.876 --> 00:21:59.684
So, whether it's more time
during the school day,

00:21:59.684 --> 00:22:02.469
more time after school, or
at night at home, and again,

00:22:02.469 --> 00:22:05.344
using technology weekends,
the goal is to become

00:22:05.344 --> 00:22:08.637
comfortable and confident
with whatever the material is

00:22:08.637 --> 00:22:11.771
that whatever 3rd grade,
5th grade, AP physics.

00:22:11.771 --> 00:22:15.101
This for me, is a game changer for kids.

00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:19.847
It's absolutely the right thing to
do, and time should be variable.

00:22:19.847 --> 00:22:21.608
Time should not be the constant.

00:22:21.608 --> 00:22:24.793
The constant should be are students
having opportunities to learn,

00:22:24.793 --> 00:22:28.046
to master the material, to be
engaged in their own learning?

00:22:28.046 --> 00:22:30.257
So, again, there's some really creative,

00:22:30.257 --> 00:22:31.862
innovative things starting to happen;

00:22:31.862 --> 00:22:34.568
but, part of, I think,
our role is to take these

00:22:34.568 --> 00:22:38.064
areas of innovations, these
pockets of excellence,

00:22:38.064 --> 00:22:41.352
and try and share these best practices
and actually take them to scale

00:22:41.352 --> 00:22:43.923
to make this the norm
rather than the exception.

00:22:43.923 --> 00:22:47.520
Sal: Yeah, and just to
double underline that,

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.931
a lot of times what we see is, yes,
you have students go at their own pace

00:22:50.931 --> 00:22:53.342
and the assumption is some kids
are just going to take longer

00:22:53.342 --> 00:22:55.679
and fall further and further behind,
but we're seeing over and over again,

00:22:55.679 --> 00:22:57.185
if you let students go at their own pace,

00:22:57.185 --> 00:22:59.017
a lot of times that
student that you thought

00:22:59.017 --> 00:23:01.378
was a a little bit slower,
they're taking their time

00:23:01.378 --> 00:23:03.215
really filling in their
gaps, and they're becoming

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:05.501
the best student in the
class 6 months later.

00:23:05.501 --> 00:23:06.838
Secretary Duncan: The
more you can articulate

00:23:06.838 --> 00:23:09.494
those findings and demonstrate
them, that's so important.

00:23:09.494 --> 00:23:14.421
Far too many adults underestimate
what students can do;

00:23:14.421 --> 00:23:17.224
and yes, we know students need
help, we need to support them,

00:23:17.224 --> 00:23:19.906
but our biggest problem,
I think, in this country

00:23:19.906 --> 00:23:21.885
is not that we're pushing kids too hard,

00:23:21.885 --> 00:23:23.760
it's that we're not
encouraging them enough.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.398
We're not giving them enough
opportunities to learn and do more.

00:23:26.398 --> 00:23:28.781
Whenever you raise standards,
ready to give opportunities,

00:23:28.781 --> 00:23:31.383
you don't have more drop
outs, you have more graduates.

00:23:31.383 --> 00:23:33.751
The problem, I guarantee
you, has always been

00:23:33.751 --> 00:23:37.063
that we dummy things down
for kids, and they feel that,

00:23:37.063 --> 00:23:38.480
they know it, they sense it.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.565
They know that they think that we're
not serious about their education,

00:23:40.565 --> 00:23:42.868
and they become disengaged, they back out.

00:23:42.868 --> 00:23:46.107
We give them a chance to fly,
to learn, to empower them,

00:23:46.107 --> 00:23:47.987
you see extraordinary things happen.

00:23:47.987 --> 00:23:49.702
Again, not just for those at the top,

00:23:49.702 --> 00:23:51.384
but those that we thought
may have been struggling,

00:23:51.384 --> 00:23:53.966
let them find their passion,
let them find their interest

00:23:53.966 --> 00:23:55.562
and they'll go to the moon with that.

00:23:55.562 --> 00:23:57.803
We have to create those opportunities.

00:23:57.803 --> 00:24:00.093
Sal: Another, I guess, over-arching theme,

00:24:00.093 --> 00:24:03.920
it's along the same idea of
us going with a legacy system

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.441
that we've had since the [horseman]
brought us the [pression] system

00:24:07.441 --> 00:24:12.465
in the mid 19th century, is
not only the system itself,

00:24:12.465 --> 00:24:14.885
seat time versus competency,
but what is actually covered,

00:24:14.885 --> 00:24:17.934
this is something I've written
about, a lot of people know,

00:24:17.934 --> 00:24:20.299
is that this decision to
do algebra in 9th grade,

00:24:20.299 --> 00:24:24.130
geometry in 10th grade, trigonometry,
the calculus and physics

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.296
in the senior year, and all of
that, that was decided essentially

00:24:26.296 --> 00:24:28.333
by 10 men around 120 years ago.

00:24:28.333 --> 00:24:31.998
So, one question I get, I
just [need] to have myself,

00:24:31.998 --> 00:24:34.720
I love calculus, I've
made 400 videos on it,

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.199
I have it online. I love the subject.

00:24:37.199 --> 00:24:39.146
Secretary Duncan: I need to watch
our videos. I need [unintelligible]

00:24:39.146 --> 00:24:42.579
Sal: Oh, very exciting
stuff. But, at the same time,

00:24:42.579 --> 00:24:45.219
the one thing I wonder is
something like statistics,

00:24:45.219 --> 00:24:48.687
is are more applicable in pretty
much any field you go into,

00:24:48.687 --> 00:24:50.362
but that's usually reserved for an

00:24:50.362 --> 00:24:52.702
elective course in
college, and it isn't core;

00:24:52.702 --> 00:24:56.855
things like law, you only get,
frankly, if you go to law school,

00:24:56.855 --> 00:24:58.754
you don't even get it at
a undergraduate level.

00:24:58.754 --> 00:25:03.792
Is there some movement to try to make
this more part of the core curriculum ?

00:25:03.792 --> 00:25:06.255
Secretary Duncan: I always
talk about a well-rounded

00:25:06.255 --> 00:25:09.224
world-class education, and so,
as all the things you mentioned,

00:25:09.224 --> 00:25:11.954
it's computer science, which
obviously didn't exist 100 years ago.

00:25:11.954 --> 00:25:14.420
Sal: I'm biased. I didn't
want to mention that people

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.047
talk about computer science (laughs).

00:25:16.047 --> 00:25:17.865
Secretary Duncan: There are a lot
of great jobs in computer science

00:25:17.865 --> 00:25:20.188
that are going on field today, coding, I-

00:25:20.188 --> 00:25:21.566
Sal: [unintelligible] here.

00:25:21.566 --> 00:25:23.456
Secretary Duncan: I would add
to that foreign languages.

00:25:23.456 --> 00:25:25.427
I would add to that financial literacy.

00:25:25.427 --> 00:25:29.547
I would add to that physical
education, recess, health;

00:25:29.547 --> 00:25:33.022
and so, these are things
that generally you see

00:25:33.022 --> 00:25:36.118
in the elite private schools, they
are this sort of part of core,

00:25:36.118 --> 00:25:39.732
but somehow in public education,
again, often due to underfunding,

00:25:39.732 --> 00:25:42.286
lack of investment, all those
things kind of get stripped away.

00:25:42.286 --> 00:25:46.401
Again, I worry about, generally,
but very specifically, right now,

00:25:46.401 --> 00:25:48.695
about places like
Philadelphia, North Carolina,

00:25:48.695 --> 00:25:51.047
that I think are a sort
of a time in crisis.

00:25:51.047 --> 00:25:53.319
When you take away those
kinds of opportunities,

00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:56.241
our children should be growing
up bilingual and trilingual.

00:25:56.241 --> 00:25:57.894
They have to be financially literate.

00:25:57.894 --> 00:26:00.506
They have to have the computer
science and other things;

00:26:00.506 --> 00:26:03.070
that has to be part of
the core curriculum.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:06.251
So, yes, the basic reading and math
are fundamental and foundational,

00:26:06.251 --> 00:26:09.149
but that's a starting
point, not an ending point.

00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:12.030
Again, if we're serious
about keeping kids in school,

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.868
reducing drop out rates,
they're devastatingly high,

00:26:14.868 --> 00:26:17.275
it's all of those things,
but I would add, it's more.

00:26:17.275 --> 00:26:21.297
It's all the extra curriculars, it's
band, it's art, it's music, it's chess,

00:26:21.297 --> 00:26:24.560
it's sports, it's academic
decathlon, it's yearbook,

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:29.099
it's theater, it's model UN, that
all has to be the norm as well.

00:26:29.099 --> 00:26:30.797
Again, when we walk away from that,

00:26:30.797 --> 00:26:32.672
we really, really hurt our children.

00:26:32.672 --> 00:26:34.718
Sal: Yeah, I'd even go a little further,

00:26:34.718 --> 00:26:36.610
but I actually think a lot of that stuff,

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:37.599
even if I think about my own education,

00:26:37.599 --> 00:26:40.318
a lot of my real memories from
middle school and high school

00:26:40.318 --> 00:26:42.541
where I felt I learned the most were
some of the things you just listed,

00:26:42.541 --> 00:26:46.264
and it almost feels like there's
an opportunity to rethink

00:26:46.264 --> 00:26:48.584
can these extra curriculars
become the curricular,

00:26:48.584 --> 00:26:51.192
and that all the course goes
our ways to support that.

00:26:51.192 --> 00:26:54.691
But I 100% agree with that.

00:26:54.691 --> 00:26:59.410
With all of these, we've just
talked about a bunch of really,

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:03.907
I think, powerful ideas, and things
that are the correct direction,

00:27:03.907 --> 00:27:06.995
but where do you see the
federal government in this?

00:27:06.995 --> 00:27:09.828
As the Secretary of
Education, obviously education

00:27:09.828 --> 00:27:11.858
is mainly executed on by the states,

00:27:11.858 --> 00:27:16.803
how do ya'll try to influence what
happens in the right direction?

00:27:16.803 --> 00:27:19.775
Secretary Duncan: So, again,
our goal is to lead the world

00:27:19.775 --> 00:27:22.569
in college graduation rates;
that's the north star.

00:27:22.569 --> 00:27:24.297
That's what the President's
challenged us to do.

00:27:24.297 --> 00:27:26.570
One generation ago, we led the world.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.804
We have flat-lined, we've stagnated.

00:27:28.804 --> 00:27:31.073
About a dozen other
countries have passed us by,

00:27:31.073 --> 00:27:33.212
and I think we're paying a real
price for that as a nation.

00:27:33.212 --> 00:27:35.723
So, for me it's about
investing at every level.

00:27:35.723 --> 00:27:37.893
It's increasing access to
early childhood education.

00:27:37.893 --> 00:27:40.319
You and I haven't talked
about that this morning.

00:27:40.319 --> 00:27:41.907
That's arguably the most
important investment

00:27:41.907 --> 00:27:44.714
we can make is to get our
babies off to a good start;

00:27:44.714 --> 00:27:46.765
let them enter kindergarten
ready to be successful.

00:27:46.765 --> 00:27:50.251
We have to continue to
improve K to 12, drive reform,

00:27:50.251 --> 00:27:53.272
increase graduation rates,
reduce drop-out rates,

00:27:53.272 --> 00:27:56.221
make sure our high school graduates
are truly college and career ready.

00:27:56.221 --> 00:28:00.451
Again, the big pusher making now,
is that some form of higher ed,

00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:02.502
4-year universities,
2-year community colleges,

00:28:02.502 --> 00:28:04.406
trade, technical, vocational training,

00:28:04.406 --> 00:28:07.751
that has to be the goal for
every single young person today.

00:28:07.751 --> 00:28:12.774
How we share best practices, how we
continue to encourage investment,

00:28:12.774 --> 00:28:15.615
how we reward innovation and courage,

00:28:15.615 --> 00:28:17.455
how we think about this comprehensively.

00:28:17.455 --> 00:28:21.169
Again, really birth through
age, whatever, 22, 23, 24,

00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:23.549
and even beyond; adult
learners coming back.

00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:25.436
Community colleges
doing a great job there.

00:28:25.436 --> 00:28:28.140
This, for me, is we're
fighting for our country here;

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.100
we're fighting for our families.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.093
We want to provide as much leadership
as we can and drive this agenda,

00:28:33.093 --> 00:28:36.663
but again, we need great partnership
at the state and local level, as well.

00:28:36.663 --> 00:28:38.868
Sal: Right, and It sounds like
the way that ya'll execute,

00:28:38.868 --> 00:28:41.723
obviously, ya'll have a
soap box, if you will.

00:28:41.723 --> 00:28:44.124
People will listen based on
you can set the direction,

00:28:44.124 --> 00:28:46.883
and on top of that, the Department
of Education goes out there

00:28:46.883 --> 00:28:50.997
and really kind of rewards
districts and states that ya'll feel

00:28:50.997 --> 00:28:52.188
are moving in the right direction.

00:28:52.188 --> 00:28:53.756
Secretary Duncan: And we try
and invest, so historically

00:28:53.756 --> 00:28:56.330
our department didn't invest
in early childhood education,

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:59.527
we thought that was our problem
with Congress' bipartisan support.

00:28:59.527 --> 00:29:02.400
We've invested bout
$600 million to increase

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.898
early childhood opportunities
in states across the country.

00:29:04.898 --> 00:29:09.004
That's a big deal; we would like
to invest dramatically more.

00:29:09.004 --> 00:29:10.969
We want to make sure that
every child has access there.

00:29:10.969 --> 00:29:14.189
We've saved a couple hundred
thousand teacher jobs

00:29:14.189 --> 00:29:17.261
in tough economic times; we're
also driving reform K to 12.

00:29:17.261 --> 00:29:19.443
Then, I said, on the higher ed side,

00:29:19.443 --> 00:29:21.707
one of the things I'm most
proud of was a $40 billion

00:29:21.707 --> 00:29:25.390
increase in Pell Grants, without
going back to tax payers for nickles.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:29.655
We simply stopped subsidizing banks,
put all that money into Pell Grants.

00:29:29.655 --> 00:29:31.945
That was wildly controversial
here in Washington.

00:29:31.945 --> 00:29:33.874
We thought it was common sense.

00:29:33.874 --> 00:29:36.725
We've gone from about 6 million
Pell recipients to 9.6 million.

00:29:36.725 --> 00:29:39.557
But to be really clear, where
we started the conversation,

00:29:39.557 --> 00:29:43.273
I'm very concerned that college
is becoming unaffordable,

00:29:43.273 --> 00:29:46.091
not just in disadvantaged
communities, but for the middle class.

00:29:46.091 --> 00:29:47.851
So, I'm proud of what we've done.

00:29:47.851 --> 00:29:50.950
This is absolutely unfinished business,

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:51.853
and we have to push very, very hard

00:29:51.853 --> 00:29:56.389
so that families have the security of
knowing if their children work hard,

00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:58.724
they will have the chance
to pursue higher ed

00:29:58.724 --> 00:30:00.384
once they graduate from high school.

00:30:00.384 --> 00:30:03.903
Sal: And you did touch on
the early learning, which is,

00:30:03.903 --> 00:30:05.558
I have a 4 year old and a 2 year old,

00:30:05.558 --> 00:30:09.106
and they're in preschool
now, and I personally,

00:30:09.106 --> 00:30:11.749
as a parent, have seen the
value of what's done for them,

00:30:11.749 --> 00:30:14.630
[their] few years before they
go into the formal system.

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:16.950
Why do you think that
hasn't been more universal?

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.084
You know, Florida famously
has early childhood,

00:30:20.084 --> 00:30:21.595
and that, you know, is kind of done

00:30:21.626 --> 00:30:24.227
in a very bipartisan way
under Governor Jeb Bush,

00:30:24.227 --> 00:30:27.427
but why don't we see that
more on a nationwide basis?

00:30:27.427 --> 00:30:28.793
Secretary Duncan: I'll tell you why.

00:30:28.793 --> 00:30:30.579
Because 2 and 3 and 4
year olds, your children,

00:30:30.579 --> 00:30:32.851
don't vote, they don't [hire] lobbyists,

00:30:32.851 --> 00:30:35.175
they don't have pacts, and I think,

00:30:35.175 --> 00:30:37.238
too many politicians are wired to think

00:30:37.238 --> 00:30:39.774
about their next election,
or just the next news cycle.

00:30:39.774 --> 00:30:44.143
Early childhood education is the
ultimate in long-term investments,

00:30:44.143 --> 00:30:48.052
and the dividends we often don't
see for a decade or 2, or 3, or 4.

00:30:48.052 --> 00:30:50.245
But folks who are a lot smarter than me,

00:30:50.245 --> 00:30:52.832
like James Heckman, the
Nobel Prize winning economist

00:30:52.832 --> 00:30:54.320
at the University of
Chicago, has talked about

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.241
a 7 to 1 return on investment;

00:30:56.241 --> 00:30:58.540
that every dollar we
put in early childhood,

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.608
we as a country get back
$7, less teenage pregnancy,

00:31:01.608 --> 00:31:05.309
less crime, less incarceration,
more high school graduates,

00:31:05.309 --> 00:31:08.145
more folks going to college, more
folks going into the workforce,

00:31:08.145 --> 00:31:10.652
paying taxes, being productive citizens.

00:31:10.652 --> 00:31:12.248
But it's a long-term play.

00:31:12.248 --> 00:31:16.697
So, the President has put on
the table a $75 billion proposal

00:31:16.697 --> 00:31:19.388
to dramatically expand
access to high quality,

00:31:19.388 --> 00:31:21.981
early learning opportunities
around the country.

00:31:21.981 --> 00:31:24.880
What's so interesting,
Sal, is at the state level,

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.685
this has absolutely
become a bipartisan issue.

00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:31.329
You see great leadership by republican
and democratic governors who,

00:31:31.329 --> 00:31:35.520
in tough economic times, are choosing
to invest; they are valuing this.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.559
Quite frankly, our struggle now is to get

00:31:37.559 --> 00:31:40.570
more of our republican
friends here in Washington

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:43.755
in the House and Senate to agree this
is the right long-term investment.

00:31:43.755 --> 00:31:46.559
I'm working very hard behind the scenes,

00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:48.441
and I'm hopeful in the
not-too-distant future

00:31:48.441 --> 00:31:51.142
that we'll start to see a couple
of republicans join with us

00:31:51.142 --> 00:31:53.529
to say this is the right
thing for our children,

00:31:53.529 --> 00:31:56.196
for strengthening families,
and ultimately for our country.

00:31:56.196 --> 00:31:58.854
Sal: Right, and going at the
other end of the spectrum,

00:31:58.854 --> 00:32:00.652
where we talk about
college and graduation,

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:02.418
this is where we started our conversation.

00:32:02.418 --> 00:32:04.139
The one thing that I hear a lot about is,

00:32:04.139 --> 00:32:07.913
I hear this even from, sometimes
I talk, we partner with schools,

00:32:07.913 --> 00:32:09.760
and they're like, "Hey, a lot
of our kids go to college."

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.749
then people, "Well, they should
be graduating from college,"

00:32:11.749 --> 00:32:13.483
and we've talked about that today,

00:32:13.483 --> 00:32:15.816
but it seems like even that
really isn't the real angle.

00:32:15.816 --> 00:32:19.233
The real angle is are they being
productive and happy citizens,

00:32:19.233 --> 00:32:24.113
and is some of what ya'll are talking
about also along that dimension,

00:32:24.113 --> 00:32:25.278
it's not just, you
know, because obviously,

00:32:25.278 --> 00:32:27.155
a college can graduate
everyone if it wants to,

00:32:27.155 --> 00:32:28.868
it can lower its standards.

00:32:28.868 --> 00:32:30.718
It's kind of what we talked about at
the state level with the standards,

00:32:30.718 --> 00:32:34.201
how do you just make sure that it
doesn't happen, just window dressing?

00:32:34.201 --> 00:32:36.236
Secretary Duncan: We
have to be very, again,

00:32:36.236 --> 00:32:38.065
thoughtful and comprehensive;
and we're going to to go out

00:32:38.065 --> 00:32:41.279
and travel the country and talk to
college presidents and faculty members,

00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:44.759
again, and students themselves
and parents, and employers,

00:32:44.759 --> 00:32:47.523
and get a sense of this, but
I think your bigger thing,

00:32:47.523 --> 00:32:49.141
any time we're dumbing down standards,

00:32:49.141 --> 00:32:51.506
whether it's higher ed, or
K to 12, early childhood,

00:32:51.506 --> 00:32:53.052
any time we dummy down standards,

00:32:53.052 --> 00:32:55.725
we're just doing a great disservice
to the folks we claim we're serving.

00:32:55.725 --> 00:32:57.650
So, that's non-starter to begin with.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.704
How do you make sure you have a high bar?

00:32:59.704 --> 00:33:02.525
How do you make sure students
are engaged civically,

00:33:02.525 --> 00:33:05.339
sort of in a participatory democracy?

00:33:05.339 --> 00:33:08.410
How they're thinking about
giving back to the community?

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:11.566
What they're doing after
college graduation rates?

00:33:11.566 --> 00:33:13.546
Yes, we need more STEM majors.

00:33:13.546 --> 00:33:14.871
Yes, we need more computer science.

00:33:14.871 --> 00:33:17.356
I was a very happy sociology major;

00:33:17.356 --> 00:33:19.949
and we want, again, just let
people pursue their dreams,

00:33:19.949 --> 00:33:22.343
whatever it might be, liberal
arts, it doesn't matter.

00:33:22.343 --> 00:33:26.830
But we want them being in a position
to be successful once they graduate.

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:29.804
That, for me, is what we have
to be looking at, so long-term.

00:33:29.804 --> 00:33:32.042
For me, it's not about salaries,
it's not about whatever.

00:33:32.042 --> 00:33:34.231
Obviously, folks who go into education

00:33:34.231 --> 00:33:35.852
don't do that to make $1,000,000,

00:33:35.852 --> 00:33:37.409
they do it to make a difference.

00:33:37.409 --> 00:33:40.024
But I want them going into education
prepared to be a great educator,

00:33:40.024 --> 00:33:41.806
and if they can do that and be successful,

00:33:41.806 --> 00:33:43.642
then I feel good about that.

00:33:43.642 --> 00:33:46.230
If folks are unprepared
for the world of work,

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:50.287
whatever their dreams are, that's when
we have to challenge the status quo.

00:33:50.287 --> 00:33:51.812
Sal: I completely agree.

00:33:51.812 --> 00:33:54.637
If we have time, really
just for one final question,

00:33:54.637 --> 00:33:56.422
so I'll make it a big picture question.

00:33:56.422 --> 00:33:58.384
We're talking about a lot of things.

00:33:58.384 --> 00:34:00.340
There are a lot of
exciting things going on,

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:03.531
there's technology, there's access.

00:34:03.531 --> 00:34:06.797
Where you do think this is going to
go if we just dream a little bit?

00:34:06.797 --> 00:34:09.910
If we look at the system 10 years
from now, 20 years from now,

00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:12.142
is it going to look like
the system we have now?

00:34:12.142 --> 00:34:13.772
Secretary Duncan: Quite frankly, I hope

00:34:13.772 --> 00:34:17.968
it looks very different from the system
today (laughs), that we have today.

00:34:17.968 --> 00:34:20.356
Because I just think we're not doing
enough, quite frankly, as a nation.

00:34:20.356 --> 00:34:24.548
So, my hope, not even 10
years out, but 5 years out,

00:34:24.548 --> 00:34:26.385
I'm impatient here, I don't want to wait.

00:34:26.385 --> 00:34:33.533
I would love to see twice as many children
have access to high quality pre-K.

00:34:33.533 --> 00:34:36.506
So, dramatically expand access there.

00:34:36.506 --> 00:34:40.068
I would like to see almost
no classrooms of kids

00:34:40.068 --> 00:34:42.688
sitting in rows of 25
and 30, and I want to see

00:34:42.688 --> 00:34:46.186
students having a chance to learn
individually and work in small groups.

00:34:46.186 --> 00:34:49.763
Again, using technology, moving
from seat time to competency.

00:34:49.763 --> 00:34:54.430
That has to happen. I want
to see graduation rates.

00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:56.371
They're actually at a 3 decade high,

00:34:56.371 --> 00:34:58.417
which is encouraging, but we
still have a long way to go.

00:34:58.417 --> 00:35:01.597
Graduation has to be the bare minimum.

00:35:01.597 --> 00:35:03.141
If you drop out of high school today,

00:35:03.141 --> 00:35:04.959
you're basically condemned to
poverty and social failure,

00:35:04.959 --> 00:35:08.163
so we have to get those drop-out
rates down to 0 as fast as we can.

00:35:08.163 --> 00:35:10.564
Then, ultimately, again,
high school graduates

00:35:10.564 --> 00:35:11.910
have to be college and career ready,

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:14.640
but college has to be much
more accessible and affordable.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.723
So, if we can really drive
down the cost of college,

00:35:17.723 --> 00:35:22.032
not just a couple percent, but
significantly so that that dream,

00:35:22.032 --> 00:35:25.647
that aspiration, becomes a reality;
families have that security.

00:35:25.647 --> 00:35:28.705
It is clearly an ambitious agenda,

00:35:28.705 --> 00:35:32.664
but I frankly think we have to move
on all those fronts simultaneously,

00:35:32.664 --> 00:35:35.093
and move as fast as we
can, and move, again,

00:35:35.093 --> 00:35:38.225
regardless of politics or ideology,
I could care less in that,

00:35:38.225 --> 00:35:39.725
we just want to help our country,

00:35:39.725 --> 00:35:41.255
want to help our young people,

00:35:41.255 --> 00:35:42.633
we want to strengthen our families.

00:35:42.633 --> 00:35:44.456
We should be able to
work together on this.

00:35:44.456 --> 00:35:46.663
This is our national mission.

00:35:46.663 --> 00:35:49.714
Sal: That was a, completley agree.

00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:52.054
Thank you, Secretary Duncan.

00:35:52.054 --> 00:35:54.723
This was a real honor to be able
to chat with you this morning.

00:35:54.723 --> 00:35:55.792
Secretary Duncan: You're
doing a great job.

00:35:55.792 --> 00:35:59.968
You're going to be the next Oprah
when you're done with Khan Academy.

00:35:59.968 --> 00:36:01.539
Thanks for the opportunity,
and thanks again,

00:36:01.539 --> 00:36:03.606
your tremendous leadership, I'm a big fan.

00:36:03.606 --> 00:36:05.697
Sal: Thank you.
