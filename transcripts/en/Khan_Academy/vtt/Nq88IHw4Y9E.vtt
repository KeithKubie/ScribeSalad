00:00:00.248 --> 00:00:01.601
- [Voiceover] So, let's do some practice problems

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:03.982
on Khan Academy exercises that make us

00:00:03.982 --> 00:00:05.782
rewrite an addition problem so that we

00:00:05.782 --> 00:00:07.459
can get them to rounder numbers.

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:12.376
Numbers that might be multiples of 10, or multiples of 100.

00:00:12.377 --> 00:00:15.993
So, let's see here, I have 63 plus 427,

00:00:15.993 --> 00:00:18.628
and that seems kind of hairy, you know,

00:00:18.628 --> 00:00:20.555
it feels like I wanna write those things down,

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:22.866
but maybe I could take away from one of them,

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.433
and give it to the other one so that they both

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:26.348
become round numbers, and it's clear

00:00:26.348 --> 00:00:29.970
that 63, if I were to give three away I would get to 60,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.732
and if I were to give those three to 427,

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:35.913
it would get to 430, and 60 plus 430

00:00:35.914 --> 00:00:37.551
is a much simpler problem.

00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:39.292
So, let's think about what this question is saying.

00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:41.928
Well, it's just taking a step by step through that process.

00:00:41.928 --> 00:00:45.885
It's just saying 63 plus 427 is going to be equal

00:00:45.886 --> 00:00:49.810
to 60 plus what plus 427?

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.586
So, the 60 plus what, this is gonna

00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:53.838
to be the same thing as 63, cause we have

00:00:53.838 --> 00:00:58.749
427 in both places, so 63 is 60 plus three.

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:00.119
Well, that makes sense.

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:02.267
On this next step, they just change the order.

00:01:02.267 --> 00:01:05.366
60 plus three, and then adding 427

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.366
is the same thing as doing 60 plus,

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:11.131
and then adding the three to the 427 first.

00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:12.374
So, we're just taking this three

00:01:12.374 --> 00:01:15.752
and moving it from the 63 to the 427.

00:01:15.752 --> 00:01:20.232
Well, three plus 427, that's just 430.

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:22.450
And now this addition problem became a lot simpler.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.109
60 plus 430, we can do that in our head.

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.291
We're just adding six 10's to this, right over here,

00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:31.470
so it's gonna be 490, and we're done.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.233
Let's do a couple more examples of this.

00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:38.192
So, over here, we want to, let's see,

00:01:38.192 --> 00:01:40.189
we want to add these two numbers,

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.567
and let's maybe see if we can 'em

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:44.585
a little bit a rounder number.

00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:46.128
So, over here, we're breaking up

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:50.640
the 275 into 270 and something.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.884
Well, that's gonna be 270 plus five.

00:01:52.885 --> 00:01:54.243
Notice, the rest is still the same,

00:01:54.243 --> 00:01:57.551
plus 595, plus 595.

00:01:57.552 --> 00:01:59.433
Now, why are we doing that?

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:03.124
Well, if we take five from 275 and give it to 595,

00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:04.880
which is what we're doing here,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.829
the 595 can get to 600.

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.229
It's gonna make the calculation easier.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.485
So, once again, here we're adding

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:13.271
the 270 and the five first, and then we're adding the 595,

00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:15.220
but we could change the order in which we do it.

00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:18.880
We could add the five to the 595 first,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.470
and then add the 270.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.826
So, this is the same thing as 270 plus,

00:02:21.826 --> 00:02:24.311
five plus 595 is 600, that's the whole reason

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:27.608
why we took five from the 275 is so

00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:30.800
that we can add it to the 595 and get 600,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.949
and now we can do this in our head.

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.805
270 plus six 100's, well we're just gonna increase

00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:39.201
our 100's by six, so it's gonna be 870.

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:42.602
Let's do a couple of more examples here.

00:02:42.603 --> 00:02:43.799
Fill in the blank.

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.802
51 plus 83 is the same thing as blank plus 84.

00:02:48.802 --> 00:02:51.959
Well, they increased 83 by one to 84,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.590
so we gotta decrease 51 by one.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.519
So, this is gonna be the same thing as 50 plus 84.

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.469
Now, why would anyone care about this?

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:01.688
Why would they do that?

00:03:01.688 --> 00:03:03.696
Well, I find this easier to calculate,

00:03:03.696 --> 00:03:04.927
because now I just have to say

00:03:04.927 --> 00:03:08.688
eight 10's plus four ones, plus another five 10's.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:12.762
Well, that's gonna be 13 10's and four ones, or 134.

00:03:12.763 --> 00:03:14.922
So, I find this a little bit easier,

00:03:14.922 --> 00:03:17.325
but the important thing is if we add to one number,

00:03:17.325 --> 00:03:19.369
we gotta take away the same amount from the other number

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.330
in order to not change the value

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.312
of this addition problem, of this expression.

00:03:25.312 --> 00:03:27.700
Let's do one more.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.692
138 plus 710 is the same as blank plus 700.

00:03:32.693 --> 00:03:35.559
So, we had 710, and it's now 700.

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:37.916
So, we took 10 away from that number,

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:39.738
so we have to give it to the other number.

00:03:39.738 --> 00:03:42.745
So, 138, we have to add 10 to that,

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:45.380
so that's gonna be 148.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.785
Now, why was that useful?

00:03:46.785 --> 00:03:49.454
Well, 148 plus 700, you can do that in your head.

00:03:49.455 --> 00:03:53.420
That's gonna be 848, and that's easier to compute

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.765
than what we just had over here.
