00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.800
Hey, guys I'm Nate, welcome back to the workshop we've got another little weapon we're Gonna build, today made out of office supplies

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.279
Today's little weapon is a slingshot made from pencils and binder clips with a

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.990
Little bit of tape a rubber band and the lid, from a water bottle. there's lots of options for ammunition but

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.529
We're gonna be going with miniature marshmallows

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.669
because they are very good at not breaking things and not hurting people. To start let's get two of our pencils and four of our

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.200
Small binder clips. First, let's take one of our little binder clips and attach it onto, each pencil about 3/4 of the way down

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.089
Then, we want to take our two binder clips and have them, face each other so that the swing arms overlap. With

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.930
Another binder clip fit it over two of the swing arms on one side.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.939
Flip it over and use the fourth binder clip to bind the other two swing arms going

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.860
from the top rather than the bottom. These binder, clips will hold the pencils at a fixed width apart

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.889
From each other so they, won't move in and out as, we use them as a slingshot.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.660
however, we do now

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.619
want to pinch the bottoms of the pencils down together so they meet at a point

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.379
Now let's use a small piece of tape wrapped around the bottom of the pencils so the tops of the pencils won't push back together

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.380
as we use our slingshot.

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.279
Let's set this assembly aside for a moment and grab the lid to the water bottle.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.530
We won't need, the rest of the bottle for this project. Now using a razor blade or small knife, we want to cut

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.669
two slits into the side of our bottle lid, one right about here and the other one directly across from it.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.970
Now we need to grab one of our rubber bands and this is going to work a lot

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.389
better if we have one of the wider type of rubber band cut

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.349
the rubber band in one spot so you just have a rubber strip. We now

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.930
want to thread our over band through these two slots that we've cut

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.499
in the lid but because, we don't, want the rubber, band to be interfering with our ammunition,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.110
we want the rubber band to go in on one side wrap around behind the back of the lid

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.169
and then in to the other side. If you need to adjust the rubber band so that it's equal lengths on both sides.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.320
This lid is going to be the cup that holds our marshmallow

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.910
ammunition for our slingshot. Now we need to attach it to our slingshot frame that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.369
We already have built. Let's grab two more binder clips and use those to hold it in place. We can

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.459
wrap the rubber band around a little bit of a pencil just below

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.099
the metal collar, and then use another binder clip, to secure that in place. We do the same thing on the other side.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.079
With those binder clips holding the rubber bands in place, we should have a functional slingshot. Let's give it a try with a mini marshmallow.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.060
Not bad.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.060
But I think we need something to shoot it at as well. We don't just want to be shooting these around willy-nilly. Well maybe

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.190
We do. We can shoot people like our cameraman, or whoever else happens to be in the room. But, it can

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.200
also be a lot of fun to set up a little target, so let's look at how to build a little target for ourselves. We're

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.360
gonna be using a lot of the same supplies we've got a lot

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.080
more pencils, we've got a little bit more tape, and we have some of this foam core board.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.570
We printed out the king of random logo, now we'll cut this out, attach it to a piece of our foam core

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.570
board, and cut it out there.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.988
Let's grab six more of our pencils and a little more of our tape to build

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.899
A stand that can hold up our king of random target. We'll start by making two supports in sort of an A-frame shape.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.029
Let's use one of our pencils to connect these two A-frames together.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.400
Our frame is looking pretty good, it holds itself up nicely, it's just held together with

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.370
a few strips of tape, you also may notice that all of these pencils currently have their points angled up, which means that

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.329
we have four erasers down on the table. That gives a nice little bit of stability.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.449
But it still has a little bit of sideways play, so let's take our last pencil and use that as a structural support

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.790
down closer to the bottom. Our little stand is now pretty strong, and stays in place fairly

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.980
well, of course if you wanted to you could always, add even more supports. Our pack of pencils came in a

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.030
group of twelve I think for about a dollar.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.690
And so if I wanted I could put more supports on the side, another cross piece right here, there's all sorts of options.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.770
But I think for now,

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.469
We have a stand that's gonna hold up pretty well. We now

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.470
want to take one more of our binder clips and clip

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.900
it sideways right in the middle of our top cross piece. This is going to be our hinge mechanism for our target.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.489
We should be able to balance this swing arm in just the right spot so that when we hit our target it falls down

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.070
and we have a clear indication of whether or not

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.559
we hit. Let's grab a final piece of tape and use it to attach our swing arm on to our target triangle.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.900
We now have a target that

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.530
we can lift up into place and with just a gentle tap, it falls all the way down. So even a marshmallow

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.739
launched out of our slingshot should be able to activate it. Let's give a shot.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.950
Ha. Shot. Give it a shot. Aw man.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.919
As always, I'm a very good shot with these things

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.070
Ha! Second try! Not bad. That does happen perfectly, marshmallow hit it,

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.449
Ponk! Falls right down. It works great. Let's do it again.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.150
Ha!

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.710
Perfect shot!

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:42.390
Yeah, just, it touches it, doesn't matter if it hits it very hard or not, although that was a pretty solid hit, just falls right

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:48.299
back down, and it goes down easily enough that the rest of the stand doesn't move from the impact. it works really

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:55.590
well. With just a few pencils, binder clips, and some tape we've made a functional slingshot and a reusable carnival-style target.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.620
