[UPBEAT MUSIC]

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.530
MIG GERARD: I am here in Jakarta
to teach the machine learning

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.072
crash course.

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:08.155
DANIEL SPARING: So today
we talked about all kinds

00:00:08.155 --> 00:00:11.080
of products we offer on Google
Cloud that help our customers

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.409
and our partners build
machine learning models.

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:14.700
MAYANK GARG: Really super cool.

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.600
MIG GERARD: One of the
other wonderful highlights

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.760
of teaching machine
learning is learning

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.680
about all of the
different products

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.339
that different people want to
use the machine learning for.

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:47.880
And those products
are so disparate--

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.480
so many different ways
to use machine learning.

00:00:53.102 --> 00:00:55.310
MUHAMMAD GHEDDI: Do
lots of awesome stuff,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.440
from predicting car accidents,
preventing cancer, as well

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.580
as self-driving cars.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.090
I joined this bootcamp because
I see that we are still not

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.970
that good at early detection
of serious diseases.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.537
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:53.537 --> 00:01:55.370
MIG GERARD: Some of the
wonderful highlights

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.030
of any time I go to teach, but
certainly this week while I've

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.500
been teaching, are to see
the students themselves.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.415
You can see the looks on their
faces when they're confused,

00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:06.040
and you can come and
you can help them,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.081
and you can see the learning
go on in their head.

00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:09.530
And their faces are transformed.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.550
DANIEL SPARING: I really enjoyed
working with the participants

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.550
on the Cloud AutoML, which is
a brand new product from Google

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.670
Cloud that allows you
to build your own models

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.050
on your own data sets
without writing any code.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.610
I hope that they
will enjoy today

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.590
and they will be able
to use these tools later

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.923
in their work and their hobbies.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.580
MUHAMMAD GHEDDI: I expect that
this program will continue,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.420
and there will be more
students involved,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.940
like not just professionals
can attend this event,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.885
but also students.

00:02:58.424 --> 00:02:59.840
MAYANK GARG: The
major thing which

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.890
I want the audience to
take away from this course

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.860
is go back and practice
as much as you can,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.520
as you did in the class,
on the codelabs, on Kaggle,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.460
or whatever program
you can find,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.615
be it in your company or
a company [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:15.615 --> 00:03:16.490
SPEAKER 1: Thank you!

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.090
SPEAKER 2: Thank you!

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.990
SPEAKER 3: Yay!

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.340
[APPLAUSE]
