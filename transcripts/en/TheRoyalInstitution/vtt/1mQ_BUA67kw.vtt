00:00:07.728 --> 00:00:14.660
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.520
I work in research, helping to
develop the next generation of

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.215
diesel engines.

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:21.600
We will follow these down
the production line.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.832
They'll burn less fuel, produce
fewer emissions, and

00:00:24.832 --> 00:00:28.120
have greater power densities,
just as these did for their

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.230
predecessors.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.670
But research and development
doesn't happen in isolation.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.452
Anything we develop in the test
lab has to be something

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.995
we can build down the production
line here.

00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:40.480
Let me give you an example
of how technology and

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.730
manufacturing move together.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.130
Within the engine, you can just
about see the top of six

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.472
injectors, one for
each cylinder--

00:00:53.472 --> 00:00:55.265
much like this.

00:00:55.265 --> 00:01:00.030
The fuel enters the injector
here at about 200 megapascals.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.710
That's about the same pressure
as 5,000 two tonne elephants

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.040
standing on top of you.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.820
It's then actuated on the
solenoid up here, which allows

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.620
the fuel to enter the cylinder
through six holes, which are

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.870
really tiny-- about the
size of a human hair.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.370
This combined with the high
pressure means the fuel enters

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.630
the cylinder as a really
fine mist.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.050
This means the fuel burns more
efficiently, and therefore, we

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.240
produce less emissions.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.440
But with the small hole and high
pressures, there's really

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.650
tight tolerances within the
injector, so the fuel entering

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.936
it has to be free of debris.

00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:38.100
Which, on the final engine,
isn't an issue, as we have a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.990
system of filters
to remove it.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.846
But first, we have to
build the engine.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.406
We're getting ready to go
into the clean room.

00:01:56.406 --> 00:01:59.755
Not something you'd expect to
find in a diesel engine

00:01:59.755 --> 00:02:02.020
factory, but this facility
is crucial.

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:13.440
This room is pressurised such
that there is no flow of air

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.110
from the outside other
than through the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.555
filtration and scrubbers.

00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:20.390
They ensure that there is no
more than 30,000 particles

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.960
above five micron per
cubic metre of air.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.780
That may sound like a lot, but
an office environment has up

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.995
to 35 million.

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:32.050
So in here, we can as
confidently assemble the fuel

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.317
system knowing we're not
introducing any contaminants.

00:02:36.317 --> 00:02:37.690
The point to this?

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.290
To design efficient engines,
we need new technology.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.530
But there's no point if
we can't build it.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.700
This clean room is a good
example of how a manufacturing

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.225
facility is allowing us to make
better design decisions.
