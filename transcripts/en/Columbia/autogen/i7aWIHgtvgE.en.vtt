rhymes the first you don't answer to the
 

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.750
rhymes the first you don't answer to the
of course to the question again if

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760
of course to the question again if
 

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.340
of course to the question again if
military nuclearization of your arm or

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:12.350
military nuclearization of your arm or
 

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:15.490
military nuclearization of your arm or
even as I said reality or the potential

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:15.500
even as I said reality or the potential
 

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.640

threat as I've said first each will eat

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:18.650
threat as I've said first each will eat

food it will lead a lot of countries to

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600
food it will lead a lot of countries to
 

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.710
food it will lead a lot of countries to
follow the path in any case in the case

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:23.720
follow the path in any case in the case
 

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.470
follow the path in any case in the case
of Israel decay there is a question mark

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480
of Israel decay there is a question mark
 

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.890
of Israel decay there is a question mark
of well why not to have a deterrence

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:28.900
of well why not to have a deterrence
 

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.660
of well why not to have a deterrence
which means to go by that the NPT is

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:31.670
which means to go by that the NPT is
 

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.170
which means to go by that the NPT is

deserves some consideration after that

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:37.130
deserves some consideration after that
 

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:38.560
deserves some consideration after that
you have the case of Israel you could

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:38.570
you have the case of Israel you could
 

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.470
you have the case of Israel you could
consider that why not a deterrence

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:41.480
consider that why not a deterrence
 

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.450
consider that why not a deterrence
simply a balance of deterrence between a

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:43.460
simply a balance of deterrence between a
 

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.760
simply a balance of deterrence between a
nuclear design we can suppose that it's

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:45.770
nuclear design we can suppose that it's
 

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:49.450
nuclear design we can suppose that it's
a nuclear power and a Iran if Iran

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:49.460
a nuclear power and a Iran if Iran
 

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.090
a nuclear power and a Iran if Iran
becomes a nuclear nuclear power the

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:52.100
becomes a nuclear nuclear power the
 

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.150
becomes a nuclear nuclear power the
prime of deterrence again and is based

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:55.160
prime of deterrence again and is based
 

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.940
prime of deterrence again and is based
on the assumption by the leadership of

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:57.950
on the assumption by the leadership of

if you don't say that you want to
 

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.860
if you don't say that you want to

it's feeling so it's fitting some gut

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:34.970
it's feeling so it's fitting some gut
 

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:38.320
it's feeling so it's fitting some gut
feeling among the among the asylums so I

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:38.330
feeling among the among the asylums so I
 

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:43.139
feeling among the among the asylums so I
simply said that the question ears

00:25:43.139 --> 00:25:43.149
simply said that the question ears
 

00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:46.560
simply said that the question ears
on these bases will the Israelis accept

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:46.570
on these bases will the Israelis accept
 

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:48.419
on these bases will the Israelis accept
the logic of deterrence with with this

00:25:48.419 --> 00:25:48.429
the logic of deterrence with with this
 

00:25:48.429 --> 00:25:51.180
the logic of deterrence with with this
leadership and I think it's a big I

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:51.190
leadership and I think it's a big I
 

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:52.829
leadership and I think it's a big I
guess it's a big question mark I don't

00:25:52.829 --> 00:25:52.839
guess it's a big question mark I don't
 

00:25:52.839 --> 00:25:54.539
guess it's a big question mark I don't
have the answer but i think it's a it's

00:25:54.539 --> 00:25:54.549
have the answer but i think it's a it's
 

00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:56.999
have the answer but i think it's a it's
a big question mark you know really it's

00:25:56.999 --> 00:25:57.009
a big question mark you know really it's
 

00:25:57.009 --> 00:25:59.810
a big question mark you know really it's
a because what you were referring to the

00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820
a because what you were referring to the
 

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.849
a because what you were referring to the
public discourse the prime is also the

00:26:02.849 --> 00:26:02.859
public discourse the prime is also the
 

00:26:02.859 --> 00:26:04.799
public discourse the prime is also the
nuclear deterrence and it's very

00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:04.809
nuclear deterrence and it's very
 

00:26:04.809 --> 00:26:06.149
nuclear deterrence and it's very
difficult to understand but it's really

00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159
difficult to understand but it's really
 

00:26:06.159 --> 00:26:08.789
difficult to understand but it's really
managed by him sense by by the

00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799
managed by him sense by by the
 

00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:12.419
managed by him sense by by the
leadership and it's a sort of eye to eye

00:26:12.419 --> 00:26:12.429
leadership and it's a sort of eye to eye
 

00:26:12.429 --> 00:26:15.690
leadership and it's a sort of eye to eye
face to face reality between the Soviet

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:15.700
face to face reality between the Soviet
 

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.759
face to face reality between the Soviet
and the Americans it was the case and in

00:26:17.759 --> 00:26:17.769
and the Americans it was the case and in
 

00:26:17.769 --> 00:26:20.639
and the Americans it was the case and in
a sense never the other side as as

00:26:20.639 --> 00:26:20.649
a sense never the other side as as

total destruction of its own country so

00:26:28.969 --> 00:26:28.979
total destruction of its own country so
 

00:26:28.979 --> 00:26:31.440
total destruction of its own country so
will it be possible to have the same

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:31.450
will it be possible to have the same
 

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.769
will it be possible to have the same
balance between between Israel and Iran

00:26:34.769 --> 00:26:34.779
balance between between Israel and Iran
 

00:26:34.779 --> 00:26:37.109
balance between between Israel and Iran
I don't have the answer by definition

00:26:37.109 --> 00:26:37.119
I don't have the answer by definition
 

00:26:37.119 --> 00:26:41.579
I don't have the answer by definition
really simply I again I I've lived in

00:26:41.579 --> 00:26:41.589
really simply I again I I've lived in

really simply I again I I've lived in
instyle six years of my life I my doubt

instyle six years of my life I my doubt
 

00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:48.469
instyle six years of my life I my doubt
that the Israelis we take the risk but

00:26:48.469 --> 00:26:48.479
that the Israelis we take the risk but
 

00:26:48.479 --> 00:26:51.149
that the Israelis we take the risk but
that's that's an open question that I

00:26:51.149 --> 00:26:51.159
that's that's an open question that I
 

00:26:51.159 --> 00:26:53.279
that's that's an open question that I
think that's opinion that everybody can

think that's opinion that everybody can
 

00:26:53.289 --> 00:26:56.669
think that's opinion that everybody can
have is own opinion a country which

which the second question a country
which has a nuclear deterrent in a sense

00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039
which has a nuclear deterrent in a sense
 

00:27:03.039 --> 00:27:05.009
which has a nuclear deterrent in a sense
nuclear deterrence being either you have

00:27:05.009 --> 00:27:05.019
nuclear deterrence being either you have
 

00:27:05.019 --> 00:27:07.529
nuclear deterrence being either you have
the bomb or or you are close to the

threshold of the bomb or you are
suspected to have the bomb in a sense

00:27:11.789 --> 00:27:11.799
suspected to have the bomb in a sense
 

00:27:11.799 --> 00:27:15.149

feels protected you know really feels

00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:15.159
feels protected you know really feels
 

00:27:15.159 --> 00:27:18.989
feels protected you know really feels
protected and it leads to a real

00:27:18.989 --> 00:27:18.999
protected and it leads to a real
 

00:27:18.999 --> 00:27:22.589
protected and it leads to a real
imbalance in the security in the

imbalance in the security in the
 

00:27:22.599 --> 00:27:24.389

security in the part of the world you
 

00:27:24.399 --> 00:27:26.729
security in the part of the world you
know really you have a country suddenly

00:27:26.729 --> 00:27:26.739
know really you have a country suddenly
 

00:27:26.739 --> 00:27:29.399

in in in the Gulf countries where

in in in the Gulf countries where
 

00:27:29.409 --> 00:27:31.649
in in in the Gulf countries where
already you have a powerful country of

already you have a powerful country of
 

00:27:31.659 --> 00:27:34.289
already you have a powerful country of
70 millions of inhabitants in front of

Earth countries which are less populous
there is already a sort of

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:40.770
there is already a sort of
 

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.730
there is already a sort of
question which is there about the

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:43.740
question which is there about the
 

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.510
question which is there about the
security you know and when introducing

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520
security you know and when introducing
 

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.980
security you know and when introducing
the nuclear deterrence factor it

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:50.990
the nuclear deterrence factor it
 

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:55.190
the nuclear deterrence factor it
increases this this ? especially because

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200
increases this this ? especially because
 

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.010
increases this this ? especially because
you can deterrence is also deterrents

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.020
you can deterrence is also deterrents
 

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.870
you can deterrence is also deterrents
nuclear deterrence is also active

00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880
nuclear deterrence is also active
 

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.570
nuclear deterrence is also active
against conventional it's a way of

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:02.580
against conventional it's a way of
 

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.150
against conventional it's a way of
balancing the conventional superiority

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:05.160
balancing the conventional superiority
 

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.030
balancing the conventional superiority
of your adversary so it means that with

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:08.040
of your adversary so it means that with
 

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.090
of your adversary so it means that with
nuclear deterrence the country can deter

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100
nuclear deterrence the country can deter
 

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.150
nuclear deterrence the country can deter
from instance the US you know they can

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:14.160
from instance the US you know they can
 

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.010
from instance the US you know they can
share the u.s. from intervening in

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:16.020
share the u.s. from intervening in
 

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.800
share the u.s. from intervening in
conventional conventional terms because

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:18.810
conventional conventional terms because
 

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.640
conventional conventional terms because
the risk would be will be so so so be I

I was we were discussing it in this in

the stairs I give the example of of

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880
the stairs I give the example of of
 

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.470
the stairs I give the example of of
India Pakistan in a really Pakistan

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480
India Pakistan in a really Pakistan
 

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.000

the convention of superiority of India
 

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.320
the convention of superiority of India
you know because India was obviously

countries so again it's a veteran sister

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:55.560
countries so again it's a veteran sister
 

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.520
countries so again it's a veteran sister
logic which is apparently logic you can

00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:58.530
logic which is apparently logic you can

fragile which is based on assumptions on
 

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.390
fragile which is based on assumptions on
both sides and the question is that

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:08.400
both sides and the question is that
 

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.130
both sides and the question is that
these assumptions are the result of

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.140
these assumptions are the result of
 

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:16.340
these assumptions are the result of
years and years of discussions of face

have the answer again is will it be

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240
have the answer again is will it be
 

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.120
have the answer again is will it be
possible to have this logic of

because there is this question of
enrichment Iran is enriching uranium and

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:27.850
enrichment Iran is enriching uranium and
 

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:30.570
enrichment Iran is enriching uranium and
nobody knows what what is the use of

nobody knows what what is the use of
 

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.580
nobody knows what what is the use of
this enrich uranium since Iran doesn't

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:32.590
this enrich uranium since Iran doesn't
 

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:36.180
this enrich uranium since Iran doesn't
have nuclear power plant it's like if

doesn't make a lot of sense in in
 

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:46.230
doesn't make a lot of sense in in
financial and in technical terms as for

the measures which could be taken again

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:48.700
the measures which could be taken again
 

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.130
the measures which could be taken again
that would be the result of a

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:50.140
that would be the result of a
 

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.490
that would be the result of a
negotiation let's discuss with our

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:52.500
negotiation let's discuss with our
 

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.760

let's open the negotiation I can't tell
 

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.890
let's open the negotiation I can't tell
I can say what would be the result of

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:01.900
I can say what would be the result of
 

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.050
I can say what would be the result of
the negotiation I guess that on one side

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:04.060
the negotiation I guess that on one side
 

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.840
the negotiation I guess that on one side
people will ask some very strong

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:06.850
people will ask some very strong
 

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:09.300
people will ask some very strong
measures on the other side there will be

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:09.310
measures on the other side there will be
 

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:10.860
measures on the other side there will be
reluctance and at the end of the day

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:10.870
reluctance and at the end of the day
 

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.690
reluctance and at the end of the day
there will be a compromise and we will

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:12.700
there will be a compromise and we will
 

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:17.220
there will be a compromise and we will
again as I've said we want to discuss we

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:17.230
again as I've said we want to discuss we
 

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.780
again as I've said we want to discuss we
want to discuss what could be these

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:18.790
want to discuss what could be these
 

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:20.940
want to discuss what could be these
measures of course their ideas floating

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:20.950
measures of course their ideas floating
 

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:23.310
measures of course their ideas floating
around in terms for instance the

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:23.320
around in terms for instance the
 

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.620
around in terms for instance the
Additional Protocol order because it's

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:25.630
Additional Protocol order because it's
 

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:27.210
Additional Protocol order because it's
very technical so there is the

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:27.220
very technical so there is the
 

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.980
very technical so there is the

has been suspended by the
 

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.940
has been suspended by the
iranian parliament so we would want to

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:36.950
iranian parliament so we would want to
 

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:40.450
iranian parliament so we would want to
as it restored and implement it you can

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:40.460
as it restored and implement it you can
 

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:44.440
as it restored and implement it you can
also discuss specific measures of

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:44.450
also discuss specific measures of
 

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.200
also discuss specific measures of
monitoring off of control you know there

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:47.210
monitoring off of control you know there
 

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:52.360
monitoring off of control you know there
is there is a I think place there is

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:52.370
is there is a I think place there is

the fact that the Russians and the
 

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.540
the fact that the Russians and the
Chinese I think went to Tehran as you

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:01.550
Chinese I think went to Tehran as you
 

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:03.550

can guess that we are ready to find a

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:03.560
can guess that we are ready to find a
 

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.620
can guess that we are ready to find a
compromise in the sense as I've said are

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:05.630
compromise in the sense as I've said are
 

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:09.160
compromise in the sense as I've said are
nuances among the six it's not it's not

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:09.170
nuances among the six it's not it's not
 

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:12.040
nuances among the six it's not it's not
a mystery and you can guess where we're

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:12.050
a mystery and you can guess where we're
 

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.530
a mystery and you can guess where we're
more less on the range of positions

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:14.540
more less on the range of positions
 

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.040
more less on the range of positions
where hard where are the six and

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:17.050
where hard where are the six and
 

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.000
where hard where are the six and
actually the Russians of the Chinese

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:19.010
actually the Russians of the Chinese
 

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:22.960
actually the Russians of the Chinese
again they didn't reach any result on

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:22.970
again they didn't reach any result on
 

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:26.260
again they didn't reach any result on
these only cos on this you know so

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:26.270
these only cos on this you know so
 

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:29.740
these only cos on this you know so
that's I guess good evidence that first

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:29.750
that's I guess good evidence that first
 

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.480
that's I guess good evidence that first
there is a sense of compromise on our

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:31.490
there is a sense of compromise on our
 

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:35.680
there is a sense of compromise on our

and it's it's not either reading in the
 

00:45:56.599 --> 00:45:59.440
and it's it's not either reading in the
crystal ball and as I've said there is

00:45:59.440 --> 00:45:59.450
crystal ball and as I've said there is
 

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:01.480
crystal ball and as I've said there is
first there is the risk of a military

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:01.490
first there is the risk of a military
 

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:03.279
first there is the risk of a military
confrontation you know really we don't

00:46:03.279 --> 00:46:03.289

know whether countries will accept this
prospect really and it's useless to say

00:46:10.839 --> 00:46:10.849
prospect really and it's useless to say
 

00:46:10.849 --> 00:46:14.200
prospect really and it's useless to say
that it will be a major disaster in this

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:14.210
that it will be a major disaster in this
 

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:15.700
that it will be a major disaster in this
part of the world in any part of the

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:15.710
part of the world in any part of the
 

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:17.170
part of the world in any part of the
world but especially in this part of the

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:17.180
world but especially in this part of the
 

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:20.740
world but especially in this part of the
world secondly as i have said also the

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:20.750
world secondly as i have said also the
 

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.809
world secondly as i have said also the
risk is that simply the collapse of the

00:46:22.809 --> 00:46:22.819
risk is that simply the collapse of the
 

00:46:22.819 --> 00:46:26.950
risk is that simply the collapse of the
non-proliferation treaty and and you

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960
non-proliferation treaty and and you
 

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.380

know again in the 70s it was already a

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:29.390
know again in the 70s it was already a
 

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:33.309
know again in the 70s it was already a
risk now it would be much in a sense

00:46:33.309 --> 00:46:33.319
risk now it would be much in a sense
 

00:46:33.319 --> 00:46:36.819
risk now it would be much in a sense
it's mo it will be much more dangerous

00:46:36.819 --> 00:46:36.829
it's mo it will be much more dangerous
 

00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:38.589
it's mo it will be much more dangerous
because in a sense it's much easier now

00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599
because in a sense it's much easier now
 

00:46:38.599 --> 00:46:42.039

also a new insistence on nuclear

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:57.910
also a new insistence on nuclear
 

01:13:57.910 --> 01:14:00.120
also a new insistence on nuclear
disarmament and especially after the

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:00.130
disarmament and especially after the
 

01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:02.190
disarmament and especially after the
speech of President Obama on the under

01:14:02.190 --> 01:14:02.200
speech of President Obama on the under
 

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:05.490
speech of President Obama on the under
on the world without nuclear weapons so

01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:05.500
on the world without nuclear weapons so
 

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.770
on the world without nuclear weapons so
again there are a lot of questions

01:14:07.770 --> 01:14:07.780
again there are a lot of questions
 

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:10.200
again there are a lot of questions
especially because in the world in the

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:10.210
especially because in the world in the
 

01:14:10.210 --> 01:14:13.310
especially because in the world in the
globalized world everything technologies

01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320
globalized world everything technologies
 

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:17.870
globalized world everything technologies
people people and also materials

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880
people people and also materials
 

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.820
people people and also materials
circulate of course much more much more

01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:20.830
circulate of course much more much more
 

01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:23.220
circulate of course much more much more
easy and again the technology of the

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:23.230
easy and again the technology of the
 

01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:25.860
easy and again the technology of the
nuclear weapons which was maybe very

01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:25.870
nuclear weapons which was maybe very
 

01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:28.230
nuclear weapons which was maybe very
taken very difficult in the 40s or 50s

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:28.240
taken very difficult in the 40s or 50s
 

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.330
taken very difficult in the 40s or 50s
for most of the countries now it's

01:14:30.330 --> 01:14:30.340
for most of the countries now it's
 

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:34.380
for most of the countries now it's
within reach of most of the countries so

01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:34.390
within reach of most of the countries so
 

01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:38.100
within reach of most of the countries so
that's that's the i guess the concerns

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:38.110
that's that's the i guess the concerns
 

01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:40.590
that's that's the i guess the concerns
we have and and a lot a lot of things

01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600
we have and and a lot a lot of things
 

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.670
we have and and a lot a lot of things
are done and i'll done by everybody i I

01:14:44.670 --> 01:14:44.680
are done and i'll done by everybody i I
 

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:48.090

international community with the
exception that countries are really

01:14:53.610 --> 01:14:53.620
exception that countries are really
 

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:56.610
exception that countries are really
committed are really attached to the

01:14:56.610 --> 01:14:56.620
committed are really attached to the
 

01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:59.220
committed are really attached to the
idea that they they are right and we

01:14:59.220 --> 01:14:59.230
idea that they they are right and we
 

01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:00.690
idea that they they are right and we
shouldn't deny them
