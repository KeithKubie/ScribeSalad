00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
De Sitter's observations were of what's known as a binary star system.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now a binary star system has as you might guess two stars,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and these two stars orbit around each other.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
More precisely, they're orbiting on the center of mass.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
These orbits often are very small, very small radius and also very fast

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and so what De Sitter did was look at the light and made it from these stars

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a different points in their orbit.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So for now, let's just pay attention to star one and just ignore star two.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So we know that if it's going around this way, well at this instant in its trajectory,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
its velocity would be pointing in that direction.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Eventually, these stars are going to make it all the way around here

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and its velocity will be pointing in exactly the opposite direction.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now if the speed of light were not constant in all reference frames,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
if you really could throw a light forward like a baseball and when we look at this light on earth,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
we might expect to see some strange effects.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'm actually going to let an animation speak for me on this one.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So here we have our one star of our binary system and it's making a circular orbit.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now at this upper point in the orbit, you can see it's moving away from this detector over here.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
At the lower point of its orbit down here, it's moving towards the detector

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
giving more additional velocity to the light, and if you look over here you can see that that light,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
which was admitted at the lower portion, actually overtakes the other light that was admitted earlier.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
This would lead to some really strange observations.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So for example, at some point when this and this light arrive at the exact same time

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
like from the bottom and top, well that means we'll be seeing the same star in two places,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and it turns out De Sitter found that that doesn't happen.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This was a very clever experiment

00:01:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to confirm experimentally the second postulate of special relativity.
