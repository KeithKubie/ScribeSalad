00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.409
Hey you!
Thanks for coming and joining us.

00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:02.930
&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks, [CROSSTALK].

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.380
&gt;&gt; Appreciate you spending some time.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.460
Have a seat,
we'll go through our prototype here.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.270
So we're beginning a project here that
is a bit of an event management app.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.700
Think about it like to dos,
events, that kind of thing.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.160
I'm curious to get your feedback
on the general flow of the app.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.280
But I'm also curious to get your
feedback on some very specific things.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.260
So for instance, in taking a look at,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.910
you can see here that we have a screen
where we can create new events.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.660
But I'm kind of curious to
understand from the home screen,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.200
when you first come into the app,
do you see something that stands out for

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.700
you that would draw you to go ahead and
create a new event?

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.122
&gt;&gt; Sure, so there is a big
red plus there and it's red.

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:44.938
So I am looking at it and

00:00:44.938 --> 00:00:50.790
that matches a lot of other designs
on Android that is a material design.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.989
I am not really familiar with
a whole bunch of other places.

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.931
So if I was at this screen,
I would hit that plus and

00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:02.140
expect to create an event.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.681
I'm not sure whether that would
necessarily create an event right here

00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:07.515
where it shows the date as the 25th, or
whether that would create an event that

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:09.740
it was left to fill the date,
but that's what I would expect.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know you bring
up a great point, right?

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.450
Sensible defaults in the creation screen
would make a lot of sense for us.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.290
In that case, like inserting the date.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.065
Because we've come
from a specific event,

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:26.360
specific screen here
that lists the date.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.400
&gt;&gt; Like on this screen,
where it looks like this is a day view.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.660
Yeah, and so

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.670
here the plus I would definitely
expect it to create that default.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the pattern there
is a floating action button.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.340
We see that pattern actually
repeat itself a little bit through

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.380
the app here.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.580
One question for you, the footing action
button tends to move around a little bit

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.940
within the UI though.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.720
Would you consider that to be
a jarring part of the experience?

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.150
Or do you feel that you understand
the action of the button

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.470
irregardless of where it's
positioned in the screen?

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.670
&gt;&gt; So I see it in three places here.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.730
Here and
here which are basically the same.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.790
There's no real difference there.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.250
And here at the bottom.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.910
And it's nice to get it
out of the way here.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.758
I think that's sort of where I expect it
based on using a bunch of other apps.

00:02:10.758 --> 00:02:15.470
And likewise, here, presumably, this
screen is going to move up and down.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.595
And it will stay in this interface,
the border between the header and

00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:21.625
the actual list of events.

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:22.955
That makes sense to me.

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:24.845
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're contemplating
implementing some really nice

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:26.925
animations as you scroll
through this screen, so

00:02:26.925 --> 00:02:30.130
it's possible that the fab
might grow and shrink.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.200
It might disappear as you scroll up
through the list, but we want to keep

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.440
the context in tab headers as
we progress through the views.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.250
Because it's important that you
maintain that information, right,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.160
that you be able to swap between
the week and month very quickly.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.820
Now in looking at the fab
on this particular page,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.130
on the week page, one of the things
we've seen in the past is that

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.740
The fab can get in the way
of some of the content.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.090
Do you feel that that's
really a problem for us here?

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.013
&gt;&gt; I feel like right now where
it is at the bottom right,

00:02:57.013 --> 00:02:58.880
it's going to cover something.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.994
&gt;&gt; You mean it doesn't cover that much?

00:03:02.994 --> 00:03:06.443
Mostly avatars in this screen right now.

00:03:06.443 --> 00:03:07.489
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.124
Also given how many items
are being displayed and

00:03:10.124 --> 00:03:13.272
the fact that the user is going
to have to scroll through but

00:03:13.272 --> 00:03:17.200
can see roughly three or four at
a time anyway, it seems to make sense.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.070
It could not exist at all.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.693
But that doesn't seem like
that would be better.

00:03:22.693 --> 00:03:23.692
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:23.692 --> 00:03:27.602
So given that this is an event slash
2D management app, one of the things

00:03:27.602 --> 00:03:31.510
that we really want to make sure that
users can do is actually check off and

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.160
complete those tasks.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.320
Do you see a clear way to do
that within these screens?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.318
&gt;&gt; Hm, I don't see anything that
actually says that this is to-dos

00:03:40.318 --> 00:03:40.832
at all.

00:03:40.832 --> 00:03:43.375
Like all of this looks like
a calendar and event stuff to me.

00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:43.967
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:50.280
&gt;&gt; Everything here has a time,
it looks like it all has places as well.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.600
The idea of there being, there's no
checkboxes, no indication that these

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.560
are things that could be accomplished as
another to do list, so I don't see that.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.230
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.690
And so, if I were to direct you
over here to these check boxes,

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.890
these UI elements.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.398
Do you feel that that's
obviously when you walk

00:04:08.398 --> 00:04:11.036
through the screens here
that was a miss, right?

00:04:11.036 --> 00:04:11.814
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:14.867
&gt;&gt; How do feel that we can evolve
that to make that a little bit more

00:04:14.867 --> 00:04:18.220
prominent, to make that functionality
standout just a bit more?

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.310
It's a core part of
the experience that we want here.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.620
And so, we need to do a better
job of showcasing that feature.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.630
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure that the circular
check box would be as good as

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.290
a square check box.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.880
Usually when we check off
things in most applications,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.480
there's an empty square
that gets checked,

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.700
as opposed to a gray circle that
changes color and has that in there.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.750
I think it's also a little bit
deceptive how this is displayed.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.680
Very much as sort of calendar
events that have locations and

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.170
times, which to-do lists certainly
can have locations and times, but

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.910
the thing to do is often, by far
the most relevant, rather than the time.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.300
And so, I wouldn't normally
go through my calendar and

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.400
check off the events
that I actually went to.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.501
Whereas with a to-do list manager,

00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:09.309
having the check be more prominent
than the time would make sense.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.040
&gt;&gt; Hm, interesting.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.023
So certainly it sounds to me like you
feel that the affordance needs to be

00:05:14.023 --> 00:05:16.413
stronger, but
there's also a question about whether or

00:05:16.413 --> 00:05:19.420
not we're actually managing to-do's
versus calendar events here.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.560
So perhaps the to-do aspect of
the app needs to stand out a bit more.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.600
&gt;&gt; Right, so this here,
we have the exact same things.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.980
And this very much
looks like a calendar.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.377
There's no way of
checking something off.

00:05:31.377 --> 00:05:32.039
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.142
&gt;&gt; And this, we can check it off.

00:05:33.142 --> 00:05:33.734
What does that do?

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:35.580
Does that remove it from our calendar?

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.914
I don't know.

00:05:37.914 --> 00:05:40.492
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
I think that's a great question to ask,

00:05:40.492 --> 00:05:44.179
is what would you expect to happen
when you did check something off?

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.540
Would you expect it to
disappear form your calendar?

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.850
Would you expect there to be
an animation associated with that?

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.760
Would you want to see it in place?

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.263
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if I'm using some
kind of a to-do list manager,

00:05:55.263 --> 00:05:57.787
I think I do want something to
happen when I check it off.

00:05:57.787 --> 00:06:01.236
And that probably means striking it out
in case it was an accidental check,

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:03.661
snd I don't want it to just
disappear immediately.

00:06:03.661 --> 00:06:04.990
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, good feedback.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.290
&gt;&gt; Potentially it could move away and
be left with an undo.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.470
But in this case, where these
obviously are calendar-ish things,

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.050
I don't want them removed
from my calendar.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.210
I might want to go back and see them.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.310
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I think maintaining
some historical context here is really

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.470
important to actually managing the set
of events that are happening here.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.540
Let me ask you one question.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.070
In terms of gesture support for
this screen, how would you expect

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.930
a user to interact with this to
check something as completed.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.900
Would you expect a tap, a swipe?

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.330
&gt;&gt; With this screen,
I would expect a tap to

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.980
bring up a screen that has more detailed
information, so something like this.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:52.906
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see.
Like a detailed view.

00:06:52.906 --> 00:06:54.123
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] With these filled in so
you could.

00:06:54.123 --> 00:06:55.608
So tap might bring it up to edit it.

00:06:55.608 --> 00:06:59.659
I wouldn't expect you to check
it off unless the tap was on,

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:01.570
basically the check mark.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.270
Which is why it might be
a good idea to have it larger.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.700
This is a really small target area.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we really want to make
sure that we have a 40 dip tap target.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.020
Making sure that we have 40
device independent pixels

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.980
is a valuable part of
touch responsiveness.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.530
Making sure that we have enough room for
the finger on the screen.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:25.280
&gt;&gt; I'm not totally sure what
a swipe left or right might do.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.340
It's possible that you could
train users to do that but

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.020
it's not super intuitive what
the objective would actually be.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.310
Swiping up or down definitely
should move through the list and

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.000
we can see things that are farther down.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.210
&gt;&gt; So one of the things you also
mentioned was that there was some

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.980
consistency in the experience here.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.260
One thing though is that we're only
allowing you to manage apps from

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.440
the day view.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.730
Would you expect to want to be able
to manage those events from your home

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:50.410
screen as well?

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.470
Or is that more of like
a heads-up display?

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.400
&gt;&gt; Oh, you mean here you can check
them off and here you can't?

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.762
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:07:58.762 --> 00:08:03.260
&gt;&gt; If to-do list management is
really a top level objective,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.820
then probably doing that from
home screen is really important.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.270
One of the things about to-do lists,

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.610
is people just won't use them if
it takes a long time to do things.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:13.200
So taking an extra tab to get
through to a day view screen to

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.590
manage a to-do list, might keep
people from interacting with it.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that does seem inefficient.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.700
&gt;&gt; But again, here,
if I tapped on any of these items,

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.430
I would normally expect
to be taken to an edit.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.670
Rather than able to complete.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.409
Also it's weird here that you
can edit everything about this

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.580
potential item except whether
it's been accomplished or not.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.720
So here you have to actually
be in this screen and

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.460
see the list to check items off,
it that's possible.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.750
Whereas here you can edit
everything else, but not that.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.020
&gt;&gt; There isn't even a notion of
delete yet here either, right?

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.050
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Where would you expect to see delete?

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.390
Would you expect to see
that here with completion?

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:53.952
Here in the edit UI?

00:08:53.952 --> 00:08:58.292
&gt;&gt; I would definitely expect it to be
in the edit UI someplace, because when

00:08:58.292 --> 00:09:03.340
everything else fails, people are
probably going to go look for it there.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:07.230
It also potentially is reasonable for

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:12.170
a swipe gesture to move this off and
delete it.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.160
&gt;&gt; Interesting, so
maybe swipe one way to complete,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.229
swipe another way to delete?

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:21.110
&gt;&gt; That is a method of interaction that
for instance, gets used on inbox, and

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.200
so I think this would be pretty
familiar to a lot of users.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that in particular
swipe affordance is quite

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.770
popular in inbox as well, yeah.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.650
Great, well I really
appreciate you coming out and

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.140
giving us a little bit
of feedback on the app.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.990
You've definitely caught
some glaring issues for us.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.870
We definitely need to iterate
here a little bit more.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.700
But I would really appreciate getting
more feedback when we have iterated and

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.610
improved based on the feedback
that you've given.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.480
Would you be willing to give us
more feedback in the future?

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Great, thank you very much.
