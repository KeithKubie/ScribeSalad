00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.260
In the last video
I mentioned how

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.489
I've been asked to make
predictions for the year 2060.

00:00:05.489 --> 00:00:07.155
And the last one I
focused on education,

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:09.950
and that's obviously
what I'm working on now.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.032
So I have some
opinions about that.

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:13.490
But what I want to
do in this video

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.220
is do maybe slightly more
broad and wild predictions,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.760
and my one prediction
I'll make is

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.820
I'm probably
completely not going

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.074
to predict the real
reality of 2060.

00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:24.490
And probably the
really big things

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.090
to predict I will
completely miss.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.660
But with that out of the way
it is fun to predict things.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.280
So let's give it a shot.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.930
So the first area
that I will predict

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.640
is what's going to happen
in the field of medicine.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.320
And in particular, I think
that the human lifespan

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.200
is going to increase
dramatically.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.780
So I'll be conservative
and say that the lifespan,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.830
the average human
lifespan, is going to be,

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.420
and especially in
the developed world,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.660
and once again, hopefully
by 2060 most of the world

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.150
is developed, that the
average human lifespan is

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.120
going to be over 100 years old.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.630
And I won't say
whether that's going

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.070
to be a good or a bad thing.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.129
There's arguments either way
about the proper way to live,

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.710
and what happens to
global populations.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.990
But if the world is for the
most part developed and educated

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.570
you actually will probably have
a lower rate of reproduction.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.270
So you might actually
have some space

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.530
in the world for older people.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.710
But this I think there
is a very strong chance

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.340
of this happening,
because we are starting

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.820
to understand the
molecular basis of aging.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.680
It's not a given thing that
because of some form of wear

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.947
and tear things have to die
at after 70 years, or 80

00:01:37.947 --> 00:01:39.530
years, or 90 years,
and we're starting

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.110
to understand the mechanisms,
and how to maybe improve

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.620
the repair mechanisms, or how
to augment it in some way.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.560
So I definitely think
this is going to happen.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.430
I don't know whether it's going
to be a positive or negative.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.450
But it's likely to happen.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.790
The next thing-- and this
is kind of closely related,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.850
this is still
biological-- is you're

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.170
going to have a close
integration between the digital

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.216
and the biological.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.699
And once again, I won't
make any statement

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.750
of whether this is a
good or a bad thing,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.020
but it seems like it's
just an extrapolation

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.820
of the direction we're
already going in,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.390
digital and biological
integration.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.050
So already you're
getting more and more

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.390
in your handheld devices.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.140
Imagine when your screen is
now no longer in your palm,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.890
but it's being projected
onto your retina

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.101
from some little thing.

00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:30.100
And then eventually you
have a direct connection

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.933
with your retina and
your brain can directly

00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:37.210
access areas of memory
through just direct

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.594
through some biological
and digital interface.

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:42.510
So I definitely think
this is going to happen.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.634
This is a big deal, because
this is starting to--

00:02:44.634 --> 00:02:46.050
And I think it's
already happening

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.980
with a lot of what you
see around technology.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.620
It's really going
to reshape what

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.100
the individual human
experience is going to be.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.520
We already see people kind of
living in virtual realities

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.620
and playing these
immersive games,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.970
and spending all of their time
on social networking platforms.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.590
What happens when
they're literally

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.120
plugged in all the time, when
almost their cellphone is

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.750
in the brain?

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.540
I don't know.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.040
I'm not going to comment whether
it's a good or a bad thing.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.600
But it does look
like a trend that's

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.310
going to keep on going
through the next 50 years.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.100
Now, if we take that
even further, we're

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.850
talking about a digital
and biological integration,

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.280
but if you go at the extreme,
and actually it's probably

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.900
both of these top two
things combined in some way,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.270
is that we are learning.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.750
And once again,
not make a comment

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.810
whether it's good or bad.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.600
It's just an extrapolation
of what we're already seeing.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.040
We are seeing more
and more ability

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.560
to understand our genome, to
molecularly target things,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.070
to manipulate actual biology.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.050
And so what you have is
that you can actually

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.780
have manipulation of biology.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.350
And this is on
some level creepy.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.900
It could be creepy or
it could be exciting

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.870
depending on how
it all plays out.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.120
But it could do things like
augment human intelligence,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.206
which would, if you think about
all the progress of society

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.080
and all the things that
already accelerating,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.190
imagine how society will change
if intelligence itself is

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.204
augmented.

00:04:16.204 --> 00:04:19.029
And as someone with a
limited intelligence,

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.029
I can't even imagine what will
happen as soon as you do this.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.850
And obviously, the more you
augment intelligence, the more

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.770
that you can learn how
to augment intelligence,

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.140
and increase lifespan, and
do digital and biological

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.600
integration even more.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.350
So these things I see
as some form of a trend.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.190
We'll see how it all plays
out, and hopefully it plays out

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.300
in kind of the
feel-good Care Bear

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.720
version versus some
type of crazy society

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.630
and we all turn into
the Borg in some way.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.812
Now, the other
trend, and these are

00:04:51.812 --> 00:04:53.520
the things that just
popped into my brain

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.400
today when I pressed record,
but the other trend that I think

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.590
is interesting is
some of the things

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.560
that we've taken for granted in
terms of how nations interact

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.130
with each other,
and nation states

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.150
in particular interact
with each other.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.220
And just as a kind
of an overview, so

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.440
there's a notion
called a nation state.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.747
And in everyday language the
word nation and the word state

00:05:15.747 --> 00:05:17.830
almost means the same
thing, but they kind of mean

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.324
different things
if you want to be

00:05:19.324 --> 00:05:20.740
a little bit more
formal about it.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.220
And that's why people use
the word nation state.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.720
That's like to a
lot of people, hey,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.919
doesn't that mean
saying like state state?

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.710
The difference between
a nation and a state

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.830
is these are a
group of people that

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.530
feel some type of
common identity.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.770
It could be a language.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.990
It could be a culture.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.110
It could be a value system.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.650
So this is some kind
of common identity.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.182
And it often is somehow
associated with geography,

00:05:43.182 --> 00:05:45.390
but it does not have to be
associated with geography.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.050
It could even be a religion,
or it could be whatever else.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.280
That's what a nation is.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.860
A state is a formal governance
structure that makes the laws

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.360
and has the institutions
to make society function.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.530
Now, a nation state
is what most of us

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.030
live in today
because it both has

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.770
an identity and some type
of formal institutions.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.790
So a very pure nation state
would be some place like Japan,

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.190
where there's relatively
uniform, in terms of ethnicity

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.600
and religion, and
in terms of culture,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.980
and you have that
same group of people

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.800
are governing themselves.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.950
In a place like the
United States ethnicity,

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.600
religion, that's diverse,
but what gives identity

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.370
is a notion of shared
values and a notion

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.170
of maybe a common
history or whatever else,

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.500
or a certain kind of world view.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.970
And obviously there's a
formal state structure.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.053
Now, what I think is going
to be interesting here,

00:06:42.053 --> 00:06:43.960
and I actually have no
idea how all of this

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.550
is going to play
out, but when you

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.110
see things like some of the
revolutions in the Middle East

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.190
due to things like people
being able to communicate

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.930
irrespective of the
traditional media,

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.460
I think there's going to be some
interesting questions on what

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.020
happens to the nation state,
especially nation states that

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.380
are able to secure their
power by kind of having

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.534
a bottleneck on
access to information.

00:07:07.534 --> 00:07:08.950
And all of that
is, I think, going

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.360
to change in a very
dramatic way as you

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.600
have more and more
integration between people,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.200
cross-border
communications, when

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.783
people realize that the people
on the other side of the border

00:07:17.783 --> 00:07:19.990
really aren't that
different than themselves.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.210
And another
interesting thing, even

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.980
the notion of democracy--
and once again,

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.760
I don't know how it's
going to play out--

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.170
but all notions of
representational democracy

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.910
that we have today are
somewhat based on geography.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.560
They're somewhat
based on geography.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.810
And that's because when
the major representational

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.814
democracies came about
that was the best

00:07:39.814 --> 00:07:40.980
way to represent each other.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.320
Hey, let me pick some
representatives from our county

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.945
or from our region, and they'll
go elect other representatives,

00:07:45.945 --> 00:07:47.710
and they'll go to the
national government.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.150
But now that we have this
instantaneous communication

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.850
with people you
might be able to have

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.472
different types of a
representational democracy,

00:07:54.472 --> 00:07:56.680
or maybe you could even have
more direct democracies.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.260
Who knows, because of things
like [INAUDIBLE] communication,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.677
and technology,
and whatever else.

00:08:02.677 --> 00:08:04.135
And then the other
way that I think

00:08:04.135 --> 00:08:06.585
nation states are, the way
they fundamentally interact

00:08:06.585 --> 00:08:09.110
is going to change is actually
in things like warfare.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.340
And once again, already
seeing this trend.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.530
In particular, I think
developed countries are not

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.235
going to have humans
on the front line.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.949
And depending on
your point of view,

00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:24.490
this could be a very
good thing or it

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.141
could be a kind
of a scary thing,

00:08:26.141 --> 00:08:28.140
because if you have no
humans on the front line,

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.723
and you're already seeing things
like this with these predator

00:08:30.723 --> 00:08:40.070
drones and you see these
robot bomb detectors,

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.080
and things like that.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.080
And it doesn't even have
to be these big things.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.240
There's already a
DARPA funded project

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.990
to work on miniature
insects that

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.900
could be used as some
form of reconnaissance,

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.140
or you could imagine
eventually they

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.485
could have these little
things on them that

00:08:51.485 --> 00:08:53.960
could knock someone out,
or who knows what they do.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.270
The exciting thing is that
all of a sudden a human

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.590
won't be there to get shot.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.640
And so hopefully military
casualties would go down.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.190
The scary thing
here is if you don't

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.100
have humans on the
front line nations might

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.200
be willing to enter into war,
especially developed nations,

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.910
they might not take
it as seriously.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.500
And so it might be something
that they do a little bit more

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.890
when they're in the mood.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.680
And it would actually
create a huge disparity

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.626
between developed and developing
nations when this happens.

00:09:23.626 --> 00:09:25.500
And you already see that
to a certain degree.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.080
A developed nation,
they don't have

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.800
to put as many
humans in harm's way.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.890
And it's purely
driven by their wealth

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.500
to have capital that
can go, you know,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.290
these robots and these drones,
and their technological

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.360
innovation, while in
the developing countries

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.120
they actually would have
to use human beings.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.867
So their cost would be much,
much, much, much higher.

00:09:46.867 --> 00:09:48.200
So it's an interesting question.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.420
And once again, who
knows how this plays out,

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.770
whether it's a good or bad
thing in the long term.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.870
And I think a similar
thing with this

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.480
is I think you're
going to see more

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:04.390
and more nonlethal weapons,
which once again, it's

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.570
very similar to this, it
sounds like it's a good thing.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.430
You know, if there's
a gun that instead

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.420
of having to kill someone, it
incapacitates them in some way,

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.190
or it stuns them in some way,
kind of the classic Star Trek

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.680
put your phasers on stun things.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.550
I guess the scarier version
of nonlethal weapons

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.580
is the threshold for using
it becomes much lower.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.780
So if a government wants
to subject its citizens

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.930
or subject another
group of citizens

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.513
it can literally just stun them,
or it can make them pass out,

00:10:34.513 --> 00:10:36.180
or it could control
them in some way.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.100
And so this could be
a little bit scarier.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.560
So who knows how all
of this plays out.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.870
So those are my
predictions or things

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.850
to think about over
the next 50 years.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.930
These are just the things that
happened to jump into my brain

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.700
today, probably based on some
of the science fiction books

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.260
I've been reading,
or whatever else.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.109
But taken with a
huge grain of salt I

00:10:56.109 --> 00:10:58.650
don't know if these things are
really going to happen or not.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.480
And I don't know if they're
even a good thing or not,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.470
but they seem to be a bit
of an extrapolation of what

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.530
we're already seeing.
