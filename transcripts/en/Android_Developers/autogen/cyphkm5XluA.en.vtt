this is really the we are at this point
 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.790
this is really the we are at this point
where hardware is really not about it's

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800
where hardware is really not about it's
 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.680
where hardware is really not about it's
different or hard it's more about how

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690
different or hard it's more about how
 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.770

you actually go through the process to a

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780
you actually go through the process to a
 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.980
you actually go through the process to a

you start implementing it this is a

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680
you start implementing it this is a
 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.440
you start implementing it this is a
critical step and you need to think

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:32.450
critical step and you need to think
 

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.210
critical step and you need to think
about all the features as well as the

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.220
about all the features as well as the
 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.640
about all the features as well as the
rest of the things which is power and

rest of the things which is power and
 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.760
rest of the things which is power and
size so this is in a different dimension

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:39.770
size so this is in a different dimension
 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.490
size so this is in a different dimension

for from your product standpoint beyond

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:51.380
for from your product standpoint beyond
 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.830
for from your product standpoint beyond
that also think about the cost very

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840
that also think about the cost very
 

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.480
that also think about the cost very
early on so that you don't end up buying

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:55.490
early on so that you don't end up buying
 

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.670
early on so that you don't end up buying
components that are expensive from the

components that are expensive from the
 

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.100
components that are expensive from the
beginning and then finally how is it all

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:00.110
beginning and then finally how is it all
 

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.790

powered is it a battery powered or a see

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800
powered is it a battery powered or a see
 

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.410
powered is it a battery powered or a see
this also matters in the design so

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:05.420
this also matters in the design so
 

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.240
this also matters in the design so
that's the planning piece next is

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:10.250
that's the planning piece next is
 

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.700
that's the planning piece next is

of Florida when you start thinking about
 

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.910
of Florida when you start thinking about
your design and you think that you need

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:18.920
your design and you think that you need
 

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.160
your design and you think that you need
to wait all the way until you actually

done with the layout the next step is to
 

00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:45.789
done with the layout the next step is to
see what exactly it looks like and this

00:12:45.789 --> 00:12:45.799
see what exactly it looks like and this

is pretty cool in hardware you can

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:48.110
is pretty cool in hardware you can
 

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:51.639
is pretty cool in hardware you can
actually start thinking about not only

00:12:51.639 --> 00:12:51.649
actually start thinking about not only
 

00:12:51.649 --> 00:12:52.929
actually start thinking about not only
thinking about what you are trying to

00:12:52.929 --> 00:12:52.939
thinking about what you are trying to
 

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.600
thinking about what you are trying to
build but also feel and kind of see what

build but also feel and kind of see what
 

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.309
build but also feel and kind of see what
it is and this is where things get

00:12:57.309 --> 00:12:57.319
it is and this is where things get

really exciting you need to take the
 

00:12:59.119 --> 00:13:00.819
really exciting you need to take the
time to actually look at where your

00:13:00.819 --> 00:13:00.829
time to actually look at where your
 

00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:03.220

with this board is the LED was actually

00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:25.389
with this board is the LED was actually
 

00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:28.199
with this board is the LED was actually
placed in the back and so it wasn't

00:13:28.199 --> 00:13:28.209
placed in the back and so it wasn't
 

00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:30.780
placed in the back and so it wasn't
visually possible to see the LEDs from

blinking especially for error LEDs so

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:35.199
blinking especially for error LEDs so
 

00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:37.199

it's important again to think about

00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:37.209
it's important again to think about
 

00:13:37.209 --> 00:13:41.309
it's important again to think about
these as part of your design after you

an important step that you need to pay

00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839
an important step that you need to pay
 

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:46.230
an important step that you need to pay
attention to in terms of manufacturing

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240
attention to in terms of manufacturing
 

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.439
attention to in terms of manufacturing
there are two options today which is

00:14:49.439 --> 00:14:49.449
there are two options today which is
 

00:14:49.449 --> 00:14:51.269
there are two options today which is
really great in terms of the cost and

00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279
really great in terms of the cost and
 

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:53.850
really great in terms of the cost and
there are trade-offs for each one so one

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:53.860
there are trade-offs for each one so one

have your Gerber files you could release

00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480
have your Gerber files you could release
 

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.429
have your Gerber files you could release
it to somebody locally either it's us or

can do it offshore there the trade-off

00:15:12.809 --> 00:15:12.819
can do it offshore there the trade-off
 

00:15:12.819 --> 00:15:16.949
can do it offshore there the trade-off
is its cost is cheaper but it also takes

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959
is its cost is cheaper but it also takes
 

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:18.720
is its cost is cheaper but it also takes
much longer time for you to receive your

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:05.590
design to reduce cost and the yields are
 

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.620
design to reduce cost and the yields are
going to be critical so pay attention to

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:07.630
going to be critical so pay attention to
 

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.840
going to be critical so pay attention to
how your product is performing in the

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:09.850
how your product is performing in the
 

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:10.440
how your product is performing in the
factory

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:10.450
factory
 

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.750
factory
especially for those small percentage of

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:12.760
especially for those small percentage of
 

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.250
especially for those small percentage of
failures that you are seeing this steps

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260
failures that you are seeing this steps
 

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.620
failures that you are seeing this steps
is really where the real cost comes in

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:19.630
is really where the real cost comes in
 

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.570
is really where the real cost comes in
this is generally like I said they're

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:21.580
this is generally like I said they're
 

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.460
this is generally like I said they're
less than one-third of the cost of an

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:23.470
less than one-third of the cost of an
 

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.830
less than one-third of the cost of an
EBT or even lower and you can further

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840
EBT or even lower and you can further
 

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.430
EBT or even lower and you can further
push it by using second source

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440
push it by using second source
 

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.130
push it by using second source
optimizing your processes even kind of

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:32.140
optimizing your processes even kind of
 

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.520
optimizing your processes even kind of
changing some of the design of in terms

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:35.530
changing some of the design of in terms
 

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:36.960
changing some of the design of in terms
of the components that you are selected

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:36.970
of the components that you are selected
 

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.210
of the components that you are selected
and reducing the cost or even removing

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:39.220
and reducing the cost or even removing
 

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:43.110
and reducing the cost or even removing
them finally you would think you're done

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120
them finally you would think you're done
 

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.480
them finally you would think you're done
again not yet the there is a bunch of

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:47.490
again not yet the there is a bunch of
 

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.370
again not yet the there is a bunch of
tests that are required for you to meet

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:50.380
tests that are required for you to meet
 

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.380
tests that are required for you to meet
before you can ship out to your

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:52.390
before you can ship out to your
 

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.840
before you can ship out to your
customers and each country has its own

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:54.850

qualification so

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320
 

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.970
let's try to wrap this up in terms of

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:13.980
let's try to wrap this up in terms of
 

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.039
let's try to wrap this up in terms of
you did the planning you did the

00:26:16.039 --> 00:26:16.049
you did the planning you did the
 

00:26:16.049 --> 00:26:20.570
you did the planning you did the
prototype you did the design and then

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:20.580
prototype you did the design and then
 

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.879
prototype you did the design and then
you did the qualify these four steps

00:26:24.879 --> 00:26:24.889
you did the qualify these four steps
 

00:26:24.889 --> 00:26:28.159
you did the qualify these four steps
needs to be repeated in each of these

00:26:28.159 --> 00:26:28.169
needs to be repeated in each of these
 

00:26:28.169 --> 00:26:32.419
needs to be repeated in each of these
EVT DVT PBT and mass production phases

00:26:32.419 --> 00:26:32.429
EVT DVT PBT and mass production phases
 

00:26:32.429 --> 00:26:35.870
EVT DVT PBT and mass production phases
and each of these steps are designed to

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880
and each of these steps are designed to
 

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.299
and each of these steps are designed to
deal with your hardware as I mentioned

00:26:38.299 --> 00:26:38.309
deal with your hardware as I mentioned
 

00:26:38.309 --> 00:26:40.519
deal with your hardware as I mentioned
earlier if you take these steps and

00:26:40.519 --> 00:26:40.529
earlier if you take these steps and
 

00:26:40.529 --> 00:26:43.730
earlier if you take these steps and
follow it through most likely your

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740
follow it through most likely your
 

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.500
follow it through most likely your
design will not have the issues that

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:45.510
design will not have the issues that
 

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:52.100
design will not have the issues that
would cost thousands of dollars that's

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:52.110
would cost thousands of dollars that's
 

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.769
would cost thousands of dollars that's
the end of this talk I'm gonna they're a
