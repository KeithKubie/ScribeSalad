00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.140
For this project I’m going to show you how
to convert sticky labels and a couple of matches

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.080
into a handful of exploding stickers. Put
them on a hard surface and hit them with a

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.990
hammer, and they explode on impact with enough
power to leave your ears ringing. These little

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.199
“Thunder Caps” are super cheap and easy
to make, and are a fun way to level up your

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.510
target practice as well. Because with “Thunder
Caps”, your targets explode.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.240
All we need to start this project is a box
of safety matches, and a razor blade. The

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.029
box-cutter I’m using has a quick release
feature for removing the blade inside, and

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.880
that’s what I’ll be using in a couple
of minutes.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.920
Now let’s get to work making our improvised
cap gun powder, with the heads of two safety matches.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.200
Matches like these are around 50% Potassium
Chlorate, mixed with a few other ingredients

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.489
like sulfur, starch, and glue.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.149
If we take a hammer and lightly tap the heads
of the matches, while slowly rolling the sticks

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.399
around, you can see the pyrotechnic shell
separates from the stick, and flakes right off.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.670
You might have noticed I’m collecting the
match heads on a paper sticky note, and that’s

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.309
mainly to help keep my brick clean, but it’ll
also make it a lot easier to capture and transfer the powder, later on.

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.500
Now our “Thunder Caps” are going to make
a much bigger bang if we grind the chunks

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.760
down into a really fine powder. And a really
easy way to do that with a kitchen knife.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.100
Crush them with the blade, then carefully
spread the powder back and forth a few times,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.080
like you're putting butter on a muffin.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.740
In less than a minute, you’ll find you have
an extremely fine match-head powder, that

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.650
should look something like this.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.170
Alright it’s time for the second ingredient,
that makes all the explosive magic happen.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.170
And you’ll find it right there, on the side
of your matchbox.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.659
Take your razor blade, and slowly and carefully,
begin scraping the side of the box so you

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.409
can harvest some of the fine red powder. And
keep a sticky note, or a piece of paper under

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.610
the box so you salvage as much of it as possible.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.060
This precious powder is about 50% red phosphorous,
mixed with a few other abrasive materials, like powdered glass.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.829
Use your blade to carefully scrape the 2 powders
into separate lines, but make sure they don’t

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.680
mix together yet. Because if they do, they’ll
activate, and become come “impact sensitive”.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.120
The recipe I’m using for my cap gun mix
is 2 parts powdered match-heads to 1 part “striker strip” powder.

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.969
So as a basic rule of thumb, just make sure
your green line is twice as long as the red

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.170
one, and it should work just fine.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.729
The safest and easiest way I’ve found for
mixing the two powders, is by dropping them

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.489
into a plastic party cup, and carefully swirling
the mixture around for about 20-30 seconds.

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.250
This way the composition gets thoroughly mixed,
and there’s very little risk of spontaneous

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.569
ignition. But that doesn’t mean it won’t
ignite.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.260
In fact you should always treat your cap powder
with the highest levels of caution and respect,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.800
to avoid setting it off accidentally.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.930
Now hopefully you’ve got some ear plugs
and safety glasses nearby, because the time

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.150
has come, to bust some caps.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.250
Watch closely as I smack the tiny pile with
a hammer, and you’ll see the instant it

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.260
makes contact, the power explodes, and vaporizes
into thin air.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.720
If you don’t have a hammer, it’s no problem.
You can actually set the powder off with anything

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.720
that hits hard enough, to shock it.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.349
This amazing composition you’ve created
is an improvised version of “Armstrong’s

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.709
Mixture”, which interestingly enough, is
the same powder used for making cap gun caps.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.480
So that means, now you have the option of
reloading old cap gun caps, and making them up to

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.700
10 times more powerful. Try using that option
with the “Exploding Cap Darts” we made in a previous video.

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.700
Now just for fun, why don’t we take this
experiment one step further, with a pack of sticky dots.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.159
I found a bundle of over 300 sticky-backed
labels, from the stationary section of my local grocery store.

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.819
Set one of the labels down on the table with
the sticky side facing up, then use something

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.519
like a modified drinking straw to carefully
transfer a tiny bit of the cap powder, to the center of the label.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.250
Drop the powder right in the middle, then
find another sticker the same color, and carefully

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.940
press it down overtop, sealing off the edges,
and trapping the powder inside.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.720
You’ve just created a powerful, homemade
“Smack Cap”. And if you look closely,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.700
you should be able to see the powder located
in the center, ready for action.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.650
I went ahead and made a whole bunch more by
adding the rest of the powder to different

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.799
colored dots, using the color coding to my
advantage.

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.349
The green dots have the smallest amount of
powder, The orange dots have around twice

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.830
as much powder, and the pink dots are as full
as I could get them.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.870
Testing them out on my workbench it’s easy
to see the difference between the green, the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.420
orange, and the pink dot, which was actually
so loud, your ears would have been ringing.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.580
So remember to do the smart thing, and wear
ear plugs.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.640
I smacked a cap on a dirty brick, so you can
see the shockwave it makes, when it explodes,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.709
then put one of the orange dots inside a leaf
to see what would happen if we hit it with

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.950
a rock. Apparently, the leaf gets completely
obliterated, in just an instant.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.959
For one final experiment I picked up a CO2
powered BB gun to see what would happen if

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.479
we tried using our “Thunder caps” for
target practice.

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.350
I printed off a paper target, and taped a
“Smack Cap” to the center, so when a pellet

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.240
hits the bullseye, the target explodes.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.590
By sticking “Thunder Caps” to your targets,
you’ll get a very gratifying feeling, of

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.240
power and accomplishment when you hit your
targets dead-on.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.870
These exploding dots aren’t just for BB
guns though. They can be used with slingshots,

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.410
blow darts, and I imagine they’d probably
work with high speed air-soft pellets as well.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.650
But whichever way you use them, one thing
is for sure. You’re bound to get a reaction, each time you set one off.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.290
Well now you know how to use a couple of matches
and some sticky labels to make an arsenal

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.650
of color coded “Thunder caps”.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.300
And whether you use them for target practice,
or just for having a bit of fun exploring

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.400
science in the back yard, your “Thunder
Caps” are guaranteed to be a blast.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.910
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
project perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
