end of this movie for Harry Potter's
life that of Dumbledore's death at the

life that of Dumbledore's death at the
 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.500
life that of Dumbledore's death at the
hands of Severus Snape and so this movie

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510
hands of Severus Snape and so this movie
 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.090
hands of Severus Snape and so this movie
absolutely had to build that

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100
absolutely had to build that
 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.470
absolutely had to build that
relationship between Harry and

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480
relationship between Harry and
 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.130

Dumbledore
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.990
Dumbledore
because order of the Phoenix didn't

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000
because order of the Phoenix didn't
 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.160
because order of the Phoenix didn't
really explore it at all because

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170
really explore it at all because
 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.840
really explore it at all because
Dumbledore was pretty much avoiding

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850
Dumbledore was pretty much avoiding
 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.850
Dumbledore was pretty much avoiding
Harry for the majority of that movie so

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860
Harry for the majority of that movie so
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.440
Harry for the majority of that movie so
this movie really had to build those

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450
this movie really had to build those
 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.000

characters so when those really

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
characters so when those really
 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.440
characters so when those really
important scenes come at the end of the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450
important scenes come at the end of the
 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.210
important scenes come at the end of the
movie they have emotional weight and

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220
movie they have emotional weight and
 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.890
movie they have emotional weight and
half-blood Prince definitely did that

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900
half-blood Prince definitely did that
 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.870

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.820
there are aspects of this movie that do
bother me though after Harry becoming a

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830
bother me though after Harry becoming a
 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.800
bother me though after Harry becoming a
teacher and teaching all the kids magic

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810
teacher and teaching all the kids magic
 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.570

order of the Phoenix this movie is at
 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.220
order of the Phoenix this movie is at
times a little slow paced and so there

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230
times a little slow paced and so there
 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.870
times a little slow paced and so there
are parts of this movie despite all the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880
are parts of this movie despite all the
 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.240

character depth that do drag but my
 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.860
character depth that do drag but my
biggest issue with this movie is that it

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870
biggest issue with this movie is that it
 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.210
biggest issue with this movie is that it
took out certain things from the book

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220
took out certain things from the book
 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.890
took out certain things from the book
that would really have helped explain a

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900
that would really have helped explain a
 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.540
that would really have helped explain a
few things that happen in this movie

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550
few things that happen in this movie
 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.670
few things that happen in this movie
like at the end one Dumbledore and Harry
