1
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.450
You got to play the game.
And sometimes even from you,
when you just said to me,

2
00:00:04.451 --> 00:00:06.350
you don't,
like you just said to wow,
you know,
sometimes you,
you,

3
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.930
it's not right to turn a blind eye on things.
And it's like

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.140
sometimes you have to,

5
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.900
if you want to get yourself to a position like mine seems

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.420
<v 1>to me that you're making a distinction between discipline and strategy,
like and,</v>

7
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.330
and,
and,
and like impulsive,
moral responding.
You know,

8
00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:30.310
like let's say that you are in a situation where you have a boss who's

9
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.750
intolerable and maybe what you'd like to do,
you know,

10
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.170
the resentment is built up over five years and you'd like to go in there and,

11
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.650
and yell at him and tell him everything you think and you think,

12
00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:43.410
well that's the truth.
It's like,
well,
it's actually,

13
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.500
it's not a very sophisticated truth because you're doing a shallow and impulsive

14
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.280
analysis of the situation.

15
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.790
Like it would have been the case that you've already compromised yourself in 500

16
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:59.730
ways.
And I'll get back to the playing the game issue because you do have to

17
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:04.070
discipline yourself to,
and,
and you have to discipline yourself to,

18
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.951
to some degree,

19
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:09.660
by allowing yourself to do arbitrary things that are part of the system,
right?

20
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.310
That's necessary part of discipline.

21
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.610
And discriminating that from a compliance with unethical activity is very

22
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:22.680
difficult.
So that's a hard situation.
But let's say you're,
you're,

23
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.980
you're going to counsel someone who has an intolerable boss and they'd come in

24
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:28.410
and they're right at the end of their tether because maybe that's why they come

25
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:29.191
for counseling.
They say,

26
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:31.800
I really want to tell that son of a bitch what I think of him.
And you think,

27
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:34.830
well,
wait a second here.
Okay,
first of all,

28
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.670
you've already eradicated from the list of reasonable possibilities.

29
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.120
That decision by failing to say small things that you could have said all the

30
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:49.284
way along.

31
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.740
And it's not like you can just all of a sudden blurt all of that out now.

32
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:56.340
And that wipes the slate clean in.
That constitutes truth.

33
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.350
It's too unsophisticated.
So let's think,
okay,
so what is it that you want?

34
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.620
Well,
I don't want this job anymore.
It's like,
okay,
now let's,

35
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.370
let's actually have a strategy about this.
Then you don't want this job anymore.

36
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.870
Can you get another job?
While I don't think so.
Well,

37
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.670
so you can't just quit.
Well,

38
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:18.090
no I can't because then I don't have any money in my family.
Depends on the job.

39
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.470
It's like,
okay,
so you can't just stop this.
That's not a viable solution.

40
00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:25.260
You go out of the frying pan into the fire or you know,

41
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:30.261
you sack you s you substitute one set of unethical actions for another set of

42
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:33.810
unethical actions that are even worse.
That's not helpful.
All right,

43
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:38.400
so let's start thinking about what exactly it is that you want.
It's like,

44
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.720
well maybe I want a better job.
I want to work for someone who's more reasonable.

45
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.980
Okay,
so what's stopping you?
Well,
I don't have my CV in order.

46
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.980
My resume isn't up to date.
Well,
why is that?

47
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:52.410
While I haven't done it for five years and I don't like doing it.
Well,

48
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:53.140
why is that?

49
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.040
Well because I'm kind of embarrassed about it because it has holes in it and it

50
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.340
shows where I'm lackadaisical and where I'm not prepared.
It's like,
okay,

51
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.110
how many things are there like that?

52
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:04.610
While there's a bunch of things and they're all associated with how I

53
00:03:04.611 --> 00:03:07.150
procrastinated in the past,
it's like,
okay,

54
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:10.030
what are we going to do to rectify that?
So I'll say to people,

55
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:13.450
why don't you update your CV death?
That's what we'll do first.

56
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:15.190
Because if you're going to look for a different job,

57
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:17.110
I'm not saying you're going to look for a different job,

58
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.800
but if you're going to look for a different job,
you're not going to,

59
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:23.770
unless your cvs updated,
you go going to,

60
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:27.070
unless you can get a good recommendation from this boss that's a tyrant.

61
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.900
That's right.
There's you gotta play the,

62
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.010
there's 10 strategic actions that you're going to have to take in order to make

63
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.610
yourself able to move laterally or up.

64
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.170
And the truth is isn't going in and yelling at your boss and telling him

65
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:45.250
everything you think about them.
The truth is trying to figure out the very,

66
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:48.460
very difficult process of how you put yourself in a better position.

67
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.750
And that that are like,

68
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.800
one of the things that's quite fun about this lecture tour is the letters that I

69
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:58.360
received or the stories that people tell me about switching jobs because they do

70
00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:03.310
realize that there,
and I often talk to people about consulting their resentment.

71
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.240
Resentments are really useful emotion.
Like it's really dangerous.

72
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.200
It's one of the most dangerous psychological states,
I believe.

73
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.850
But it's unbelievably useful because resentment usually only means one of two

74
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:19.450
things.
It either means quit whining and,

75
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.980
and take it on because you're immature or it means you're allowing yourself to

76
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:26.950
be taken advantage of and you have something to say or do.

77
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.240
And so you want to sort out the first part and find out if you're just being

78
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:35.890
immature and you can think that through and you can talk to people.
Um,
but,

79
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.870
and that,
but if it's the second,
it's like,
no,

80
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:40.960
you've compromised yourself in a variety of ways and you have to figure out how

81
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:43.060
to get out of that.
And if you're resentful,

82
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:47.050
that's evidence that you have in fact done that.
Okay,

83
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:48.400
so now the issue would be,

84
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:52.030
well how can you set your life up so that you can be without that resentment?

85
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.320
And so that's when you start to develop a strategy for you know,
and,
and it,

86
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.480
there's actually an adventure in this too.

87
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.710
I mean I've had a number of clients who have been in jobs that they didn't like

88
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:05.920
it all and you know,
they were tyrannized by someone for example,

89
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:10.090
and they were also working below their hypothetical level and we'd put together

90
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:11.230
a plan.
It's like,
okay,

91
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.460
you're going to make three times as much money in five years.
That's the Plat.

92
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.720
But like that's not going to be simple.
So you,
there's education,

93
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.660
you got to educate yourself maybe formerly cause you've got holes,

94
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.210
you got to fix up your resume,
you've got to,

95
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.760
you've got to overcome your fear of being interviewed.

96
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.980
You have to start sending out like 50 resumes a week on a regular basis and be

97
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:35.140
prepared for a 99% rejection rate.

98
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.560
You're going to look for a different job in is probably going to take six months

99
00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:40.960
to a year and almost all of that is going to be rejection.

100
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.550
And you go to steel yourself from for that and prepare and maybe this is going

101
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:49.870
to be a three year process.
It's no trivial thing,
but you know,

102
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.110
it's almost inevitably can't remember a single example where the consequence of

103
00:05:56.411 --> 00:05:57.800
that very careful,

104
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.980
detailed strategic thinking wasn't a massively substantive improvement in

105
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.460
socioeconomic positioning and a great movement towards a UN on improving

106
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:11.300
trajectory and,
and,

107
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.930
and there's advantages even along the way because even before that happens,

108
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.460
the fact that you're taking genuine steps to put yourself in a better situation

109
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.580
immediately starts to reduce your resentment,

110
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:25.250
even if it isn't having positive consequences to begin with.

111
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.620
But you have to be realistic about it.
It's like,
look,

112
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:30.200
it's going to be hard to update your CV because you're embarrassed about it and

113
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:33.950
you should be right.
It's no wonder you're embarrassed about it.
And then,
well,

114
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.890
of course you don't want to go be interviewed because you're not very good at
it.

115
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.950
And,
and there's holes in your story and,
and your,

116
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.220
and you can be made nervous easily and you're not a very good advocate for

117
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:46.960
yourself.
So there's a lot of improvement that needs to be done there.
And,
uh,

118
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.030
and then you have to withstand the,
the,
the,

119
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.520
the punishment of being constantly rejected when you apply for jobs because the

120
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:59.270
baseline rejection rate,
you know,
for the,
for the typical job,

121
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:02.690
applicant is like 99%.
It's like the rejection rate for everything.

122
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.020
Is this gonna work?
No,
but if you do it a hundred times,

123
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.200
it might work once and that's all you need.
That's exactly it.
You,
you,

124
00:07:10.201 --> 00:07:14.180
you only need that once.
And so the truth there isn't to yell at your boss.

125
00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:16.150
The truth there is to get your life together.
Yeah.
