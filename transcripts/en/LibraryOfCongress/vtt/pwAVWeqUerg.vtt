00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.700
&gt;&gt; Constance Carter: During my
career at the Library of Congress,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.690
I had many adventures, but one
of my favorites was being found

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.760
out by the Library of
Congress to work with the staff

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.920
of the curator's office
on the botany

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.040 position:56%
of the Lyndon Johnson china service.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.620 position:56%
There I met the charming and
knowledgeable curator Betty Monkman.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.300
From her days as a
registrar of the White House

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.100
in the late 1960's she has learned
the provenance of every painting,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.990
every sculpture, and
every piece of furniture.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.300
Betty will be signing her
book "The White House:

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.540
Its Historic Furnishings and
First Families" from 4:30 to 5:30.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.820
Betty introduced me to Bill
Allman, the present curator

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.600
of the White House who had been
so helpful to reference librarians

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.010
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.800
He can always be counted on to
provide the odd fact or a quote.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.840
And he's stopped us lots
of times from misquoting.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.430
Betty -- Bill has been a
White House staffer since 1976

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.190
and was appointed curator in 2002.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.200
He knows the residence
that some of us call it

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.600
or the mansion from stem to stern.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.270
And as well as the people who
run it and those who live there.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.310
Allman is the author of
"Official White House China

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.140
From the 18th to the 21st Century."

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.730
He will be signing
from 4:30 to 5:30 also.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.570 position:56%
So let's welcome Bill to the podium.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.370
Thank you.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:54.800
[ Applause ]

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.100
&gt;&gt; William Allman: Good
afternoon everybody.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.930
It's really a pleasure to be here.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.050
Book festival is such
a great institution.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.870
And I remember being at the White
House when it got its inception

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.830 position:56%
with you know the instigation from
a First Lady Barbara Busch was in --

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.440
instrumental in getting
it started and so.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.810 position:56%
The White House Historical
Association is our very much beloved

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.160
support agency, support
outside authority, non-profit.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.580
And they do a lot of the, the
publishing for the White House.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.410
They were, they were started
by Mrs., by the incentive

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.150
of Mrs. Kennedy in 1961 to publish
a guide book The White House

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.500
and Historic Guide to
be sold to the public

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.550
as they were coming
through on tours.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.460 position:56%
And little by little it's grown into
five different kinds of guidebooks

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.020
and a and a number of other
wonderful historic volumes,

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.640
two of which we will
be signing today.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.350 position:56%
The china book actually didn't start

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.050
as a White House Historical
Association project,

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.550
it was done by Margaret Klapthor
who was the wonderful curator

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.410
at the National Museum of
American History that dealt

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.380
with the first lady's hall,
the first lady's gowns,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.480
the china exhibition there,
worked in the 1950's with the --

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.200
Mrs. Eisenhower to help improve
the china room at the White House.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.670
So in 1975 she published
the first edition of the

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.200
"Official Whitehouse China."

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.450
And so the current book is
actually the 3rd edition.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.880
It's been brought up to date
in 2008 and then it was brought

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.440
up to date most recently because we

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.900
since 2008 have three new
state services of china.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.970
All of which were funded by the
Whitehouse Acquisition Trust

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.390
which is a branch of the
Whitehouse Historical Association.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.350
And so earlier this year they came
to, to use with you're the source

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.400
of the information and we're
the source of the money

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.620
for both the china and
the book and wouldn't --

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.540
and we would like to
publish a new edition

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.560
and bring everything up to date.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.790
And so it was kind of
a hard moment for me

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.160
because Mrs. Klapthor is
you know sort of a mentor

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.440
for me and a mentor for Betty.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.310
And we worked with her for many,
many years on the first edition

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.860
and then worked on
the second edition.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.870
To be listed as the author
is sort of a misnomer

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.710
but it's apparently
stylistically correct for a,

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.340
you know the current author
of the most recent additions

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.280
to a book written by a
previously deceased author

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.390
to get the credit so.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.680
Anyway I'm kicking and screaming
I permitted my name to be put

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.650
on the book as somehow
the principle author

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.240
but with a very carefully worded
underline that says "based

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.990
on previous editions
by Margaret Klapthor,

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.670
Betty Monkman and Susan Detweiler."

00:04:52.670 --> 00:05:00.210
So the Whitehouse started out
as simply a house and an office.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.020
It became an attraction.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.320
It became a stage.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.990
It remained until 1961
for Mrs. Kennedy to sort

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.210
of say I think it should have a
more formalized museum function

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.250
to take it from historic site
and attraction into a place

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.340
that people could come and
truly learn about the presidents

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.270
and the first lady's
and their families.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.600
About American fine arts,
American decorative arts.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.260
The earliest collection within
the Whitehouse would have been the

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.170
portraits of the presidents
and first lady's.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.010
That starts with the great standing
portrait of George Washington

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.020
that hangs in the east room that
was hanging when the house opened

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.660 position:56%
in 1800 and then was rather
famously saved from the fire of 1814

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.880
by first lady Dolly Madison.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.450
But it really remained until the
late 1850's for the government

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.360
to say "oh, George
Washington is fine,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.300
but what about the other guys?".

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.900
And, and so they, they the
commissioned George Ely

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.270
who had painted like portraits of
some of the intervening presidents

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.120
and they really started the idea

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.630
that they would collect
portraits and, and, and,

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.250 position:56%
and so where as decorative arts
were changing as, as styles changed,

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.710
the portraits became a collection.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.830
Early in the 20th Century there
was a wonderful big folio volume

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.160
of reproductions of official
portraits of the presidents.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.020
So ever since the, the art owned

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.730
by the Whitehouse has been
deemed the official works.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.630
But the second major part
of the collecting a first

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.880
for any collection was the china.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.650
That started in 1889 when first
lady Caroline Harrison came

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:42.950
to the Whitehouse.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.830
She was a practical
homemaker form Indianapolis.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.280
She was a practitioner of the
Victorian art of china painting

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.450
and actually brought -- had
classes at the Whitehouse with a

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.200
with a teacher who instructed
Mrs. Harrison and cabinet members,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.040
and cabinet members daughters and
other friends in china painting.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.820 position:56%
She was the first president of the
Daughters of the American Revolution

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.930
so she was very interested
in American history.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.020 position:56%
And at the beginning of the Harrison
administration they started the

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.630
first 100 years of the presidency.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.360
So it, so it, so it was
a very historic moment

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.330
when Mrs. Harrison arrived.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.110
She started going down
into the depths

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.500
of the buildings saying
"what's on the shelves."

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.880
"What can people tell
me who are on the staff

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.390
about what's on the shelves?"

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.690
"Is this historic china?"

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.530
"Is this you know, what's
interesting about this?"

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.620
It started the idea that this was
a way to demonstrate the tastes

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.150
of people who had come before.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.150
Because what people don't always
know is that it was perfectly legal

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.520
in the 19th century, congress would
say here's some money to move in

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.590
and if that's not enough
have a garage sale.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:53.710
And basically dispose
of those things

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.300
that you don't find
fashionable any longer.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.200
Now in the china department many
times I think that was a result

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.370
in breakage if there
wasn't enough of a service

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.290
to actually continue using it.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.900
Then perhaps the service
would be discarded at auction

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.610
or simply being given away.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.010
So the china collection
she started working on it.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.580
There was a very a, a, a famous
journalist named Abby Gunn Baker

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.860
who was brought in around the
turn of the century to work

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.200 position:56%
with Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, Edith.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.920
And in a establishing a the history
of the various services and going

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.340
to family members and saying please
donate pieces to the Whitehouse

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.630
so we can represent even those
people who are not represented.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.980
There was not always a
formal state china purchase

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.390
for every administration.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.140
That's a common misconception
as well

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.120
that there's one every time
there's a change of administration.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.450
Many times it was a question

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.240
of how recently had the
previous one been acquired,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.980
how fashionable did it remain?

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.890
How little hopefully
breakage had occurred.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.460
And so the china collection
was started.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.780
Pieces were pulled out of
storage and placed on exhibit

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.540
in the ground floor quarter.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.960
They bought two wonderful Gustav
Stickley arts and crafts bookcases

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.840
to be the, the china storage space.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.160
They had just rebuilt
the east terrace.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.810 position:56%
So now all of the visitors came in
through the east, the new east wing,

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.470
past these two china
display cabinets.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:28.600
And so it was made a formal
exhibition unlike anything else

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.770
that the Whitehouse had ever known.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.940
So it -- but there really wasn't
anything written about it other

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.260
than what Abby Gunn Baker
did until Mrs. Klapthor

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.660
and the first big formal book
on Whitehouse china services.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.270
If you want to know about
some of them I mean the, the,

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.140
the have examples of all the state
services now except the Andrew

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.980
Jackson in the Whitehouse
china collection.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.180
In many cases these are pieces
that have come back to us

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.040
because they got away
either via the auctions.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.650
Occasionally we've been told
presidents would simply give

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:06.950
away china.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:13.610
We reacquired five dinner plates
form the James K. Polk state china

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.050
with the family provenance of
President Lincoln gave them

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.800
to Ms. Barber one plate
for every haircut.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.870
And the family had
these five plates.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.600
And they sold them sort of
back to us one at a time

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.370
as they needed some
more money I think.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:32.540
And so -- but we, we've
found things at auction

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.930
and so we're very fortunate

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.950
in having examples of
the various china's.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.290
The first truly formal service
in the sense of being designed

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:47.390
to be presidential was the dinner
and dessert service ordered

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:53.250
by James Monroe for the rebuilt
Whitehouse after the fire of 1814.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:58.790
Wonderful shipping vouchers that
described furniture and textiles

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.860
and things that were bought
for that refurbishing.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.800
We don't have any pieces
in our collection

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.030
of what the dinner service
might have looked like,

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:14.710
but the dessert service was a
wonderful deep red colored border

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.260
with five individual
little tiny reserves

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:24.320
where specifically described in the
bill as representing arts, science,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:30.530
commerce, maritime, and
what they called strength,

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.170
which was basically
cannons, and swords,

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.190
and guns in the little reserve.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.710
So this china it was
used for a while.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.440 position:56%
It got away in the mid 19th century.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.970
As far as we can tell it went to
an auction house in Washington

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.280
where the auctioneers actually
took a liking to the china

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.190
and perhaps didn't
not sell it at all

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.660
or bought it you know
from the government.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:59.440 position:56%
A great barrel full of it ended up
in the hands of Henry Francis DuPont

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.170
at the Winterthur museum up in
Delaware where he had you know

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.410
like 80 pieces of this china.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.010
Mostly plates and they were just
kind of stacked up on a sideboard.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.520
They, they, they really
weren't treating it

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.250
as any kind of a great acquisition.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:16.740
The Whitehouse had
one plate on exhibit.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.240
Couldn't persuade Winterthur to
lend any to the Whitehouse partly

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.000
because for a long time
they had a prohibition

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.890
against lending outside the
boundaries of their museum.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:31.750
But as a result in the 1980's
we got a call from a member

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.600
of the other branch of
the family you know.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.220
So this is -- these pieces
went to DuPont through one side

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.830
of the family and here was
the owner of the pieces

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.830
in the other side of the family.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:47.800
Only eight but a wonderful big
ice pail, or ice cream cooler,

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.820
baskets, and a few plates.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.060
So he said I think the Whitehouse
deserves some of this service

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.730
because Whittier's
hoarding the rest of it.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:13:00.730
And so anyhow we got what we think
are the choicer pieces perhaps

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.900
because there's more variety
of form in what we have then,

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.760
then what Winterthur in fact has.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.500 position:56%
The Polk china that I mentioned
the, the, the was purchased in 1845.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.880
And all of these were French.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.690 position:56%
There wasn't any American china
being bought until the 20th century.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:23.350 position:56%
The Polk china -- the Monroe china
had a beautiful eagle at the center.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:29.020
An eagle with the American shield
emblazoned on its, on its chest.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.930
Taken form you know the great seal

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.490
of the United States
variations on diplomatic emblems.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:39.640
There wasn't a presidential
seal codified for a long time.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.200
For the Polk china they
simply put an American shield.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.100
You know the little shield with
the red stripes and the blue canton

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.670
up at the top on the edge
of a white dinner service

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.310
and then wonderful dessert
service was apple green borders

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.080
and each plate was painted
with a with a flower.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.470
And so we have examples
of some of that china.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:04.940
The Pierce china was
the next at 1853.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.030
It was showed at The Great
Crystal Palace Exhibit

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.870
in New York that year.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.590
President Pierce attended.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.200
He was showing two services
by a company that wanted

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.600
to make china for the Whitehouse.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.240
There was one with a little shield

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.070
at the center and the
letter P on it.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.120
And then there was one that
had an American eagle on it.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.020
Well he picked the
one with the shield

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.980
but he very wisely said it's
not for me it's for the nation

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.590
and don't put my initial
on it because it belongs

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.870
to the people not to
me personally and so.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:40.780
All of that china disappeared
except one enormous center piece.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.790
It stands about as
tall as this podium.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:47.240
And has a basket, three
graces standing there holding

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.780
up the basket.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.900
Somewhere by the early 20th century

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.620
when Abby Gunn Baker was
doing her research, this,

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.600
this center piece became the
Dolly Madison china instead

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.900
of the Franklin Peirce china.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.830
So they moved it like 40 years
early and seemed to ignore the fact

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.730
that well Dolly Madison's
china if it was bought

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.970
by the government would have been
destroyed in the fire of 1814

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.240
and so it's very unlikely that
it's Dolly Madison's at all.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.300
Which ultimately it was a
more properly identified

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.480
with the good help of,
of Margaret Klapthor.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.710 position:56%
The earliest state service for which
we considered dining is the Lincoln.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.030
It's called the Royal Purple.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.300
It has deep purple border.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:36.370
An eagle very much like what was
on the Monroe china from 1817.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:41.910
And a -- so I mean these services
were getting bigger in numbers.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:47.210
These early services has
lots of serving pieces.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.800
So you would have dozens of
this kind of plate maybe three

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.560
or four types of plate but
then you'd have fruit baskets,

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.800
and compotes, and ice pails, and
butter dishes and things as part

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:03.140
of the china service rather
than using silver or glass.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.020
And so the Lincoln had an
abundance of these kinds of things.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.890
Three tiered stands, two tiered
stands with custard cups put all

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:13.570
around it for fancy entertaining.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:18.220
Enormous punch bowls which
we still have both of them.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.160
And so if you were to
-- if a first lady were

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.970
to say can we dine
off the Lincoln china,

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:28.190
there are enough dinner plates and
soup plates to actually set a table

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:31.280
for maybe 10 or 12 people.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.770
Usually what happens then is

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:37.360
and the first ladies immediately
understand the wisdom of it is

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.330
that you put it on the table and
all the guests come in and you get

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.580
to say how beautiful
the Lincoln china is

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.160
and the butler takes the
plate away and brings you food

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:49.730
on something that's not so
fragile and so old and so rare.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.370
So the -- but the Lincoln china --

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:57.460
when Mrs. Lincoln left the
Andrew Johnsons' moved in.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:03.550 position:56%
There was a huge amount of pilferage
as a result of Mrs. Lincoln being

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:08.110
in the house for more than a month
after her husband's assassination.

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:13.930
The Johnsons' giving her you
know sort of quiet time upstairs.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:18.420
And the public simply came in
and took what they wanted and --

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.000
including cutting the
tassels off the drapes

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.890 position:56%
and taking pieces off the upholstery
and pieces of the china so.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.050
The Johnson' actually
reordered the Lincoln china

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:33.940
and so we have now china that has
a series of differences sometimes

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.320
in makers marks, sometimes
in the quality

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.680
of the application of the eagle.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:43.370 position:56%
In fact the Lincoln ones were
probably an outline was drawn and a,

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.440
and a decal was almost put on.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.830
Where the Andrew Johnson pieces
were probably pained by hand

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.250
and so there's variations
in the china

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:55.640
but a good bit of it in the house.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.340
The most exotic service ever
ordered was for President

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.390
and Mrs. Rutherford B. Hayes.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:05.340
They hired Theodore Davis who was
an illustrator for Harper's Weekly

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.650
and he spent a summer at a
cottage on the New Jersey shore

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:14.980
where he designed a service of
American plants and animals.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.460
Now what the manufacturer
didn't know was

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.710
that you know they had priced this
out as you'll give me one design

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:26.070
for a dinner plate and one
design for a soup plate

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.050
and we'll make a service.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:33.560
And Davis comes back with
12 designs for each course.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.540
So and new shapes.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.490
Nothing that was going
to be a mold that,

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.710
that poor Haviland actually had.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.640
So they had to retool for
the forms and then they had

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:47.140
to make 12 different
designs for each course.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:52.740
So for dinner there was a buffalo,
a wild pig, a, a raccoon things

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.680
that might be served
for dinner courses.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.860
Soup had frogs and okra plants and
things that might be served for,

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.940
for soup and the same thing for
game plates and fish plates.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.920
Ice cream was served on a snowshoe.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.770
And so this is a service where
we have about 500 pieces.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:16.280
I think it was popular for a while
then it went quickly out of favor

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.330
at least by the late 19th century

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.280
for being just a wee
bit too Victorian.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.860
But it was the only time the
government ever permitted the,

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:31.300
the vendor the manufacturer to
make it for the public as opposed

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.370
to it being exclusive
for the Whitehouse.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:34.670
But it had separate marks.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.350
So if you have a piece of the
service, it's very beautiful

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:41.340
and its original absolutely period,
but it has a mark on the back

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.960
that will say patented

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.000
which represents what could
be bought by the public.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.200 position:56%
But the patented pieces are in many
major museum collections as examples

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.740
of the style that was being
set at Whitehouse tables.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:59.420
So what -- the last
non-American china was ordered

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:03.090
by Theodore Roosevelt in 1903 that
was made at Wedgewood in England.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:07.440
And then the Wilson's came in --

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.770
Theodore Roosevelt had
been presented options

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.970
from china factories in Ohio

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:16.960
and West Virginia offering we can
finally make a good American china.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:21.850
And he still wasn't
convinced so in 1917 Lenox

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:26.090
in Trenton New Jersey became the
first American china manufacturing

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.810
company to sell a service
to the White house.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:33.320
All the 20th century china's
have been much more formal.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:38.490 position:56%
A band of color, textured gilt bands
around the rim and the shoulder

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.580
and then usually a
variation of some sort

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.470
on the presidential
seal at the center.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:49.520
And the services have
gotten enormously bigger.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.540
They went to -- the
dining room prior

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:57.070
to 1902 seated maybe 40
people 50 people max.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:02.770
The 1917 service for the
Wilson's was made for 120

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.130
because the dining
room was now bigger.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:10.950
We now find that the
dining room can seat 134.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.750
So basically all the china's
up through Truman were made

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:18.630
for 120 start out short if
there's been no breakage.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.810
And so the, the more modern
services have been made

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.800
in increasingly large numbers.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.430
The Johnson's for 216,
the Reagan 220

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:31.070
and then the three
most recent services

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:35.570
which was the reason I'm being
speaking today what I wrote

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.080
about in the new addition
of our china book

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:44.500
that represents the Clinton's,
and the Busch, George W. Busch

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.630
and then President and Mrs. Obama
that have been ordered for 320.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:53.670
So that we can have enough to
set dinner in the east room,

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:54.970
dinner in the dining room, dinner

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.180
in the dining room plus
some in the parlors.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.110
Not outdoors.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.360
We don't let the good
china go to the tents.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.130
So they rent china for the
outdoor meals almost all the time.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:10.260
Very occasionally we might let
something go out to be ceremonial.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.410
So these recent china services --

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:19.830
actually when President and Mrs.
Clinton arrived, they did something

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:23.970
that we thought was really very
brilliant and said "we don't want

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:28.560
to order new china, we just want
to supplement one of the old ones."

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.790
You know "there's not enough pieces
of the Franklin Roosevelt china

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:35.010
to set all the tables
we need, we like them."

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.310
"We like the blue color and we

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:39.010
like the big blue plates form
the Wilson's state service,

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:43.000
how about we just go back to Lenox
and say can we make some more?"

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.300
And we thought wow that's
a brilliant idea I mean

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.600
so we ordered more.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.300
We had to make some concessions
to the fact they didn't want

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:56.380
to retool some of the 1917, 1918
forms were no longer the same forms

00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:00.040 position:56%
that we -- in their production line.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.320
And then we were very careful
to make them all differently

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:08.690
so every new piece has the original
old mark plus a new Lenox mark

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:12.230
with the date 1994
underneath it and so.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:16.620
So we thought that was
going to be the end of it.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.920
Then our good friends

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.260
at the Whitehouse Historical
Association decided

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:26.880
that for the November 2000, 200th
anniversary of the first occupancy

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.490
of the Whitehouse by John and
Abigail Adams that they would want

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:34.400
to sponsor a big gala
historical dinner.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:40.280 position:56%
And they suggested maybe we needed a
big historical gala dinner service.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.660
And so suddenly there was
a new china on the horizon.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:49.790
Mrs. Clinton took a very great
interest in the designing of it.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.920
And so you know very quickly,

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.420 position:56%
originally it was called you know
this is to be the anniversary china.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.120
Maybe it was going to
be the millennial china

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.130
because it came in 2000.

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:04.030 position:56%
But as we expected it pretty quickly
became called the Clinton china.

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:09.230
And so it was unveiled at this
dinner where we were in the midst

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.840
of the disputed election
of, of that fall.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:17.060
You know the hanging chads in,
in Florida and all the things

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.790
that went on, the Supreme Courte
decision about awarding votes.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:25.430 position:56%
And so here's a dinner where they've
invited all the previous former

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.150
first lady's and presidents.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.530
So everyone is in attendance except
for President and Mrs. Reagan

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:33.070
because the president was
already in really bad health.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:36.180
So Mrs. Johnson, the
Ford's, the Carter's,

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.510
the Busch's who's son was
one of the two candidates

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.120
who hadn't been decided

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.750
and the Clinton's who's vice
president was the other side

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.050
of who haven't been decided.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:48.210
And so it was like
okay is this going

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.280
to be a peaceful dinner or not?

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.170
You know and what was really
wonderful we got invited,

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:57.540
the staff some of the -- at least
the curator staff got invited

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.910
to be dinner guests.

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:04.130
And that nothing but great
things were said about the staff.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.710
That was really the focus
of the, of the dinner.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:09.140
President Ford, President Carter
they kept saying the Whitehouse is

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.440
such a wonderful home.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.740
We had such a good time.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.040 position:56%
The staff took such good care of us.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.390
You can't believe how
wonderful the staff is.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.330
We're sitting there going
okay this worked out alright.

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.050
You know we, we didn't
have any problems

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.880
and we actually got you know touted

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.660
for all the hard work
people do and so.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:28.520
But I think that may have
kind of set us on a trend

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:33.820
to possibly having a new
service for every administration.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.480
It's a storage nightmare.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.700
I have to absolutely honest.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.800
And so it was fairly late in
the Busch administration that,

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.410
that Mrs. Laura Busch suggested
a china service being made.

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.970
I think it starts to be looked
on sort of legacy project.

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:52.810 position:56%
Something they want to leave behind.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:57.840
This time around Mrs. Obama looked
much more early into the concept

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.860
of wanting a new service
partly to be billed

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.180
on the idea they were
getting publicity

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:08.840
for modern taste modern
art abstract art

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.560
and could a china service be made

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:15.990
that would you know be more
streamlined a little bit less

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.470
historic looking?

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:21.200
But as Mrs. Obama very clearly
said "I want it to be able to mix

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.050
and match with all the
rest of the services."

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:27.050
So some of the things that were
talked about in early meetings

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:31.840
with our chefs about oh what is
trending now are square plates.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.540
And it's like square plates are
not going with the round plates

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.850
and all the rest of the service.

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:38.050
And so we had to deal
with the issue too.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:42.270
A chef will tell you if they had
their choice the plate is white.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.110
The food is what needs to show.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:47.650
The color on the plate is a
distraction from the food.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:51.060
And it's like well I don't think
an all white service is really what

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.360
gets chosen here.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.430
And so then you know you
start working on the thing.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.570
Designs go back and forth
and then suddenly you get a

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.370
reelection campaign.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.030
And so things go to
a halt for a while

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:05.710
until you see whether you get
reelected and then you pick

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.960
up where you left off and so.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.470
So we have another new service.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:16.520
These services have been 12
14 pieces per place setting.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.450
320 place settings.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:23.480
So you're looking at
4,000 pieces per service.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.730
Not so many cups and
saucers anymore.

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.720
The traditional service is almost
always had a cream soup cup

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.460
and a bullion cup and a
tea cup, demitasse cup

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.970
and sometimes a cocktail cup.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.270
Like Mrs. Reagan.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.570
Mrs. Reagan when she came

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.050
to the house she knew
exactly what she wanted.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:43.610
This was the most expeditious
service that was ever ordered

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:48.360
because she had it like -- we
got it early in the second year.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.660
I mean it was all you know --

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.750
it was in the works almost the
moment she arrived at the house.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.730
It's got 19 pieces
per place setting.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:57.930
Cereal bowls, fruit bowl all
the things that if you were here

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:59.400
for a bowl -- let's
talk about desserts.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.350
I think she was already
imagining having desserts

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.200
that were only just a couple
of bites but beautifully done

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.460
and they needed all
these fancy little bowls.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.360
Some of which I don't
think have ever been

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.610
out of their storage
racks but none the less.

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:15.420
We have them if we ever need them.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:22.260 position:56%
And so china has kind of evolved,
and evolved, and evolved and so the,

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.840
the new book that, that
has just come out is a,

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.020
is a very historically minded book.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.290
It's not a all picture book.

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:34.700
Is has wonderful illustrations of
all these wonderful china services.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:38.080
But there's a lot of technical
detail there about you know bills,

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:43.090
and sizes of pieces and prices of
pieces and quantities and things.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:48.420 position:56%
So you know it, it's a read that you
can enjoy a lot of it and maybe some

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.640
of it is only truly
for the collector.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.670
Because you have to remember there
are collectors out there because of

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.570
that you know 19 century
was legal for china to leave

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.690
and so there are people who
have collected and bought and --

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.010
Robert McNeal was a big
collector in Philadelphia

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:04.830
and he left his entire
china collection

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.480
to the Philadelphia Museum of Art

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.840
and they now have a
gallery devoted just

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.710
to his presidential
china collection.

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:18.210
So the sort of the parallel
book to this is the one

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:21.580
that Connie mentioned what they
call the Decorative Arts Book.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.800
White House its Historic
furnishings and First Families

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:30.320
which was first published in
2000 as an anniversary project

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.650
at the same time as we were working

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.440
on the china service
for Mrs. Clinton.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.850
And it's was revised
in 2008 we're up --

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:40.950
brought more up to date in 2008.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:43.550
That's the most recent edition.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:45.610
Betty did a fantastic text.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:50.160
I mean it's just the absolute
perfect you know history of kind

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.490
of everything that happened
over time in the Whitehouse

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:54.950
in regards to the decorative arts.

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:57.290
Because you know here's
this collection or portraits

00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:00.640
that everybody sees but people
don't know so much about furniture

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.750
and the lighting fixtures and
the carpets and the silver

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.330
and glassware and things.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:09.600
And so records are pretty
good on a lot of these things.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.400
Sometimes records disappear

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.130
and so you piece it
together as best you can.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:16.030
We don't own everything
because there were lots

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.220
of these sales and things got away.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:22.270
So when that book was,
was produced my job was

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:24.540
to do the catalogue
section at the back.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:28.020
And coordinate all the photography
of the objects that we had

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.290
that we wanted to use
for illustrations.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:35.970
And so it's a, it's a -- if I say
so myself it's a really fine book

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.750
about the, the subject of
décor in the Whitehouse

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:42.490
and what it tells people
about how things changed.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:47.660
The Whitehouse wasn't
always 100% up to date

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.950
but it was probably a
good example to the,

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:53.750
to the nation of you know people
could come in and see the rooms

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.390
and they could admire the choices.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:59.190
Sometimes there wasn't enough
money in those allocations

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.240
and not enough money
made by the garage sales

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:06.440
to actually keep everything
looking neat, trim and pristine.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:11.530
But usually fairly often there was
a redecoration in the 19th century

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:14.970
so the house was pretty
much up to date.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:17.210
So when you arrive in 1901

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:19.840
and here's Theodore Roosevelt
who's very much a student

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.580
of the colonial revival
and the interest

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:27.580
in 18th and earlier style décor.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:31.030
Looking at this house going
wonderful 18th century shelf built

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.610
between 1792 and 1800.

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:38.580
Very ugly interior based on
all this Victorian stuff.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:44.930 position:56%
And so there was the last of the big
public auctions when you know tons

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:49.190
of things were removed including
an enormous Tiffany stained glass

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:52.000
screen that had been installed
in the entrance hall one

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.880
of Tiffany's first big commissions.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.380
350 square feet of red, white,

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:02.070
and blue Tiffany glass was
hauled off to the auction.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:05.180
Sold to man who had a hotel
on the Chesapeake Bay.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.120
Presumably installed in his hotel.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:11.420
And then when the hotel burned
down in the early 1920's the screen

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.020
as far as we know was
melted into oblivion.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.620
So there's a black and white
photograph in existence.

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:20.160
Some color attempts at interpreting
what it might have looked like.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.390
But, but the why is Theodore
Roosevelt did hire McKinley

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:24.690
and White the great
architectural firm.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:28.920
And they did to the insides of
the Whitehouse let's freeze it.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.330
Let's make it look colonial.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:33.990
Let's make it look a little bit
empire and stop having it change

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:37.980
with every administration to the
point where the American Institute

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:42.380 position:56%
of Architects actually sent a
letter saying it should be preserved

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.420
untouched forever and ever.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.260
Kind of presuming that there should
be no effort by other first lady's

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.310
and presidents to leave
there mark on the house.

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:54.150
And so, but what it means is we
don't really have a 20th century

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:55.820
collection in the decorative arts.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.810
We don't have art deco
furniture or nouveau things

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:05.110 position:56%
because they simply were only you
know living with these faux antiques

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:09.490 position:56%
that Theodore Roosevelt bought which
then Mrs. Kennedy took a big step

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:13.900
and said let's leave it at the
periods, let's just take a lot

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.070
of the faux antiques out
and put the real thing

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:19.280
in so they public would be
seeing wonderful things.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.820
And she also said we can't
just have portraits we have

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:27.150
to have great artwork
representing landscapes, seascapes,

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:29.410
still lives in the art collection.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:32.380 position:56%
And so our art collection has grown.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.910
Our decorative arts
collection has grown.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.560
We still add to the
decorative art collection.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:42.650
Every fist family buys things
for their private quarters.

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:44.550 position:56%
Funds are allocated by the congress.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:47.470
Many times those funds
are now declined in favor

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:51.890
of having other sources of funds
so it's not tax dollars being spent

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:55.780
on making their, their
quarters comfortable for them.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:01.510
But as a result we inherit a
lot of overstuffed furniture.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:05.850
Sofas and chairs which
we've been told

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:10.710
by the fire marshal a big
hazard for our storehouse.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:14.820
And so but they don't become
museum collection right away.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.660
We kind of let them,
let them evolve a while.

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:20.830
Let them be used by multiple
presidents before we say okay we're

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.360
going to take every one
of these pieces and,

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:28.470
and add it to the permanent
collection for museum purposes so.

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:35.620
We do not deaccession and so partly
because nobody wants a first lady

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:41.620
to whole sale get rid of the taste
of the preceding first lady's.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.970
And we don't lend to
anyone but the Smithsonian.

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:48.270
And occasionally the
National Archives most often

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:51.380
to the Presidential Library
because there's a natural affinity.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.660
But that was set up early in
Kennedy's time with the idea

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:57.320
that the Whitehouse didn't
need to have everybody asking

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.030
to borrow something
from the Whitehouse

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.200
and then have 15 things
off the walls

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.330
so the public wouldn't
be able to see it and so.

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:06.870
So the deco arts book,
the china book

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:08.430
and we have a wonderful
fine arts book.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:13.180 position:56%
Those are kind of the three you know
major publications that have come

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.590
from the Whitehouse
Historical Association as sort

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:17.950
of collaborations with our office.

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:22.250
But we also work very closely with
them on a quarterly journal and,

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:26.600
and editing and providing
materials for that.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.830
Symposium that they stage usually
comes with you know some input

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:35.010
from our office about that, that
materials going to be published

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:38.890
or subject matters that are going
to be addressed in symposium.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:42.590
So it's a, it's a great working
relationship that we have

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:48.650 position:56%
and we're very happy to have them
as our partners and we're very happy

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.440
to have these books available.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:56.280
And if we see you downstairs, we'll
be happy to sign them for you so.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.580
Please if there's any questions,

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.510
I'd be more than happy
to a hear from you.

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:10.790
[ Applause ]

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:12.600
&gt;&gt; Yes ma'am.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.620
&gt;&gt; I understand the concept

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.490
of each administration
buying its set of china.

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:22.620
Do they do similar things
with glassware and cutlery?

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:27.280
&gt;&gt; No. We kind of hoped at
one point that maybe one

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:32.490 position:56%
of those china services would turn
into a new set of glassware instead.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:37.100
What we're finding is like
everyone can probably attest to,

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.820
the luxury trades in
America have gone

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.900
down the tubes to a large extent.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:48.600
Finding American glass
is almostt impossible.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:56.770
The glassware that Mrs. Kennedy
first ordered in 1961 sorry.

00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:00.870
The glassware that she bought you
know was just absolutely plane.

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:04.010
The previous glassware that
had been bought in the 1930's

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:05.870
for Franklin Roosevelt was cut.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:08.020
And she said I really think
we should have glassware

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.430
if you break it no one gets mad

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:15.000
because cut glass is
expensive and hard to replace.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.350
So it was made by a
company in West Virginia.

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:19.650
Then it was -- that company
was bought out and it was made

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.060
by another company in West Virginia

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.190
and then it was made
by a Company in Ohio.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.520
And it was made by Lenox
and then Lenox closed

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:31.040
up its glass factories
and so, so it's hard.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.520
The flatware we have two
principle services of flatware.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:40.050 position:56%
Gilded silver which is actually an
amalgamation of its storage silvers.

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:42.700
So there are forks from the 1890's,

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:46.180
knives from the 1920's,
spoons from the 1950's.

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:50.940
All kind of based on silver
from the Andrew Jackson era

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.520
that are often used
for state dinners.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.380
And then there's a silver
service that was provided

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.900
in the Ford administration
that we bought from Gorham.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.760
It was a pattern that was called
-- it's called King Charles.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.420
It's actually the King
George pattern

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.000
or the Traditional King's pattern.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.950
They renamed it King Charles

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:11.830
because they were selling
it in historic Charleston.

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:16.570
And so, so it's used -- it does
not have Whitehouse written on it.

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:19.940
All the other earlier silvers
including the gilded service is

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:23.420
engraved Presidents House
which is the traditional words

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.000
on the silver services.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.470
The old early 19th century name
for it rather than Whitehouse.

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:33.960
So they, they seem to
serve our purposes well.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.880
You know there could be a time what
the first lady would say I wish we

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.970
had something that looked more
modern then these very 18th century

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:46.170
flatware services and the same
could be said for the glass.

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:48.970
I know our -- the head of our
food service people didn't'

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:50.270
like Mrs. Kennedy's glass.

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:53.930
By the time we were into the 21st
century said these are glasses

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:57.430
that are too small for
modern drinking and,

00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:01.740
and you know champagne should be a
flute and not a tulip and you know.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:05.990
So he would be all for
a new glass service.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:10.700
Oh yes?

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:13.920
&gt;&gt; I, I was wondering if you could
talk about the role of symbolism

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.570
and helping the first family
either choose a service

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:19.360
from a different administration
for a dinner party

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:23.140
or more permanent furniture
such as President Obama's choice

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:27.220
to use the resolute
desk in his oval office.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:33.790
&gt;&gt; Well the resolute desk is
a wonderful piece of furniture

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:36.690
that was commissioned by
Queen Victoria to give

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:40.640
to President Rutherford
Hayes in 1880.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:44.440
It's a great big partner's
kind of desk.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:49.630
Franklin Roosevelt commissioned a
presidential seal to inset so that

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:52.320
if he were sitting on the other
side you couldn't see his,

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.990
his leg braces.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:57.750
It was used in the private quarters

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:00.100
until President Kennedy
put it in the oval office.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.780
And that made a big, that was a
big symbolic statement bringing

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.610
out historic object
and Mrs. Kennedy's work

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:09.870
to be more museum like.

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:13.960
It then traveled as a result of
President Kennedy's assassination.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:18.650
It was like part of his package
and so it didn't come back

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:23.040
to the Whitehouse until President
Carter asked for it back in 1977.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.320
So it's been used by every
president in the oval office except

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:30.700 position:56%
for George H. W. Busch who preferred
to use his vice presidential desk

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.940
since he had a desk in the West
Wing for continuity, but he used it

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.970
in the private residence.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:40.820
Other things that are symbolic
obviously in this new china

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:46.190 position:56%
that the presidential seal has made
an appearance on three of the pieces

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:48.490
out of the 11 that are
part of the Obama china.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:51.640
The traditional places to put
it are on the service plate.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.120
The first thing you
see at the table.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.880
And the dessert plate the last
thing you see at the table.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.380
And the service plate is

00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:01.270
in the center you know no
foods actually served on it.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:03.260
In this case it's also on
the side of the little cup

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.460
and saucer that's part
of the last course.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:10.100
Other services had more eagles.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.970
Mrs. Johnson actually in,
in designing the china that,

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:17.960 position:56%
that Connie mentioned working on for
the flowers for the dessert plates.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.370
She took the eagle off
the 1817 Monroe china.

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:23.970
She really went back to
a historical president.

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:30.860 position:56%
Put a very early American version of
the eagle and then put wild flowers

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:34.390
around the, the, the, the
borders of some of the plates

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:36.980
to represent her interest
in the roadside

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.400
and the preservation of the land.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.770 position:56%
And then the 51 different dessert
plates had the state flower for each

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:46.800
of the 50 states and the
District of Columbia so.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.310
So sometimes symbolism
built into the china.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:53.790
I know with the, the Obama
china there's a certain amount

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:55.820
of streamlining in the design.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.440
And that was designed to
represent there interest

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:02.470 position:56%
in the abstract and the more modern.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:06.770
Mrs. Busch, Laura Busch picked
a very nontraditional eagle

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:08.070
for her state china.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:12.750 position:56%
It was an inlay in the sideboard in
the family dining room that had a --

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:15.220
sideboard that had
belonged to Daniel Webster

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:18.870
and she just thought you know
it was very much more naive

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:22.370
than a traditional you know defined

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.870
by a Harold Dreversen
[phonetic] kind of eagle.

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:29.790
But that's what she wanted so
that's what went on her china so.

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:32.860
And really our office is not
the arbiter of the design.

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:34.400
You know we suggest.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.220
We help with colors and looking
at the other earlier services.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:43.540
More often than not ours is a
question of quantities, shapes,

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.960
storability and things
that go into it.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:52.400
The china service beyond the
actual what makes it beautiful.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:57.670
&gt;&gt; Constance Carter: What, what
is served in the cocktail cup?

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.360
The only thing I could
possibly think

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.900
of is a Tom and Jerry, but usually.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.200
&gt;&gt; No. No.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.160
This is what they call cocktail
cup is a little tiny ramekin.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.960
You've got a ramekin you put the
shrimp in the ramekin whatever.

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.440
Then you put the cocktail
sauce in the.

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.740
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.040
&gt;&gt; It's not.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.980
&gt;&gt; I of course was
thinking of whiskey.

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:22.060
&gt;&gt; That's not a beverage cup.

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.440
&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.290
&gt;&gt; But sometimes they're used
for little tiny desserts.

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:28.840
You know crème Brule or
whatever can be put in the,

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.830
in the ramekins and things.

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:32.130
Yes sir.

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:33.940
&gt;&gt; So you have any record
of the china that was used

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.240
in the personal quarters?

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.270
I've got some pieces of a
Haviland china that came

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:43.210
down through my family and the
person they were acquired from said

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.320
that it was used by
Theodore Roosevelt.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.730
It's not the official pattern.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:50.830
And it's not the manufacturer
that you mentioned referenced

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:53.160
that Theodore Roosevelt used.

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:58.430 position:56%
What's the research approach that
you would use to -- or is there one?

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:03.320
&gt;&gt; Well. Usually its finding
those got any comparable

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:07.290
like the Sagamore Hill the
Theodore Roosevelt home have most

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:09.140
of that same china that
might have been used

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.260
in the private quarters
by the family.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.970
A lot of the you know some

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:15.480
for the presidents brought
china for that purpose.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.920
Some of them bought china
while they were in office.

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.170
In other cases some of these
like the Woodrow Wilson

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:24.990
and the Franklin Roosevelt china's
you know this is a state dinner

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:28.250
china service that
comes with oatmeal bowls

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:30.500
because it would be used
for serving breakfast just

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.360
as well as serving dinner.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:39.400 position:56%
There's, there's a much published
story about President Warren Harding

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:44.050
who had many illegal well I guess
poker parties were not illegal

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:47.710
but the drinking of booze at
the poker parties was illegal

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:50.490
under the, the Volstead Act.

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:56.140
But supposedly he gambled a
barrel of Whitehouse china.

00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:02.770
But we can't find where
there's a loss in the inventory

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.050
to represent that kind of thing.

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:08.020
So maybe it was the family china
that he was willing to give

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:11.230
up because he could buy
some more plausibly.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.520
But if you, you know you
could send us some pictures.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.410
I don't think we'll be the
best source but I would say

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:18.060
if it's really is Theodore
Roosevelt's the best place

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.370
to start is Sagamore Hill and see

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:23.040
if by any chance they own
some of the same china.

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.790
You know we have some personal
pieces in our collection that came

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:29.940
as a result of first ladiess in
early 20th century asking families

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.720
to give something to
represent a president

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.300
who would not be otherwise
represented.

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.100 position:56%
So we do have some pieces associated

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:39.880
with Andrew Johnson
and the Garfield's but.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.910
And in some cases we
know they have more

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:45.760
of it wherever they're
institutional home is.

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.560
Yes?

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.170
&gt;&gt; A little bit back
on the symbolism.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:57.450
I understand that the Obama china
is based a bit on a earlier china.

00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:59.310
I believe the Monroe,
is that correct?

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:00.610
&gt;&gt; Madison.

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:01.910
&gt;&gt; Madison.

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:03.210
&gt;&gt; Close.

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:05.810
And I've seen them
both and I -- but --

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:08.870 position:56%
could you go into that a little bit?

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:13.690
&gt;&gt; Sure. The dinner
plate well let's see.

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:14.990
There's 11 pieces.

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:20.750
The, the, the service plate has a
wide gold border which is been true

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:24.250 position:56%
of the Clinton china and some
plates that the Eisenhower's ordered

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:26.220
that seem to be very presidential.

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:31.760
But with a very narrow ridged
or strident kind of border

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.360
to look much more modern and clean
then lot's of frilly Rococo kind

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.300
of stuff that's been in
some of the other china's.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:43.750
Then the dinner plate was
based on a family service

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:45.740
that belonged to the Madison's.

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:49.620
I think it's a very
modern china for 1806.

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:53.810
It's kind of pin wheels and,
and fronds done in black

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.980
and white on orange background.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:00.990
I mean it was a service that was
bought while he was Secretary

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:07.280
of State and may have been used at
the post fire presidential homes

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.970
in Washington that Madison lived
in because he didn't get back

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:13.060
into the Whitehouse
before leaving office.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.520
So we have several pieces
of that in the china room

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.260
and it drew the attention
of Mrs. Obama

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:22.810
as I think this is a
wonderful decorative element.

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:25.810
And so it was just
done on white on white.

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:28.620
So it's just a, just a
raised element rather

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:31.880
than a, a, a, painted element.

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.910
And then the rest of the
service has the blue with the,

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:41.820 position:56%
the ridges that the strident kind of
border that was derived from a color

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.220
which is supposedly the color

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:48.070
of the water off the presidents
home in Kailua in Hawaii.

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:53.760
And so that was a , a throw into
the symbolism of connecting the old

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.090
and the traditional with a color
that was unprecedented with kind

00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:01.150
of the streamline designing
which was somewhat unprecedented.

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:03.840
And the other interesting
element was is

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:09.130 position:56%
that you know they're only kind of
two American china makers right now.

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:12.830
Lenox which has closed up all of
its New Jersey factories and moved

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:16.600
to North Carolina as the economy
after they went bankrupt once

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.150
and then Pickard out
in Antioch Illinois.

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:22.650
And so Mrs. Obama said
well how about we --

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:25.860
Lenox has made almost all the 20th
century china's for the Whitehouse.

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:29.410
Let's pick Pickard because
they're from our home state.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:32.820
And so it got a chance to sort of
you know make a statement there

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.710
about going a little
further afield and,

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:39.010
and getting something from home.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.740
Yes ma'am?

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.320
&gt;&gt; Does you office collaborate

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.890
with the Whitehouse
Historical Association

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:48.840
on the Christmas tree ornaments?

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.760
&gt;&gt; Not very much.

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.380
They've got a great
historian Bill Seal

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:59.960
who has written the definitive two
volume book The Presidents House

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.450
who I think is the
principle source of,

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:05.690
of information for
the, the ornament.

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:07.570
Certainly if they have
any kinds of questions

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:12.210 position:56%
or want any confirmations it's a
very easy two way street coming back

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:13.510
and forth.

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:15.000
And so the ornaments
I don't know how --

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.750
if you don't know the
ornaments, they've been going

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:21.090
in chronological order with a few
exceptions where they threw in one

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:22.830
for like the 200th
anniversary of the house

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:25.260
or the 200th anniversary
of the presidency.

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:30.590
And so this year's is
going to be Herbert Hoover.

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:34.530
And so they've already --
it's already been revealed.

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:35.890
So I'm not telling any secrets.

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:37.470
You know it's not like fall

00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:38.960
and therefore the Christmas
ornament comes out.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:43.020
But, but it's a fire
engine because in --

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.700
on Christmas eve 1929 while the
Hoovers' were having Christmas

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:50.690
dinner in the state dining
room, staffer walks in

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:53.860
and says Mr. President
the west wing's on fire.

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.620
And so they went out on the terrace

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:59.210
and watched the fireman
come and put out the fire.

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:02.110
Staff people went over to the
house and his son went over to try

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:05.160
to save the papers out of his
desk drawers in his office.

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:09.400
One of the staff people had bought
a puppy for his son and put it

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.020
in his office and so he
went to rescue the dog

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:14.070
and successfully rescued the dog.

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:16.840
But some of the members of the
dinner party were young children

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:22.500 position:56%
so in 1930 for Christmas Mrs.
Hoover commissioned toy fire engines

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:26.540
to give to all the children who
had witnessed the west wing fire.

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:29.640
So it's a nice -- you
know everybody it's a toy.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.600
It looks great as a
Christmas ornament you know

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.980
with a Christmas tree in the back
of the fire truck and everything.

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:36.820
So I think it's going
to be a big seller.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:39.620
I'm sure they're hoping so too.

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.480
The nice thing we get
you know as, as,

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:46.640
as was mentioned the Whitehouse
Historical Association funds a lot

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.490
of our work, acquisitions,
new drapes,

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:54.830
new carpets for public rooms,
the china service and things

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:58.410
so we probably couldn't
do a lot of what we do

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:01.410
without their regular support so.

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:05.670
And the ornaments help
fill up the coffers.

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:09.580
They sell a lot.

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:10.880
Yes ma'am?

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.100
&gt;&gt; Is it okay if I
ask a second question?

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:14.600
&gt;&gt; Only up to the time limit.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.900
I have a wrap up so.

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:20.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Okay. On the back of most china
you see the name of the manufacturer

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:23.140
such as Lenox and then
maybe the name

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:26.280
that the china manufacturer
has given it.

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.960
What is on the back
of Whitehouse china?

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.580
&gt;&gt; Pretty much the same.

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:34.510
It will have the commercial
logo for the manufacturer.

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:37.380
You know what for -- let's say
for Lenox which is traditional.

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:41.290 position:56%
You know it's an L with a wreath
around it and it will say Lenox made

00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:43.560
in America or made in the USA.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.340
It's kind of their tradition.

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:49.030
Then it says the Whitehouse
and the date.

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:51.970
So that's for the usable china.

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:55.920
We also make place
settings for the china room

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.130
which says Whitehouse
China Collection.

00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:01.640
Separately for the
presidents library

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:05.200
that will say The Barack Obama
Presidential Library Museum.

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:08.850
A place setting for the president
and first lady and a place setting

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:11.890 position:56%
for the Smithsonian to continue
their long-standing tradition where,

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:15.760
where Margaret Klapthor worked so
hard on creating a china collection
