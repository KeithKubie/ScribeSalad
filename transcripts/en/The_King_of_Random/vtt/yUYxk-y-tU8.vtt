00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.160
I've gathered up some common household ingredients, 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.240
and a frying pan, because today we're doing some 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.120
kitchen chemistry.  This is the type of cooking that 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.030
gets me excited because I'm trying out recipes for 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.070
solid-state rocket fuel.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.200
To get started, I'm taking this portable electric 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.160
burner outside and away from anything flammable.  I'll 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.010
add a frying pan, and set the heat to medium-low.  

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.130
This lid should help it heat faster, and while that's 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.010
warming up, I'll place one of these plastic cups on a 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.250
digital scale and turn it on.  When the scale has 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.160
zeroed out the weight of the cup, I'm ready to measure 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.120
portions of these two ingredients.  The black bottle 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.220
is a stump remover from the garden section of a local 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.040
hardware store, and I'm using it because it contains 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.160
Potassium Nitrate.  And according to the MSDS, it 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.090
contains a lot of it.  The second ingredient is plain 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.190
white table sugar and I couldn't resist a little taste 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.160
before investing it into this experiment.  Ok, this 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.170
recipe calls for a 60/40 mix by weight, and I'm going 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.050
to make a 100 gram batch, so I'm adding 60 grams of 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.180
stump remover first, followed by 40 grams of 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.050
granulated white sugar.  That looks good there, so I'll 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.170
give the cup a little shake to mix the two together, and 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.200
then try to pour it neatly and evenly into the pre-

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.240
heated pan.  Over the course of about 5 minutes, I'll 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.230
need to stir the mix up a little so it doesn't burn on 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.160
the bottom.  Not much seems to be happening yet, but 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.190
after about 8 minutes I can see some of the sugar 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.110
starting to caramelize into a liquid.  At this point 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.040
I'll need to be stirring and mixing a little more 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.020
frequently, and as I do, the mixture begins to liquify 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.030
and clump together, turning a golden brown.  Just a 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.040
couple of minutes later, the entire batch looks like 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.160
cookie dough, and the white powder is completely mixed 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.130
in.  I'll need some sort of container to hold this in, 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.260
and I'm thinking these Mega Block Legos might work.  

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.090
At this point, the mixture is just runny enough that 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.050
it can be coaxed into the container.  It takes about 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.220
60 grams to fill this red block, and when I've cooked 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.140
up a little more, I'll add that to the blue one.  It's 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.180
darker in color because it cooked longer, and 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.250
generally speaking, I think the less it is cooked, the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.100
better.  There's just a little bit left over, and it's 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.170
hot, but if I'm careful, I can roll it into a test 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.090
piece for measuring the burn rate later on.  Alright, 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.060
while those are cooling, I've got one we can light off 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.130
just to see how it looks.  I'll get it started with a 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.010
propane torch, and when the fuel catches, it throws 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.150
off a nice little flame, and quite a bit of smoke.  

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.100
This mix is 4 months old and seems to burn a little 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.110
slow, but it's still a good show.  And you can tell by 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.060
the melting plastic that it does get pretty hot.  Ok I 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.220
just made 3 more batches of fuel that are all a little 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.120
different.  To the yellow one I added 30 grams of 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.160
water and then turned the heat up to boil the water 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.070
out.  After a couple of minutes, the mix turned to a 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.250
white mush and was ready when all the water seemed to 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.100
have cooked out.  This method prevented the sugar from 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.280
caramelizing, but was a little crumbly when dry.   

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.190
I packed that into this yellow LEGO block and set it 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.030
aside.  Another batch was made using a mix of 58% 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.280
Stump Remover, 29% Sugar, and this time I used 13% 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.180
Corn syrup, and 30mL water.  The water was cooked out 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.050
the same way as the last, and then about 1 gram of 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.070
homemade rust powder was added, and stirred in 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.200
throughly.  When it was ready, it looked like a creamy 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.060
chocolate frosting, and I packed that into the green 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.230
LEGO.  I may have accidentally trapped an air bubble 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.120
inside.  You'll see this explode later when we test 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.140
it.  For my last batch, I sprinkled some red rust into 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.230
the mix while it was still wet, and like the others, 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.130
stirred it until the water had evaporated out.  This 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.060
mix kind of looked like a delicious red velvet cake, 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.180
but I wouldn't recommend eating it.  I took samples 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.230
from each fuel, and measured them all to a length of 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.010
1", then timed the burn rates to see how they 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.240
performed against each other.  I was happiest with the 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.250
batch made with my homemade rust because it burned the fastest.  

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.230
I had a few sample scraps left over that 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.210
were begging to be burned up, so I did that.  And now 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.080
here we are with 5 samples ready for ignition.  

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.260
Testing the red one, I'm really impressed at how fast 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.110
it ignites and burns, but a little nervous when it 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.170
starts spinning out of control.  I'm out of there.  

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.210
The blue one lights off just as powerfully, and builds 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.020
thrust to the point to where it takes off, leaving me 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.180
in a total whiteout.  This yellow one was the un-

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.060
caramelized version and I got smarter this time by 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.050
pointing it down to prevent it from taking off like 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.270
the others.  It burned slower than the first two, but 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.080
the amount of smoke it put off was still incredible!  

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.130
Ok so this green one has the rust in it, and it lit up 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.140
instantly and then blew up.  But did you notice how 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.080
much faster the burn rate was?  That's amazing.  For the black 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.200
one I decided it was a good idea to hold it in place 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.130
with another cement brick, and that strategy seemed to 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.180
work.  At least this time I didn't get sprayed in the 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.210
face with spewing hot rocket fuel.  Overall I think 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.150
I'm happiest with these mixtures using the rust.  With 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.120
a different homemade casing that actually has a 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.290
nozzle, I was able to get a successful rocket launch 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.290
that I think went a couple thousand feet high.  

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.090
Well that's it for this project.  If you like these videos,
