00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:04.380
ALEKSEY SURKOV: I'll tell you
about Chrome Web Store today

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.280
from various perspectives.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.510
So just to remind you
what Web Store is,

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.090
this is Chrome Web Store--
chrome.google.com/webstore.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.790
How many of you have installed
at least one something

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.400
from Web Store?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.900
Right.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.590
And how many of you
have uploaded something

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.720
to Web Store as developers?

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.290
OK, good, so about 50%.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.370
So the goal of my presentation
is to-- I actually

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.500
have two goals, I guess.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.120
One goal is to give
you some idea why

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.260
you might be interested in using
Web Store as a new distribution

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.330
channel if you are not
doing this already.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.930
And the second goal is to give
some tips, or some things which

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.300
are harder to find
in the documentation

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.910
and at which might make
your app more effective

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.750
and just bring you more users.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.170
So Web Store is supported on
all our desktop platforms-- Mac,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.530
Windows, Linux.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.855
We don't support any
mobile browsers yet,

00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:07.600
so don't try to open the
link from Android or iOS.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.560
What kind of content do
we have in Web Store?

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.670
We really have three types
of items in Web Store.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.510
We have applications.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.010
And applications can
be hosted and packaged.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.850
So hosted applications
in Web Store

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.300
are really just
links to websites.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.570
So if you have a website,
then making a host application

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.660
in Web Store should take
not more than a few minutes.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.530
But the benefits
that you will have

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.100
if you have this host
application in Web Store

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.920
is that you will be able to get
user reviews, user feedback.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.300
For users, it will be
easier to find your website,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.050
your web application.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.800
They will be also able to read
some additional information,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.840
like description, and
see some screenshots.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.194
So I'll go in details
about that later.

00:01:54.194 --> 00:01:56.110
Packaged apps are something
slightly different

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.280
from just hosted
apps, hosted websites.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.070
Packaged apps is, in
some way, a website

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.970
which is packaged as a zip file.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.260
And at the install
time, it's downloaded

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.520
to the user's machine so
that it can work offline

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.210
without internet.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.920
So one of the biggest
advantages of packaged apps

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.860
is that they are
offline by default.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.880
They just work without internet.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.290
Another advantage is that they
have access to various APIs

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.930
which are not available
for just normal web apps.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.060
For example, they can interact
directly with a USB port.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.370
They can also use these
API [? pieces ?] [? just ?]

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.614
directly.

00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:37.030
And they can do
many other things.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.821
They also run in their
own separate window,

00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:42.240
so on operating systems like
Linux or Mac or Windows,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.600
they just feel like
native applications.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.240
Extensions are things which
implement some functionality

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.500
in the browser, in Chrome, which
doesn't exist there otherwise.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.260
They interact very
closely with the way

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.030
Chrome renders the web pages.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.310
So one example of an
extension is-- obviously,

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.680
AdBlocker is a good
example, or an extension

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.350
which translates all the words
when you double click it,

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.000
and many other
things you can do.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.560
And themes is just a way to
add colors to your browser

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.900
and maybe set some
background images to make

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.200
the whole browser experience
more personalized.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.740
So we get, oftentimes, the
questions from developers.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.520
They are wondering how
the homepage of Web Store

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.520
gets constructed
and what the way is

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.520
to get to the top
of this home wall--

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.182
the top of the home page.

00:03:33.182 --> 00:03:36.930
I really just wanted
to give you a view

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.400
on how this wall
gets constructed

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.740
and what kind of
content is shown here.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.890
So the first section and
the third section sections

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.710
manually curated by a
Google merchandising team.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.500
So these are hand-picked apps.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.890
Google uses different
signals to decide

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.130
which apps to promote here.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.276
The signals include
things like the apps

00:04:01.276 --> 00:04:03.950
should be high-quality apps.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.030
It should also have
some popularity already.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.777
So if you want Google to pick up
your app for a promotion here,

00:04:12.777 --> 00:04:15.360
you really need to invest into
your own marketing a little bit

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.290
first.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.440
It should probably use some
features of the platform

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.040
to showcase the
platform in a good way.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.390
And it might be also a new
launch, an exclusive launch

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.860
on the Chrome platform.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.360
We also have some
sections generated

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.840
using machine learning
and algorithms.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.390
We have a personalized,
section which

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.890
is different for every user.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.780
We try to select
stuff which is most

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.720
relevant to the particular user.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.880
And we also have
just popular things.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.460
And then we have
this infinite wall

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.899
at the bottom of
the homepage, which

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:53.190
is a mixture of various
streams that I mentioned about.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.600
So publishing to
Web Store really

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.090
involves three simple steps.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.510
If you want to
publish a hosted app

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.552
and you already have a
website, then essentially,

00:05:05.552 --> 00:05:07.176
you don't need to
create your solution,

00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:08.530
because you already have one.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.630
You just to add a Chrome
manifest, upload to Web Store,

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.200
add some promotional
information, and you're done.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.750
If you want to
make an extension,

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.650
or if you want to
make a packaged app,

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.730
you really need to use the
APIs that Chrome provides

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.270
specifically for extensions
and packaged apps

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.340
to use all the features.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.400
And let me zoom in a little bit
on what promotional information

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.110
we require for publishing
and why it's important.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.940
So you need to give us things
like promotional images

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.630
that we use to render
your apps in the wall.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.020
And these images should
be of high quality,

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.260
because we don't really want
to show low-quality images

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.510
at the top of the wall.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.750
So we have a manual curation
process for the images

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.520
that you upload from Web Store.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.040
And if we think that image
is low-quality, or maybe just

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.190
a blank rectangle
without any information,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.490
or a lot of small text--
there are some guidelines

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.290
for that-- we mark
this image as not

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.970
to be shown on the
top of the wall.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.360
And then your item, even if it's
a very good, high-quality item,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.910
it will not be able to show
up at the top of the wall.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.370
So it's really important to
have high-quality promotional

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.870
images.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.070
It also attracts users.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.890
It's also important
to have, for details,

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.250
screenshots which show
how your app works

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.207
or how your extension works.

00:06:29.207 --> 00:06:31.540
And the detailed description--
we know from user studies

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.620
that users really love
detailed descriptions.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.040
They love detailed information.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.250
They try to learn more before
deciding whether or not

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.220
they want to install.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.820
They're really
cautious about this.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.340
They also read
reviews and ratings,

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.940
so it's good to have
good reviews and ratings.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.490
It's especially important if
you want to monetize your app,

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.160
if you want your users to pay.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.510
So for monetization, Web
Store offers multiple ways

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.980
that you can monetize your app.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:07.450
The most straightforward way--
at the same time, probably

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:13.110
the way to scare most users
from the very beginning--

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.110
is to have a prepaid app
or a prepaid extension

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.290
where the users need to
pay in order to install.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.964
So if you have an extension
or a packaged app,

00:07:24.964 --> 00:07:26.130
this will just work for you.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.550
Web Store will not let the
user download without paying.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.400
But if you have a hosted app,
which is essentially a website,

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.070
you also need to interact with
the Google Web Store server

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.840
to query whether the
particular user has paid

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.870
for the particular
application, and then you

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.060
can decide what kind of
UI you want to render.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.180
Maybe you want to tell
the user to upgrade,

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.620
or maybe you can provide
some free functionality.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.320
You can also enable
a free trial, which

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.480
means that your app will
be able to get installed

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.280
without paying, but then you
can implement some functionality

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.160
to check whether or not a
payment actually happened.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.120
And there may be
limits on functionality

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.520
in the application.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.200
We also recently
launched in-app payments

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.700
maybe a few months ago.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.730
In-app payments give you a
way to configure what kind

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.230
of in-app products you want
to have in your extension

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.730
or in your application.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.350
And then the code snippet
on the right side,

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.220
if you have an extension
or a packaged app,

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.790
that's really all you
need to do to query

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.630
what kind of in-app our
products a particular user who

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.330
is currently using your
product has purchased.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.770
And then you can also act
accordingly, maybe-- open

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.900
some game level or enable
some functionality.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.220
You're also free to use
your own custom solution.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.430
We don't enforce
using specifically

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:45.350
Web Store solutions.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.250
You can use anything you want.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.950
And you can also,
obviously, use ads

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.800
just as you do it for websites.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:09:00.150
So this is a feature which
was just launched yesterday.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.630
Web Store format for
the manifest file

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.360
supports internationalization
and localization

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.380
to multiple languages.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.750
So you can say, here
is my title in English

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.250
and my description in English.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.980
Here my title and description
in Chinese and German

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.220
and every language
that you care about.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.620
In case you don't really
know how to translate,

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.810
or you don't want to
deal with it yourself

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.630
how to translate your
description and your app title

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.380
to other languages,
is we now have

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.350
this semi-automated process--
and you can find it now

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.150
in your Chrome Web Store
Developer Dashboard--

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.490
where you can actually use
the professional translations

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.940
to request translations
for your listings.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.000
The prices are-- for most
languages it's $0.10 per word,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.870
and the turnaround time
is less than a week.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.030
And we support 25 languages.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:52.010
And the good news is that
for all of you who are here

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.160
listening to this talk, we
want to offer a refund up

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:02.750
to $100 for all translations
that you make from Web Store

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:03.910
by the end of this month.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.030
So you can just go
to the link there.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.640
It's also written
on the whiteboard.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.560
And the first 50 responses
will get free refunds

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.128
for all translations
made from Web Store.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.510
Another thing which
developers often ask us about

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.660
is why publishing an
app takes so much time,

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.650
why it takes so long.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.100
And that's because we have an
app review process to fight

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.510
malware, abuse, and
other bad things.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.580
Extensions, for example,
are very powerful,

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.162
and they can do a very bad
things to the user's browser.

00:10:40.162 --> 00:10:41.870
They can steal all
the data, potentially,

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.070
and we definitely don't
want this to happen.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.690
So we have a two-stage
review process.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.120
When you click the
Publish button,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:55.920
the app does not immediately
get available to all your users.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.120
There is some delay.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.980
And we use this delay
to first scan your item

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.590
using automatic
malware-fighting pipeline.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.940
And the pipeline can say,
oh, the item is safe,

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:05.940
and then we publish it.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.240
It can say, the
item is not safe.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.520
It's malware.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.980
And then we take it down.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.760
And then it can also
say, I don't know,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.740
but it looks suspicious.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.560
So then, if it
looks suspicious, we

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.750
send it to manual
review process.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.100
And it can take slightly
more time in that case,

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.210
so we have experts to look
at each particular item.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:30.720
So what's important here is
that, even though it's sounds

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.410
a little bit scary,
most items get

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:35.120
published within 60 minutes.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.380
And then it's very important
to monitor the email

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.760
that you use to publish
items in Web Store,

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.460
because Google
will use this email

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:46.010
to send your notifications
about any problems which

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.520
are happening with your items.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.930
And in some cases,
it's very effective

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:53.190
to just appeal, or to
reply to the notification

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.400
some sensible way,
and then the item

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.380
can be restored
very quickly again.

00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:01.450
Another feature I
wanted to tell you

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.610
about to in Web Store
is user feedback.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:08.170
So everybody knows that
it's important to listen

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.410
to user feedback.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.690
We offer a feature
which helps to simplify

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.300
interacting with your users.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.060
You just need to opt in from
your Developer Dashboard.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.380
And this two effects.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.090
First, the users will start
to see a link to a Support

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.850
page in Web Store for your item.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:31.630
And when they go there, they
can leave bug reports or feature

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.910
requests, or just ask questions.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.020
And on the other hand,
you as a developer

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.960
will see a count of
unreplied feedback items,

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.530
and you'll be able
to reply to them

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.490
or just react to
them in some way.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.050
Another interesting
channel which

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.710
was just launched
a couple of days

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.670
ago is called Google
Play for Education.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.780
I want to tell you a
little bit more about this.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.280
Google Play for
Education is a place

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.240
where Google Play team
and Chrome Web Store

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.550
team combined their efforts to
make this product for teachers

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.030
and their students
in the schools.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:14.830
So currently, it has
Android apps and Chrome apps

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.560
which teachers can install
to their student's machines

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.040
and use that for
educational purposes.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.660
So at this moment, we
just manually hand-picked

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.650
a handful of Chrome
Web store apps

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.430
and added them to Google
Play for Education.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:35.030
But at some point in the
future, not too far away,

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.530
we will open this on the
opt-in basis for every Chrome

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.600
developer.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.075
And you will be
able to just opt in

00:13:43.075 --> 00:13:44.800
to Google Play for
Education program.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.440
Your app will go through some
additional review process

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.720
to make sure that it's really
a good educational app.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.180
And then you'll be able to get
this very powerful distribution

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.220
channel and sell
your apps or just

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.800
give it for free
to many schools.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.580
You can go to this URL--
developers.google.com/edu--

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.190
and there is a sign-up form
where you can sign up to get

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.130
notified when this opt-in
opens for everybody.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.200
So just to summarize the tips
that I've already mentioned,

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.710
any high-quality promotional
images is a good thing.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.940
Having good screenshots and
detailed descriptions is also

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:32.590
valuable, helps users
to make their decision.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.340
It's important to
monitor the email address

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.940
that you use to
publish your apps,

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.980
because Google will use it
in case something is wrong.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.930
It's good to monitor
the user feedback,

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.780
and there are tools
for that in Web Store.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.000
It's also good to localize
to multiple languages

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.500
if you target users in
other languages as well.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.120
And invest into
your own marketing,

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.930
and then if you have a
good app, then chances

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.670
will be higher that Google
Merchandising team will

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:01.980
notice your app and make
it even more popular.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.300
The last thing I
wanted to mention

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.250
is statistics which are
available to Web Store

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.180
developers.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.510
So the built-in
statistics is something

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.430
that you just have for free
for every Web Store item.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.210
currently, it includes
impressions and installs

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.220
that you get on a daily basis.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.490
We are also going add very
soon sales statistics,

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:28.720
so if your app uses any of
Web Store's payment options,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.510
you will see additional
charts and tables

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.580
summarizing how much
money you're making.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.730
And the last option
that you can use

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:40.690
is you can just give us
your Google Analytics ID,

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.460
and Chrome Web Store will
ping your Google Analytics ID

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.670
every time when an
app is installed.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.829
And you can then just
slice and dice this data

00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:49.495
using all the power
of Google Analytics.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.980
So I have a few links here.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.480
I think the slides will be made
available after Google I/O,

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.280
so you'll be able to
just click through them.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.010
One thing I wanted
to mention here

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:03.990
particularly is the
Cordova Project.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:08.250
The Cordova Project allows
you to run Chrome Web

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:13.080
Store packaged apps also as
iOS apps and Android apps.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:17.310
So it's a tool to convert Chrome
Web Store app to an APK file

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.020
and upload it to Android,
to Play Store, or to iOS app

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.550
and upload it to App Store.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.090
And then there are some
other videos that you can use

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.190
or that you can just watch
about the Chrome Apps

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.920
platform and ecosystem.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.550
And now I think I'm ready
to answer questions.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.470
I have a mic here.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.010
Just raise your
hand if you want to.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.130
AUDIENCE: So I
have two questions.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.470
At the beginning you mentioned
for the wall, that Chrome Web

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:54.050
Store wall, that we have to
invest our own in marketing,

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:57.210
but also if there's going to
be, say, an exclusive launch

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.195
or a new launch,
that the marketing

00:17:00.195 --> 00:17:02.320
team or the merchandising
team will put that there.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.400
So how do we tell the
merchandising team, hey,

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.200
we're doing an exclusive
launch on the Chrome Web Store.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.774
Like, what's the
communication channel there?

00:17:12.774 --> 00:17:13.690
ALEKSEY SURKOV: Right.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:21.150
So how it works is-- one
communication channel you

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.030
can use is the discussion
group that we have.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.040
We monitor it.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.097
And if you really
have a good app,

00:17:27.097 --> 00:17:29.180
and if you mention this
on the discussion channel,

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.370
then the merchandising
team will definitely

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.720
pay attention to this.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.050
Then, for large partners, we
have direct communications

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:39.550
with them.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:43.590
And when they launch something,
we to notice this fast

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.020
and also help them to
promote it in Web Store.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.030
But our idea is that we're
going to build a merchandising

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:52.990
team pretty soon which is
going to be proactively looking

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.810
for new launches and
new popular apps.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:58.340
So in the ideal
scenario, your app

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.430
will just get noticed by
the merchandising team

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.240
without your doing anything.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.800
But I think it's
also good to use

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.840
Google Group to
tell about your app.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.010
AUDIENCE: And
second question is,

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:12.320
for the impressions
and the analytics

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.670
that you showed, what is
defined as an impression?

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.190
Is it just the app
showed up in the wall?

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:22.570
Or is it when they clicked and
they got the more zoomed-in--

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:26.201
their [? modal ?] just looking
at the app or extension?

00:18:26.201 --> 00:18:27.950
ALEKSEY SURKOV: So
impression is currently

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.691
the event when the user opens
the detail page of your item,

00:18:30.691 --> 00:18:31.565
so when they clicked.

00:18:31.565 --> 00:18:34.400
If it just shows up on the
wall, we don't really log it.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.805
AUDIENCE: When you
use Cordova to publish

00:18:43.805 --> 00:18:45.655
in Google Play or
App Store, can you

00:18:45.655 --> 00:18:48.330
use the payment APIs
that you provide?

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.916
Will they work?

00:18:49.916 --> 00:18:51.540
ALEKSEY SURKOV: That's
a good question.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.540
I do not know the
answer to that.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:57.830
But I know that they keep
adding new APIs all the time,

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.700
so the project is
very fast evolving.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.100
And then just a year
ago, they had just

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.200
very small subset of Chrome Apps
APIs ported to Android and iOS,

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.160
and over the year,
they added a lot more.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.305
So I think it's
either already there

00:19:12.305 --> 00:19:14.310
or will be added at some points.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.620
So you can go and check
out this Cordova website,

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.412
and they should
have the details.

00:19:19.412 --> 00:19:21.620
AUDIENCE: I just wondered
because maybe Apple doesn't

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.110
want another payment API.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:27.559
ALEKSEY SURKOV: Well, it
might be integrated with--

00:19:27.559 --> 00:19:29.600
AUDIENCE: Oh, it could
layer on top of the Apple.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.320
Oh.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.403
ALEKSEY SURKOV: Yeah, it
might be on top of Apple.

00:19:32.403 --> 00:19:34.158
I don't know the
detailed answer to that.

00:19:34.158 --> 00:19:34.866
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.640
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.330
To be featured on
the Chrome Store,

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:47.132
do we need to have a packaged
app, or can it be a hosted app?

00:19:47.132 --> 00:19:49.090
ALEKSEY SURKOV: It can
be a hosted app as well.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:54.510
We actually will try to promote
as well as packaged apps

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.510
and their extensions
and hosted apps.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:00.320
We think they all are important,
like same-level citizens in Web

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.660
Store, and we will definitely
be promoting all of them

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.225
if they are of good quality.

00:20:04.225 --> 00:20:05.100
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:20:11.049 --> 00:20:12.090
ALEKSEY SURKOV: Question.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:20.810
AUDIENCE: How does the payment
API connect with the, say,

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:26.170
enterprise-- so, you know,
like in the managed domain,

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.660
you can specify, I want
everybody in my domain,

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.770
my organization, to have
this extension installed,

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.790
or to have this app installed.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.964
How does that work
with the payment stuff?

00:20:36.964 --> 00:20:38.880
Like, if it requires,
say, a one-time payment,

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.990
or it requires a
subscription, how

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.360
does the, say, administrator,
pay for all these users?

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.310
Because that's a
very flexible number.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:48.970
Is it dependent on the number
of users in the organization?

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.570
Or does it wait until they
actually install the app?

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:53.570
I don't know.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.210
It might be beyond the scope
of this discussion, but--

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.126
ALEKSEY SURKOV: Right.

00:20:57.126 --> 00:21:00.290
So for enterprise,
I don't think we

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:01.770
have a good solution
in Web Store

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.010
for to just buy
something for enterprise

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:05.900
if it's a paid
extension or paid app.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.750
So I have two answers here.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.220
One is, there is definitely
a way for you in CPanel

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.504
to just preinstall something
for all the main users.

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:13.920
You can say, this
extension should

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.370
be installed to all the
main users for this app.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:18.680
And then when they sign into
Chrome with their domain

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.660
account, it will be installed.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.100
I don't think you can currently
use this for paid apps,

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.370
but there is definitely a
way to do this for free apps.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.360
And the second answer
is, there is also

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.620
a project called Google
Application Marketplace.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.170
And this is somewhat
separate from Web Store,

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:40.020
but this is actually focused
on enterprise use case.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.010
And you can install
things there,

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:48.540
and they will get added
to this launch icon

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.190
with these colorful
squares at the top.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.940
I can show you it.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:04.280
So essentially, this
launch icon here,

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.800
it will have the applications
that you installed as a domain

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.240
administrator to all
your domain users.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.460
So you can use Google
Application Marketplace

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.320
if you want paid
solutions, or you can just

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.400
install free extensions from
Web Store and the CPanel

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.645
in the special Chrome
Web Store section.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.140
OK, so thanks for
your attention,

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.910
and I'll be around if
you have more questions.
