00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.719
Suppose you've just returned to your home on

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.689
a cold, winter day. The house is cold.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.510
So you want to get to a comfortable

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.677
temperature as quickly as possible. Suppose that's say,

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:15.720
73 degrees Fahrenheit or 23 Celsius. What temperature

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.400
should you set the thermostat to? Very high,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.760
like 90 degrees Fahrenheit or 35 Celsius. You

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.710
know, to get it up there fast. Or set

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.760
it to what I really want it to end up with, like 73 Fahrenheit or 23 Celsius.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.740
Explain the reason for your choice. In other words,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.930
what's your conceptual model of how the heater works?
