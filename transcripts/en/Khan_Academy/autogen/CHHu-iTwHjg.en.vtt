00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.546
 In this video we will talk 

00:00:02.546 --> 00:00:03.347
 about Gibbs' free energy. 

00:00:03.347 --> 00:00:05.669
 And more precisely how useful it is in determining this 

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:08.826
 whether a reaction would be spontaneous or not, 

00:00:08.826 --> 00:00:12.449
 which is very useful in chemistry and biology. 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.047
 It was first defined by Josiah Willard Gibbs. 

00:00:16.047 --> 00:00:18.717
 What we see is a known formula, 

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.668
 which will help us predict spontaneity. 

00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:24.301
 According to the formula, the change in Gibbs' free energy 

00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:28.480
 is equal to the change in that 'H', which is enthalpy. 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.848
 This is a change in enthalpy, 

00:00:30.848 --> 00:00:32.751
 which we can consider as the heat content, 

00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:34.748
 because the formula applies to 

00:00:34.748 --> 00:00:37.406
 conditions with constant pressure and temperature. 

00:00:37.406 --> 00:00:39.555
 This is the change in enthalpy 

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:44.036
 minus temperature multiplied by change in entropy. 

00:00:44.036 --> 00:00:45.928
 The change in entropy. 

00:00:45.928 --> 00:00:48.063
 'S' is entropy. 

00:00:48.063 --> 00:00:52.370
 This seems like a strange, difficult-to-understand formula. 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.226
 But as we shall see, it is very logical. 

00:00:55.226 --> 00:00:58.373
 Joya Willard Gibbs took this formula, 

00:00:58.373 --> 00:01:00.044
 to understand 

00:01:00.044 --> 00:01:02.681
 how much of the enthalpy will be useful 

00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:03.853
 in doing work. 

00:01:03.853 --> 00:01:06.223
 How much of her is free to do good things? 

00:01:06.223 --> 00:01:07.744
 But in this video we will think about it 

00:01:07.744 --> 00:01:11.331
 how can we use the change in Gibbs' free energy, 

00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:13.724
 to predict whether a reaction 

00:01:13.724 --> 00:01:15.627
 will run spontaneously, 

00:01:15.627 --> 00:01:17.230
 whether it will be spontaneous. 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.355
 Let's start. 

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:23.755
 If delta G is less than 0, 

00:01:23.755 --> 00:01:26.889
 the reaction will be spontaneous. 

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:29.791
 It will be spontaneous. 

00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:31.277
 It will happen, 

00:01:31.277 --> 00:01:32.753
 provided reagents can interact 

00:01:32.753 --> 00:01:33.947
 in the right way. 

00:01:33.947 --> 00:01:37.314
 It will be spontaneous. 

00:01:37.314 --> 00:01:40.890
 Now let's think why this is logical. 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.432
 If the expression here is negative, 

00:01:43.432 --> 00:01:46.288
 the reaction will be spontaneous. 

00:01:46.288 --> 00:01:48.470
 Let's think of all possible options. 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.991
 In this case here, 

00:01:49.991 --> 00:01:54.565
 if the enthalpy change is less than zero 

00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:56.365
 and entropy is increasing, 

00:01:56.365 --> 00:01:58.187
 enthalpy is decreasing. 

00:01:58.187 --> 00:01:59.685
 That means we will give 

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:01.774
 energy here. 

00:02:01.774 --> 00:02:03.353
 We will give enthalpy. 

00:02:03.353 --> 00:02:04.909
 You can think of it like 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.231
 to deliver energy. 

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:09.193
 Providing. 

00:02:09.193 --> 00:02:10.284
 I will draw it. 

00:02:10.284 --> 00:02:12.385
 It's the enthalpy here. 

00:02:12.385 --> 00:02:15.043
 At the end I have less enthalpy than at the beginning. 

00:02:15.043 --> 00:02:16.506
 But entropy is increasing. 

00:02:16.506 --> 00:02:18.352
 Disorder increases the number of conditions, 

00:02:18.352 --> 00:02:20.546
 which my system can accept. 

00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:22.330
 There is logic in that. 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.082
 It is logical 

00:02:23.082 --> 00:02:24.602
 this happens spontaneously, 

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:26.679
 regardless of temperature. 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.457
 I have these two molecules. 

00:02:28.457 --> 00:02:31.057
 They will collide. 

00:02:31.057 --> 00:02:32.593
 As they approach, 

00:02:32.593 --> 00:02:34.660
 their electrons can tell, 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.413
 "Wait, here's a better configuration, 

00:02:36.413 --> 00:02:38.213
 in which we will reach a lower energy level, 

00:02:38.213 --> 00:02:39.653
 we can give energy, 

00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:40.814
 whereby 

00:02:40.814 --> 00:02:44.214
 separate components are separated. " 

00:02:44.214 --> 00:02:45.956
 Now we have more components. 

00:02:45.956 --> 00:02:46.815
 They have separated. 

00:02:46.815 --> 00:02:47.779
 We also had energy separation. 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:48.917
 Entropy is increasing. 

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:51.215
 It is logical that this is a natural process, 

00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:53.514
 which is actually happening. 

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:55.695
 This is a spontaneous reaction here. 

00:02:55.695 --> 00:02:59.493
 Delta G 

00:02:59.493 --> 00:03:02.314
 is less than zero. 

00:03:02.314 --> 00:03:03.532
 Right here. 

00:03:03.532 --> 00:03:05.216
 I will do all the spontaneous reactions - 

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:08.873
 I will surround them with this green. 

00:03:08.873 --> 00:03:11.450
 What about this case here? 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.629
 The delta H is greater than zero. 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.656
 In this reaction, the enthalpy should be increased, 

00:03:19.656 --> 00:03:22.316
 and the ethiopia will be reduced. 

00:03:22.316 --> 00:03:25.171
 You can imagine these two atoms 

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:27.214
 or maybe these two molecules are getting closer, 

00:03:27.214 --> 00:03:28.955
 but their electrons say, "Hey, no, no. 

00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:30.035
 To get in touch. 

00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:31.870
 we have to move to a higher energy level. 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.831
 We will need energy, 

00:03:33.831 --> 00:03:36.270
 and the disorder will be reduced. 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.652
 That can not happen. " 

00:03:37.652 --> 00:03:39.767
 And of course, this is a sum, 

00:03:39.767 --> 00:03:41.946
 if delta H is greater than zero 

00:03:41.946 --> 00:03:43.246
 and if it is less than zero, 

00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:45.545
 the whole expression will be positive. 

00:03:45.545 --> 00:03:47.727
 Thus delta G will be greater than zero. 

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:51.269
 Here delta G will be greater than zero. 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.951
 I hope you guess, 

00:03:52.951 --> 00:03:55.505
 that this reaction would not be spontaneous. 

00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:59.708
 It will not happen. 

00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:02.389
 Here are some variations 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.270
 of delta H and delta S, 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.033
 where spontaneity depends on temperature. 

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:08.972
 Here we have 

00:04:08.972 --> 00:04:12.048
 delta H is less than zero. 

00:04:12.048 --> 00:04:15.229
 We will have an energy release, 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.191
 but entropy declines. 

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:18.387
 What will happen? 

00:04:18.387 --> 00:04:19.849
 If the temperature is low, 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.461
 these particles will be able to gently approach each other and 

00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:25.364
 their electrons will be able to interact. 

00:04:25.364 --> 00:04:27.047
 Maybe they will reach a lower energy level 

00:04:27.047 --> 00:04:29.067
 and will give energy. 

00:04:29.067 --> 00:04:31.041
 They give off energy, 

00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:33.247
 electrons do this spontaneously. 

00:04:33.247 --> 00:04:34.906
 But entropy has diminished. 

00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:36.230
 This can happen, 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.531
 because the temperature 

00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:40.107
 here is low. 

00:04:40.107 --> 00:04:40.943
 You can say, 

00:04:40.943 --> 00:04:42.023
 "Wait, that does not break that 

00:04:42.023 --> 00:04:43.927
 the second law of thermodynamics? " 

00:04:43.927 --> 00:04:45.424
 You have to remember, 

00:04:45.424 --> 00:04:48.326
 if we only think about this part 

00:04:48.326 --> 00:04:50.520
 from the system, entropy is reduced. 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.167
 But we have warmth. 

00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:56.487
 This heat will contribute to entropy 

00:04:56.487 --> 00:04:58.507
 in the rest of the system. 

00:04:58.507 --> 00:05:02.222
 So the second law of thermodynamics, 

00:05:02.222 --> 00:05:04.990
 saying entropy in the universe is increasing, is in effect, 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.081
 thanks to the heat released. 

00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:08.404
 But if we only look at those particles here, 

00:05:08.404 --> 00:05:09.983
 entropy has decreased. 

00:05:09.983 --> 00:05:13.465
 This reaction here too 

00:05:13.465 --> 00:05:15.462
 will be spontaneous. 

00:05:15.462 --> 00:05:17.703
 We always want to go back to the formula. 

00:05:17.703 --> 00:05:21.847
 If this is negative and this is negative, 

00:05:21.847 --> 00:05:24.402
 this will be positive. 

00:05:24.402 --> 00:05:25.783
 But if T is low enough, 

00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:27.583
 this expression will not matter. 

00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:29.781
 If T is low, entropy does not matter much. 

00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:32.969
 If T is low, entropy does not matter much. 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:34.861
 Then enthalpy takes control. 

00:05:34.861 --> 00:05:36.800
 In this situation delta G - 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.059
 Assume that T is low enough, 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:41.478
 to make the delta G negative. 

00:05:41.478 --> 00:05:43.800
 This will be spontaneous. 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.378
 Let's look at the same scenario, 

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:47.073
 but if we have high temperature. 

00:05:47.073 --> 00:05:49.207
 Now we have these two molecules. 

00:05:49.207 --> 00:05:50.553
 Let's say these are the molecules, 

00:05:50.553 --> 00:05:53.966
 maybe this purple is this one here. 

00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:55.615
 we have the same two molecules here. 

00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:58.366
 They can 

00:05:58.366 --> 00:05:59.991
 give energy. 

00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:02.685
 But here you are saying, 

00:06:02.685 --> 00:06:04.190
 "Hm, see, they can ..." 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.010
 Changing the enthalpy is negative. 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.250
 But they pass one by the other 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.015
 so fast they will not have a chance - 

00:06:11.015 --> 00:06:12.054
 Their electrons will not have a chance 

00:06:12.054 --> 00:06:13.773
 to interact in the right way, 

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:15.896
 to make a reaction. 

00:06:15.896 --> 00:06:18.568
 This is a situation where the reaction will not be spontaneous, 

00:06:18.568 --> 00:06:20.601
 because the particles will pass one by the other very quickly. 

00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:23.444
 They will not be able to interact with each other properly. 

00:06:23.444 --> 00:06:25.825
 You can imagine that if T is high, 

00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:28.483
 if T is high, this expression will be very important. 

00:06:28.483 --> 00:06:31.442
 Since entropy is negative, 

00:06:31.442 --> 00:06:33.870
 this whole expression will become positive. 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.506
 This will be more positive, 

00:06:35.506 --> 00:06:37.085
 than it will be negative. 

00:06:37.085 --> 00:06:39.082
 Therefore, this is a situation where delta G 

00:06:39.082 --> 00:06:41.230
 is greater than zero. 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.785
 The reaction is not spontaneous. 

00:06:42.785 --> 00:06:44.608
 All I do is to give you a sense of why 

00:06:44.608 --> 00:06:47.858
 Gibbs' formula for free energy is logical. 

00:06:47.858 --> 00:06:49.727
 Remember this holds at constant pressure and 

00:06:49.727 --> 00:06:50.680
 constant temperature. 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.723
 These are reasonable assumptions when 

00:06:52.723 --> 00:06:53.988
 we are dealing 

00:06:53.988 --> 00:06:55.241
 with reagents in a tube 

00:06:55.241 --> 00:06:58.736
 or with many of the biological systems. 

00:06:58.736 --> 00:07:00.058
 Now move here. 

00:07:00.058 --> 00:07:03.519
 Our enthalpy, 

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:05.679
 our change in the enthalpy is positive. 

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:10.489
 And our entropy will increase if 

00:07:10.489 --> 00:07:12.400
 these particles react, but our temperature is low. 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.059
 If these members react, maybe they can divide 

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:16.080
 or to do 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.707
 something like that. 

00:07:17.707 --> 00:07:20.039
 But they will not, 

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.606
 because when they collide, 

00:07:22.606 --> 00:07:24.718
 they say, "Do you know? All our electrons are good. 

00:07:24.718 --> 00:07:27.317
 They are in nice and stable configurations here. 

00:07:27.317 --> 00:07:28.815
 I see no reason to react. " 

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:29.674
 Although, if they react, 

00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:31.208
 can increase entropy. 

00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:33.145
 But there is no reason to react. 

00:07:33.145 --> 00:07:35.525
 If we look at these different dimensions, 

00:07:35.525 --> 00:07:39.439
 if this is positive, if even this is positive, 

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:41.507
 but if T is low, it will not be able to 

00:07:41.507 --> 00:07:42.860
 overcome this. 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.273
 Therefore, we have a delta G greater than zero, 

00:07:46.273 --> 00:07:47.909
 the reaction is not spontaneous. 

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:49.976
 If we had the same scenario, 

00:07:49.976 --> 00:07:52.471
 but let's say, "Okay, let's get the temperature up here. 

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:54.300
 To increase the average kinetic energy. " 

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.463
 Then these particles will be able to 

00:07:55.463 --> 00:07:57.564
 hitting each other. 

00:07:57.564 --> 00:08:00.478
 Although the electrons 

00:08:00.478 --> 00:08:02.579
 will need energy to 

00:08:02.579 --> 00:08:05.029
 create these links, 

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:08.024
 the reaction may be carried out, 

00:08:08.024 --> 00:08:09.823
 thanks to the disarray that has been created. 

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:11.298
 We have more possible states. 

00:08:11.298 --> 00:08:12.957
 And the reaction is less likely to occur in the opposite direction, 

00:08:12.957 --> 00:08:14.397
 because what is the chance 

00:08:14.397 --> 00:08:16.046
 all these particles to be assembled 

00:08:16.046 --> 00:08:17.566
 in the exact configuration 

00:08:17.566 --> 00:08:21.362
 and return to this smaller number of molecules. 

00:08:21.362 --> 00:08:23.197
 Let's take a look at these dimensions again here. 

00:08:23.197 --> 00:08:25.797
 Even if delta H is greater than zero, 

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.376
 even if it is positive, 

00:08:27.376 --> 00:08:29.024
 if the delta S is greater than zero 

00:08:29.024 --> 00:08:30.220
 and T is high, 

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.962
 especially with the negative sign here, 

00:08:31.962 --> 00:08:33.621
 this thing 

00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:35.897
 will overcome the enthalpy 

00:08:35.897 --> 00:08:37.371
 and the change in enthalpy, 

00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:39.275
 therefore, the entire expression will be negative. 

00:08:39.275 --> 00:08:43.199
 Here delta G will be less than zero. 

00:08:43.199 --> 00:08:46.345
 This reaction will be spontaneous. 

00:08:46.345 --> 00:08:47.854
 I hope this gave you a sense of 

00:08:47.854 --> 00:08:50.455
 the Gibbs formula for free energy. 

00:08:50.455 --> 00:08:52.521
 And once again, 

00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:55.980
 that it implies constant pressure and temperature, 

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.302
 but it is useful when we think about it 

00:08:58.302 --> 00:09:00.055
 whether a reaction would be spontaneous. 

00:09:00.055 --> 00:09:03.213
 When looking at biological or chemical systems, 

00:09:03.213 --> 00:09:05.558
 we can check the delta G for a given reaction. 

00:09:05.558 --> 00:09:07.706
 We will say, "Oh, delta G is negative?" 

00:09:07.706 --> 00:09:09.180
 "This will be a spontaneous reaction." 

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.736
 "Delta G is zero?" 

00:09:10.736 --> 00:09:12.117
 "This will be a balancing reaction." 

00:09:12.117 --> 00:09:14.190
 Or we can say, "This is a positive delta G." 

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.310
 "The reaction will not be spontaneous."
