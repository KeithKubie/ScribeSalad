00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.540
one of the problems with object

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550
one of the problems with object
 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.550
one of the problems with object
detection as you've seen it so far is

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560
detection as you've seen it so far is
 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.249
detection as you've seen it so far is
that each of the grid cells can detect

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259
that each of the grid cells can detect
 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.580
that each of the grid cells can detect
only one object whatever grid cell wants

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590
only one object whatever grid cell wants
 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.220
only one object whatever grid cell wants
to detect multiple objects here's what

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230
to detect multiple objects here's what
 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.289
to detect multiple objects here's what
you can do you can use the idea of

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299
you can do you can use the idea of
 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.460
you can do you can use the idea of
anchor boxes

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470
anchor boxes
 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.849
anchor boxes
let's not serve an example let's say you

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859
let's not serve an example let's say you
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.859
let's not serve an example let's say you
have an image like this and for this

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869
have an image like this and for this
 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.099
have an image like this and for this
example I'm going to continue to use a

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109
example I'm going to continue to use a
 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:25.730
example I'm going to continue to use a
3x3 grid

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740
3x3 grid
 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.859
3x3 grid
notice that the midpoint of the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
notice that the midpoint of the
 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.650
notice that the midpoint of the
pedestrian and the midpoint of the car

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
pedestrian and the midpoint of the car
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.799
pedestrian and the midpoint of the car
are in almost the same place and both of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809
are in almost the same place and both of
 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.119
are in almost the same place and both of
them fall into the same grid cell so for

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129
them fall into the same grid cell so for
 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.840
them fall into the same grid cell so for
that grid cell if Y outputs this vector

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
that grid cell if Y outputs this vector
 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.560
that grid cell if Y outputs this vector
where you're detecting three classes

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570
where you're detecting three classes
 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.440
where you're detecting three classes
pedestrians cars and motorcycles it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450
pedestrians cars and motorcycles it
 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.709
pedestrians cars and motorcycles it
won't be able to output to detection so

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719
won't be able to output to detection so
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.080
won't be able to output to detection so
have to pick one of the two detection x'

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
have to pick one of the two detection x'
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.950
have to pick one of the two detection x'
to output with the idea of anchor boxes

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
to output with the idea of anchor boxes
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.410
to output with the idea of anchor boxes
what you're going to do is predefined

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420
what you're going to do is predefined
 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.709
what you're going to do is predefined
two different shapes called anchor boxes

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
two different shapes called anchor boxes
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.350
two different shapes called anchor boxes
or anchor boxes shapes and what you're

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360
or anchor boxes shapes and what you're
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.410
or anchor boxes shapes and what you're
going to do is now be able to associate

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
going to do is now be able to associate
 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.289
going to do is now be able to associate
two predictions with the two anchor

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
two predictions with the two anchor
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.719
two predictions with the two anchor
boxes and in general you might use more

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
boxes and in general you might use more
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.320
boxes and in general you might use more
anchor boxes maybe five or even more but

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330
anchor boxes maybe five or even more but
 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.390
anchor boxes maybe five or even more but
for this video I'm just going to use to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
for this video I'm just going to use to
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.130
for this video I'm just going to use to
anchor boxes just to make the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140
anchor boxes just to make the
 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.890
anchor boxes just to make the
description easier so what you do is you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
description easier so what you do is you
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.850
description easier so what you do is you
define the cost label to be instead of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
define the cost label to be instead of
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.289
define the cost label to be instead of
this vector on the left

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299
this vector on the left
 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.440
this vector on the left
you basically repeat this twice so you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
you basically repeat this twice so you
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.569
you basically repeat this twice so you
would have PC B X B YB h BW c1 c2 c3 and

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579
would have PC B X B YB h BW c1 c2 c3 and
 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.569
would have PC B X B YB h BW c1 c2 c3 and
these are the eight outputs associated

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
these are the eight outputs associated
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.039
these are the eight outputs associated
with anchor box one and then you repeat

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
with anchor box one and then you repeat
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.020
with anchor box one and then you repeat
that PC B X and so on down to c1 c2 c3

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030
that PC B X and so on down to c1 c2 c3
 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.050
that PC B X and so on down to c1 c2 c3
another eight outputs associated with

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060
another eight outputs associated with
 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.940
another eight outputs associated with
anchor bhasu so because the shape of the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950
anchor bhasu so because the shape of the
 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.880
anchor bhasu so because the shape of the
pedestrian is more similar to the shape

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
pedestrian is more similar to the shape
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.330
pedestrian is more similar to the shape
of anchor box one than and the box - you

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
of anchor box one than and the box - you
 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.790
of anchor box one than and the box - you
can use these eight numbers

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800
can use these eight numbers
 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.330
can use these eight numbers
to encode that PC is one yes there is a

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340
to encode that PC is one yes there is a
 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.470
to encode that PC is one yes there is a
pedestrian use this to encode the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480
pedestrian use this to encode the
 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.540
pedestrian use this to encode the
bounding box around the pedestrian and

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550
bounding box around the pedestrian and
 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.360
bounding box around the pedestrian and
then use these to encode that that

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
then use these to encode that that
 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.230
then use these to encode that that
object is a pedestrian and then because

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240
object is a pedestrian and then because
 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.680
object is a pedestrian and then because
the car the box around the car is more

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690
the car the box around the car is more
 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.750
the car the box around the car is more
similar to the shape of anchor box to

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760
similar to the shape of anchor box to
 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.330
similar to the shape of anchor box to
the nanka box one you can then use these

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340
the nanka box one you can then use these
 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.040
the nanka box one you can then use these
to encode that the second object here is

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050
to encode that the second object here is
 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.740
to encode that the second object here is
the car and have the bounding box and so

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750
the car and have the bounding box and so
 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.020
the car and have the bounding box and so
on be all the parameters associated with

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
on be all the parameters associated with
 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.310
on be all the parameters associated with
the detected car so to summarize

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320
the detected car so to summarize
 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.710
the detected car so to summarize
previously before you were using anchor

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720
previously before you were using anchor
 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.080
previously before you were using anchor
boxes you did the following which is for

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090
boxes you did the following which is for
 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.600
boxes you did the following which is for
each object in the training set in the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610
each object in the training set in the
 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.730
each object in the training set in the
training set image it was assigned to

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740
training set image it was assigned to
 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.550
training set image it was assigned to
the grid cell that corresponds to that

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560
the grid cell that corresponds to that
 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.010
the grid cell that corresponds to that
objects midpoint and so the outputs why

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020
objects midpoint and so the outputs why
 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.820
objects midpoint and so the outputs why
was three by three by eight because

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830
was three by three by eight because
 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.350
was three by three by eight because
you're the three by three grid and the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360
you're the three by three grid and the
 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.930
you're the three by three grid and the
grid position we had that output vector

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940
grid position we had that output vector
 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.699
grid position we had that output vector
which is you know PC then the bounding

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709
which is you know PC then the bounding
 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.210
which is you know PC then the bounding
box then C 1 C 2 C 3 with the anchor box

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220
box then C 1 C 2 C 3 with the anchor box
 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.160
box then C 1 C 2 C 3 with the anchor box
you now do the following

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170
you now do the following
 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.750
you now do the following
now each object is assigned to the same

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760
now each object is assigned to the same
 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.460
now each object is assigned to the same
print cell as before the signs of the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470
print cell as before the signs of the
 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.930
print cell as before the signs of the
grid cell that contains the objects

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
grid cell that contains the objects
 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.270
grid cell that contains the objects
midpoint but it's assigned to an anchor

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280
midpoint but it's assigned to an anchor
 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.280
midpoint but it's assigned to an anchor
cell but it's assigned to a grid cell

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290
cell but it's assigned to a grid cell
 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.500
cell but it's assigned to a grid cell
and anchor box with the highest iou with

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510
and anchor box with the highest iou with
 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.170
and anchor box with the highest iou with
the objects shape so you have to anchor

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180
the objects shape so you have to anchor
 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.380
the objects shape so you have to anchor
boxes you would take an object and see

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390
boxes you would take an object and see
 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.040
boxes you would take an object and see
so if you have an object with um this

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050
so if you have an object with um this
 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.729
so if you have an object with um this
shape what you do is take your to anchor

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739
shape what you do is take your to anchor
 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.890
shape what you do is take your to anchor
boxes maybe one anchor box is this shape

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900
boxes maybe one anchor box is this shape
 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.229
boxes maybe one anchor box is this shape
that's on the box one maybe anchor box 2

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239
that's on the box one maybe anchor box 2
 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.600
that's on the box one maybe anchor box 2
is this shape and then you see which of

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610
is this shape and then you see which of
 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.180
is this shape and then you see which of
the two anchor boxes has a higher IOU

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190
the two anchor boxes has a higher IOU
 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.430
the two anchor boxes has a higher IOU
with the ground true banging bolts and

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440
with the ground true banging bolts and
 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.130
with the ground true banging bolts and
whichever it is that object then then

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140
whichever it is that object then then
 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.710
whichever it is that object then then
gets assigned not just to a grid cell

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720
gets assigned not just to a grid cell
 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.290
gets assigned not just to a grid cell
but to a pair just assigned to a grid

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300
but to a pair just assigned to a grid
 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:19.340
but to a pair just assigned to a grid
cell calmer and cabal hair and that's

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350
cell calmer and cabal hair and that's
 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.409
cell calmer and cabal hair and that's
how that object gets encoded in the

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419
how that object gets encoded in the
 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.100
how that object gets encoded in the
toggle label

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110
toggle label
 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.559
toggle label
and so now the output Y is going to be 3

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569
and so now the output Y is going to be 3
 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:32.820
and so now the output Y is going to be 3
by 3 by 16 because as you saw on the

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830
by 3 by 16 because as you saw on the
 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.050
by 3 by 16 because as you saw on the
previous slide

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060
previous slide
 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.559
previous slide
y is now 16 dimensional or if you want

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:37.569
y is now 16 dimensional or if you want
 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.149
y is now 16 dimensional or if you want
you can also view this as 3 by 3 by 2 by

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:42.159
you can also view this as 3 by 3 by 2 by
 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.659
you can also view this as 3 by 3 by 2 by
8 because they're now 2 and the boxes by

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669
8 because they're now 2 and the boxes by
 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.070
8 because they're now 2 and the boxes by
and Y is a dimensional and dimension of

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080
and Y is a dimensional and dimension of
 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.309
and Y is a dimensional and dimension of
Y being 8 was because we have 3 object

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319
Y being 8 was because we have 3 object
 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.779
Y being 8 was because we have 3 object
classes if you have more objects then

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789
classes if you have more objects then
 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.260
classes if you have more objects then
the dimension of Y will be even higher

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270
the dimension of Y will be even higher
 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.760
the dimension of Y will be even higher
so let's go through a concrete example

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770
so let's go through a concrete example
 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.890
so let's go through a concrete example
for this grid cell let's specify what is

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900
for this grid cell let's specify what is
 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:17.100
for this grid cell let's specify what is
y sodium pedestrian is more similar to

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110
y sodium pedestrian is more similar to
 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.629
y sodium pedestrian is more similar to
the shape of ANCA box 1 so for the

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639
the shape of ANCA box 1 so for the
 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.309
the shape of ANCA box 1 so for the
pedestrian we're going to assign it to

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319
pedestrian we're going to assign it to
 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.429
pedestrian we're going to assign it to
the top half of this vector so yes there

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:26.439
the top half of this vector so yes there
 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:29.240
the top half of this vector so yes there
is an object there be some bounding box

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250
is an object there be some bounding box
 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.070
is an object there be some bounding box
associated the pedestrian and I guess if

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080
associated the pedestrian and I guess if
 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.279
associated the pedestrian and I guess if
a pedestrian is cost 1 then we see 1 is

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289
a pedestrian is cost 1 then we see 1 is
 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.610
a pedestrian is cost 1 then we see 1 is
1 and then 0 0 and in the shape of the

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620
1 and then 0 0 and in the shape of the
 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.189
1 and then 0 0 and in the shape of the
car is more similar to anchor box 2 and

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199
car is more similar to anchor box 2 and
 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.119
car is more similar to anchor box 2 and
so the rest of this vector will be 1 and

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:44.129
so the rest of this vector will be 1 and
 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:46.800
so the rest of this vector will be 1 and
then the bounding box associated with

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810
then the bounding box associated with
 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.050
then the bounding box associated with
the car and then the car is c2 so that 0

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060
the car and then the car is c2 so that 0
 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.879
the car and then the car is c2 so that 0
1 0 and so that's the label Y for that

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889
1 0 and so that's the label Y for that
 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.029
1 0 and so that's the label Y for that
lower middle your grid cell right that

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039
lower middle your grid cell right that
 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:02.969
lower middle your grid cell right that
did I that this arrow is pointing to now

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979
did I that this arrow is pointing to now
 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.920
did I that this arrow is pointing to now
one of this grid cell only had a car and

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930
one of this grid cell only had a car and
 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.950
one of this grid cell only had a car and
had no pedestrian if it only had a car

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960
had no pedestrian if it only had a car
 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.439
had no pedestrian if it only had a car
then assuming that the shape of the

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:13.449
then assuming that the shape of the
 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:15.570
then assuming that the shape of the
bounding box around the car is still

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580
bounding box around the car is still
 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.079
bounding box around the car is still
more similar to anchor box 2 then the

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:19.089
more similar to anchor box 2 then the
 

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:22.260
more similar to anchor box 2 then the
target label Y if there was just a car

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270
target label Y if there was just a car
 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.610
target label Y if there was just a car
there and the pedestrian had gone away

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620
there and the pedestrian had gone away
 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.969
there and the pedestrian had gone away
it would still be the same for the

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979
it would still be the same for the
 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.050
it would still be the same for the
anchor box

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060
anchor box
 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.699

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.340
box two and for the part of the vector
corresponding to anchor box one what you

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350
corresponding to anchor box one what you
 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.320
corresponding to anchor box one what you
do is you just say there is no object

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330
do is you just say there is no object
 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.460
do is you just say there is no object
there so PC is zero and then the rest of

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470
there so PC is zero and then the rest of
 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.450
there so PC is zero and then the rest of
these would be don't care us now just

that won't happen much at all and so it
 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.110
that won't happen much at all and so it
shouldn't affect performance much so
