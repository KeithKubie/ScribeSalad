SALMAN KHAN: I'm here with
Jesse Roe of Summit Prep.

00:00:03.697 --> 00:00:04.780
What classes do you teach?

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.040
JESSE ROE: I teach algebra,
geometry, and algebra II.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.270
SALMAN KHAN: And now
you're with us, luckily,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.240
for the summer, doing
a whole bunch of stuff

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.115
as a teaching fellow.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:12.656
JESSE ROE: Yeah, as
a teaching fellow

00:00:12.656 --> 00:00:14.760
I've been helping with
organizing and developing

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.294
new content, mostly on the
exercise side of the site.

00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:19.710
SALMAN KHAN: And the reason
why we're doing this right now

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.020
is you had some very
interesting ideas or questions.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.020
JESSE ROE: Yeah, so
as an algebra teacher,

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.710
when I introduce that concept
of algebra to students,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.930
I get a lot of questions.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.470
One of those
questions is, what's

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.280
the difference between an
equation and a function?

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.720
SALMAN KHAN: The difference
between an equation verses

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.680
a function, that's an
interesting question.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.142
Let's pause it and
let the viewers

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:43.600
try to think about
it a little bit.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.670
And then maybe we'll
give a stab at it.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.670
JESSE ROE: Sounds great.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.320
So Sal, how would you
answer this question?

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.720
What's the difference between
an equation and a function?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.950
SALMAN KHAN: Let me think
about it a little bit.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.660
So let me think.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.540
I think there's
probably equations

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.780
that are not functions
and functions that

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.530
are not equations.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.571
And then there are probably
things that are both.

00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:05.330
So let me think of it that way.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.170
So I'm going to draw-- if
this is the world of equations

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.555
right over here, so
this is equations.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.460
And then over here is
the world of functions.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.306
That's the world of functions.

00:01:21.306 --> 00:01:22.680
I do think there
is some overlap.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.520
We'll think it through
where the overlap is,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.717
the world of functions.

00:01:26.717 --> 00:01:29.050
So an equation that is not a
function that's sitting out

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.490
here, a simple one would
be something like x plus 3

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.760
is equal to 10.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.354
I'm not explicitly talking
about inputs and outputs

00:01:40.354 --> 00:01:41.770
or relationship
between variables.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.282
I'm just stating an equivalence.

00:01:44.282 --> 00:01:48.230
The expression x plus
3 is equal to 10.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.870
So this, I think, traditionally
would just be an equation,

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.480
would not be a function.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.450
Functions essentially
talk about relationships

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.200
between variables.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.410
You get one or more
input variables,

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.590
and we'll give you only
one output variable.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.900
I'll put value.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.232
And you can define a function.

00:02:06.232 --> 00:02:07.440
And I'll do that in a second.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.030
You could define a
function as an equation,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.449
but you can define a function
a whole bunch of ways.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.160
You can visually
define a function,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.790
maybe as a graph-- so
something like this.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.050
And maybe I actually
mark off the values.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.320
So that's 1, 2, 3.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.510
Those are the
potential x values.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.605
And then on the
vertical axis, I show

00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:27.480
what the value of my
function is going to be,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.000
literally my function of x.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.520
And maybe that is 1, 2, 3.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.200
And maybe this
function is defined

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.670
for all non-negative values.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.690
So this is 0 of x.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.530
And so let me just draw--
so this right over here,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.010
at least for what I've drawn
so far, defines that function.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.676
I didn't even have
to use an equal sign.

00:02:46.676 --> 00:02:51.732
If x is 2, at least the way
I drew it, y is equal to 3.

00:02:51.732 --> 00:02:52.690
You give me that input.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.877
I gave you the value
of only one output.

00:02:55.877 --> 00:02:57.960
So that would be a legitimate
function definition.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.335
Another function
definition would

00:02:59.335 --> 00:03:02.050
be very similar to what you
do in a computer program,

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:12.380
something like, let's say, that
you input the day of the week.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:21.660
And if day is equal to Monday,
maybe you output cereal.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.480
So that's what we're
going to eat that day.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.890
And otherwise, you
output meatloaf.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.590
So this would also
be a function.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.590
We only have one output.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.420
For any one day of
the week, we can only

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.060
tell you cereal or meatloaf.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.510
There's no days where you
are eating both cereal

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.590
and meatloaf, which
sounds repulsive.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.114
And then if I were to
think about something

00:03:49.114 --> 00:03:50.780
that could be an
equation or a function,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.300
I guess the way I think about
it is an equation is something

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.210
that could be used
to define a function.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:03.200
So for example, we could say
that y is equal to 4x minus 10.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.840
This is a potential
definition for defining y

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.000
as a function of x.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.400
You give me any value of x.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.180
Then I can find the
corresponding value of y.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.589
So this is at least how
I would think about it.
