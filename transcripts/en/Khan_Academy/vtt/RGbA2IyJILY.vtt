00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.830
Let's do some more of these
classic age word problems.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.360
So we're told that William
is 4 times as old as Ben.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.980
12 years ago, William was
7 times as old as Ben.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.960
How old is Ben now?

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.050
Once again, it's
a good idea to try

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.750
to do this on your own first,
and then I'll work through it.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.440
What's the unknown here?

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.120
Well, the unknown here
is how old is Ben now.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.610
So let's set a variable equal
to that, and we do x or y.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.180
But since Ben starts with
a b, let's use b for Ben.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:48.410
So let's let b equal Ben's
current age, Ben's age now.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.580
Let's see how all of
this other information

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.300
relates to Ben's current
age, and then maybe we

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.324
can set up some equation
and then solve for things.

00:00:57.324 --> 00:00:59.490
I'll do it a little bit
more structured in this one.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.406
You could have done many
of the problems we've

00:01:01.406 --> 00:01:02.780
been working on in this way.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.830
Let's think about Ben, and
then let's think about William.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.230
I'll do William in blue here.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.470
So let's think about William.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.180
And then there's two points
in time we're talking about.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.430
We're talking about
now, today, and we're

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.580
going to talk
about 12 years ago.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.890
Over here, let's call that now.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.250
This will be our now
column, and then this

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.580
will be our 12 years ago.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.160
Let's see what we
can fill in here.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.120
What is Ben's age now?

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.060
Well, we just defined
that as the variable b.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.670
That's the unknown.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.086
That's what we
have to figure out.

00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:45.555
So let's just stick that there.

00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:47.520
That's just going to be b.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.850
Well, what's Ben's
age 12 years ago?

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.680
So maybe we want to
express it in terms of b.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.390
If he's b now, 12 years
ago, he was just b minus 12.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.810
Fair enough.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.940
Now what is William's age today?

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.250
Well, this first sentence
gave us the information.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.990
William is 4 times
as old as Ben.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.410
And we can assume that
they're talking about today,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.370
is 4 times as old as Ben.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.060
So if Ben is b, William
is going to be 4b.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.540
And so how old was
William 12 years ago?

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.920
Well, if he's 4b right
now, 12 years ago,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.280
he'll just be 12 less than that.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.810
So he's 4b now.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.460
12 years ago, he
was 4b minus 12.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.250
So that's kind of interesting.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.095
But we haven't quite yet made
use of the second statement.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.480
This is William 12 years ago.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.480
12 years ago, William was
7 times as old as Ben.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.550
So 12 years ago, this number
is going to be 7 times

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.680
this number.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.920
Or another way to think
about, take this number

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.290
and multiply it by 7, and
you're going to get this number.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.925
12 years ago, Ben's age
is 1/7 of William's age,

00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:10.610
or William's age is
7 times Ben's age.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.530
So let's see if we can set
that up as an equation.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:22.620
We can have-- let me
write this down-- 7 times

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:31.390
Ben's age 12 years
ago, b minus 12,

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.030
is going to be equal
to William's age.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.220
And it seems like we've
done the hard part.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.370
We've set up the equation.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.710
Now we just use a little
bit of our algebraic tools

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.260
to solve for b.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.990
So let's do that.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.040
The first thing we
might want to do,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.760
we could distribute
the 7, so 7 times

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.040
b, 7 times, essentially,
a negative 12.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.400
We have 7b minus 7
times 12-- let's see.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.050
That's 84-- is going to
be equal to 4b minus 12.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.720
This whole expression
is literally 7 times

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.770
Ben's age 12 years ago.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.470
Now what can we
do to solve this?

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.160
Well, we can subtract 4b from
both sides, so let's do that.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.090
I could do two steps
at the same time.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.840
Well, actually, let's
just keep it simple.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.340
I'm going to subtract
4b from both sides.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.030
That goes away.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.500
On the right-hand side,
I have a negative 12.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.280
On the left-hand side, I am
left with 7b minus 4b is 3b.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.590
And then I still
have a minus 84.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.294
Well, I want to get rid of
this negative 84, this minus 84

00:04:44.294 --> 00:04:45.210
on the left-hand side.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.875
So let's add 84 to both sides.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.170
On the left-hand side,
I'm just left with 3b.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.390
And on the right-hand side,
I have negative 12 plus 84,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.635
or 84 minus 12, which is 72.

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:05.450
Now if I want to
solve for b, I just

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.700
have to divide both sides
of that equation by 3.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.860
And so I am left
with b is equal to--

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.664
and now we have our
drum roll-- 72/3.

00:05:15.664 --> 00:05:17.580
And you might be able
to do that in your head.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.555
It would be 24, I believe.

00:05:19.555 --> 00:05:21.680
You could work it out on
paper if you have trouble.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.710
Let's just do it real quick.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.760
72, 3 goes into 7 two times.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.230
You get a 2 times 3 is 6,
subtract, you bring down the 2,

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.640
3 goes into 12 four times.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.080
So b is equal to 24.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.070
Going back to our question,
what is Ben's age now?

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.160
It is 24.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.610
And let's verify that
this is actually the case.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.250
They're telling us that William
is 4 times as old as Ben.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.620
So what is William's
current age?

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.030
Well, 4 times 24 is 96,
so William is a senior.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.380
We should call him Mr. William.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.710
He is 96 years old.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.810
Maybe he's Ben's grandfather
or great-grandfather.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.500
Then they say 12 years ago,
William-- well, 12 years ago,

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.690
William was 84 years old.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.980
So he was 84 years old.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.480
They say that's 7
times as old as Ben.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.790
Well, 12 years ago, if
he's 24 now, Ben was 12.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:26.738
And indeed, 84 is 7 times
12, so it all worked out.
