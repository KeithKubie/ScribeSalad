00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:06.439
Whatcha gonna do with all that junk, all that
junk in outer space?

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.630
Hey space junkies, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.420
Space is more accessible than ever, and we’re
launching new stuff up there all the time.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.360
But along with all the satellites and space
stations, we’ve also left a lot of litter

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.490
in our wake.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.680
And if it hits anything, it’ll create more
junk and quickly get out of control.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.500
To help keep track of all that junk, NASA
monitors the bigger pieces and actually publishes

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.770
a newsletter called Orbital Debris Quarterly.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.440
That’s right, NASA talks about space junk
as much as we talk about gentlemen.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.470
It’s like a tabloid for space geeks.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.690
It even ranks the top 10 satellite breakups
of all time.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.690
But why just keep track of it?

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.479
Why don’t we go out there and take out the
trash?

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.120
There have been some proposals and experiments.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.909
As far back as 1996 the space station Mir
attached pieces of gel to the outside to gather

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:54.649
microscopic space junk, though the results
were negligible, ruling it out as trash collection

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:55.649
service.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.179
Other ideas have been suggested, like launching
other satellites to grapple onto derelict

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.449
ones and hauling them back down to earth like
a professional wrestler doing a Batista bomb.

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.990
The Swiss EPFL’s CleanSpace One was drawn
up to grab Switzerland’s first satellite

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.820
Swiss Cube and remove it from orbit.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.391
How do you like that, they send one tiny cube
up and they still want to clean it up, way

00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:14.780
to go The Swiss.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.420
But their solution can’t capture debris
that’s very large or very small.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.220
But the ESA is also working on something to
take large satellites down by 2021, but like

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.780
the Swiss space roomba, it’s a one shot
deal.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.829
In 2014 Japan’s space agency actually tested
out a metal space net designed to create a

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.899
magnetic pull to drag floaty bits out of orbit.

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.689
They hope to have something ready by 2019.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.149
Ideas that don’t require sending something
expensive into space expensively have also

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.180
been dreamed up.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.009
In 2012 Raytheon tested phase one of their
Space Debris Elimination concept.

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.030
The idea was a device suspended by balloons
80 km up would shoot a jet of atmosphere as

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.859
high as 600 km.

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:56.819
When junk hits the suddenly thick air, it
loses speed and comes back down to earth.

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.220
Raytheon concluded that while the energy costs
were high, they weren’t unreasonable and

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.840
could possibly be reduced with further development.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.700
And of course, there’s everybody’s favorite
idea: space lasers.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.130
Yes, space lasers.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.990
Sure we could put them on other satellites
to give them a clear path, but that’s a

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.210
space law no-no because now you’ve started
weaponizing space.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.800
Even putting them somewhere neutral like the
ISS is dicey because that’s how you get

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.680
rogue supervillain astronauts.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.780
Instead if we’re going to have what NASA
boringly calls a “laser broom,” it would

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.180
have to be stationed on Earth.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.310
This means you’d have to target fast moving
tiny particles hundreds of kilometers away

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.800
and pepper them with laser bursts in just
the right way to unsettle their orbit and

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.300
bring them tumbling down.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.300
No easy feat.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.780
Plus it is imperative that the laser doesn’t
miss and damage something we actually need

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.970
that’s farther out in space because the
laser beam just kept going!

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.190
Makes you wonder what happened to all those
shots that missed when X-wings and Tie Fighters

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.190
tangled.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.690
Now, technically, we don’t have to do ANY
of this.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.100
All objects circling the earth will experience
orbit decay and eventually crash into the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.310
earth on their own.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.900
Given enough time, space WILL clean itself.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.920
But it’d be nice to have some control over
where all that heavy debris lands, and not

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.390
to have to wait decades or even centuries
for gravity to decide.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.930
Right now the cost and challenge of cleaning
up space isn’t really worth the effort:

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.090
space is still a pretty big place and the
odds of collisions are slim.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.930
But if satellites do start colliding, then
space junk will multiply and the problem will

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.020
get out of hand fast.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.740
If it gets to that point, hopefully one of
these technologies will be ready to clear

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.950
a path and hopefully it won’t be the “laser
broom”.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.780
So say we make these technologies to knock
space junk back down towards earth.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.940
Then what?

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:42.160
Trace and Amy talk about dropping spaceballs
here.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:50.770
What proposal is your favorite?

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.280
It’s lasers isn’t it?

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.180
ISN’T IT?
