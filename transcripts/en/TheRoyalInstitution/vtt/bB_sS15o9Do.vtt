00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.300
 

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.747
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.747 --> 00:00:14.380
 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.510
So you can tell the age of shoes
just by looking at them.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.630
Here's a new pair, and they've
got nice laces, with little

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.230
plastic caps on the end that
stop them from fraying.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.510
These are a different story.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.740
The laces are quite
old and worn away.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.060
And on this one, the plastic
cap's gone completely, and the

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.720
ends are really frayed.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.160
The same is true of
our chromosomes.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.700
They've got caps on the end
called telomeres, and they

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.110
also wear away over time.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.750
It turns out, that this is
actually a really important

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.600
mechanism for cells to know
how old they are.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.340
So as the telomeres get shorter
and shorter, the cells

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.970
undergo a process called
replicative senescence.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.140
Essentially, it's sitting there
not dividing, but also,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.050
damaging the tissue around it.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.910
And that's thought to contribute
to many of the

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.090
diseases of older age.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.855
But there's an issue.

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:10.540
All our cells have telomeres
that get shorter

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.230
as the cells divide.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.710
But we pass our chromosomes
onto our children.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.680
So why don't they start
off life with

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.080
really short telomeres?

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.730
It turns out, this is all down
to an enzyme called telomerase

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.384
that's encoded on
chromosome 5.

00:01:27.384 --> 00:01:31.575
And telomerase, essentially,
resets the biological clock.

00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:35.300
 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.120
Well, this is telomerase.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.850
I know it looks ridiculous, but
it is, actually, a very

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.050
good representation
of the enzyme.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.130
We know it has a mitten shape.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.740
And inside is a template,
which allows it to make

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.460
repeats of DNA.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.400
So we take DNA precursors, add
them into the telomerase

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.400
enzyme, and it simply adds
them on to the end of the

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.572
chromosome.

00:02:00.572 --> 00:02:04.240
And we have multiple repeats on
the end of the chromosome,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.130
protecting the rest
of the DNA.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.470
 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.120
So this is a fundamental
mechanism in germ cells and

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.370
stem cells.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.090
But what happens when
it goes wrong?

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.030
Well, if you don't have enough
telomerase then the telomeres

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.460
are too short and the cells
will age prematurely.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.330
On the other hand, if telomerase
is switched on in

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.000
all the cells of the body,
they all extend their

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.390
telomeres, the cells don't know
how old they are, they

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.870
will grow and divide
all the time.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.510
And that can give
rise to cancer.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.950
So telomerase is an incredibly
important enzyme.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.550
 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.690
Apart from a few unusual
exceptions, like onions and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.770
fruit flies, it's really well
conserved all the way across

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.110
nature, from yeast to humans.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.230
And now we know so much more
about what it is, and how it

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.930
works, there's a possibility
of being able to design new

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.880
drugs that can target telomerase
and allow people to

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.570
live healthier lives.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:33.553
