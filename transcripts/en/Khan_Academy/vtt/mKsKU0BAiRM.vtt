00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:02.210
- [Voiceover] So, pause this video and, real quick,

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.157
figure out what 27 plus 1 is, and then, if possible,

00:00:06.157 --> 00:00:09.982
figure out what 27 plus 10 is.

00:00:09.982 --> 00:00:12.788
Alright, so, let's think about it together.

00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:14.948
So, you might've been able to do this one pretty easily.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.782
You might've said, "Okay! If I'm adding 1,

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:19.661
"it's just going to be the next highest number from 27.

00:00:19.661 --> 00:00:22.048
"I would go to 28 if I have 1 more."

00:00:22.048 --> 00:00:24.323
But, the reason why I'm doing this exercise is,

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:27.418
we really think about place value.

00:00:27.418 --> 00:00:29.468
So, over here, the number 27,

00:00:29.468 --> 00:00:34.506
we have a 2 in the ten's place, this is in the ten's place,

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:39.530
right over here, and then we have a 7 in the one's place.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.297
So, you could visualize the number 27 as 2 tens,

00:00:43.297 --> 00:00:45.363
and I have 2 groups of 10 here,

00:00:45.363 --> 00:00:48.521
and then 7 ones, and I have 7 ones right over here.

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:50.077
And then, if I add 1 more,

00:00:50.077 --> 00:00:52.236
that's 1 more of these individual ones,

00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:54.001
and so, what am I going to be left with?

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.880
Well, I'm still going to have 2 tens,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.713
I'm still going to have 2 tens,

00:00:59.713 --> 00:01:02.104
but how many ones am I going to have now?

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:06.994
Oh, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ones.

00:01:06.994 --> 00:01:09.149
So, it's going to be 28.

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.819
So, that might not be surprising for you,

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:14.002
but it's really valuable to think about

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:16.440
in terms of place value because it can be very useful

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.050
later on as you learn more math.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.443
Now, let's do the same thing with 27 plus 10.

00:01:21.443 --> 00:01:25.947
We already said 27, that's 2 tens and 7 ones,

00:01:25.947 --> 00:01:29.407
and now, with 10, the 1 isn't in the one's place,

00:01:29.407 --> 00:01:30.800
so it doesn't just represent 1,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.742
the 1 here is in the ten's place,

00:01:33.752 --> 00:01:38.765
so we have 1 10 and we have 0 ones.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:39.787
So, we just have--

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:42.680
The number 10 is just a group of 10 here!

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.676
So, when you add these together, what are you going to have?

00:01:44.676 --> 00:01:49.320
Well, now, you're going to have 1, 2, 3 tens,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.921
you're going to have 3 in the ten's place,

00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:55.339
and you're still going to have

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:59.095
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ones.

00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:01.472
7 ones.

00:02:01.472 --> 00:02:02.261
So, notice.

00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:04.003
Here, when you added a 1,

00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:06.882
you increased your one's place by 1.

00:02:06.882 --> 00:02:10.690
And, here, when you added 10, which is really 1 10,

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.571
you didn't increase the one's place,

00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:15.212
you increased the ten's place.
