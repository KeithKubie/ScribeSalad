00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.157
Thanks, Chris, for teaching us how to add
and subtract fractions and finding the

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:10.193
least common denominator. Now let's
practice what we learned again. Let's try

00:00:10.205 --> 00:00:14.807
a pretty easy problem. We're going to try
7 12ths plus 3 8ths. You can put your

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:20.084
answer for the numerator in that box and
the denominator is that box. Good luck.
