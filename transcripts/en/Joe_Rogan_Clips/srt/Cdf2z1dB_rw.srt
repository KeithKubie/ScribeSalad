1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,870
I mean in Ronda Rousey's case
it was also, it was very, yeah,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,900
her mom was a world judo
champion and mom was a pieced.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,230
She's had an interesting path
I think probably. Yeah. Yeah.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,260
I'm wondering how much she loves the WWE.
I wonder,

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,050
I always wonder when a person is like an
elite athlete at the highest level one,

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,320
a real one.
If they,

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,650
they still enjoy doing that cause
I think she enjoyed it though.

8
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:25,830
I think she was a fan of it before
she ever got involved. Yeah. She,

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,650
I think she actually enjoyed
pro wrestling, you know,

10
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:31,710
and she things even though it's scripted,

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,360
obviously flying off of an
into and around athletic,

12
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:40,950
but it's scripted. Yes. It's
not competition. But then again,

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,430
you can only get knocked
unconscious so many times.

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,390
You can only get fucked up so many times
and she got fucked up two fights in a

15
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:52,350
row really bad. The Holly
Holm K, which was ruthless,

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,180
that was brewed on then Amanda Nunez
just punched her face in for 48 seconds.

17
00:00:57,181 --> 00:01:00,810
It was horrific. Yeah. That was hard
to watch. I like to watch. I mean,

18
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,950
I don't like to watch a really big
guys punch each other and women,

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,560
I don't know why,
like when guys are a little smaller,

20
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,730
it's easier to watch as long as they're
not kicking themselves in the head.

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,133
I'm just saying,

22
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,140
so the big scary ones like heavyweights
dropping bombs on the Japanese go,

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,140
oh my God, that just, that guy took eight
years off. That guy's, you know? Yeah.

24
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,500
It's definitely different.
And you do notice it like a,

25
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:28,710
there's certain heavyweights and they hit
guys and they get knocked unconscious,

26
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:33,510
whether it's Frances in Gando or steep
Daimyo chits are these big guys and they

27
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:36,690
slammed, someone's like, oh my God.
That's what I mean. Like I watch that.

28
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:40,950
I don't actually, I mean violence. I
know it's sport, but for me it's, oh,

29
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:43,290
it's violent. It is, yeah. It's a,

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,280
it is a very dangerous path that you
have to know when to get off and more,

31
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,700
I don't know if I would say more so
than other combat sports, but yep,

32
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,790
it makes sense. All of them,
all of them have a path.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,310
But I think very specifically,
MMA has,

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,290
you have to be really careful because
the consequences are so great.

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,750
There's not enough padding.
And those gloves are tiny little things.

36
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,770
You could also get kicked. He could get
kneed in the face, elbowed in the face,

37
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:14,940
and once you've realized the Chin starts
going and your reflexes start going and

38
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:19,440
you're, you're slowing down, like you
got to get out now you got to get out.

39
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,780
And sometimes they don't get
the proper advice, you know?

40
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,200
And sometimes they don't
know what else to do.

41
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:28,980
They don't have anywhere else to go. And
that goes back to, yeah, I was talking,

42
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:29,520
I tell,

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,830
talked to a lawyer about that because
we have tons of friends in organized

44
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:34,680
sports stuff.
Like you have to be drafted or coach,

45
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,880
the team has to pick you up or, you
know, whatever. And I say to him like,

46
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:41,460
how fortunate are you
that you're in a sport

47
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,090
like other athletes, like a snowboarder
or whatever, that you can go, yeah,

48
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,330
you can go out. Yeah, you
want a ride, you can go ride.

49
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:52,890
Nobody is dictating to you right.
