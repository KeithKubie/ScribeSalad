00:00:05.746 --> 00:00:08.186
&gt;&gt;Student: Right now we're hiking
out to the flow like we said earlier,

00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:12.276
and we brought our equipment with us,
our GPS, Global Positioning System,

00:00:12.686 --> 00:00:16.276
and we're going to go track the
outside perimeter of the flow

00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:17.176
that we measured yesterday.

00:00:17.236 --> 00:00:17.596
So okay..

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:21.616
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These young explorers are
studying fresh lava flows on Hawaii,

00:00:21.616 --> 00:00:24.156
and broadcasting their
observations via satellite

00:00:24.196 --> 00:00:25.666
to schools around the world.

00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.266
&gt;&gt;Student: And we're
studying lava flows.

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.586
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This ambitious
expedition is the culmination

00:00:30.586 --> 00:00:32.316
of this year's JASON Project,

00:00:32.596 --> 00:00:35.486
a comprehensive project-based
learning program developed

00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:39.396
by Doctor Bob Ballard, the explorer
who found the wreck of the Titanic.

00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:40.526
&gt;&gt;Robert: Why don't you
say, "Hi," to everyone?

00:00:40.556 --> 00:00:40.996
&gt;&gt;Student: Hi, everybody.

00:00:40.996 --> 00:00:42.346
&gt;&gt;Robert: I came back
from that expedition.

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:46.676
There were 16,000 letters
waiting for me,

00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:48.556
and they all basically
said the same thing.

00:00:48.556 --> 00:00:51.586
You know, what do I have
to do to do what you do?

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:52.686
Well the answer is simple.

00:00:53.396 --> 00:00:56.066
You go to college, you
study physics for ten years,

00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.486
it's a slam-dunk after that.

00:00:57.886 --> 00:00:59.996
But the kids were not
making the connection

00:00:59.996 --> 00:01:04.656
between the scientific adventure
I was having and the dues I had

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:06.366
to pay to live that adventure.

00:01:07.646 --> 00:01:12.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Begun in 1989, the
JASON Project now reaches more

00:01:12.126 --> 00:01:16.526
than five million fourth through
eighth graders around the world.

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:20.296
&gt;&gt;Robert: The idea is this: that they
will study a pretty tough curriculum

00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:24.706
with science, and chemistry,
math and physics, and biology

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:26.646
and social sciences as well.

00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:28.936
And then at the culmination
of their studies,

00:01:29.126 --> 00:01:30.796
we'll do an expedition live for them.

00:01:31.086 --> 00:01:35.196
&gt;&gt;And we'll be going up to the
crater up at Kilauea, up on the rim.

00:01:35.196 --> 00:01:37.046
&gt;&gt;Sometimes we'll go
in the rainforest,

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:40.156
sometimes we'll go beneath
the sea, sometimes we'll go

00:01:40.156 --> 00:01:42.536
into outer space, doesn't matter.

00:01:42.646 --> 00:01:44.846
Wherever there's action in science.

00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:48.996
And then we use this
technology of tele-presence

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:51.256
to then transport them
on the expedition.

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:51.886
&gt;&gt;Student: Get the
camera, look at that.

00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:52.376
&gt;&gt;Student: Wow, look at that.

00:01:52.376 --> 00:01:53.606
&gt;&gt;Student: Back up, back
up, back up, back up.

00:01:53.606 --> 00:01:56.946
&gt;&gt;Robert: We also have our Argonaut
programs, and these are kids

00:01:56.946 --> 00:01:58.726
that actually go on
the expedition with us,

00:01:58.726 --> 00:02:00.246
and they're sort of our ambassadors.

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:03.536
Kids listen to kids, so we like to
integrate them into the program.

00:02:03.536 --> 00:02:05.256
&gt;&gt;Student: We now have
what we call a lava dogs

00:02:05.296 --> 00:02:08.146
down on the actual active lava
flow, and right now it's quite..

00:02:08.236 --> 00:02:11.736
&gt;&gt;Gwendolyn: This for us helps
close that digital divide

00:02:11.736 --> 00:02:16.246
because our students may not have all
the resources to be able to travel

00:02:16.286 --> 00:02:18.716
to these different
locations, you know?

00:02:18.856 --> 00:02:21.386
At least they have that
understanding of the world.

00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:23.936
We bring it right here
using the technology.

00:02:24.446 --> 00:02:25.456
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Gwendolyn Faulkner

00:02:25.456 --> 00:02:28.046
and Beverly Battle have
seen the positive impact

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:30.926
of project-based learning
programs like the JASON Project

00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:34.416
on their students at Washington
D.C.'s Harriet Tubman School.

00:02:34.416 --> 00:02:38.076
&gt;&gt;Beverly: And that was showing
how birds adapt to their habitats

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:41.626
or their environments
by using their beaks.

00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:47.406
On your tables, you have been
given a set of tweezers, straw,

00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:50.316
a spoon, and a clothespin.

00:02:50.316 --> 00:02:52.416
And also you have some food sources.

00:02:52.636 --> 00:02:56.676
&gt;&gt;I have a population of
students who are very diverse.

00:02:57.126 --> 00:03:01.196
Students who are African-American,
Hispanic, and Asian,

00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:06.866
and a lot of those students come
to us not equipped with the skills

00:03:06.946 --> 00:03:10.516
that some of our counterparts
in the city may have.

00:03:10.516 --> 00:03:14.506
&gt;&gt;And see how much you can
pick up with your beak.

00:03:14.976 --> 00:03:18.786
&gt;&gt;Their skills have
strengthened in reading, in math,

00:03:19.226 --> 00:03:22.716
in all subject areas as
a result of participating

00:03:22.716 --> 00:03:23.826
in project-based learning.

00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:24.716
&gt;&gt;Student: This is
how much we picked up,

00:03:24.716 --> 00:03:26.256
and this is how much we have left.

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:26.916
&gt;&gt;Beverly: All right.

00:03:27.016 --> 00:03:30.716
&gt;&gt;Student: We get to interact more
with each other, with the teacher.

00:03:30.786 --> 00:03:32.426
It's more fun.

00:03:32.506 --> 00:03:35.286
&gt;&gt;Beverly: One of my Hispanic
students spoke very little English

00:03:35.286 --> 00:03:36.966
when he came to me in September.

00:03:37.566 --> 00:03:42.766
And his involvement in project-based
learning has made him come

00:03:42.766 --> 00:03:43.706
out of his shell.

00:03:44.246 --> 00:03:47.536
He's eager to do whatever
you want him to do.

00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:49.466
He loves getting on the computer.

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.986
He is no longer the shy
student who did not want

00:03:52.986 --> 00:03:54.526
to talk when I called on him.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:57.096
Now he's eager to answer
it all the time.

00:03:57.416 --> 00:03:57.986
&gt;&gt;What were they doing?

00:03:58.086 --> 00:04:01.446
&gt;&gt;Student: They wanted to see how
one bug on the surface is different

00:04:01.446 --> 00:04:03.026
to the same bug in the lava too.

00:04:03.546 --> 00:04:05.436
&gt;&gt;Beverly: Okay, good, very good.

00:04:05.436 --> 00:04:06.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In addition

00:04:06.026 --> 00:04:09.536
to the interdisciplinary curriculum
materials, there's an opportunity

00:04:09.536 --> 00:04:12.476
for students to publish
their journals and chat live

00:04:12.476 --> 00:04:13.926
with scientists on the web.

00:04:14.446 --> 00:04:19.396
&gt;&gt;Gwendolyn: So kids can actually
actively engage with scientists,

00:04:19.656 --> 00:04:21.276
asking them their real-life
questions,

00:04:21.276 --> 00:04:24.456
and getting almost an
immediate response back.

00:04:24.456 --> 00:04:27.096
So it opens up the doors of
opportunity, and that's what

00:04:27.096 --> 00:04:29.596
that technology will
allow us to do here.

00:04:29.996 --> 00:04:33.246
&gt;&gt;Beverly: Now we're going
to show how volcanoes erupt.

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:36.476
&gt;&gt;Our students have a
very short attention span,

00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:39.416
so we have to constantly
think of ideas

00:04:39.776 --> 00:04:42.746
which to keep them busy,
to keep them involved.

00:04:43.096 --> 00:04:49.126
&gt;&gt;When she puts it in, close it.

00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:50.066
&gt;&gt;Student: Close it.

00:04:50.066 --> 00:04:56.826
&gt;&gt;Beverly: Quickly
[Gasps and laughter].

00:04:57.496 --> 00:05:00.336
&gt;&gt;Beverly: It gives you a lift when
you see the children are learning.

00:05:00.336 --> 00:05:04.586
You see on their faces what happens
during an experiment like we did

00:05:04.586 --> 00:05:08.786
in the classroom with the explosion
of the Alka-Seltzer in the film can.

00:05:09.016 --> 00:05:11.336
You know, they don't
see this every day.

00:05:11.506 --> 00:05:13.616
&gt;&gt;How would that compare
to a volcano erupting?

00:05:13.856 --> 00:05:16.296
&gt;&gt;Student: it probably-- with enough
pressure get in it, it'll pop.

00:05:16.746 --> 00:05:18.656
&gt;&gt;Beverly: All right, where
would that pressure come from?

00:05:19.016 --> 00:05:19.516
&gt;&gt;Student: The center.

00:05:20.036 --> 00:05:20.976
&gt;&gt;Beverly: The center of what?

00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:21.556
&gt;&gt;Student: The earth.

00:05:21.856 --> 00:05:22.146
&gt;&gt;Beverly: All right.

00:05:22.146 --> 00:05:25.976
&gt;&gt;For them to learn something from
that, and to connect that knowledge,

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:29.886
that gives me a lift,
and it makes me know

00:05:29.886 --> 00:05:32.646
that I'm having successes
in my classroom.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.746
And a teacher wants to have success.
