00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.650
My name is Joanne Cheung and I am a graduate
student in the Harvard Graduate School of

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.650
Design.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.110
I’m a fellow at Berkman this year, I’m
an artist, and an architect.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.169
This year I’m developing an analytical framework
for looking at public space, so physical space,

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.430
all the stuff around us, and discourse on
the internet.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.609
My background is in the fine arts, so I’ve
always cared about how to communicate something,

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.570
how something appears to someone not from
my own discipline.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.390
A lot of this came from, well, I guess two
things.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.590
One is the very jarring experience of the
past election and realizing that geographically,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.320
my understanding of the country that I live
in is very different than what I thought it

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.320
was.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.640
Also, this summer I became an American citizen,
so learning everything about the democratic

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.359
process was really interesting, and I thought
that I wanted to understand how my own discipline

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.820
intersected with the political process.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.300
There is no opting out of existing in this
system and I think now that everyone is so

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.730
deeply connected, the other side of that is
we’re all more alienated from the subjects

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:18.460
of our actions, so whether they’re intentional,
unintentional, or accidental, I think making

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.590
those connections visible is really important
now.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.932
Of course I always go back to that William
Gibson quote, “the future is already here,

00:01:25.932 --> 00:01:31.240
it’s just not evenly distributed,” but
then I go back and think about my own discipline,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.580
which is dealing with land and buildings,
and I was thinking, well, the future doesn’t

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.040
distribute itself, has land ever been evenly
distributed?

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.650
I can’t think of something that has.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.290
A lot of that comes down to human agency,
it comes down to decisions humans make.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.790
I think it’s not technology doing the work,
it’s people doing the work, and so, maybe

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.409
that gives me some worry, it scares me because
I want to define who those humans are, but

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.110
it also gives me a little bit of hope because
I’m a human, we all are, so there is potential

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.140
for making change and making a difference.
