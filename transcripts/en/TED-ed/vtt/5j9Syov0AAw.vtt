00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:10.170
Humans know the surprising prick
of a needle,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.539
the searing pain of a stubbed toe,

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.969
and the throbbing of a toothache.

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.600
We can identify many types of pain
and have multiple ways of treating it.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.850
But what about other species?

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.070
How do the animals all around us
experience pain?

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.230
It's important that we find out.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.851
We keep animals as pets,

00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:31.460
they enrich our environment,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.631
we farm many species for food,

00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:37.781
and we use them in experiments
to advance science and human health.

00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:39.830
Animals are clearly important to us,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.462
so it's equally important that we avoid
causing them unnecessary pain.

00:00:44.462 --> 00:00:47.111
For animals that are similar to us,
like mammals,

00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:50.281
it's often obvious when they're hurting.

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:52.521
But there's a lot that isn't obvious,

00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:56.201
like whether pain relievers that work
on us also help them.

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:58.121
And the more different 
an animal is from us,

00:00:58.121 --> 00:01:01.195
the harder it is to understand 
their experience.

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:03.802
How do you tell whether 
a shrimp is in pain?

00:01:03.802 --> 00:01:05.131
A snake?

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.691
A snail?

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:09.272
In vertebrates, including humans,

00:01:09.272 --> 00:01:12.482
pain can be split 
into two distinct processes.

00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:16.560
In first, nerves and the skin sense
something harmful

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.195
and communicate that information
to the spinal cord.

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:21.784
There, motor neurons activate movements

00:01:21.784 --> 00:01:24.682
that make us rapidly 
jerk away from the threat.

00:01:24.682 --> 00:01:28.322
This is the physical recognition of harm
called nociception,

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:29.578
and nearly all animals,

00:01:29.578 --> 00:01:32.297
even those with very simple 
nervous systems,

00:01:32.297 --> 00:01:33.765
experience it.

00:01:33.765 --> 00:01:36.752
Without this ability, animals would be
unable to avoid harm

00:01:36.752 --> 00:01:39.736
and their survival would be threatened.

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:43.455
The second part is the conscious
recognition of harm.

00:01:43.455 --> 00:01:46.593
In humans, this occurs when the sensory
neurons in our skin

00:01:46.593 --> 00:01:51.395
make a second round of connections
via the spinal cord to the brain.

00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:57.022
There, millions of neurons in multiple
regions create the sensations of pain.

00:01:57.022 --> 00:02:01.152
For us, this is a very complex experience
associated with emotions like fear,

00:02:01.152 --> 00:02:02.082
panic,

00:02:02.082 --> 00:02:03.212
and stress,

00:02:03.212 --> 00:02:05.734
which we can communicate to others.

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:08.483
But it's harder to know exactly
how animals experience

00:02:08.483 --> 00:02:10.592
this part of the process

00:02:10.592 --> 00:02:13.892
because most them can't show us
what they feel.

00:02:13.892 --> 00:02:18.543
However, we get clues from observing
how animals behave.

00:02:18.543 --> 00:02:22.493
Wild, hurt animals are known
to nurse their wounds,

00:02:22.493 --> 00:02:24.674
make noises to show their distress,

00:02:24.674 --> 00:02:27.033
and become reclusive.

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:31.154
In the lab, scientists have discovered
that animals like chickens and rats

00:02:31.154 --> 00:02:35.633
will self-administer pain-reducing
drugs if they're hurting.

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:39.184
Animals also avoid situations where
they've been hurt before,

00:02:39.184 --> 00:02:42.383
which suggests awareness of threats.

00:02:42.383 --> 00:02:45.204
We've reached the point that research
has made us so sure

00:02:45.204 --> 00:02:47.124
that vertebrates recognize pain

00:02:47.124 --> 00:02:51.634
that it's illegal in many countries
to needlessly harm these animals.

00:02:51.634 --> 00:02:56.054
But what about other types of animals
like invertebrates?

00:02:56.054 --> 00:02:58.313
These animals aren't legally protected,

00:02:58.313 --> 00:03:02.234
partly because their behaviors
are harder to read.

00:03:02.234 --> 00:03:04.436
We can make good guesses
about some of them,

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:05.274
like oysters,

00:03:05.274 --> 00:03:06.104
worms,

00:03:06.104 --> 00:03:07.324
and jellyfish.

00:03:07.324 --> 00:03:09.885
These are examples of animals
that either lack a brain

00:03:09.885 --> 00:03:12.225
or have a very simple one.

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:16.126
So an oyster may recoil when squirted
with lemon juice, for instance,

00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:18.815
because of nociception.

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:20.725
But with such a simple nervous system,

00:03:20.725 --> 00:03:24.525
it's unlikely to experience 
the conscious part of pain.

00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:27.475
Other invertebrate animals 
are more complicated, though,

00:03:27.475 --> 00:03:28.805
like the octopus,

00:03:28.805 --> 00:03:30.305
which has a sophisticated brain

00:03:30.305 --> 00:03:34.235
and is thought to be one of the most 
intelligent invertebrate animals.

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:39.686
Yet, in many countries, people continue
the practice of eating live octopus.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:43.905
We also boil live crawfish, shrimp, 
and crabs

00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:47.125
even though we don't really know
how they're affected either.

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:48.997
This poses an ethical problem

00:03:48.997 --> 00:03:52.905
because we may be causing these animals
unnecessary suffering.

00:03:52.905 --> 00:03:57.036
Scientific experimentation,
though controversial, gives us some clues.

00:03:57.036 --> 00:04:01.378
Tests on hermit crabs show that they'll
leave an undesirable shell

00:04:01.378 --> 00:04:03.497
if they're zapped with electricity

00:04:03.497 --> 00:04:05.806
but stay if it's a good shell.

00:04:05.806 --> 00:04:09.257
And octopi that may originally curl up
an injured arm to protect it

00:04:09.257 --> 00:04:12.307
will risk using it to catch prey.

00:04:12.307 --> 00:04:16.826
That suggests that these animals make
value judgements around sensory input

00:04:16.826 --> 00:04:20.296
instead of just reacting 
reflexively to harm.

00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:23.897
Meanwhile, crabs have been known
to repeatedly rub a spot on their bodies

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:26.687
where they've received an electric shock.

00:04:26.687 --> 00:04:28.567
And even sea slugs flinch

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:31.896
when they know they're about 
to receive a noxious stimulus.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:35.979
That means they have some memory
of physical sensations.

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.368
We still have a lot to learn about
animal pain.

00:04:38.368 --> 00:04:40.387
As our knowledge grows,

00:04:40.387 --> 00:04:45.127
it may one day allow us to live in a world
where we don't cause pain needlessly.
