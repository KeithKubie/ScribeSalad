- By now
it's late October,

00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:03.936
it's heading towards November,

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:06.239
and we've actually done
something remarkable.

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:09.042
We have completed what
was originally planned

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:12.545 align:start size:84% position:16%
as the first section
of our thru-hike.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:14.380 align:start size:88% position:13%
And we've got to a
point in the river where

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.116 align:start size:88% position:13%
we're actually climbing
out of the canyon,

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:19.985 align:start size:94% position:6%
it's about a 3,500-foot
climb along a very obscure

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:23.289 align:start size:97% position:3%
and very difficult route known
as the Walter Powell Trail,

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.058
named after the brother
of John Wesley Powell

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:29.462 line:0%
who was on that expedition
in the summer of 1869.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:32.465 line:0%
And when we got to
the rim of the canyon,

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.067 line:0%
we met this lady.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.201 line:0%
- So this is Renea Yellowhorse.

00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:38.371
She's a Navajo woman
who has spent her life

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.007 align:start size:94% position:6%
out on the horizontal
world of the Grand Canyon.

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.176
She lives up on, basically,

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:45.645 align:start size:97% position:3%
the rim up here, her family
has grazed sheep here

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.046
for hundreds of years.

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:48.948 line:0%
She's standing in a
place where there's

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:51.884 line:0%
one of the most impactful
development projects

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:53.419 line:0%
that is about to happen.

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:55.855 line:0%
And she's basically
become a voice

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.591
and a leader for this group
called Save the Confluence.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.893 align:start size:84% position:16%
And they're fighting
to save this land

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:02.328
and this area of Grand Canyon.

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:06.365
And it's become a very
controversial issue,

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.834
it has divided the
Navajo community.

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:11.137
And we figure that instead of

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:12.605
us talking about it,

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:16.709 align:start size:94% position:6%
we let you hear what they
say and their voices.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.445 line:0%
- The gondola would bring
people all the way down

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:21.414 line:0%
to the confluence

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:22.681 line:0%
and there at the river level

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.517 line:0%
they would have a
elevated walkway,

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:27.286 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
a snack bar, a
restroom facility.

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:31.190 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
Enough services to take
care of 10,000 people a day.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.892
- You're gonna employ
an awful lot of people

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:34.327
in an impoverished area

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.629 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
and help them save
their culture.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:39.432 line:0%
What's better than that?

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:42.101 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Any idea of
disrupting this area

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.037 align:start size:84% position:16%
with your jackhammers,
with your machinery

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.905 align:start size:84% position:16%
or whatever dynamite
or explosive

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.506 line:0%
you want to bring in here,

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:50.577 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
you're basically
destroying a shrine.

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:54.514 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The confluence,
little Colorado River

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:56.649
meets the Colorado River.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.252 line:0%
Where they meet, this
is where life begins,

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:02.121 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
this is what our
grandmothers tell us.

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:03.723
It is a sacred space,

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:05.457
and we don't want to see

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:08.861
the Disneyland on the
edge of the canyon.

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.363 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I think the view
from the bottom

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:13.900
gives one a perspective of
one's place in the universe.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.901
If I were to hike down to
the bottom of the canyon

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:17.336
I'd have to be airvac'd out

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:19.438
because of my knees and ankles.

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:21.673
And so we're trying to
offer the average person

00:02:21.673 --> 00:02:23.743
that below-the-rim experience.

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:26.145 align:start position:0%
- It's like a lot of experiences
throughout the world.

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:28.247
You know you're never gonna
be on the top of Everest.

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:31.951 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
We provide an incredible
visitor experience

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:35.054 align:start size:81% position:19%
for millions of
people every year.

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:38.391
But we can't provide every
experience for every person

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.126
based on their own
individual abilities.

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:44.263
- When I come here, I
wish to commune with

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:46.198 align:start size:81% position:19%
the ones that have
gone before me,

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:49.301 align:start size:94% position:6%
like my great-grandmother
and my father.

00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:52.805 align:start size:84% position:16%
And know that they are
that special place.

00:02:55.207 --> 00:02:58.044
That if the Escalade
Development comes in,

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:00.512
that it would dig into
the heart of our mothers,

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:04.650
Mother Earth, and I would
never be able to come here

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.686
to feel that way again.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.922
(dramatic piano music)

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.592 align:start size:94% position:6%
- So we left the politics,
the stormy politics

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:14.927
of the Grand Escalade behind us,

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:16.195
'cause we had to
move downstream.

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:17.730
We had 500 miles to go.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.131
We actually walked back down

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:22.201
through the area
that it would be

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:23.703
built if it were to be built

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:27.240
and we moved down through
the kaleidoscope of colors,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.374
which is so famous
at the Grand Canyon,

00:03:29.374 --> 00:03:31.143
but the reality is, once again,

00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:32.444
we were in the situation where

00:03:32.444 --> 00:03:33.679
you can't follow the river.

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:36.181
You come into sections
like the Inner Gorge

00:03:36.181 --> 00:03:38.851 align:start size:97% position:3%
where you're constantly
getting pinned and locked up

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:41.321
on these different
benches of rock.

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:45.525 align:start size:94% position:6%
So we've left food roughly
every five to ten days

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:47.660
in plastic buckets.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.161
Not a lot of food but,

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:50.763 align:start size:84% position:16%
so we're on a timed
schedule to get there,

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:53.099
but more importantly, we have
to get to water every day,

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.168
we can't carry more than
one day's worth of water.

00:03:56.168 --> 00:03:58.671 align:start size:88% position:13%
And so we're constantly
trying to find ways

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.006
to move down canyon,

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:01.140
sometimes on these benches

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.408
way above the river,

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.809
but we have to get
back to the river.

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.211
- And when we get to the river

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:07.880 align:start size:97% position:3%
a whole new set of problems
present themselves.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.617 align:start size:97% position:3%
It seemed like impenetrable
thickets of thorns

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:13.919
created by these dense groves of

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.822
acacia trees, mesquite.

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:20.560
And that's to say nothing of
the cactus that you encounter

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.262
and the attentiveness
that you have to apply

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:26.598
to avoid stepping
on these things.

00:04:26.598 --> 00:04:29.135 align:start size:84% position:16%
And so the challenges
and the rigors

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:32.305
are still taking a
toll on our bodies.

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:35.474 align:start size:97% position:3%
We're still feeling the
impact of this environment.

00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:36.942
The difference, however,

00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:41.347 align:start size:97% position:3%
is that unlike in
September, we're holding up.

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:43.382
And in fact, we're
not only holding up,

00:04:43.382 --> 00:04:46.685 align:start size:81% position:19%
but we're starting
to see evidence

00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:49.354
of our personalities reemerge.

00:04:49.354 --> 00:04:51.623
Every now and then I'd look over

00:04:51.623 --> 00:04:54.627 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I'd see the
kind of Pete McBride

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:58.464
that I know and recognize.

00:04:59.564 --> 00:05:01.567
And Pete would look over at me,

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:04.870
and he would see the
kind of Kevin Fedarko

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.706
that he's used to being around.

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:09.642
(audience laughing)

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.210
So basically what's
happening is that

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.146
we're feeling comfortable
enough in this environment

00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:17.650
that we are reverting to
what passes for normalcy

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.685
between the two of us.

00:05:19.685 --> 00:05:23.422
(audience laughing)

00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:25.724
(chuckling)

00:05:25.724 --> 00:05:28.260
- Alright, so it's now January.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.196
We've moved all the way
down to the South Rim.

00:05:31.196 --> 00:05:33.366
And I want you to
look at the lights

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:34.633
on the top of this frame.

00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:36.702
This is where you'd
enter the South Rim,

00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:39.071
this where 5 1/2
million visitors

00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:41.139 align:start size:84% position:16%
come to Grand Canyon
National Park.

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.507
They do a remarkable job there.

00:05:42.507 --> 00:05:44.143
But the lights in the distance

00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:45.744
is where the second,

00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:48.847
basically it's the southern
threat that's coming in.

00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:51.249 align:start size:88% position:13%
So the gateway community
called Tusayan,

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:54.119
they've proposed 2,800 homes,

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:57.022
two million square feet
of commercial space,

00:05:57.022 --> 00:05:58.657
a water ski park.

00:05:58.657 --> 00:06:00.826
And what we started realizing

00:06:00.826 --> 00:06:02.261
and what we continued
to want to explore

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:04.063
is what happens up
here on the rim,

00:06:04.063 --> 00:06:06.599
how is it gonna affect
life down here below,

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.500 align:start size:84% position:16%
how is it gonna affect
the water table,

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.602
the complex water table
that runs though it,

00:06:10.602 --> 00:06:12.538 align:start size:84% position:16%
how is it gonna
affect the wildlife.

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:13.973
So as we move downstream,

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:15.474 align:start size:94% position:6%
we actually start
depending on the wildlife

00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:17.042
in an unusual way,

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:20.746
mostly the sheep but also we
start following lion tracks.

00:06:20.746 --> 00:06:22.882 align:start size:84% position:16%
For four days we
followed lion tracks

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:25.084
along the Esplanade layer.

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:26.785
But just as you think
you're starting to get

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:29.922 align:start size:88% position:13%
kinda Grand Canyon savvy
and get the kind of

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:31.590
vibe of the place,

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.126
it kicks you in the gut again.

00:06:34.126 --> 00:06:36.495 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So winter in the
Grand Canyon announces

00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:40.866
its arrival in the form of
a bunch of massive storms

00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:44.904 align:start position:0%
that have rolled across, they've
rolled through the Pacific,

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:47.807 align:start size:97% position:3%
they've rolled across the West
Coast of the United States

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:51.344 align:start position:0%
and they start hitting the
Southwest, the Desert Southwest,

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:52.544
and when they do so,

00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:54.147
the first thing that happens is

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:58.083 align:start size:97% position:3%
they hammer the temperatures
way down below zero.

00:06:58.083 --> 00:07:00.286
And so you're huddled
in your tents at night,

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:02.121 align:start size:88% position:13%
you're trying to protect
your water bottles

00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:03.555
and keep them from freezing,

00:07:03.555 --> 00:07:06.692
and then, the storms,
they start unloading

00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:09.127 align:start size:84% position:16%
the precipitation that
they carry in them.

00:07:09.127 --> 00:07:12.298
And the snow begins
to fall late at night

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:13.499
when it's dark.

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:14.767 align:start size:84% position:16%
You don't really
know what's happening

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:16.302 align:start size:81% position:19%
except you hear
these ice crystals

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:18.837 align:start size:81% position:19%
landing in the
wall of your tent.

00:07:18.837 --> 00:07:20.773
And you wake up in the
morning and you realize

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:23.141 align:start size:84% position:16%
that this world that
you are inside of

00:07:23.141 --> 00:07:26.278
and suspended in has
been coated and glazed

00:07:26.278 --> 00:07:29.948
in a layer of ice 10
to 11 inches thick,

00:07:29.948 --> 00:07:32.785
which has rendered the business,

00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:34.887
the imperative business
of moving downstream

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:36.822
toward those food caches

00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:39.826 align:start size:84% position:16%
terrifying and
absolutely dangerous.

00:07:43.262 --> 00:07:44.663
- [Woman] One right there.

00:07:44.663 --> 00:07:46.432
- I don't know how to get my

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:47.767
feet into these.

00:07:49.801 --> 00:07:52.871
- [Kevin] So frozen I can't
even straighten the toe.

00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:55.841
- This is acts of desperation

00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:59.011
in an unexpectedly
gigantic snowstorm.

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:01.580
(mumbles) You can't
get your insole out,

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.414
can you?
- I can't.

00:08:02.414 --> 00:08:04.183
It's frozen in there.

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:09.188 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So we made it through that
area called Owl Eyes Bay.

00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:11.023
It was probably one of the
most physically challenging,

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:13.092 align:start size:84% position:16%
most grueling sections
of the trip for us

00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:15.194
on a number of levels.

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:17.830
I think on some points it
was a bit of a milestone

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.465
for us to get through it,

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:21.133
but it didn't let up.

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:23.401
We got through the
snow on some of them,

00:08:23.401 --> 00:08:25.505
but the temperatures persisted.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.373 align:start size:94% position:6%
Compared to the fall where
it was over a hundred,

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:28.940
it's not below zero.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.777 align:start size:84% position:16%
We saw temperatures
of minus seven,

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start size:97% position:3%
for a week after it hovered
around five degrees.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.215 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I'm just gonna give
you a little backup

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:38.283
on the challenges
I was faced with

00:08:38.283 --> 00:08:42.354 align:start size:84% position:16%
trying to capture this
place and our story

00:08:42.354 --> 00:08:43.989
with one camera, with one lens,

00:08:43.989 --> 00:08:47.059 align:start size:94% position:6%
with one tiny solar
panel and four batteries.

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:51.497 align:start size:97% position:3%
There is no socket to go pop
your camera to charge in.

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:54.499
And cameras and batteries,
they hate cold temperature,

00:08:54.499 --> 00:08:56.268
so I basically would crawl in

00:08:56.268 --> 00:08:57.736
when I would finally go to bed,

00:08:57.736 --> 00:09:00.305 align:start size:97% position:3%
when I'm not trying to capture
the magnificent starlight,

00:09:00.305 --> 00:09:01.640
I would go and I would

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.543
sleep the entire night
stashing my batteries

00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:07.346 align:start size:88% position:13%
in my armpit or anywhere
that I could find any

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:09.648 align:start size:84% position:16%
shade of warmth, which
I really couldn't

00:09:09.648 --> 00:09:11.483
because I took some
stupid sleeping bag,

00:09:11.483 --> 00:09:13.385
I wasn't really warm enough.

00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:16.321
But it's part of the
deal on some level.

00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:17.690
What'd you think?

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.325
- What did I think?

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:22.595
(audience laughing)

00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:23.829
Here's what I think.

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:25.264
I think that what
I hate the most

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:27.900 align:start size:97% position:3%
about working with a National
Geographic photographer

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.802
is something like this.

00:09:29.802 --> 00:09:33.238
When you take undiluted
suffering and misery

00:09:33.238 --> 00:09:35.073
and you weave it into
an image of beauty,

00:09:35.073 --> 00:09:37.843
you are creating an
act of fraudulence.

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:40.846
(audience laughing)

00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:46.385
This is what it's like to be me.

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:47.619
Huddled inside of a tent

00:09:47.619 --> 00:09:51.023
with every stitch of
clothing I own on me,

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:52.692
wanting not to go outside

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:56.862 align:start size:97% position:3%
and this guy is flitting
around like some photo firefly

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.167
early in the morning
and late at night.

00:10:02.367 --> 00:10:04.202
When I think back now,

00:10:04.202 --> 00:10:06.004
it was really bad, the
hundred degree heat wave

00:10:06.004 --> 00:10:08.340
in September, but it
didn't compare to this,

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.642 align:start size:84% position:16%
it was just so
miserable and so awful

00:10:10.642 --> 00:10:11.977
that I don't even like to look

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:13.412 align:start size:97% position:3%
at this photograph 'cause--
- C'mon! C'mon!

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:14.779 align:start size:81% position:19%
- It triggers a
level of visual PTSD--

00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:18.317
- Wait, whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa now. (laughs)

00:10:18.317 --> 00:10:20.118
He gets going.

00:10:20.118 --> 00:10:21.987
Alright, let's be
fair, there's one,

00:10:21.987 --> 00:10:24.323
you enjoyed sections, right?

00:10:25.757 --> 00:10:26.959
- Alright, I will admit,

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.027 align:start size:88% position:13%
yes, there were some
things that I did enjoy.

00:10:29.027 --> 00:10:31.597
It's difficult for
me to recall them,

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:33.365
but as it turns out,
here's one of them,

00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:35.701 align:start size:94% position:6%
and it occurred,
actually, I have to admit,

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:37.869
each and every day.

00:10:37.869 --> 00:10:39.070
So the thing is, that like,

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.107
there is this moment that comes

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:44.143
after you've completed your
journey through the canyon

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:45.344
at the end of the day

00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:46.612 align:start size:81% position:19%
and you've finally
stopped moving

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:47.947
and you've set up camp.

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:50.749
And you heat up some food,

00:10:50.749 --> 00:10:52.918
and you get something
hot into your belly.

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:56.021 align:start size:97% position:3%
And you're feeling this
delicious sense of relaxation,

00:10:56.021 --> 00:10:57.423
and then what happens is

00:10:57.423 --> 00:10:59.624
that you lean back
and you stare up

00:10:59.624 --> 00:11:02.628 align:start size:97% position:3%
and you realize that something
extraordinary is happening.

00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:04.830 align:start size:84% position:16%
You are reminded
that the Grand Canyon

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start size:84% position:16%
is graced by something
exceptional each
and every night.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.103 align:start size:94% position:6%
You are inside of an
abyss that is a mile deep,

00:11:12.103 --> 00:11:14.039 align:start size:84% position:16%
one of the greatest
environments on earth,

00:11:14.039 --> 00:11:17.243
a place that has been
polished and carved out

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:19.378 align:start size:84% position:16%
by the greatest river
in the Southwest

00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:21.246
that is still running
through its bottom

00:11:21.246 --> 00:11:22.881
thousands of feet below you,

00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:24.650
and you realize that that river

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.219 align:start size:88% position:13%
is reflected in a second
river that is arched

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:30.255 align:start size:97% position:3%
over your head, a celestial
river of starlight,

00:11:30.255 --> 00:11:32.591 align:start size:94% position:6%
and you are caught
between these two rivers,

00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:34.592
and you are held in a beauty

00:11:34.592 --> 00:11:37.263
that hinges on the juxtaposition

00:11:38.463 --> 00:11:41.333
between harshness
and aestheticism.

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.201
It is an extraordinary thing,

00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:46.138
it is a privilege and is a gift.

00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:47.505
And I do have to admit

00:11:47.505 --> 00:11:50.442
that encountering that
each and every night

00:11:50.442 --> 00:11:52.677
is one of the closest things
that I've ever experienced

00:11:52.677 --> 00:11:54.080
to true religion.

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:59.985 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I would say he may hate
my fraudulent photos,

00:12:01.453 --> 00:12:03.922
but there are times that I
definitely wanted to stop

00:12:03.922 --> 00:12:06.425
and his passion kept me going.

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:07.693
And we had to keep going.

00:12:07.693 --> 00:12:10.329
The reality is we couldn't

00:12:10.329 --> 00:12:12.764
soak up the starlight
like we wanted to,

00:12:12.764 --> 00:12:15.133
we had to crawl out of our bags.

00:12:15.133 --> 00:12:16.702
We descended into Olo Canyon,

00:12:16.702 --> 00:12:18.237
this is how you
enter Olo Canyon,

00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:20.005 align:start size:94% position:6%
it's one of the most
magnificent slot canyons

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:21.240
in all of Grand Canyon.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.376 align:start size:81% position:19%
It's a 200-foot
repel, free repel.

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:25.777
You're cold and miserable,

00:12:25.777 --> 00:12:27.345
but you have to come in here

00:12:27.345 --> 00:12:29.214
and start your day
and find your way

00:12:29.214 --> 00:12:31.016
through this remarkable maze.

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:33.618
I could've spent weeks in
here as a photographer,

00:12:33.618 --> 00:12:35.754
it is total magic.

00:12:35.754 --> 00:12:38.557
But the reality is,
like I said before,

00:12:38.557 --> 00:12:42.327 align:start size:84% position:16%
we cached food every
distances apart,

00:12:42.327 --> 00:12:45.363 align:start size:88% position:13%
we were on a 10-day
food line at this point,

00:12:45.363 --> 00:12:47.466
and we have basically run out,

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:49.968
we have about a day's worth,

00:12:49.968 --> 00:12:51.503 align:start size:81% position:19%
we're running down
to jelly beans,

00:12:51.503 --> 00:12:52.971
and so we're in a race for food.

00:12:52.971 --> 00:12:55.374
Here's a little snippet on that.

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:57.175
Got one day left of food.

00:12:57.175 --> 00:13:01.613
Even though we're two days
away from our food cache.

00:13:01.613 --> 00:13:03.381
- [Woman] Got it!

00:13:03.381 --> 00:13:06.118 align:start size:88% position:13%
- What'd ya get?
- We're gonna eat again!

00:13:06.118 --> 00:13:09.187
(screaming)

00:13:09.187 --> 00:13:11.590
These are loaded baked potatoes.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.925
- [Woman] Shut the front door.
Like chipotle?

00:13:13.925 --> 00:13:15.160
- Yes!

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.329 align:start size:84% position:16%
So as it happens when
you camp or hike,

00:13:18.329 --> 00:13:20.499
food becomes kind of important,

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:23.535 align:start size:94% position:6%
but we're now, once again,
happy and we've found

00:13:23.535 --> 00:13:25.137
the Yellow Brick
Road, so to speak,

00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:27.405 align:start size:97% position:3%
this is the Muav limestone
layer that we took

00:13:27.405 --> 00:13:30.776 align:start size:88% position:13%
for a short distance,
about three river miles.

00:13:30.776 --> 00:13:32.076
Kenton Grua, actually,

00:13:32.076 --> 00:13:33.778
that Kevin featured in his book,

00:13:33.778 --> 00:13:35.346 align:start size:84% position:16%
was the first person
to ever realize

00:13:35.346 --> 00:13:37.148
you could connect these benches,

00:13:37.148 --> 00:13:39.952
we're basically following
the black pellets of gold

00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:42.554
we call them, the
bighorn sheep poop,

00:13:42.554 --> 00:13:46.291 align:start size:97% position:3%
and we weaved our way
through here up to Mat Cat,

00:13:46.291 --> 00:13:48.660 align:start size:84% position:16%
we climbed our way
back up from the river

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.895
back up onto the layer and then

00:13:50.895 --> 00:13:52.931
weaved and ducked
and dived our way

00:13:52.931 --> 00:13:54.900 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
all the way around
up into Havasu,

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.601 line:0%
because we wanted to
really investigate,

00:13:56.601 --> 00:13:57.970 line:0%
you see these black lines here,

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.305 line:0%
these black circles,
the uranium mines,

00:14:00.305 --> 00:14:03.375 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
we want to try to
understand that issue.

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:05.310
- And the destination,

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.278
the endpoint of this segment,

00:14:07.278 --> 00:14:08.914
the place that we were headed

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start size:97% position:3%
was the kingdom of the people
of the blue-green water.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.954
This is a very special
part of the Grand Canyon.

00:14:15.954 --> 00:14:20.092 align:start size:97% position:3%
And it is home to the tiniest
tribe of Native Americans

00:14:20.092 --> 00:14:22.661
who live either around
or inside the canyon,

00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:24.330
the Havasupai people

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.735 align:start size:97% position:3%
who live inside of what
looks to be an idyllic home,

00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:30.969 align:start size:84% position:16%
but they're
incredibly vulnerable

00:14:30.969 --> 00:14:32.403 align:start size:88% position:13%
because one of the
things about the canyon

00:14:32.403 --> 00:14:34.005
is that everything is connected

00:14:34.005 --> 00:14:35.507
and so they are aware,

00:14:35.507 --> 00:14:38.243
perhaps at a deeper level
than almost anyone else

00:14:38.243 --> 00:14:40.145
just how vulnerable they are

00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:42.514 align:start size:97% position:3%
to the sorts of things that
are happening right now

00:14:42.514 --> 00:14:44.349
in the rim of the Grand Canyon.

00:14:44.349 --> 00:14:46.985
- So this is the Havasupai
coming out to do a protest

00:14:46.985 --> 00:14:48.520
in front of the canyon mine,

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.822
the canyon mine sits on the
south side of Grand Canyon,

00:14:50.822 --> 00:14:53.325 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's out of the border
of the park itself,

00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:54.859
but the Havasupai fear

00:14:54.859 --> 00:14:57.396
that it's well within the
watershed of Grand Canyon

00:14:57.396 --> 00:14:59.898 align:start position:0%
and if there were to be a
breach or anything would happen,

00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:01.499 align:start size:81% position:19%
that it would flow
down right into

00:15:01.499 --> 00:15:03.869
their water source, their life.

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:06.004
I spent time with
the uranium miners,

00:15:06.004 --> 00:15:09.207
all guys trying to hang
on and do their job best,

00:15:09.207 --> 00:15:10.942 align:start size:84% position:16%
they're doing
everything legally,

00:15:10.942 --> 00:15:12.210
it's a contentious area,

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.145 align:start size:88% position:13%
a lot of people are
against uranium mining,

00:15:14.145 --> 00:15:16.615
the challenge here is
nobody has the money

00:15:16.615 --> 00:15:19.952 align:start size:84% position:16%
to drill a 3,000-foot
well to monitor

00:15:19.952 --> 00:15:22.554
these mines and if they're
acting appropriately or not.

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:24.423
They're dealing with systems,

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:26.258 align:start size:94% position:6%
environmental regulations
that are not meant

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:27.959
for the Grand Canyon,

00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:30.128
there's only one Grand Canyon.

00:15:30.128 --> 00:15:31.896
And if you get above
this and start to see

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:34.065
the proximity, this
is on the north side,

00:15:34.065 --> 00:15:36.101
this is Arizona 1 mine.

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:38.002
This is outside of
the park boundary,

00:15:38.002 --> 00:15:39.604
but as you can see from the air,

00:15:39.604 --> 00:15:42.507
everything is connected, it's
well within the watershed.

00:15:42.507 --> 00:15:44.509
So if anything were to go wrong

00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:46.077
in a uranium situation,

00:15:46.077 --> 00:15:49.915 align:start size:97% position:3%
it would go right down into
the lifeline of the Southwest.
