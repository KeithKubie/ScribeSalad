00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.450
We're asked to prove
that triangle ADC is

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.810
congruent to triangle BEC, so
this left triangle's congruent

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.980
to this right triangle, and the
figure is not drawn to scale.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.110
And we should never
assume that it is.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.010
And then we have
some givens here.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.700
So they tell us that segment
AC is congruent to BC.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.050
So AC is congruent to BC.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.080
And they also tell us that
CD is congruent to CE.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.530
So CD is congruent to CE.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.160
And I've got to mark it twice,
because CD is not necessarily

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.580
the right length as CA.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.274
In fact, they don't
look anywhere close,

00:00:34.274 --> 00:00:35.190
so we can't assume it.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.640
But they tell us that
CD is congruent to CE.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.892
So what else can we figure out
about this little diagram here

00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:44.850
in order to be able to
say this left triangle's

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.054
congruent to the right?

00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:48.220
Well, the one thing we know
is that this angle right

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.910
over here, angle ACD, is
congruent to angle BCE.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.430
So let's write that down.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.455
Angle ACD, and we don't have
to write the angle symbol.

00:00:58.455 --> 00:01:00.580
And it's not easy to write
the angle symbol anyway,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.630
it figures it out later
that we're actually

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.920
talking about an angle.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.170
Angle ACD is congruent
to BCE, and we

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.440
can say that because
they're vertical angles.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.690
Vertical angles are equal.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.190
Fair enough.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.720
And there you go, it added
the angle symbols for us.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.860
And now, we can, I think,
well, that's enough information

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.630
to say that they are congruent.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.476
We can now say that triangle ADC
is congruent to triangle BEC.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.885
And we know that because we have
a side, an angle, and a side.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.114
So by side-angle-side
congruence.

00:01:43.114 --> 00:01:44.780
Sometimes it takes a
little bit of time,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.910
it hangs up a little bit.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.570
Luckily for me, this
time it did not do that.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.100
And so I think I am done.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.150
So let me check my answer here.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.400
Drum roll.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.388
And it worked.
