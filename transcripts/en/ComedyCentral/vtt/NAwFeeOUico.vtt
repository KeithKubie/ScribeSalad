00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:02.469
- I'm creating a website
with all the ammunition

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.938 align:start size:84% position:16%
that a cyberbully
will need to attack.

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:06.339
I'm not just feeding the trolls,

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.842 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm rolling out an
all-you-can-eat buffet.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.745
After uploading some of
my childhood pictures

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.614
along with my email
and phone number

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:17.650
I offered $50 as bait
and posted my challenge

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.753
to Reddit and 4chan, ground zero

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:22.155
for the internet's
most vicious trolls.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:23.957
Let's see what happens.

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:28.561 align:start size:84% position:16%
Within hours the
hate came flying in.

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.264
At first it was insults
about my intelligence,

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:35.068
a few about my age slash looks,

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:39.739
some made no sense at all.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.009
Then came the threats.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:44.577
Basically, dude,
people will attack

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.212
your family to get to you.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.248
It's best if you don't
make a public statement

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.250
that you're impenetrable.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.185
I carried on with
the rest of my day

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:54.788
as the attacks kept coming.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.189
The ext morning I discovered

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:59.025 align:start size:88% position:13%
my Instagram and Twitter
accounts were hacked.

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.528 align:start size:94% position:6%
After an eagle-eyed
troll noticed my password

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:02.962
in my challenge photo.

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.697 align:start size:84% position:16%
A password my
assistant, Jasmine,

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.599
assured me was out of focus.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.802
Then the memes hit.

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:13.139
(light, intense music)

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:16.609 align:start size:97% position:3%
The cyberbullies were obsessed
with one of my photos,

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.244
trying to to one up each other

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.380
by portraying me as a sex dildo.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:24.617 align:start size:81% position:19%
But one troll rose
above the rest,

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:29.155 align:start position:0%
slamming me with nonstop images,
memes, and unfortunately,

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.858
poetry.

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:35.228 align:start size:97% position:3%
I responded to the troll
and said if he wanted my $50

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.297
he would have to
appear on camera.

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:41.267
He agreed but only if he
could choose the location.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.903
He's given me coordinates
and we're almost there.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:46.072 align:start size:84% position:16%
He had complete
home-court advantage,

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:48.975 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I was unsure what
sport we were even playing.

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.343
Follow the light, cuck.

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:53.746
Can't even spell cock right.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.248
There he is, there he is.

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:59.352 align:start size:97% position:3%
I now had a rare chance to
confront a troll face to face.

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:00.887 align:start size:72% position:28%
Hey man.
- Hey, shit.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:01.888
- How should I address you?

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:02.989
- Lol Jessie.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.591
- Little Jessie?

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.758
- Lol, do this shit for lol's,

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:08.361 align:start size:88% position:13%
lol's sec, lol's hacker
group, fuck yeah.

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:10.296 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I said cyberbully
me and here are

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.764
some of the things you did.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:13.633
You sent a picture of someone
holding a bottle of pills.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.903 align:start size:94% position:6%
It says jon dore's libtard
agenda on the pills.

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:18.104
- Yeah.

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:20.206
- So you think I'm
liberal and retarded?

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:21.040
- Yeah.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.543
- Here's another one.

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:25.712 align:start size:81% position:19%
You posted what
looks like a tweet

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:29.582 align:start size:94% position:6%
coming from Kim Jong-Un's
personal account.

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:30.950
It says got my first

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.652 align:start size:94% position:6%
intercontinental
ballistic missile working,

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:34.320 align:start size:84% position:16%
where should I
send my first nuke?

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.357 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then you have a
poll, Jon's front door.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:38.858 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah.
- Sixty-eight percent.

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:39.859
- Yeah.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:40.793
- I'm gonna take
issue with this.

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:42.228
I live in the United States now.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.730 align:start size:81% position:19%
If you were to
nuke my front door

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.498
you'd also already be nuking
the United States of America.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:46.733
- Is it going to happen?

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.768
- Yeah, 68% of people
do want it to hit,

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:50.270
oh is this all fake?

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.638 align:start size:84% position:16%
You didn't actually
put out a poll?

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:52.906
- No.
- oh.

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:55.008
So then you've gone into
some poetry, if I may.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:55.842
- I did.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:56.809
That one I'm proud of.

00:02:58.411 --> 00:02:59.679
- So this is what you wrote.

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.915
What's true of you
is you're mediocre,

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:03.449
but you covered
up like a choker,

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.418
but you're still a choker.

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.353 align:start size:84% position:16%
Notice you just rhymed
choker with choker?

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:08.688 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, cause I used
a double meaning.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.223
- That's an air ball.

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:11.224
- How old are you?

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:12.058
- How old do you think I am?

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:13.593
- Like 49?

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:15.628
- All right, let's just move on.

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.063
What advice would
you give to kids

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:19.199
who are being trolled
or bullied online?

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.734
- Keep your sanity
by going insane.

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.836
I mean I was a little
kid getting bullied

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.738
and I toughened up.

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:29.008 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Okay, let's say your
trolling made me freak out

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.644
and blow my head off in
a microwave or something?

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:34.747 align:start position:0%
- I don't hold personal
responsibility for your choices.

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:36.649
- Do you think you'll
be a troll forever?

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.151
- Yeah, hell yeah.

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.853
If anyone's gonna save the
world from a big brother

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:44.457
type reality, it's gonna be
the motherfucking trolls.

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:46.059
- Have you ever felt remorseful

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.094 align:start size:84% position:16%
about any of the
trolling you've done?

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:49.762 align:start size:72% position:28%
- No.
- None at all?

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:51.164
- Zero percent.

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:53.967 align:start size:97% position:3%
Have you ever heard of
Aristotle's extreme of means?

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:56.769
- Totally I have, but for the
viewers explain it to them.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.506
- So in order to
correct a virtue

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:05.478 align:start position:0%
you try to practice the extreme
antithesis of that virtue

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:10.583
'cause you don't find virtue
on one extreme or the other.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:15.088
Virtue, virtueness isn't
binary, it's balanced.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.056
Yeah, that's Aristotle's--

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:18.091
- Extreme of means.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.459
- Yeah, exactly.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.327 align:start position:0%
Well, you did win the
cyberbully challenge hands down

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:22.528
so I do owe you $50.

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:24.464 align:start size:88% position:13%
Actually, will you give
me an apology first

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:25.298
before I give it to you?

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:26.466
- Fuck no, what?

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:27.900 align:start size:88% position:13%
- For the horrible
things you said online?

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.503 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You can get a handshake
and maybe a bro hug.

00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:34.674
- All right, $50,
handshake, bro hug.

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:36.943
- No, no, that's a
full ass fucking hug.
