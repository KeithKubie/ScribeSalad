00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:03.092
- [Voiceover] The
geometric sequence a sub i,

00:00:03.092 --> 00:00:06.041
is defined by the formula
where the first term,

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:08.293
a sub one is equal to negative 1/8,

00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:11.613
and then every term after
that is defined as being,

00:00:11.613 --> 00:00:16.613
so a sub i is going to be two
times the term before that.

00:00:16.652 --> 00:00:20.646
A sub i is two times a sub i, minus one.

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:24.813
What is a sub four, the
fourth term in the sequence?

00:00:24.813 --> 00:00:28.017
Pause the video, and see
if you can work this out.

00:00:28.017 --> 00:00:30.530
Well there's a couple of ways
that you could tackle this.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.047
One is to just directly
use these formulas.

00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:36.635
We could say that a sub four,

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:38.579
well that's going to be
this case right over here.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.666
A sub four is going to be
equal to two times a sub three.

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.800
Well, a sub three, if we
go and use this formula,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.590
is going to be equal
to two times a sub two.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.702
Each term is equal to two
times the term before it.

00:00:52.702 --> 00:00:54.138
Then we go back to this formula again,

00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:58.367
and say a sub two is going
to be two times a sub one.

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:00.487
Two times a sub one.

00:01:00.487 --> 00:01:05.487
Lucky for us, we know that
a sub one is negative 1/8.

00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:09.842
It's going to be two times negative 1/8,

00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:13.008
which is equal to negative 1/4.

00:01:13.918 --> 00:01:15.538
Negative 1/4.

00:01:15.538 --> 00:01:17.740
So this is negative 1/4.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.318
Two times negative 1/4,
is equal to negative 2/4,

00:01:23.318 --> 00:01:25.792
or negative 1/2.

00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:27.800
A sub four is two times a sub three.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.776
A sub three is negative 1/2.

00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:33.024
So this is going to be
two times negative 1/2,

00:01:33.024 --> 00:01:35.973
which is going to be
equal to negative one.

00:01:35.973 --> 00:01:37.807
So that's one way to solve it.

00:01:37.807 --> 00:01:39.409
Another way to think about it is,

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.797
look, we have our initial term.

00:01:42.797 --> 00:01:44.353
We also know our common ratio.

00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:46.211
We know each successive term

00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:48.904
is two times the term before it.

00:01:48.904 --> 00:01:51.551
So we could explicitly,

00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:54.964
this is a recursive definition
for our geometric series.

00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:57.797
We could explicitly write it as a sub i

00:01:57.797 --> 00:02:02.180
is going to be equal to our
initial term negative 1/8.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.827
Then we're going to multiply it by two.

00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:11.063
We're going to multiply it
by two, i minus one times.

00:02:11.937 --> 00:02:16.937
So we could say times two,
to the i minus oneth power.

00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:21.666
Let's make sure that makes sense.

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:24.850
A sub one, based on this formula,

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.311
a sub one would be negative 1/8,

00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:30.097
times two to the one minus one.

00:02:30.097 --> 00:02:31.839
Two to the zeroeth power.

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:32.814
So that makes sense.

00:02:32.814 --> 00:02:34.346
That would be negative 1/8.

00:02:34.346 --> 00:02:35.670
Based on this formula,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.362
a sub two would be negative 1/8,

00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:41.800
times two to the two minus one.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.239
So two to the first power.

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.725
We're going to take our initial term,

00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:46.815
and multiply it by two, once.

00:02:46.815 --> 00:02:47.976
Which is exactly right.

00:02:47.976 --> 00:02:50.860
A sub two is negative 1/4.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.014
So we want to find the
fourth term in the sequence,

00:02:53.014 --> 00:02:56.213
we could just say well,
using this explicit formula,

00:02:56.213 --> 00:03:01.006
we could say a sub four,
is equal to negative 1/8,

00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:04.979
times two to the four, minus one.

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.043
Two to the four, minus one power.

00:03:08.043 --> 00:03:10.574
So this is equal to negative 1/8,

00:03:10.574 --> 00:03:13.131
times two to the third power.

00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:16.694
This is negative 1/8 times eight.

00:03:16.694 --> 00:03:21.541
Negative 1/8 times eight,
which is equal to negative one.

00:03:22.382 --> 00:03:25.099
You might be a little bit,
a toss up on which method

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.280
you want to use, but for
sure this second method,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.811
right over here where we'd come
up with an explicit formula

00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:32.924
once we know the initial term,

00:03:32.924 --> 00:03:34.572
and we know the common ratio,

00:03:34.572 --> 00:03:37.080
this would be way easier, if
you were trying to find say,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.403
the 40th term.

00:03:38.403 --> 00:03:40.841
Because doing the 40th term
recurs to be like this,

00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:43.939
would take a lot of time,
and frankly, a lot of paper.
