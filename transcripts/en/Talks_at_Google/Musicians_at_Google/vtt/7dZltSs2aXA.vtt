00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.350
SPEAKER: I'm thrilled to
introduce JP Joffrey Hard Tango

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.180
Chamber Band, with a special
guest, Lara St. John,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.434
playing violin.

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:16.925
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.963
Please welcome
and here they are.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.580
JP JOFRE: Hello.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.730
Well, hello everyone.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.150
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.370
We're very excited to be
sharing some new music with you.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.010
We are very used to play
this music at night.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.040
So it's a little
bit hard for us.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.350
But we are glad that it
looks a little bit dark now.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.980
And, anyways, we're going
to start with a piece that

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.200
is called "After the
Curtains," written

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.200
for violin and bandoneon,
followed by "Universe."

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.346
So thank you so much.

00:00:56.346 --> 00:00:58.841
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.944 --> 00:01:02.694
[MUSIC - JP JOFRE HARD

00:01:02.694 --> 00:01:05.328
"AFTER THE CURTAINS"]

00:04:20.182 --> 00:04:23.176
[MUSIC - JP JOFRE HARD TANGO

00:06:59.162 --> 00:07:01.647
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.760
Well, thank you so much.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.650
The next piece we want to
play is called "Taranguino."

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.480
And it's a composition I wrote,
inspired by my grandfather, who

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.254
was an accordion player.

00:07:26.254 --> 00:07:28.670
And he always wanted to play
the bandoneon, the instrument

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.430
I'm holding right now.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.820
And it's a very
particular instrument

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.190
because every button plays
two notes, one note when

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.434
I open the bellows.

00:07:37.434 --> 00:07:39.600
And the same button, when
I close, change the pitch.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.340
And the interval is
always different.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.520
And in this hand, I
have the lower register.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.810
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:49.920
You have a C opening.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.120
And when I close,
it becomes an F.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.261
And the interval is
always different again.

00:07:57.261 --> 00:07:59.010
So we have to practice
four keyboards, two

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.801
keyboards opening and
two keywords closing.

00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:03.576
And so that's why my grandfather
choose the accordion.

00:08:03.576 --> 00:08:04.075
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:04.574 --> 00:08:06.380
And so I wrote
this piece for him.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.380
It's called "Taranguino."

00:08:15.798 --> 00:08:18.726
[MUSIC - JP JOFRE HARD TANGO

00:15:02.216 --> 00:15:05.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.630
Thank you.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:18.106
Thank you so much.

00:15:18.106 --> 00:15:19.480
The next piece we
want to perform

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.450
is called "After the Rain."

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.100
And I wrote this piece.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.620
And it's about my father.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.360
As you can tell,
I guess a little,

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.620
I get a lot of inspiration
from my family.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.580
And so this is the
piece that I do here,

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:40.219
which means "After the Rain."

00:15:40.219 --> 00:15:43.213
[MUSIC - JP JOFRE HARD TANGO
 CHAMBER BAND, "AFTER THE RAIN"]

00:21:48.481 --> 00:21:51.475

Chris Johnson on
the double bass.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:14.450
So the next piece want to play
is one of my first composition.

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.560
And it's a piece I
wrote in Argentina,

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.645
in a very particular time.

00:22:20.645 --> 00:22:26.410
It was 2001, '02, when we
had a huge economic crisis.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:30.970
I remember we had five
presidents in one week, really.

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:35.020
At that time I decided I
wanted to be a bandoneon

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.840
player and a composer.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.879
And I remember my
family was very upset.

00:22:41.879 --> 00:22:44.170
They tell me, why you're not
a lawyer, or an architect,

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.580
or something else?

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.510
But when I told my
mother, she told me

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:54.070
she was very happy because
I was doing what I loved.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.984
So I wrote this piece.

00:22:55.984 --> 00:22:58.150
And the first movement is
inspired about my country.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.100
The second movement is
inspired by my mother.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:06.699
And I always say-- well, my
mom, she lives in Argentina now.

00:23:06.699 --> 00:23:08.240
I say this because
every time we play

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.920
the piece, people come to me
and say, I'm sorry for your mom.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.580
And she lives in
San Juan, Argentina.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:16.540

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.474
Thank you.

00:23:18.474 --> 00:23:22.285
And this is "Tango Movement."

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.765
I'd like to introduce a
great pianist from Argentina,

00:37:24.765 --> 00:37:37.680
who also produced our last CD,
Pablo Cafici; from the cello,

So we're heading to the end now.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:10.120
We're going to play a
lullaby I wrote to my niece.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:14.830
It's called "Duces Suenos,"
which means Sweet Dreams.

we want to perform now.

want to thank you

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:56.070
all for coming this morning.

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:59.470
I'm used to saying tonight.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:03.220
And we're very, very
glad to be here.

This is a great, great
opportunity for us.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.720
We're going to say goodbye
with a piece I had the pleasure

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:15.030
to record with Paquito
D'Rivera a few years ago.

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:20.054
And now Lara is going to
play the clarinet part.

00:43:20.054 --> 00:43:22.120
This is "Primavera,"
which means Spring.

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.948

SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:48.430
Thank you so much for
what you did here.

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:52.180
We have two microphones
open for questions.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.810
We have a few minutes.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:56.430
Can I ask you a question?

00:47:56.430 --> 00:48:01.920
So as a composer
and a performer,

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:06.910
what is it like to perform
your own compositions?

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:14.540
JP JOFRE: Well, I always feel
like composing and performing

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:15.680
goes together.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:23.380
And I feel like if I'm just
playing someone else's music,

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:27.000
I feel like I'm a
little bit empty.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.350
And if my music is
performed by someone else,

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:31.470
I also feel a little bit empty.

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:33.800
So I feel like
composing and performing

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:39.065
is the right balance for me,
in my personal experience.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:46.500
Sometimes in the beginning,
when I first moved to New York,

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:51.910
it was a little bit
complicated to start

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:53.640
presenting my own music.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:57.882
I had to learn the traditional
repertoire for tango,

00:48:57.882 --> 00:49:00.300
for the music of Piazzolla.

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.680
Little by little, I
started playing my music.

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:07.500
And then people started to ask
me to play more of my music

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:08.470
at some point.

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:12.717
And some presenters asked me
to, no, just perform your music.

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.470
Now, today-- well, for
the past two years,

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:22.102
I've been mostly only
just playing my music.

00:49:22.102 --> 00:49:25.200
I'm very, very happy for that.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.398
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:49:26.398 --> 00:49:28.868
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:37.380
AUDIENCE: And tango is such a
big part of everybody's life

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.292
here.

00:49:38.292 --> 00:49:42.460
I just want to ask what is
tango for you, and for whoever

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.040
wants to answer the question?

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:48.510
JP JOFRE: Diego?

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:50.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:57.500
DIEGO BLANCO: Well, tango,
it took a lot of stages.

00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.680
I mean that's tango
for a long time.

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.230
And first, it was fun.

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:04.950
And then it became a passion.

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:10.624
Today, is more like a companion,
and a passion, and my future.

00:50:10.624 --> 00:50:11.615
So it depends.

00:50:11.615 --> 00:50:14.056
It really takes on many shapes.

00:50:14.056 --> 00:50:15.430
Tango is so practiced.

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:19.099
You learn a lot about
yourself through tango,

00:50:19.099 --> 00:50:19.890
through practicing.

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:21.500
I'm sure through
the music as well.

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.958
I haven't played
an instrument yet.

00:50:22.958 --> 00:50:24.140
So I don't know.

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:26.480
But through the
body, definitely it

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.860
teaches you a lot
about yourself.

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:30.545
So it's everything, I think.

00:50:33.443 --> 00:50:34.892
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:36.341 --> 00:50:37.307
CHRIS JOHNSON: OK.

00:50:37.307 --> 00:50:38.440
Hello?

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:38.940
Yeah.

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:41.280
I thought originally,
I guess as a child,

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.025
I thought tango is like a dance.

00:50:43.025 --> 00:50:44.900
I've seen couples with
a rose in their mouth.

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.490
And as I got older
and got a chance

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:51.330
to play some of the music, I
got to play a lot of Piazzola,

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:52.620
realize how great it was.

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:57.462
And then I ran into JP a couple
years ago, about 10 years-- not

00:50:57.462 --> 00:50:58.990
even 10 years, seven ago, maybe?

00:50:58.990 --> 00:50:59.280
JP JOFRE: Yeah.

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.840
CHRIS JOHNSON: And then we
started playing together.

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:03.048
And, like, it's been a great
ride so far and so good.

00:51:03.048 --> 00:51:06.580
So can't complain.

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:11.050
LARA ST. JOHN: I guess for
me, I did the 25th anniversary

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:14.010
of Astor Piazzolla's
Central Park concert

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:17.800
about five years ago in Central
Park, at the same bandshell,

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.920
and actually with the same
pianist, with Pablo Ziegler.

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:25.980
So that's kind of what started
me and my sort of tango stuff.

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:29.450
We've gone on the road quite
a bit doing that program

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:34.380
and other programs
with-- well, not with JP,

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:36.950
but another bando player.

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:41.440
But a lot of the
rhythms are the same

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:42.867
as what he puts into his music.

00:51:42.867 --> 00:51:45.200
And I mean, you must have
been really heavily influenced

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.334
by Piazzolla's stuff--

00:51:47.334 --> 00:51:48.196
JP JOFRE: Yeah.

00:51:48.196 --> 00:51:49.571
LARA ST. JOHN:
--in certain ways.

00:51:49.571 --> 00:51:51.362
JP JOFRE: I grew up
listening to Piazzolla.

00:51:51.362 --> 00:51:53.100
I grew up with my grandmother.

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:57.190
And she used to listen to
tango from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM

00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:58.640
every day.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.840
LARA ST. JOHN: You know,
funny enough, so did my dad.

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.870
Weird for a Canadian.

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:04.144
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.590
JP JOFRE: I have two now.

00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:11.562
AUDIENCE: So, well, thanks
for the performance.

00:52:11.562 --> 00:52:13.700
Loved you music.

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.370
Maybe there's a good
story here or not.

00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:18.460
But I was somewhat
excited, trying to find

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:22.530
where can I find a
bandoneon to buy?

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:26.642
And the music stores were all,
like, oh, no, no, you just

00:52:26.642 --> 00:52:27.142
find them.

00:52:27.142 --> 00:52:27.986
I don't know.

00:52:27.986 --> 00:52:29.280
It's kind of mysterious.

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:32.911
But where do you
find a bandoneon?

00:52:32.911 --> 00:52:34.843
JP JOFRE: That's a question.

00:52:34.843 --> 00:52:35.809
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:35.809 --> 00:52:39.870
That's a good question.

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:43.700
Before I play bandoneon,
I was a drummer.

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:47.700
And I remember, I was
walking the streets.

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:49.547
And I saw a bandoneon
in a music store.

00:52:49.547 --> 00:52:51.380
And it was the only
instrument in the store.

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.190
It was a very old bandoneon.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:56.030
So I exchanged the drum
set for the bandoneon.

00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:59.110
And I remember the store
guy, he was very happy

00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:01.747
because at the time nobody
wanted to buy a bandoneon.

00:53:01.747 --> 00:53:04.080
Now, it's very difficult to
find bandoneons in Argentina

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.650
because most of them,
they are taken to Japan.

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:09.310
In Japan, there are a
lot of bandoneon players.

00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:12.910
And in Europe, there are a lot
of bandoneon players as well.

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:16.800
So there was a time that it was
very cheap to buy in Argentina.

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:20.260
So most bandoneons were gone.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:23.390
But in those days, there
are many factories.

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:26.710
There is a factory in Germany.

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:29.810
The most famous one is
Double A, Alfred Arnold.

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:31.680
And this is actually
a bandoneon from them,

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:35.960
that they gave to
me as a sponsorship.

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.690
And in Argentina, there
is another, Lucia,

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:41.620
doing bandoneons now.

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:42.890
He's really good.

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:45.380
So in those days, if you
want to buy a bandoneon,

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:49.630
it's more easier than before,
than 10 years ago, for example.

00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:52.520
AUDIENCE: Isn't it true that,
like, the greatest bandoneons

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:55.330
were actually made in Germany?

00:53:55.330 --> 00:53:55.970
JP JOFRE: Yeah.

00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:59.970
The instrument was
invented in Germany.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:03.580
And it was invented to play
religious music at the church.

00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:08.880
And somehow, it ended up in
the cabarets in Argentina.

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:12.347
And it became the main
voice of tango music.

00:54:12.347 --> 00:54:13.180
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.090
And that's it.

00:54:18.841 --> 00:54:20.840
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.020
Where can we listen
to you in New York?

00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.454
Do you play live anywhere?

00:54:24.454 --> 00:54:25.620
Do you play at any milongas?

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:26.400
JP JOFRE: Yeah.

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:30.560
We actually have on Sunday,
we have in concert in Mezzrow.

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.570
Actually, Amy can say.

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.000
AMY KANG: Yeah.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.330
So we play different
places, like concert halls

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:39.497
and like jazz clubs.

00:54:39.497 --> 00:54:41.580
This Sunday we'll be playing
at a jazz club called

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:43.630
Mezzrow in the West Village.

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:44.780
It's on West 10th Street.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:46.590
It's like a little
basement space.

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:50.390
But it's beautiful,
intimate, and kind of

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:52.635
like the perfect
setting for this music.

00:54:52.635 --> 00:54:53.510
JP JOFRE: After that?

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:55.624
AMY KANG: Sunday
evening, 8:00 o'clock.

00:54:55.624 --> 00:54:56.290
JP JOFRE: Great.

00:54:56.290 --> 00:54:58.710
And after that,
we're going to Korea

00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:04.190
to perform in a new hall, Lotte
Hall in Seoul, and in Japan.

00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:06.030
Well, if you want
to know more dates,

00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:08.071
our website is jpjofre.com/hard
tangochamberband.

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:18.235
There you can find more
information about us.

00:55:18.235 --> 00:55:20.360
AUDIENCE: And what's your
synergy with the dancing?

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.443
You didn't mention you're
playing at any milongas.

00:55:22.443 --> 00:55:24.200
So that's why I asked that.

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.360
JP JOFRE: Well, when
I moved to New York,

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.960
I started working
a lot of milongas.

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:36.285
My dream was always to play a
concert, like a concert set up.

00:55:36.285 --> 00:55:40.076
And so that's kind of following
the Piazzolla tradition.

00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:48.610
So I'm not at the moment playing
in milongas or with that.

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:51.766
And this is special case
where Line Haddad and Diego

00:55:51.766 --> 00:55:52.890
Blanco are amazing dancers.

00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:55.225
And we're very happy to do it.

00:55:55.225 --> 00:56:00.580
But mostly, like they
say, 95% of the time,

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:04.734
we are doing like concerts
like the way we just did.

00:56:04.734 --> 00:56:06.180
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.580
JP JOFRE: You're welcome.

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:09.780
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:10.380
JP JOFRE: OK.

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:13.130
[APPLAUSE]
