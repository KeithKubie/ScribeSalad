00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.160
Use graphing to solve
the following problem.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.610
Abby and Ben did household
chores last weekend.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.690
Together they earned $50, and
Abby earned $10 more than Ben.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.480
How much did they each earn?

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.990
So let's define
some variables here.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.780
Let's let A equal
Abby's earnings.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.495
And let's let B
equal Ben's earnings.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.500
Then they tell us how
these earnings relate.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.080
They first tell us that
together they earned $50.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.460
So that statement can be
converted mathematically

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.890
into-- well,
together, that means

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.280
the sum of the two earnings.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.800
So A plus B needs
to be equal to $50.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.590
Abby's plus Ben's
earnings is $50.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.640
And then they tell us Abby
earned $10 more than Ben.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.460
So we could translate
that into Abby's earnings

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.290
is equal to Ben's
earnings plus 10.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.590
Abby earned $10 more than Ben.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.879
So we have a system
of two equations

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:16.170
and actually with two unknowns.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.354
And then they say, how
much did each earn?

00:01:20.354 --> 00:01:22.770
So to do that, and they want
us to solve this graphically.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.186
There's multiple
ways to solve it,

00:01:24.186 --> 00:01:25.950
but we'll do what
they ask us to do.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.690
Let me draw some axes over here.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.160
And I'll be in
the first quadrant

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.680
since we're dealing
with earnings,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.990
so neither of their
earnings can be negative.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.400
And let me just define
the vertical axis

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.980
as Abby's axis or the
Abby's earnings axis.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.610
And let me define
the horizontal axis

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.460
as Ben's axis or
Ben's earnings axis.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.420
And let me just graph
each of these equations.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.282
And to do that, I'm going
to take this first equation,

00:01:52.282 --> 00:01:53.990
and I'm going to put
it in the equivalent

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.322
of slope-intercept form.

00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:57.030
It might look a little
unfamiliar to you,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.020
but it really is
slope-intercept form.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.020
Let me rewrite it first.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.180
So we have A plus
B is equal to 50.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.300
We can subtract B
from both sides.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.740
So let's subtract
B from both sides.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:17.920
And then we get A is equal
to negative B plus 50.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.830
So if you think about it this
way, when B is equal to 0,

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.000
A is going to be 50.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.529
So we know our A intercept,
we could call it.

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:26.820
We normally would call that
a y-intercept, but now this

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.170
is the A axis.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.540
So this right here, let me call
this 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.630
So if Ben made $0,
then Abby would

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.800
have to make $50 based
on that first constraint.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.230
So we know that that's a point
on the line right over there.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.020
And we also know that
the slope is negative 1,

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.560
that B is the independent
variable, the way I've written

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.380
it over here, and this
coefficient is negative 1.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.540
Or another way to think
about it is if A is 0, then

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.830
B is going to be 50.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.060
If Abby made no money, then
Ben would have to make $50.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.470
And that falls purely out
of this equation right here.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.970
If Abby made nothing,
then Ben would

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.489
have to make $50, so
10, 20, 30, 40, 50.

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.530
So those are those two
situations and every point

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.640
in between will satisfy
this first constraint.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.440
So let me connect the dots.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.970
So it would look
something like that.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.190
That's due to this first
constraint, due to the fact

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.077
that together they earned $50.

00:03:29.077 --> 00:03:30.660
Now, let's think
about the second one.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.140
Abby earned $10 more than Ben.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.090
So that's this
equation right here.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.530
And it's really already in
our slope-intercept form.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.490
If Ben made $0, then
Abby would make $10.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.720
So that's our A intercept.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.390
So it's right over there.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.680
We could keep doing that.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.020
Our slope is going to be 1 here.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.700
If Ben makes $10, then
Abby's going to make $20.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.574
If Ben makes $20, Abby's
going to make $30.

00:03:56.574 --> 00:03:58.490
We could keep going, but
I think this gives us

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.406
the general direction.

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:02.360
It already hints at a
point of intersection.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.480
So just eyeballing it, so we've
graphed to the two constraints,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.090
together they earned $50.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.480
That's the magenta
constraint right over here.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.810
Abby earned $10 more than Ben.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.417
That's this green
constraint right over here.

00:04:14.417 --> 00:04:16.500
And it looks like we have
a point of intersection.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.300
And it looks like we have
a point of intersection

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.410
at Ben earning $20.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.540
Let me label this as
10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.460
So this is Ben earning
$20 and Abby earning--

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.870
this is 10, 20, and 30.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.190
And Abby earning $30.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.940
So just eyeballing it off of
this, it looks like A is 30

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.430
and B is 20.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.610
And let's go verify, make sure
that these levels of earnings

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.370
for Abby and Ben actually
satisfy both constraints.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.030
So the first constraint is that
Abby plus Ben have to make $50.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.600
Well, $30 plus $20 is $50.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.550
So it meets our
first constraint.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.910
The second constraint is that
Abby earned $10 more than Ben,

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.370
that Abby is equal
to Ben plus 10.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.810
Well, once again,
over here, Abby

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.720
is making $10 more than Ben.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.970
So it meets our
second constraint.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.669
And we only have two of them.

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:12.710
So it meets both of them.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.190
So that's our solution.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.740
Abby earned $30.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.833
Ben earned $20.
