00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.380
Evolution isn't stuck around gypsy moths,
microbes or birds -- HUMANS are evolving too,

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.530
right now...

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.610
Can you hear it?

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.220
Hello there evolved persons!

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.610
Trace here for DNews.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.020
We've studied evolution for a long time.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.960
We have heaps of evidence showing the path
evolution took from the dawn of man to the

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.960
present day.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.539
There are those who deny we've evolved at
all, and believe evolution is purely science

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.370
fiction, but though I really liked Nickelodeon's
Tomorrow People, X-Men and Heroes, REAL human

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.230
evolution DOES exist in recorded history.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.660
5,000 years ago, in the third millenium B.C.,
humans were in the Bronze Age -- Europeans

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.500
were learning to use metals, the Sumerians
were building Ziggurats, and the Egyptians

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.720
were figuring out Papyrus -- and since then,
we've gone through physiological changes.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.760
Humans aren't just smarter, though that's
part of it -- we've genetically mutated and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.760
adapted!

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.600
A study published in Nature in 2012 analyzed
the human genome and found we're now carrying

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.500
mutations that didn't exist 5,000 years ago!

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:13.150
The 6,500 DNA strands of European and African
Americans contained 1.15 MILLION single-nucleotide

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.980
variants -- that is to say, a single letter
of the ACGT structure of DNA was different

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.840
than other individuals.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.360
This shows we've evolved because evolution
is simply mutation over time, with some mutations

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.520
performing better than others.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.180
When a group of humans left the cradle of
life in Africa en route to Europe, they left

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.360
behind a broad DNA base, limiting themselves
to only their band of explorers.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.230
This means European Americans are carrying
around more of these single-variant mutations

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.720
because of that smaller initial gene pool.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.010
Human evolution continues the way it always
has, through DNA encoding errors causing adaptation...

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.880
whether this is positive or negative is where
natural selection plays a role.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.610
Geneticists from Africa and Europe analyzed
ANCIENT DNA to determine a baseline for our

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.560
evolutionary change, and found our skin, hair
and eye pigmentation has slowly adapted and

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.239
changed as we've spread.

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.930
Their research, published the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences used computer

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.569
simulations to compare that baseline to modern
Europeans to find out how certain genetic

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.730
mutations affected our bodies.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.940
According to their DNA comparisons, modern
Europeans were significantly darker skinned

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.290
5,000 years ago.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.520
But, as we pushed north, nature weeded out
darker skin because it's less efficient at

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.140
producing vitamin D in the lower-UV cloudier
latitudes -- as there was a lack of vitamin-D

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.450
from the sun, these people needed to get it
from their diet instead, which explains why

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.820
most of the planet have trouble digesting
lactose, except for those who have descendants

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.800
in the cloudy north of Europe.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.670
The evolution of hair and eye color is less
clear, there is some basic evidence that blue-eyed

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.430
people can see better in the dark -- This
is just my thought, but perhaps these cloudier

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.840
places influenced the lighter eye color as
well?

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.730
More study is needed, for sure.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.420
Unfortunately, because of the limited gene
pool not all the mutations are good; 14-percent

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.160
of them were potentially harmful, possibly
causing diseases.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.260
Oh mother Earth, thou art a heartless wench.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.599
Do you feel... evolved?

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.660
Click the like if you do, and the dislike
if you don't.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.410
Some days I do, when I've had the right mix
of sleep and diet...
