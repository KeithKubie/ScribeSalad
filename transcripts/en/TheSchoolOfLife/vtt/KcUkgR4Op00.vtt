00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.740
Rich people have a lot of power

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.160
One of the key questions of  modern economics and politics is therefore

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.000
What do the rich really want?

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.720
The standard of assumption is tended to be more money,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.420
but the reality is stranger and more hopeful.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.980
Ironically, the one thing that the rich general aren't much more motivated by

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.500
is money itself.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.720
They have far more than enough of that already, enough to keep 10 generations going.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.260
The rich are not therefore working to make more  money with an eye to spending it.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.900
They're making more money in order to keep scored.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.620
To put it as simplest, in order to be respected and liked.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.760
The rich are working for love, and for honor

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.540
They stay up late in the office out of vanity,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.880
because they want to be able to walk into rooms full of strangers,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.380
and be swiftly recognised by those that matter as miraculous and clever.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.760
Surveying the problem of capitalism, the standard response of the left

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.020
has been to suggest that one should simply tax the rich more.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.160
But this fails to grasp and therefore properly to exploit the real psychological motives of the rich.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.440
The rich only pursue money frantically to a great collective cost,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.760
because wealth appears to be the primary, most objective source of honor in the modern world.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.460
But if only we can fix how honor is obtained,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:26.060
we can be able to redirect their mania to more socially beneficial ends in ways the working sync with their deformed, ego-driven personalities

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.900
At present, a natural inclination is to force the rich to give up their wealth using the instrument of new taxes,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.900
but this strategy is doomed.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.900
The chances of people running away and taking their assets with them is too great.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.900
We need to go down a different route.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.900
The aim is to seduce the rich,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.500
to make them want to benefit their society in return for giving them what we know they deep down really want.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.500
but haven't until now, reliably been able to get,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.620
except through money, namely, honour!

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.880
we know well enough that societies can motivate people very powerfully through honour

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.380
soldiers will perform extraordinary feats in the battlefield

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.880
in return for the highest gratitude from their countries

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.880
they don't even asked to be paid very much!

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.920
scientists will labour in poverty for decades

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.200
in the hope of winning a nobel prize

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.060
yet as societies, we're only just beginning to explore what good can come out of vanity

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.060
in the realm of business.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.160
In the commercial world, there are at present, no systematic failsafe methods for gaining status

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.020
in return for doing what society desperately needs capitalists to do:

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.640
treat their workers well,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.020
and produce useful, environmentally-sound goods and services

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.580
in some countries, there may be the odd hope of a medal from the president or a royal,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.280
if one behaves well

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.240
but the chances of securing one are simply too remote and unpredictable

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.600
to motivate hard-headed capitalists in their actions from day to day

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.600
it remains far more rational to peg one's hopes for status on the verifiable criteria of money

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.220
rather than the vague chance of an invitation from the palace

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.220
this is precisely what needs to be changed

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.160
society should do a systematic deal with capitalists

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.780
it should give them the honour and love they so badly crave

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.740
in exchange for treating their workers as human beings;

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.240
not abusing customers, and properly looking after the planet

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.240
the prestige should be enormous!

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.960
A bit like winning the nobel prize, the victoria cross or the pulitzer prize

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.300
in other words, a fitting target for capitalists,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.480
the most ambitious and narcissistically craven and damaged people in any society

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.020
the founding figure of modern economics, Adam Smith,

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.240
cleverly recognized the two chief motivating factors in human life:

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.380
the love of money, and the love of glory

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.880
he argued that a wiser society must learn how to harness the love of glory at times, like now,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.320
when the public good come into conflict with the love of riches.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.960
We need the energy of entrepreneurs, we need their drive and determination

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.400
but if these business people continue to be motivated by unchecked profit alone

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.940
we will all go to ruin.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.100
to solve the problem, we don't have to wait until the rich miraculously grow magnanimous or kind,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.640
we should target the vanity of the rich, and encourage them to act well from their most powerful of desires:

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.640
the desire to be loved &lt;3

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.640
It will be a very small price to pay,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.880
in return for a more humane version of capitalism
