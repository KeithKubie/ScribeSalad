00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.760
Walt Disney Pictures was founded in 1923,
and for more than nine decades, they’ve

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.900
constantly delivered audiences top-notch entertainment
content.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.750
With all of the properties they own today,
the Mouse House is arguably more popular than

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.430
it’s ever been, enthralling moviegoers of
all ages with a variety of captivating stories

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.930
and memorable characters.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.110
Still, for all the great things Disney has
done, not everything they create is wholly

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.110
original.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.700
There are more than a few instances of one
Disney movie “borrowing” a concept from

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.590
another Disney flick, trying to put a new
spin on it so fans won’t notice.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.400
Here are 10 poplar movie ideas Disney stole
from Disney.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.340
Zootopia

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.990
Those who have seen the infamous “recycled
animation” clips online know that Disney

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.690
likes to use the same character models for
different productions in an effort to save

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.940
time, and it’s a practice that continued
well into the 21st century when computer animation

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.450
became the dominant form.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.630
Nick Wilde, one of the main characters in
the hit film Zootopia, bears a close resemblance

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.460
to someone from an old Disney film.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.329
His design follows the template of Robin Hood
from Disney’s 1973 take on the story.

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:17.950
Both characters are foxes, so it isn’t surprising
the directors looked to Robin Hood for inspiration.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.950
Frozen

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.520
Let It Go may have dominated the airwaves,
but it was hardly the only catchy musical

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.679
number from Frozen.

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.240
The lovable snowman Olaf had a tune of his
own called In Summer, where he sang about

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.509
how he wished he could enjoy warmer weather.

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.359
At one point in this sequence, Olaf does a
dance with some seagulls in yellow and red

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:35.359
hats.

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:39.340
It’s an obvious reference to Disney’s
own Mary Poppins, when Mary Poppins and Bert

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.990
dance with the penguins who are wearing similar
outfits.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.139
There’s no denying it’s a fun little moment,
so it’s easy to see why the studio would

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.929
want to use it again.

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.060
Moana

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.310
Upon its release, Moana earned rave reviews
from critics who praised it for eschewing

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.299
the traditional Disney princess formula.

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.520
Moana is a strong, independent woman who is
not dependent on a love interest to get by

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.530
in the story.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.810
As progressive as this is, no new ground was
really broken.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.209
That same character set-up was used for Merida
in Brave, albeit in ancient Scotland instead

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.580
of the Pacific Islands.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.640
Given that Brave was another box office hit
that won an Oscar, Disney figured it would

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.930
work well again.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.900
Another similarity is that Moana and Merida
are the only Disney “princesses” not based

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.650
on a fairy tale or legend.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.650
Aladdin

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.099
One of the more memorable elements in Pinocchio
is that fact that whenever the wooden puppet

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.390
tells a lie, his nose grows.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.030
But did you know that Pinocchio isn’t the
only Disney hero with an easy-to-spot tell

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.700
for when he’s being untruthful?

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.209
Many years later when making Aladdin, the
Mouse House incorporated this trope in a fun,

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.209
creative way.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.030
Whenever Aladdin lies, the plume on his hat
falls and covers his face.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.790
This may not have gone down in film history
the way Pinocchio’s nose did, but it’s

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.500
still a fun inclusion and something for fans
to keep an eye out for the next time they

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.599
watch the movie.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.620
Disney apparently wants to teach children
not to fib, which is an admirable goal.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.620
The Lion King

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.930
For an entire generation of moviegoers, the
death of Mufasa is one of the most traumatizing

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.010
film moments they’ve ever had to endure.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.210
Even after the scene was altered to be less
intense, it still served up one of Disney’s

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.489
strongest stomach punches.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.860
There’s only one thing that could possibly
rival it: the death of Bambi.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.190
The similarities between the two sequences
are no accident either.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.750
When writer Irene Mecchi joined the project,
she was told the pitch was “Bambi in Africa

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.700
meets Hamlet,” so Disney knew what they
were doing from the start.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.109
It’s hard to argue with the results, and
The Lion King is one of their most acclaimed

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.840
films.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.840
Wreck-it Ralph

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.970
Disney’s ode to video games broke tradition
for animated films by having the principal

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.560
actors record their voice over lines together.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.459
This allowed for better chemistry to develop
and allowed for improvisation.

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.310
It’s a cool idea, and it’s one Disney
had experience with years earlier in Monsters,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.310
Inc.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.340
For that Pixar production, John Goodman and
Billy Crystal spent time in the recording

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.690
booth together, as did Steve Buscemi and Frank
Oz.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.989
Monsters, Inc. was noteworthy for the comradery
between the characters, so this unorthodox

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.040
method clearly paid off in the end.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.049
You can expect things will be the same when
production on Wreck-it Ralph 2 gets underway.

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.049
Up

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.620
Disney films have featured a multitude of
villainous characters, but most of them seem

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.879
to meet their ultimate end in the same manner.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.130
It’s become a frequent occurrence for Mouse
House evildoers to fall to their deaths.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.959
A recent example of this was seen in Up, when
Charles Muntz took a tumble to his doom.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.470
He was the fifth Disney villain to die this
way, following the likes of the Wicked Queen,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.670
Gaston, Frollo, and others.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.070
Up was the first time a Pixar movie incorporated
this Disney trope, so it’ll be interesting

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.840
to see if this is a one-time thing or a sign
of what’s to come.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.840
Inside Out

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.640
Pixar loves to make references to their other
films, but they’re usually light-hearted

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.950
Easter eggs for those paying close attention.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.720
For Inside Out, they included a callback that
could be a bit more morbid.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.920
When Riley is having nightmares about her
new house in San Francisco, a deceased rat

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.260
pops up on the screen.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.970
Longtime Pixar fans may notice that this critter
looks eerily similar to Remy, the hero of

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:58.970
Ratatouille.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.071
Hopefully everyone’s favorite rat chef didn’t
meet his end since we last saw him and this

00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:06.820
is just another case of Disney reusing their
character models again.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.790
Remy was an inspiration to us all, so we don’t
want him to be nightmare fodder.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.790
WALL-E

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.090
Pixar’s 2008 smash hit takes place in a
future where humanity has abandoned Earth,

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.230
but the filmmakers looked to the past and
present for inspiration in the movie’s design.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.880
The People Mover transportation system is
a nod to the old Disneyland attraction WEDway

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.040
PeopleMover, which was in Tomorrowland for
30 years.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.700
Additionally, the spaceship AXIOM was partly
influenced by the Disney Cruise Line ships,

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.600
giving its inhabitants a luxurious environment
to call home.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.580
As the old saying goes, you write what you
know, and the creative team at Disney certainly

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.790
adhered to that.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.440
It grounded the futuristic bits of WALL-E
so the audience could really buy in.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.440
Zootopia

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.390
Life isn’t always easy for Judy Hopps.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.670
As the first bunny cop in Zootopia, she has
to overcome a lot of adversity on a daily

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.670
basis.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.920
In order to get by, she adapts the mantra
“Tomorrow is another day.”

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.110
Where did she get it from?

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.020
Judy is apparently a fan of old Disney flicks.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.980
The line can be seen as a reference to a song
from The Rescuers, which was also about a

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.750
group of unlikely animal heroes working together
to solve a crime while facing menacing predators

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.820
on their quest.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.440
That seems like a fairly big coincidence,
so it wouldn’t be shocking if Disney had

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.060
The Rescuers in mind when piecing together
the outline of the story.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.060
Conclusion

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.810
Those are our picks for times Disney stole
ideas from Disney.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.080
Which ones did we miss?
