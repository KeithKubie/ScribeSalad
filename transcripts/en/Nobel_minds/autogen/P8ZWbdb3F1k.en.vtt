he didn't understand because of the
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.520
he didn't understand because of the
techniques available at the time was how

this me how this these machines operate

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
this me how this these machines operate
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.649
this me how this these machines operate
and so when I started my career at

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659
and so when I started my career at
 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.160
and so when I started my career at
Berkeley I chose to study baker's yeast

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170

which is not a traditional system to

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400
which is not a traditional system to
 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.890
which is not a traditional system to
evaluate protein secretion but they

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900
evaluate protein secretion but they
 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.810
evaluate protein secretion but they
still that's how they grow and divide

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
still that's how they grow and divide
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.120
still that's how they grow and divide
they actually secrete and assemble their

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130
they actually secrete and assemble their
 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.700
they actually secrete and assemble their
membrane using this process of secretion

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
membrane using this process of secretion
 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.520

and so my first graduate student one of

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530
and so my first graduate student one of
 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.929
and so my first graduate student one of
my first students Peter Novick and I

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939
my first students Peter Novick and I
 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.660
my first students Peter Novick and I
just developed a genetic approach that

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670
just developed a genetic approach that
 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.330
just developed a genetic approach that
allowed us to isolate mutations that

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
allowed us to isolate mutations that
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.660
allowed us to isolate mutations that
cripple this process and when we did so

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670
cripple this process and when we did so
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.490
cripple this process and when we did so
we were able to see that yeast cells use

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
we were able to see that yeast cells use
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.649
we were able to see that yeast cells use
a process that's essentially the same as

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659
a process that's essentially the same as
 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.709
a process that's essentially the same as
human cells and as a result the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
human cells and as a result the
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.870
human cells and as a result the
biotechnology industry was able to use

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880
biotechnology industry was able to use
 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.389
biotechnology industry was able to use
yeast as a vehicle for the production of

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399
yeast as a vehicle for the production of
 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.969
yeast as a vehicle for the production of
useful human proteins in fact one third

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
useful human proteins in fact one third
 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.770
useful human proteins in fact one third
of the world supply of human insulin is

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
of the world supply of human insulin is
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.309
of the world supply of human insulin is
made by secretion and yeast and so what

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319
made by secretion and yeast and so what
 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.260
made by secretion and yeast and so what
we did which was just very basic turned

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
we did which was just very basic turned
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.670
we did which was just very basic turned
out

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680
out
 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.870
out
quite practical application
