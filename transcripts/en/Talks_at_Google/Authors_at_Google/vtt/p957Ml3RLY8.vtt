00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.290
WILLIAM SHUNN: Thank you.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.300
"The detective
unlocks my tiny room

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.580
and drags a plastic chair
in from the hallway.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.309
Mr. Shunn, she says, I'd like
to ask you some questions now

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.850
if you have a few minutes.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.260
I'm not going anywhere, I
say, narrowing my eyes--

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.120
my stinging eyes.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.240
There's no one but the detective
and me in this consultation

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.110
booth.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.480
No knob on the
inside of the door.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.980
The detective locks us in,
sits down crosses her legs,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.200
and smooths her
short, short skirt.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.060
I squirm in my chair.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.880
She's disconcertingly
blonde, mid 30s.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.050
I'm 19 years old, and
I haven't been alone

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.780
so close to a woman
in five months.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.490
With no table between us
our knees nearly touch.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.810
This is against mission rules
in so many ways I can't even

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.400
count.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.550
She arranges a Steno
pad atop her bare thigh,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.540
pencil sharpened and poised.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.680
Should I call you-- what
is it, elder, instead?

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.040
I try to breathe easy and
keep my eyes above her neck.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.860
Either way.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.060
Your name please, elder.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.570
I'm confused.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.660
You used it a minute ago.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.410
For the record, her
green eyes don't blink.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.040
Full name.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.290
I touch the spot on my
sweater where the black name

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.900
tag should have been.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.270
Donald William Shunn the second.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.490
Age?

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.140
19.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.230
Are you a Canadian citizen?

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.380
No, I'm American.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.320
And you've been in
Canada for how long?

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.370
Uh, five months about.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.120
Any previous criminal record?

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.780
No.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.370
She takes sharp efficient
notes in shorthand,

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.830
a skill I didn't
know still existed.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.060
OK, elder, she says, crossing
her legs the other way.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.890
Let's talk about your
activities today.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.010
I keep my eyes up, up.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.440
I've been through this
already with the constable

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.830
at the airport.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.470
She shrugs.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.045
Now you're going
through it with me,

00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:14.420
and you'll probably
go through it

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.380
with someone else after that.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.540
That's how these things go.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.420
I'd like to talk to
my mission president.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.990
So would we, elder.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.490
We take terrorism
very seriously.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.370
The word knocks
the wind out of me.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.820
What?

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.910
Terrorism.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.840
Conspiracy.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.890
Conspiracy?

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.400
There's no conspiracy.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.920
She taps her pencil
against the pad.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.120
Imagine what it
looks like from here.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.030
I'm going to prison.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.270
I'm going to prison, and
I'm going to die there.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.220
I'm not a terrorist.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.370
The words grate in my throat.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.280
I already explained
what happened.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.770
Explain it to me.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.840
Help me out here.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.370
We can't get any of your
people on the phone.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.020
All we have is you.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.940
All you have is you.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.500
I close my eyes, trying
to work my frozen lungs.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.390
How many times was Joseph
Smith in scrapes like this?

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.670
Plenty, and he got through it.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.990
Well, no, actually they
shot him in the end,

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.940
but I try not to
think about that.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.040
I can get through this.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.170
Elder Shunn, tell me,
says the detective.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.520
Tell me how you ended up here.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.730
My impulse is to
blurt out everything.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.740
I take a deep breath.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.999
I choose my details with care."

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:39.540
That was the prologue
from my memoir,

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.990
"The Accidental
Terrorist-- Confessions

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.330
of a Reluctant Missionary."

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.080
The book tells a story of
how as a 19 year old Mormon

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.700
missionary in Canada I came
to be arrested and convicted

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.217
for felony mischief.

00:03:53.217 --> 00:03:55.300
Before I talk a little bit
about how the book came

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.620
to be written and
published and read a couple

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.660
more short excerpts, though, I
want to offer two disclaimers.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.720
First, though I'm no
longer a practicing Mormon

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.890
and have not been for
more than 20 years,

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.760
and though the book does delve
into some controversial aspects

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.750
of Mormon history, I'm not here
either to critique or defend

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.290
the faith, only to
offer a small glimpse

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.839
into the lives of its
mysterious, cleancut, wide eyed

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.110
young missionaries.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.630
Second, though you'll
hear depictions today

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.150
of certain criminal
activities, I'm

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.480
not here to glamorize,
condone, or defend them.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.200
In other words, kids,
don't try this stuff

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.620
at home or at the airport.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.850
Now, why did I write "The
Accidental Terrorist?"

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.740
Well, fame and
fortune obviously.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.880
I mean, why else
would anyone undertake

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.190
the spectacularly
self-destructive task

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.390
of writing a book,
especially one

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.890
that ended up taking 17
years start to finish.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.040
Honestly I started
wanting to write

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.840
about being a missionary
almost as soon

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.360
as I became a missionary.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.470
We probably all picture
Mormon missionaries

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.230
as an army of interchangeable
young men in white shirts

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.730
and ties trudging endlessly
from one porch to the next

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.280
with a holy book and an
urgent message from God.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.400
Even growing up Mormon
this was pretty much how

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.840
I always envisioned mission
life would be-- holy young men

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.370
walking with the Holy
Spirit, testifying boldly,

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.670
and saving souls.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.730
It wasn't until I turned 19 and
was pressed into service myself

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.000
that I discovered a
more colorful reality.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.730
The missionaries I
met were anything

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.650
but homogeneous and
frequently anything but holy.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.520
Some were diligent,
and some were slackers.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.030
Some were pious, sure,
but more were profane.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.820
There was gossip, and brown
nosing, and backstabbing.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.280
A few of my colleagues
seemed to be

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.890
set on breaking every rule in
our little white handbook, not

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.660
to mention a commandment or two.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.420
I mean, they were despite
the black name tags

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.560
really just a bunch of teenage
boys with all that implies.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.650
Myself-- I was something of a
sheltered kid up to that point

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.080
having grown up in Utah
in a large Mormon family,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.050
but I was also a budding
science fiction writer.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.900
I'd attended the
Clarion Workshop

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.580
in science fiction writing
at Michigan State University

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.180
the previous summer,
so I was already

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.160
planning on a writing
career, and my reaction

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.100
to the absurd reality
of mission life

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.550
was inevitably a powerful
desire to write about it.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.970
This desire only intensified
after the incident

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.660
that got me arrested and
expelled from Canada.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.700
Yes, that's my actual
conviction record right there.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.840
I was only 19, but I now
had two bizarre experiences

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.650
under my belt that few
people in the world

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.260
could claim-- Mormon mission
service abroad and a hijacking

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.770
trial.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.770
Either one would be
interesting alone,

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.260
but together it seemed
like gold to me.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.080
The potency of the combo came
into sharper focus for me

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.330
after I returned home
from missionary service.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.560
My arrest had made the news not
just in Canada, but in Utah,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.010
too.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.570
Telling the story of
how it had all gone down

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.980
became my party trick.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.110
In any gathering,
inevitably someone

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.430
would tell someone else that I
was the terrorist missionary,

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.930
or someone would find out
that I was no longer allowed

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.120
into Canada, and people
would crowd around,

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.250
and I'd have to tell
the story again.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.360
I got pretty good at it and
at stretching or condensing

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.040
the narrative to fit the
attention span of the audience.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.560
I could do it in 5 or 10
minutes, or as happened two

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.970
or three times, I could go
on for two hours or more

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.750
and not lose anyone.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.490
I won't do that today.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.030
Now, my primary objective
in the storytelling

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.340
was simply to
explain myself, which

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.512
I think is something
we all feel,

00:07:54.512 --> 00:07:55.970
and which is why
this world of ours

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.870
is so filled with
books and blogs.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.630
For me, probably as a
result of my upbringing

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.830
there is little worse
than being misunderstood,

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.460
so when someone would say to
me, you made a bomb threat?

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.160
God, how stupid could you be?

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.430
I felt compelled to
respond, yes, it was stupid,

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.010
and I wouldn't do
it again, but you

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.060
have to understand
the series of events

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.600
that made it seem
like a good choice

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.880
at the time-- the
only possible choice.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.940
I did eventually
start writing it

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.750
all down-- first as a
series of posts on GEnie

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.190
in the early 90s.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.980
You remember GEnie?

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.500
Then as something of a
serialized proto blog

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:42.429
on my website in 1995, where you
can still find that version--

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:46.140
and finally in 1999,
as a serious attempt

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.370
to write the definitive,
compassionate,

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.240
and massive chronicle of the
lives and culture of Mormon

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.610
missionaries--
basically the book

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.340
I wish had existed
for me to read when

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.420
I was a teenager before I
went and became a missionary

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.510
in the first place.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.720
I won't bore you with an
account of the many drafts

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.090
this book went through over the
years, or the many near misses

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.617
when one of my many
literary agents

00:09:08.617 --> 00:09:10.200
was convinced we
were close to getting

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.310
an offer on the manuscript,
or the screenplay version

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.080
and the time it was
optioned for one day,

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.570
or the podcast that came
out of it all in 2006,

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:23.080
and which is also still
available on my website.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.160
I'll just tell you
about the day in 2014

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.290
after having waited
seven months to receive

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.810
one final heartbreaking
rejection on the manuscript

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:35.620
when my agent Barry Goldblatt
sat me down and said,

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.250
look, this is not advice I
would normally give a client,

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.080
but this is a good
book, and we both

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.690
know there's an
audience for it even

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.580
if no one else can see that.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.920
It's time for you to get this
out there and then move on.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.430
It's time for you to
self-publish this book.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:55.010
My wife and I-- my very
patient and supportive wife,

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.430
I might add-- had already
discussed that very strategy,

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.240
so I was ready, or so I thought.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.220
If only I'd known what that
would mean for the next 18

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.160
months of my life.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.190
Let me read you another
short excerpt now-- one

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.790
of those behind the scenes
glimpses of missionary life

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.480
I've been talking about.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.466
This takes place in
December in 1986.

00:10:21.466 --> 00:10:23.340
"I'd been a missionary
for about three months

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.740
in the small prairie
city of Brooks, Alberta,

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.510
and though I don't
realize it, I'm

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.280
suffering from deep depression.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.890
Our job as missionaries is
to proselytize for 70 hours

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:40.030
a week, but my more experienced
partner, Elder Dedman-- all us

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.370
kids were given the title elder,
which is a story in itself--

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.140
has no interest in that.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.540
Instead of knocking
on doors, we've

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.590
been hiking, bowling, shooting
pool, watching television,

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.240
reading books-- in
short, just about

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.910
everything the missionary
handbook forbids us from doing

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.690
short of going out on dates.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.110
I'm no fan of
proselytizing myself,

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.870
but on top of my
homesickness and resentment,

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.080
this blatant rule breaking
has made me feel frustrated,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.570
sinful, isolated, and paranoid.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.780
Relations between me and
the domineering Elder Dedman

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.030
are tense in the extreme.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.930
Brother Alvarez, an assistant
to the local Mormon bishop

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.040
has noticed this and
asked Elder Dedman and me

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.430
to participate in the Christmas
program at church on Sunday--

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.260
him by giving a talk,
me by performing

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.480
a special musical number.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.820
Sunday morning Dedman and I
arrived at church 40 minutes

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.530
before sacrament meeting.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.740
It was the earliest we'd
been up in two weeks,

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.590
and we were two big
bundles of nerves.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.560
We both went
straight to the dais.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.080
Dedman flung himself down
in one of the choir seats

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.160
and buried himself in his notes.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.050
I propped up the piano's
lid, opened the file board,

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.290
and arranged my sheet music.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.160
There were seven or eight people
in the chapel already-- brother

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.700
Alvarez reviewing his own notes
in a seat behind the podium.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.220
The ward clerk arranging
his roll books.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.810
A couple of younger
teenage priesthood

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.740
holders preparing the
sacrament, and a scattering

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.060
of early arrivals--
but I figured

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.520
I could get two run throughs
in while the place was still

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.480
relatively empty.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.790
I sat, lifted my hands, and
began the first arabesque.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.520
The music felt right
right from the start.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.670
Despite the
complicated arpeggios,

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.310
each finger knew
exactly where to be

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.750
at what time without
my having to think,

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.460
letting my hands roll up and
down the keys as smoothly as

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.570
if they were on wheels,
and my heart rolled right

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.780
along with them, buoyed by
the river of notes, as light

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.620
as it had been in weeks.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.410
So consumed was I
by the music that I

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.310
didn't notice Bishop
[? Neuwirth ?] standing

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.940
at my shoulder until he spoke.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.930
Is this what you're planning
to play for us today, elder?

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.545
He startled me so badly that
I laid down a line of clams.

00:13:02.545 --> 00:13:03.920
I didn't turn to
look at him as I

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.410
tried to recover-- an effort
that took all my concentration.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:13.297
When I was back on track, I
forced out a gruff affirmative.

00:13:13.297 --> 00:13:14.880
The bishop leaned
in over my shoulder,

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.430
peering at the sheet music,
and crowding my right arm.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:22.250
When exactly was
this piece written?

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.250
I huffed and stopped playing.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.070
1888, I said, frostily.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.650
The date was printed clearly
beneath the title on the sheet

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.130
music.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:35.590
1888, Bishop [? Neuwirth ?]
repeated, shaking his head.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.510
No, I'm afraid that's
not going to work.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.610
Stunned, I turned my head.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.050
Excuse me?

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:46.360
The bishop rocked back hands
clasped behind his back.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.720
The church general
handbook is very specific,

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.180
he said, casually.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.354
Except for certain
church approved pieces,

00:13:52.354 --> 00:13:54.270
musical numbers performed
in sacrament meeting

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.580
must be at least 100 years old.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.160
You'll have to play
something else.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.692
I don't have anything else.

00:14:01.692 --> 00:14:05.230
A disconnected panic made
my hands and my face tingle.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.820
This is what I've
been practicing.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.620
Then play something
from the hymn book,

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.820
he suggested in a helpful tone.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.170
You can play hymns, right?

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.420
I groped for words.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.800
I can accompany anything
in the hymn book,

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.090
but they're not good
piano pieces on their own.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.610
Well then, I don't know
what we're going to do.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.720
He sounded maddeningly
reasonable.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.830
I've played this
100 times in church.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.820
No one has had a
problem with it before.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.430
He folded his arms.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.870
If other bishops don't want
to enforce the guidelines,

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.860
that's their choice,
but that's not the way

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.870
we do things in this ward.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.790
I hated his fussy little
moustache and his stupid tweed

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.230
jacket.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.240
This piece of music
is 98 years old.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.280
I could hear my
voice growing shrill.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.490
I saw Brother Alvarez heading
our way, and Elder Dedman too.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:55.040
What?

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.100
In two more years, it magically
stops being inappropriate?

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.100
Bishop [? Neuwirth ?]
squinted at me in a manner

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.130
entirely unlike Clint Eastwood.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.470
Elder, he said
even more quietly,

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.250
I won't allow my daughter
to go on a date even one day

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.120
before she turns 16.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.120
Why?

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.200
Because that's the guideline
the brethren have given us.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.320
Excuse me, gentleman,
said Alvarez,

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.580
laying a hand on the
bishop's shoulder.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.870
What seems to be the problem?

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.100
Bishop [? Neuwirth ?]
cleared his throat.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.340
If Alvarez wore his Mormonism
like an elegant suit,

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.880
then the bishop wore his like
an accountant's green eyeshade

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.570
and sleeve garters.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.070
I was just pointing
out to the elder

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.800
here that he can't play
music under 100 years old.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.090
Alvarez raised an eyebrow.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:43.030
Unless the bishop
gives his approval.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.670
Bishop [? Neuwirth ?]
coughed a little.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:48.030
Well-- well, yes, but I'm
not familiar with this--

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.590
he leaned over me and peered
again at the sheet music--

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:55.284
'da-bus-sy.' Debussy,
Alvarez said gently,

00:15:55.284 --> 00:15:56.700
and to be honest
with you, bishop,

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.290
I was quite looking forward
to hearing this number

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.570
in sacrament meeting.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:01.880
I find it entirely
peaceful and reverent.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.890
Don't you agree?

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:07.410
The bishop nodded
slowly, eyes narrowed.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:12.390
So there won't be a problem if
Elder Shunn plays this number?

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:15.840
All right, yes, I suppose
that will be fine.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.850
Elder Dedman on the other
side of me touched my elbow.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.770
Smoke break, he whispered?

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.260
Fighting back tears, I nodded
gratefully and stood up,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.610
shoving my hands
into my pockets.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.830
We'll be back in a few
minutes, Dedman said,

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.036
and I trailed him down
the steps from the dais.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.650
When I looked back
through a watery veil

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.250
before exiting the
chapel, Brother Alvarez

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.940
was explaining
something to the bishop

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.290
quietly and furiously
very close to his ear.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.790
In the men's room,
I wiped my eyes

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.770
and tried to still the
anger quivering in my hands.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:51.740
Elder Dedman watched me in
the mirror with concern,

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.260
an emotion I hadn't imagined
was part of his repertoire.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.540
He handed me another
dampened paper towel.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.800
Are you going to be OK?

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.480
Yeah, I think so.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.460
I plastered the cool
towel to my forehead

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.140
and squinted at myself.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.720
Thanks.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.990
Dedman leaned back against one
of the sinks, shaking his head.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:11.169
Man, that guy's a jerk.

00:17:11.169 --> 00:17:12.460
I don't care if he is a bishop.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.599
He ought to get
punched in the nose.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.220
Someone at least ought
to give him a swirly.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.460
If he walked in here
right now, I'd do it, too.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.859
Picturing Dedman forcing the
bishop's head down a toilet,

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:24.655
I couldn't help
but snort a little.

00:17:24.655 --> 00:17:27.540
I don't-- I don't think
he has enough hair.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.050
It'd work.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.110
He combs it over.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.960
He'd end up with
this one long twist

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.210
sticking up from over his ear.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.870
I laughed.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.620
Can I be the one to flush?

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.624
Be my guest.

00:17:38.624 --> 00:17:40.040
After another
couple of minutes, I

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.080
felt composed enough to
return to the chapel.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.080
Leaving it, I'd only
had a companion.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.080
Now, going back with
Dedman's hand on my shoulder,

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:58.410
I felt like I had an ally."

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.300
And now we've reached
the polemical portion

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.330
of today's presentation.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.996
Don't worry, it
probably won't hurt.

00:18:04.996 --> 00:18:07.370
Despite the fact that I've
had more than 30 short stories

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:11.042
published-- note I said
published, not self-published--

00:18:11.042 --> 00:18:13.000
and despite the fact that
I've been shortlisted

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.850
for the highest awards
in science fiction,

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.300
my most widely read work
by far is undoubtedly

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.040
my short essay on
proper manuscript

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.720
format for fiction writers.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.540
So many publications
link to this page

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.970
from their submission
guidelines,

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.610
in fact, that it has appeared
at or near the top of searches

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.860
for manuscript format and
short story format for as

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.050
long as Google has existed.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.600
By this, you might
correctly divine

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.750
that I am something of a
stickler for doing things

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:45.230
the right way, and
that in turn is

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.180
why I am so often tempted
to put an asterisk

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.500
next to the
self-published when I talk

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.080
about the genesis of my book.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.700
It's true that self-publishing
doesn't carry quite the stigma

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.040
that it once did.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.930
After the success of books
like "The Celestine Prophecy,"

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.950
"Wool," "Fifty Shades of
Grey," and many others.

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.840
In fact, this stigma
itself is probably

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.140
a fairly recent phenomenon since
authors from Laurence Sterne,

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.710
and Jane Austin, to Marcel
Proust, and Virginia Woolf all

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.020
self-published at
one time or another,

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:20.150
but it's also true that part of
the rap on self-published books

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.720
has to do with their
perceived quality.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.550
And in many cases that
quality is not good,

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.230
and I'm not talking about
the words themselves here.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.700
I'm talking about the book
as a physical or possibly

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.260
even an electronic object.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.040
By way of analogy, I could make
a perfectly functional chair

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.810
by tipping an orange
crate on its end

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:44.100
and nailing on a couple of
two by fours for a back.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.120
You could sit on it
certainly, but it probably

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.790
wouldn't be very comfortable,
and you definitely

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.000
wouldn't want to sink
into it and stay there

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.410
for several hours.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.730
Now, not to sound
like Nick Offerman,

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.070
but with some basic
study and practice you

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.880
can probably make a pretty
decent and reasonably

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.840
comfortable chair
in your wood shop.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.100
It may not be a Chippendale
chair or an Eames chair,

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.600
but at least you
can build something

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.010
that does its job
without calling

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.315
much attention to itself
or causing any discomfort.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.670
It's the same thing with books.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.890
Yes, with all the print
on demand services

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:24.260
available today it's easy to
rip the final white hot page

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.170
of your manuscript from the
typewriter-- metaphorically

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.830
speaking, of course-- and send
it straight to the printer,

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.442
but how disappointing
as a reader

00:20:32.442 --> 00:20:34.400
to receive a book you've
been waiting excitedly

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.490
for only to discover that the
lines are spaced too closely

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.160
together to be read
comfortably, that the font is

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.710
a harsh sans serif,
the paragraphs

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.376
are printed in
unindented blocks,

00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:45.750
or the margins
aren't wide enough

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.930
to give the eye any relief.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:52.620
That's not a book you want to
fall into and spend hours with.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.860
Now, I probably don't have
to sell this crowd on best

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.680
practices, but I
believe if you're

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.240
going to go to the trouble
to write and self-publish

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.820
a book you owe it to
yourself and to your audience

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.090
to educate yourself
in the standards

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.210
and tools of your trade.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:11.780
In my case, this meant learning
that the golden ratio makes

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.030
for the most pleasing
dimensions of text on a page,

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.590
learning what makes for
comfortable line spacing,

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.390
learning what fonts
are considered best

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.340
for extended reading, learning
about kerning and optical

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.280
margins, learning the
meaning of verso and recto,

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.522
learning where and
when to use small caps,

00:21:28.522 --> 00:21:30.480
learning, in fact, that
small caps are not just

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.220
regular caps in a
smaller font size,

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.577
but are, in fact,
proportioned differently.

00:21:34.577 --> 00:21:36.660
Are you beginning to see
why this project consumed

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.890
18 months of my life?

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.110
Basically, my goal
was to produce a book

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.700
that most readers could pick up
and examine without realizing

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.210
it was self-published.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:49.440
To do this I had to understand
that modern technology,

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.540
while it could enable
me to accomplish this,

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.620
could not accomplish
it in and of itself.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.800
I needed to educate myself
in the craft of book design

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.850
and typesetting if
I was going to be

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.917
able to make that technology
do what I needed it to do,

00:22:04.917 --> 00:22:06.750
and here I should admit
that Google probably

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.690
deserved a mention in my
book's acknowledgements

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.270
because who else
was going to show me

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:13.770
where to learn all this stuff?

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:17.170
But the physical object was
only part of the equation.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.397
The ebook editions
needed to look good, too,

00:22:19.397 --> 00:22:21.230
but it didn't take long
for me to figure out

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.610
that good looking output
was not a priority for any

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:26.040
of the conversion services
that take your Word document

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.100
and spit you back an ebook file.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.640
I needed more control of
the process than that.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.780
Now here I'm really going
to grab for my geek cred.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.240
I read through the specs
for EPUB and MOBI files.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.810
I wrote myself a
Perl script that

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:43.590
would parse the HTML file
exported by WordPerfect.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:47.160
Yes, I still use
WordPerfect-- and I have since

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.870
even before I was a developer
there in the early '90s--

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.324
to generate the five different
flavors of ebook files

00:22:53.324 --> 00:22:54.740
that I needed for
each of the five

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.190
major vendors through which
I planned to sell the book.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.590
OK, that might have been
a little over the top

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:04.190
even for me, but it was fun.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.112
These are just the
production issues, though.

00:23:06.112 --> 00:23:08.320
None of this would have
mattered without a manuscript

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.410
that I was proud of and
eager for people to read,

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:14.480
but I didn't have
that-- not at first.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.370
I knew my book was long,
ragged, and a little unfocused.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.610
That was fine in a
serialized podcast

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.070
where people hear
a chapter a week

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:26.080
over a long period of time,
but that was not fine, not

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.340
acceptable in a book
someone would sit down

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.140
to read in a matter of days.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.890
Most problems
related to this book

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:35.280
I was able to solve for myself.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.580
Not this one.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.080
I'd been trying unsuccessfully
to solve it for a decade

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.460
and a half, and
somehow I couldn't.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.250
So I did the only
thing that made sense.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.430
I hired a professional
editor, someone

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.387
I trusted implicitly to give my
manuscript the same treatment

00:23:49.387 --> 00:23:51.720
it would have received at any
big traditional publishing

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.750
house-- or rather, probably
better treatment-- and that

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.450
made all the difference.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.660
Part of managing a
successful project

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.741
is knowing what
you can do yourself

00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:04.032
and what you need to outsource.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:09.770
OK, this next excerpt
picks up later

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.670
the same day of the piano
debacle home at our apartment

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:14.235
after dark.

00:24:18.108 --> 00:24:22.880
"Elder Dedman jumped up from the
armchair suddenly all energy.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.150
Flip, Shunn, why are we
sitting here talking.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:26.410
It's been a rotten day.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.240
This place is
claustrophobic, and you

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.416
could use some cheering up.

00:24:30.416 --> 00:24:33.250
I wasn't sure I wanted
to be cheered up.

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.150
What do you have in mind?

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.510
He looked around
the tiny apartment.

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.190
Well, here it is
almost Christmas,

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.210
and we're hardly in
the spirit at all.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:42.380
Get your snow gear on.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.395
I think we need a tree.

00:24:45.395 --> 00:24:46.770
When we got in
the car, I thought

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:50.510
we might be heading to a
tree farm or Canadian Tire,

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.130
but Dedman drove us only five
or six blocks before parking

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.320
near the mouth of an alley.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.760
Where are we going?

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.260
Shh.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.720
Follow me.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.540
He turned off the
overhead light,

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.930
exited, and closed
his door gently.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:05.180
I did the same.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.380
When he duck walked down the
alley like a suburban commando,

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.650
I mimicked him as best I could.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.310
We kept to the muddy ruts
torn in the blanket of snow

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.900
by knobby winter tires.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.130
To our right behind
wooden fences

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.830
lay the backs of
slumbering houses.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.900
To our left was a chain
link fence, and behind that

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.460
a line of tall shaggy
spruces that bounded

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.630
the grounds of a grade school.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:32.750
A bright gibbous
moon had just risen.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.430
Dedman stopped
far down the alley

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.752
in a zone of relative darkness
away from any street lights.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.510
Crouching in the weeds and
dirty snow beside the chain link

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:47.660
fence, he whispered, hold
it so it doesn't rattle.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.170
Hold-- hold what?

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:53.080
In answer, he stood,
latched on to the fence,

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.080
and swarmed up it.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.870
The sound was like a million
sleigh bells jingling.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.160
I quickly hooked my gloved
fingers through the fence

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.550
and strained to hold it taut.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.390
I expected lights to
flick on any moment

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:06.460
in the houses
behind us, shotguns

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:10.490
pumped and ready for a
Santa Claus invasion.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.670
The fence was at
least eight feet tall.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.850
Dedman dropped lightly
down the far side,

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.410
landing in the pristine
margin of snow between it

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:19.940
and the closely spaced spruces.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.270
He motioned me up.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.360
Your turn.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.240
I seized the fence
with both hands

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.360
as high up as they could reach.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.130
My boots were too big to
get a toehold in the links,

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.460
but after half a minute
of huffing and puffing

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.430
and several queasy seconds
of instability at the top,

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:37.130
I made it over.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.740
I stood stock still as the
rattling of the fence faded

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.190
out, conscious of
the clear night,

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.880
the bright moonlight,
and my own visibility.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:50.210
I turned toward my companion,
but he had vanished.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:53.070
I pushed my way between
the two nearest trees,

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.460
their lowest boughs overlapped,
clutching at my legs.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.960
The scent of broken pine
needles stung my nose.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.230
Elder Dedman, I
hissed, as I emerged

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:05.380
into the broad
ghostly school yard.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.740
A hand touched my shoulder.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.390
Boo!

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:12.420
I yelped as Dedman materialized
from the shadows beside me.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.170
He shushed me with a
delighted grin on his face.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:16.420
Keep it down, Shunn.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.370
You'll get us busted.

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:19.890
Then don't do that.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.560
What are we doing here anyway?

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.060
Dedman pointed at
the spruce that

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.220
had concealed him which
had to be 12 feet tall.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.250
Getting a tree.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:32.670
Oh, right, because
that'll fit in our pit.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.940
He drew his hunting knife and
raised it in front of my face.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.300
It gleamed in the
moonlight, a wicked thing

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.560
with toothy serrations on the
spine of its six inch blade

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.970
and a hilt wrapped in raw hide.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:46.440
Dedman, who always
carried it when we hiked,

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.240
called it his coyote sticker.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.510
You just stand
guard, he ordered.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:56.580
With that he sheathed the knife
and clambered into the tree.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.520
It was the Platonic ideal
of a Christmas tree.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.200
Its bushy boughs tapered
in a perfect cone

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.880
from the ground all
the way to its apex.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.370
Had you draped it in tinsel
and capped it with an angel,

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:10.220
there would have been
no grander tree in town.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.830
Dedman wriggled in
toward the trunk

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:14.160
and picked his
way up from there.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.260
About three feet from
the top, his head

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.600
popped suddenly into view.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.130
That's where he started sawing
at the trunk with the knife's

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:23.080
separated spine.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.470
The loud rasp seemed
to carry for miles.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.560
The teeth weren't
made for cutting wood,

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.170
and the job took forever.

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:33.660
At one point, I spotted a
distant police car prowling

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.430
past the front of the school.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.670
Cops, I squealed, throwing
myself flat in the snow

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:42.520
and cursing the reflective
strips on the back of my parka.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:47.140
The car never slowed, and
Dedman resumed his work.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.260
After 10 minutes or so, I
heard a resoundingly crack

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.910
as Dedman snapped the trunk.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.500
I was so fixed on watching for
trouble the tree top nearly hit

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.840
me as it shooshed to the ground.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.310
It sounded like wind
in a wheat field.

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:06.370
Hoisting three feet of heavy,
prickly fir over the fence

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:09.250
was no simple feat,
but we managed it.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.640
As we hustled down the
alley with our prize slung

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.410
between us, I glanced back at
the ugly gap in the tree line.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:18.888
It looked to me like we'd
knocked someone's tooth out.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.840
As far as I know, by the way,
unless the police in Brooks,

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.450
Alberta have read my book,
the murder of that tree

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:29.320
remains unsolved to this day.

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:37.090
Now let's come back
to last summer.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:38.830
The book was almost done.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:41.440
Every piece was
in place but one.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.618
I still needed a cover.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.870
We had no idea that
what we were doing

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:52.070
was really a cover
shoot for my memoir.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:55.690
It was late summer 1987.

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.290
I was stationed with my
assigned companion Elder Bishop

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.350
in Bonners Ferry, Idaho.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:03.710
After my troubles in Canada,
I had been transferred back

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:06.310
stateside, where I
found myself living rent

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:10.730
free in a small house owned by
a local Mormon farming family.

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.450
The house was a couple
of miles outside

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:16.010
of town in the middle of a
vast swath of wheat fields.

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:18.670
The Kootenai River
meandered nearby.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:20.730
Occasionally a moose
would wander by

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.930
or a bald eagle
would sail overhead.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.000
I'd been there since
May, so I'd gotten

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.370
to watch much of the
growing and harvest process.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:31.210
At the end of the
season, the farmer

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:33.100
let us know that they
would soon be burning

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.890
the stubble of one of the
fields, which would lie fallow

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:38.130
the next year.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.840
Even with advanced warning,
it was quite a shock

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.860
when Bishop and
I, returning home

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.520
in the late afternoon from
a day of proselytising,

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.990
spotted the smoke
rising and the distance.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.160
Driving up the dirt road
between the smoldering

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:55.050
remnants of the fires
was a surreal experience.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:57.930
It was so surreal, in fact,
that we did exactly what you'd

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:00.830
expect from bored kids.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:03.680
We pulled over,
hopped out of the car,

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.900
and gleefully snapped
pictures of each other posing

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.050
beside the flames.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:13.540
Decades passed, and though I
didn't forget about the fire,

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:16.520
I did forget about those photos.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.700
It was only after playing around
with several different cover

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.150
concepts for the
book and finding them

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:24.690
all wanting that I
finally pulled out

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:28.140
my box of old mission mementos
and started sifting through it,

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.560
looking for
inspiration, and that's

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.680
when I stumbled across this.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.700
Gold.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.139
I knew I'd found gold.

00:31:37.139 --> 00:31:38.930
I scanned the photo
immediately and started

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.680
working on a new cover.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.990
This image is so perfect in my
opinion that looking back it's

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.550
hard not to feel like
Elder Bishop and I

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:51.560
that day more than 28 years ago
were knowingly staging a cover

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.110
shoot for my future memoir.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:32:00.280
It's eerie, and in a
way, I believe it's true.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.440
I believe when he picked up
that burning sheaf of wheat

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.150
that my younger self had some
inkling, or maybe some hope,

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:09.456
of this book that
might one day come.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.310
Now let me offer one last
excerpt before I close.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.240
"Between Christmas
and New Year's, I

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.720
had made a break for it.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.800
I tried to run away
from my mission.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.630
I hopped on a bus
bound for Calgary

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:29.250
and then Salt Lake City, a
journey of almost exactly 1,000

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:32.830
miles, but I only made it as
far as Great Falls, Montana

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:35.830
before a local church leader
intercepted me and convinced me

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:38.810
to give my mission another go.

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:42.510
I was transferred from Brooks
to Calgary, a much larger city

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:45.200
where something like 40
missionaries were stationed,

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.720
including a few
female missionaries.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.600
My new companion, Elder Snow,
was a diligent missionary

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.180
who worked me hard,
but we also spent

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.500
plenty of time playing practical
jokes on our nearby neighbors,

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.320
Sister Roper and Sister Steed.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.460
In fact, the rivalry
between our companionships

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.585
was escalating to
reckless levels.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:15.520
On the 1st of February, a
Sunday evening, Elder Snow and I

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.500
met the sisters at a fireside,
an evening service featuring

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.590
a couple of inspirational
speakers held at a huge church

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:25.620
building near the
University of Calgary.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.890
Afterward, Roper
and Steed invited

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:29.310
us to meet back
at their apartment

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:31.400
for some hot chocolate.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.670
It was dark by then, and in
the vast expanse of Calgary,

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:37.260
we were miles from their pit.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.120
The sisters set off at a good
clip in their red Cavalier,

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.280
which I tried to keep
in sight as we sped down

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.350
the wide unfamiliar streets.

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.700
Our most recent humiliation
at the sisters hands

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:51.230
may have been why I found
myself racing to overtake them.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:55.380
It may be why Snow egged me
on to drive faster and faster.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.190
Racing down one of Calgary's
broad thoroughfares,

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:02.010
I gunned the engine and pulled
abreast of the red Cavalier.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.470
Roper and Steed taunted
us with rude gestures

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.150
and tried to shake
us by peeling off

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:08.440
into a maze-like neighborhood.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.100
Were we sublimating some
instinct toward flirtation

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.670
and courtship?

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:14.489
Was this how Elder
Fowler and sister

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:17.810
Niland had found themselves
on the wrong footing?

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:20.110
A good 10 minutes
later, Snow and I

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:23.179
found ourselves stopped behind
the sisters in a left turn lane

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.370
a few blocks from
their apartment.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.409
The light was red.

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:30.800
Red light, green
light, Snow shouted.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.510
Giddily, I jammed the
gear shift into park.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:36.130
Snow was already out his door.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:39.500
I pounded on Roper's window
while Snow rousted Steed.

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.070
Red light, green
light, we cried.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.050
Red light, green light!

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:45.820
Within moments, all four of
us were running figure eights

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:50.159
around the two cars waving
our arms and whooping it up.

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:53.870
When the light turned green,
Snow gave me a diabolical look

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:57.220
and jerked his chin
at the sister's car.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.300
I understood instantly.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.450
Without a word, the two of
us hopped into their car,

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:06.300
slammed the doors,
and squealed away.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.765
Roper and Steed,
in the few moments

00:35:07.765 --> 00:35:09.390
I could still see
them in the rear view

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.610
mirror, gaped after us.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:12.830
Ha, I shouted.

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:15.102
Take that!

00:35:15.102 --> 00:35:17.560
Four or five blocks later, we
parked behind their apartment

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.560
building and got out of
the car to wait for them.

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:25.520
We waited, and we
waited, and we waited.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.370
We were pacing with
worry, breath steaming

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:31.260
in the cold night air when our
blue Cavalier finally careened

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.900
into the parking lot
and screeched to a halt.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.200
Nearly 20 minutes had passed.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.860
The sisters, white
faced and breathless,

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.620
scrambled out the doors
and ran straight toward us.

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:47.320
Sister Roper grabbed
Snow by the lapels.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.999
Oh my lord, she babbled.

00:35:48.999 --> 00:35:50.540
Oh my lord, oh my
lord, we're getting

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.650
sent home-- all of us-- we're
getting sent home for sure.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:54.839
Oh, I can't believe it.

00:35:54.839 --> 00:35:56.380
We're going to be
in so much trouble.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.300
So much trouble.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.800
Hey, hey, slow down, said
Snow, extricating himself

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.770
from her grip.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.820
What the shazz happened?

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:08.090
Oh my word, it was a
nightmare is what it is.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:12.520
We got stopped by the police,
thank you, said Sister Steed.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.840
I felt a stab of fear.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.540
The police?

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.350
Snow folded his arms
and drew himself erect.

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:20.350
What did you two do?

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.010
He was trying to
project authority,

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:24.450
but I could tell he was rattled.

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:25.850
What did we do?

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.340
Said Roper, flapping
her arms in dismay.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.070
We took off after you.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:32.290
That's what we did, but
there was this pedestrian

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.020
crossing on the next block.

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.494
I was all mixed up and the
light started flashing yellow,

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:37.910
but it was too
late for me to stop

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:41.120
so I went through the crosswalk,
but there was a car behind us

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.790
back at the red light, and
it turned out to be a cop,

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:47.370
and he flipped his lights
right on and pulled us over.

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:49.235
Snow was shaking his head.

00:36:49.235 --> 00:36:51.240
Oh, doper, you
got to be kidding.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.670
A pedestrian crossing?

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.920
That is one serious ticket.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:59.260
You're telling me, said Roper,
her face a mask of desperation,

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.920
but it gets even better.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.880
When the cop asked to
see my driver's license,

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.850
guess where it was?

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:05.350
Where?

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:05.860
I asked.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.210
In your pit?

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:08.860
She whacked my shoulder.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.020
No, you idiot.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.520
It was in my purse
on the front seat

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.270
of the car, the car
you were driving.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:17.640
I clapped a hand to my forehead.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:21.690
Oh no, Roper, I am so sorry.

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.406
The look she gave me would
have pulverized granite.

00:37:24.406 --> 00:37:26.780
Tell me that tomorrow when I
have to take my license down

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.260
to the police station.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.340
I'll be lucky if I
don't get arrested.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.400
I'm lucky I'm not
in jail right now.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.490
At least we had your
registration, said Steed.

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:37.475
That helped.

00:37:37.475 --> 00:37:39.600
Of course, the officer took
down the address, which

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.320
is the mission
office, so guess who's

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.490
getting a visit from the police
first thing in the morning.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:48.290
Oh shazz, Snow moaned,
clutching his hair.

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:51.110
Like I told you, Roper
said, tomorrow that cop's

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:54.190
going to tell President Tuttle
I ran a light without a license

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.230
in your car, and
you think he's going

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:58.840
to believe us when we say
there's nothing funny going on.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.940
I'm telling you we're
all getting sent home.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.020
My father is going
to be so cheesed off,

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.730
said Snow, eyes closed,
fists clenched at his sides.

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:08.330
Flip.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:08.830
Flip.

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:10.480
Flip!

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.120
I couldn't stop shaking my head,
seeing all my hard won progress

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.162
evaporate.

00:38:15.162 --> 00:38:16.120
What was wrong with me?

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:19.380
Why did I always
have to be so stupid?

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.390
But at the same time,
I felt the stirring

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:23.330
of a tiny mutinous hope.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:26.520
Might we really get sent home?

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:30.690
Roper and Steed exchanged a
look, their mouths trembled,

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.560
and suddenly they both
cracked up laughing.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.860
Steed doubled over and Roper
had to lean against her

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.040
to keep from falling down.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.790
Huh?

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:40.980
Hey, what is this?

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:41.790
Snow demanded.

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:44.500
What the shazz is going on?

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.010
Oh boy, elders, said Roper,
pounding Steed on the shoulder.

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:50.170
We really had you going.

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.080
Steed held her heaving stomach.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.610
You ate it up-- every bite.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:58.720
You two looked so terrified
I almost peed myself.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.560
Wait, you didn't
get pulled over?

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.530
We did get pulled over,
said Roper, wiping her eyes,

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.230
but we only got a warning.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:08.360
The cops said the fire
drill was kind of cute,

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.610
but when we ran the light he had
to make sure we weren't drunk.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:16.170
She and Steed dissolved in
fresh peals of laughter.

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:18.910
Pretty soon I was laughing,
too, and after a few minutes,

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:21.020
even Snow cooled down.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.130
Hot chocolate around the
sister's kitchen table

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:26.710
went a long way toward
repairing the breach.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:29.150
As we were rinsing
our mugs, Sister Roper

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:32.030
said to me in her
most serious tone,

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:35.020
don't you ever forget what we've
all been through, Elder Shunn.

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.500
You need to write a book
someday and put all this down

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.250
for posterity.

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:42.130
People need to know what it's
really like to be missionaries

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.720
and how we got through it.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.010
You hear me, Elder Shunn?

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:47.980
I expect to see
that book someday.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.130
I promised her she
would, though I couldn't

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.110
imagine how to
write an honest book

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.668
and still show my
face at church.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.930
It was less than a month
later that I'd find myself

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.230
behind bars for real.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:03.100
No practical joke.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.930
Now, 29 years later, with
the book actually here,

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:09.890
it feels less like I've kept
a promise to Sister Roper

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:12.930
than that I've kept
a promise to myself."

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:15.300
Thanks for listening.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.988
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.290
And there's still
several minutes

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:26.550
left for questions if anyone
has anything they'd like to ask.

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:32.280
There's microphones
at both sides of the a

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.510
AUDIENCE: So it sounds
like you went through a lot

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:38.592
to figure out how to actually
do the self-publishing properly.

00:40:38.592 --> 00:40:41.050
Have you thought about-- did
you write about that, or share

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:43.633
that, or have you thought about
going into business doing that

00:40:43.633 --> 00:40:44.222
possibly?

00:40:44.222 --> 00:40:45.930
WILLIAM SHUNN: That's
a really good idea.

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:49.570
I've actually given some
thought to offering workshops

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.810
in creating ebooks.

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:55.500
I haven't really written much
about it yet, but I do plan to.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.484
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:56.484 --> 00:40:57.734
WILLIAM SHUNN: Very good idea.

00:40:57.734 --> 00:40:58.662
Thank you.

00:41:02.149 --> 00:41:02.982
Any other questions?

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:08.520
All right.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.080
Thank you very much
for coming out.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.830
There's copies of the
book available right

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.010
over there on your way out.

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:14.968
I really appreciate it.

00:41:14.968 --> 00:41:16.360
Thank you.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.910
[APPLAUSE]
