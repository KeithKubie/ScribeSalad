SCOTT LOH: The
Associate Fire Program

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.270
allows us to leave our roles
as University employees

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.480
and answer calls for help within
the municipality of Princeton.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.430
[SIREN]

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.550
The municipality has a 100%
volunteer fire department.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.040
During the day,
that's a challenge

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.170
as far as a manpower standpoint.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.430
So the fact that the University
has employees right here that

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.370
can respond and are
willing to respond

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.470
is a tremendous help and asset
to the town where manpower

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.520
would normally not be
found because volunteers

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.480
are typically out working
their job from nine to five.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.440
SANDRA KEARNEY: So when the
University started the program,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.010
I heard about it and decided
that since I'm already

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.080
a volunteer firefighter, it
would be a great opportunity

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.160
to not only service
the town that I live in

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.130
but also service the
town that I work in.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.670
The training?

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.950
We do two trainings a month.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.310
And we also do some live
burns a couple times a year

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.380
where we actually go out
and do practical training

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.290
with the fire and go
to the Fire Academy.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.070 position:69%
DAN TOMALIN: The associate program with the,
University, they're the same as we are.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.650
They're part, they're actually
members of the Fire Department.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.300
So they go.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.760
If they get there
first, they start

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.880
doing whatever needs to be done.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.930
And they do everything.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:29.720
Firefighting.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.090
Rescue.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.920
They help with car accidents.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.380
Everything that we do, they do.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.370
And it's a huge help.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.900
LIZ LEMPERT: When it comes to
public safety and fire safety,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.800
the goals of the University
and the community

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.900
are completely in line.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.900
And this is an area where
it's ripe for collaboration.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.900
And I'm proud that this
has been an area where

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.900
the University and the town
have been working together

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.300
both in terms of putting
together a volunteer force

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.510
and the University helping
with some of the major expenses

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.260
to make sure that we
have the equipment we

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.000
need to outfit our volunteers.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.000
The town has purchased
two new fire trucks for us

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.000
to use, totaling $1.4 million.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.000
The University is helping
with that purchase

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.190
with a contribution of $500,000.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.000
MICHAEL KERVAN: Anyone who is
an employee of the University

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.890
is allowed to join the program.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We provide the training and
the time for you to respond.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.000
And right now, I believe
we have around 30 members.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.000
And we're looking to
have around a pool of 50

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.300
that we can use for
our duty schedule.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.640
SANDRA KEARNEY:
There's a lot of things

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.560
that I love about
being a firefighter.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.760
The camaraderie, the feeling
of being a part of something.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.260
You know?

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.980
And helping people.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We do activities
outside of training.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.000
And then we all train together.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.980
STEVE ELWOOD: The best
part about the program

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.370
and why I enjoy it so much
is because it's given me

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.000
an opportunity to meet many
folks at the University

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.200
and throughout the
community that I otherwise

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.300
wouldn't have met.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.400
And also it gives
me an opportunity

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.800
to give back to the
local community.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:30.130
