00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.708
ANDREW LITTELL: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:01.708 --> 00:00:02.880
My name is Andrew Littell.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.588
And it is my distinct
pleasure to welcome

00:00:04.588 --> 00:00:05.860
to Google, Simon Winchester.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.276
Mr. Winchester,
welcome to Google.

00:00:07.276 --> 00:00:09.193
SIMON WINCHESTER: Thank
you very much, Andrew.

00:00:09.193 --> 00:00:10.984
ANDREW LITTELL: I'd
like to start out today

00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:13.320
by asking you about your
latest book, "The Men Who

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.450
United the States."

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.190
What drove you to write
about this particular aspect

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.547
of American history?

00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:20.380
SIMON WINCHESTER: Well,
I'd become a citizen

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.830
on Independence Day.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.970
ANDREW LITTELL: Congratulations.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.790
SIMON WINCHESTER: Thank you
very much, indeed-- in 2011.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.200
And because of that, it
is a very emotional thing

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.020
to be inducted into this
great amalgam of people.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.750
And I was very proud and happy.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.310
And because I'd been fascinated
with America ever since I

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.910
hitchhiked around it
in 1962, when I was 17.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.150
So once I'd become
a citizen, I thought

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.510
I would love to have a
bash at writing a book.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.320
But I didn't really know how to.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.310
I mean it's an enormous subject.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.530
And it's also a
subject which has

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.940
been written about by
thousands of people, academics,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.040
and explorers, and journalist.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.830
And it was a question
of trying to write it

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.620
in a way that was
fresh and different,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.390
but nonetheless told a story
that I thought was compelling.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.070
And I came up with a variety
of ideas, none of which

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.400
initially piqued my interest or,
more importantly, my editor's

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.480
interest.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.314
But the fourth one, it
wasn't three is a charm.

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:23.730
It was four is
charm in this case.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.080
I was just ruminating one day
on the name of the country,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.430
the United States of America,
and looking specifically

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.430
at this adjective,
"United," and how did

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.260
that happen to come about?

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.750
Not merely come about, but
to remain a coherent aspect

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.510
of this country for
most of its existence,

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.340
with obviously the single
exception of the 1960s

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.180
and the terrible events
of the Civil War.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.590
Because it occurred to me
that the other great entities

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.410
on the world's surface,
Canada let's say,

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.310
Russia, Europe, none
of them had seriously

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.340
achieved total
and lasting unity.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.340
I mean dear old
Canada, we love it.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.110
But the fact of the
matter is that there

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.770
is this great Francophone
block in the middle, Quebec,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.060
which is forever threatening,
sometimes loudly, sometimes

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.530
less so, to split the
country into three.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.330
The Soviet Union,
we've seen what's

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.680
happened in the aftermath
of the breakup of the Soviet

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.170
Union, dozens of little states,
often hostile to one another.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.640
And Europe, where I'm from,
I mean despite the best

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.030
efforts of idealists,
politicians, since the 1950s,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.680
we can't really rightly say
that it's achieved total unity.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.000
Well, I made at a serious
level, here's England.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.776
We don't use the euro.

00:02:44.776 --> 00:02:46.150
We're at the moment
when thinking

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.030
about splitting
apart from Scotland.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.160
That's coming up for
discussion in 18 months or so.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.680
Within Europe itself, I
mean Switzerland is not

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.320
a part of the European Union.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.930
If you try and plug your
electric razor in in Stockholm,

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.790
you'll need a different plug
from the one you use in Madrid.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.990
And everyone is speaking
in different languages

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.340
and there is no common
language in Europe.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.500
And yet America, which is
this great mongrel amalgam

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.680
of peoples of every
imaginable ethnic background,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.280
and religious affiliation,
and political viewpoint,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.030
does manage to hang together.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.270
And I thought, let's ruminate
on this word, "united."

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.480
And then it was a question
of how to structure a book.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.400
And that was in a way,
the more difficult thing.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.010
But we can talk about that--

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.310
ANDREW LITTELL: Sure.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.990
SIMON WINCHESTER: --as we
move along, I dare say.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.250
ANDREW LITTELL: Well, the thing
that immediately, even before I

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.458
picked up the book and was
just looking at the title,

00:03:39.458 --> 00:03:44.670
I was really captivated by
this idea of regionalism

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.970
as a part of being
united and so looking

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.290
at the wide variety
of regions that

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.750
are represented within
this United States.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.410
And I think it's a very delicate
balance between allowing

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.240
differences and regional
characteristics to flourish,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.880
but also being part
of a greater whole.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.582
SIMON WINCHESTER: Well, it is.

00:04:12.582 --> 00:04:15.970
The variation that you speak of,
I've become somewhat involved

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.380
in a project related
to that as well,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.607
which is for the last 50
years in Madison, Wisconsin,

00:04:24.607 --> 00:04:26.690
they've been preparing a
dictionary, which they've

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.220
at last finished, which you
probably know about, DARE,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.370
the "Dictionary of
American Regional English.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.950
It's a very long story,
but basically when

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.240
it was initiated in
the 1960s by people

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.630
that believed there was huge
variation within this country

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.080
linguistically
and dialectically,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.206
let's record it before it
all effervesces and America,

00:04:48.206 --> 00:04:49.580
everyone speaks
exactly the same,

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.730
which hasn't happened of course.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.250
ANDREW LITTELL: Yeah.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.460
SIMON WINCHESTER: And
they sent these people

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.640
to the furthest
reaches of this country

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.850
and what were
called Word Wagons.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.350
And they went down to little
villages in Louisiana,

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.090
or up in Alaska, or up in Maine
and found the oldest person

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.920
that had lived there for
decades and asked them--

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.780
they had a huge
350-page questionnaire.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.530
And it must been a
daunting prospect

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.750
to see these two young students
turn up on your doorstep

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.200
and ask you the same
questions every time, what

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.512
do you call the
insect that bites you

00:05:18.512 --> 00:05:19.970
on the neck in the
summertime, what

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.510
do you call the strip of grass
between the front of your house

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.940
and the curb?

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.570
And they built up from this,
this immense dictionary.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.320
It's six volumes.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.260
It was just finished--

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.093
ANDREW LITTELL: Wow.

00:05:30.093 --> 00:05:32.660
SIMON WINCHESTER: --last year,
which displays majestically

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.285
the variation that
you talk about.

00:05:34.285 --> 00:05:36.410
So when we drive down the
interstate and we're just

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.250
confronted by Walgreen's, and
McDonald's, and everything

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.370
looks the same, once you get
off the interstates it really

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.870
isn't.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.210
And what you say
is so true that out

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.840
of this astonishing variety,
which still exists, nonetheless

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.520
connective tissue, which
makes everyone able to say,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.320
I am an American,
which allows me

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.570
to say that nowadays
of course, is something

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.174
that I wanted to write about.

00:06:00.174 --> 00:06:02.340
ANDREW LITTELL: Well, let's
talk about the structure

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.881
a little bit.

00:06:02.881 --> 00:06:09.090
Because when you talk about
the men who united the states,

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.300
it could very easily be a list
of men in alphabetical order,

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.990
with very long entries for
some and shorter entries

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.690
for another.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.640
But that wouldn't make
very good reading.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.160
And so that the device
or the technique I

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.750
think that you've stumbled
upon is really interesting.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.440
And if you could talk
a little about it?

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.720
SIMON WINCHESTER: Yes.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.050
I mean you're absolutely right.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.136
I've always maintained
that in writing nonfiction,

00:06:30.136 --> 00:06:31.510
there are three
crucial elements.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.710
There's the idea, which is king.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.880
Good writing helps.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.350
But it's not in my view, the
second most important thing.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.510
I think the second
most important thing

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.740
is the structure of the book.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.940
You can write lyrically
about a wonderful idea.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.540
But if the structure is off,
the reader will be turned away.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.780
You're absolutely right, I was
preparing a list of the people.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.030
And it has to be said at the
outset, that most of them

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.555
were men who actually created
the physical links that

00:07:00.555 --> 00:07:02.310
bind this country together.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.150
And looking at this list, which
was 100 and 120-odd people,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.570
many of them well known, but
most of them very little known,

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.430
how to organize it?

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.037
Yes, of course, it could
have been alphabetical order.

00:07:15.037 --> 00:07:16.620
That would have been
just like looking

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.620
through an encyclopedia.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.140
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.223
It could have been in a
chronological order, which

00:07:20.223 --> 00:07:22.060
does have a sort of
narrative logic to it.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.910
But their achievements
and their interests

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:24.900
were all over the map.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.410
And so the reader would be
reading of a 19th century

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.750
person involved in
electricity and then

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.250
another one involved
in canal making

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.680
and would find the same
thing in the 20th century.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.190
So that would be
very, very confusing.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.470
And so one day, I was writing
to a friend of mine in China.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.890
And I had lived in
China for a long while.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:47.810
And he was reminding me
about Eastern philosophies,

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.150
essentially all
those east of India,

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.110
where I'd also
lived for a while,

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:58.560
having at the base of many of
their philosophical beliefs

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.150
four or five classical elements,
and particularly in China.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.241
And these elements
sort of underpin

00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:07.490
everything and the interaction
between these elements.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:13.480
And they're wood, earth,
water, fire, and metal.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.920
And it suddenly seemed to
me, looking at these five

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.290
categories and looking at
this list of 120 names,

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.360
that you could actually and
quite logically and quite

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.940
reasonably shoehorn these
names into these categories

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.770
and it would all sort of work.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.520
So all the early explorers,
because they were essentially

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.100
hacking their way
through forests,

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.309
they were in birch
bark and wooden canoes,

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.975
they were building palisades
of wood to protect themselves,

00:08:41.975 --> 00:08:44.900
they were burning log fires
to keep away the wolves,

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.470
and so forth, you could say
early American explorers could

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:53.360
be put under a rubric of "wood."

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.680
And similarly, once the
country, as the extent

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.447
had been defined by these early
explorers, of whom, of course,

00:09:00.447 --> 00:09:02.030
Lewis and Clark were
the most famous--

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.905
ANDREW LITTELL: Sure.

00:09:02.905 --> 00:09:05.280
SIMON WINCHESTER: --then it
would be the early geologists

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.029
and surveyors, who
were trying to work out

00:09:07.029 --> 00:09:08.170
what America was made of.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.280
Well, that's all
to do with earth,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.280
because the geologists
and rock hounds,

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.060
hitting things with hammers and
examining through a magnifying

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:15.710
glass.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.840
So "earth" seemed to
they cover those people

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.460
and those achievements.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.760
And then water, the third
of these elements-- well,

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.320
the early explorers,
the early settlers

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.780
would, if not exploring it,
venturing into the country,

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.040
they would do so in the
rivers, the Rappahannock,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.680
and the James, and the
Susquehanna, and the Potomac,

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.460
and the Hudson.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.690
And that when they got to
about 50 or 60 miles upstream,

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.500
they suddenly found that
they couldn't go any further,

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.257
because there was a
line of waterfalls,

00:09:47.257 --> 00:09:49.090
because that's where
the Appalachians became

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.590
the coastal plain.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.815
And so they settled there,
initially in settlements

00:09:54.815 --> 00:09:57.910
that would eventually evolve
into places like Richmond,

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.950
and Fredericksburg, and
Washington, DC, and Albany.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.530
And then they
would begin trading

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.230
with people, perhaps
upstream of them.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.050
And to get around
the rapids, they

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.160
would build very
primitive canals.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.710
And once they learned
how to do that,

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.160
then they would build canals
elsewhere in the country,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.340
and famous ones like
the Manchester Canal,

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.830
which effectively gave birth
to Boston as a major mercantile

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.260
center and the Erie
Canal, the most famous

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.430
of all, which essentially made
New York a mercantile center.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.690
So that all worked under
the rubric of "water."

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.360
And then fire, well,
it seemed to me

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.840
that it was all
very well to travel

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.420
behind a horse on a canal.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.300
But that's not very rapidly
crossing the country.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.310
And America, in the 1850s and
1860s, it was picking up speed.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:50.180
Speed was a necessary possibly
of commerce and moving people

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.210
hither and yon.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.370
And this had coincided
with James Watts'

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.050
invention of the steam engine.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.510
And so suddenly,
fire-based machinery

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.120
was brought into play,
to drive initially

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.150
railway trains, and
then early cars.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.450
And then other
forms of fire were

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.030
used to power the internal
combustion engine.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.360
And so we get roads,
and we get highways,

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.770
and then we get airplanes.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.970
So that all worked under
the rubric of "fire.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.360
And then the fifth and final
of these Chinese classical

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.640
elements was "metal."

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.510
And that seemed to me was the
metal of the telegraph wire,

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.350
and the metal of
electricity distribution.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.394
And then of the
telephone, and then radio,

00:11:27.394 --> 00:11:28.810
and then television,
and then what

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.040
we're doing today, all the
internet and everything

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.360
that Google stands for.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.030
So it did seem that these
five categories not only

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.990
worked, but also
where themselves

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.450
in chronological order
because wood comes earth,

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.110
comes before water.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:44.660
ANDREW LITTELL: Yeah.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.940
It's nice too that it
does fall in somewhat

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:47.820
chronological order.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.970
But you don't feel
confined to-- it's

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.720
not like at the beginning
of each section,

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.000
it's a certain set
of years necessarily.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.830
There's a ballpark.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:00.540
But you don't confine
yourself to say, well,

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.411
I can't talk about
airplanes in this chapter

00:12:03.411 --> 00:12:04.910
because we haven't
gotten there yet.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:05.250
SIMON WINCHESTER: Yes.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.130
I mean someone else, reasonably
the other day, well, there

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:08.980
is the sixth element,
which is occasionally

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.480
brought into play,
which is "air."

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.790
So why didn't you talk
about airplanes and air?

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:17.580
As I said well, this book,
this is 150,000 word book.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.740
I mean America is
a gigantic subject.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.292
I could have put a
sixth category in.

00:12:23.292 --> 00:12:25.500
But my editor, I think he
were saying, wait a minute.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.010
ANDREW LITTELL: It's
got a nice length to it.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:27.690
SIMON WINCHESTER:
It's got heft to it.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.148
So we don't want to turn it
into an encyclopedia or a Sears

00:12:30.148 --> 00:12:30.929
catalog, right?

00:12:30.929 --> 00:12:32.970
ANDREW LITTELL: Well, I
thought it was a really--

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.560
I mean it allows
you as a writer I

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.690
think to try new things as well.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.190
It gives you a construct
in which to work in.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:44.132
But really let you take
your imagination, which

00:12:44.132 --> 00:12:45.840
perhaps as a historian,
and you might not

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.810
get to use as much as--

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:48.810
SIMON WINCHESTER: Right.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.000
I mean I must say, I
think of all the books

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.500
I've done recently,
this was the most fun.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.585
I was initially thinking
how will Americans--

00:13:00.585 --> 00:13:01.965
but then I'm an American--

00:13:01.965 --> 00:13:02.260
ANDREW LITTELL: Right.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.980
SIMON WINCHESTER:
-- so I join you--

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.520
feel about being examined
through the prism of Chinese

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.020
philosophy?

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.020
But it's not really.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.700
Because these five elements
are essential really

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.610
to all of our lives.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.790
It's not that it's just the
Chinese had classified things

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.890
like that, as you said,
two millennia ago.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.580
ANDREW LITTELL: Switching
topics slightly,

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.460
the publication of
your book almost

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:30.170
coincided with the shutdown
of the US government.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.650
It happened a couple
weeks later I think.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.970
I'd love to hear-- without
getting too political--

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.053
SIMON WINCHESTER: Exactly.

00:13:36.053 --> 00:13:38.410
I'm well aware of
that, very hard to.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.920
ANDREW LITTELL: I'd love
to hear your thoughts,

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.450
not only as someone who has
just written about uniting

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.650
the states, but also
as a newly minted--

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.117
I know it's 2011 I think--

00:13:51.117 --> 00:13:53.200
SIMON WINCHESTER: It still
feels pretty new to me.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.340
ANDREW LITTELL: --but as a
newly minted American citizen,

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.450
your thoughts on that process.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.190
And I think it
strikes some of us

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.472
as exactly contradictory to
what you highlight in your book.

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:09.180
SIMON WINCHESTER: It
has a lot of people.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.104
So I mean this too began when
the shutdown was going on.

00:14:12.104 --> 00:14:13.770
And they would say,
how on earth can you

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.936
write a book called "The
Men Who United the States,"

00:14:15.936 --> 00:14:19.810
when the United States is
so apparently disunited?

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:22.750
Well, I mean I had a number
of things to say about that.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.870
I think America is a great deal
better than her politicians,

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:28.515
quite honestly.

00:14:28.515 --> 00:14:30.556
ANDREW LITTELL: This might
be true around Google.

00:14:30.556 --> 00:14:31.556
SIMON WINCHESTER: Right.

00:14:31.556 --> 00:14:38.610
But America has survived a lot
of extraordinary and terrible

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.170
national experiences, I
mean not least of course

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.630
the Civil War in 1860s.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.390
And yet America
bounced back from that

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:46.470
and it took a long time.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.150
But it survived.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.410
And the guiding
principles of this country

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.590
survived Lincoln's
assassination.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.270
It survived the
Great Depression.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.814
It survived lunacies
like Prohibition,

00:14:58.814 --> 00:14:59.730
I mean for God's sake.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.370
I don't want to offend
any die-hard people that

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.100
are temperance adherents.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.130
But it seems pretty
astonishing to me

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.230
that that could be
not only legislation,

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.500
but in the Constitution,
that you're not

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.120
allowed to buy or liquor.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.470
It survived the Dust Bowl.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.200
It survived, as I
said, the Depression.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.120
It survived Millard Fillmore,
the Know-Nothing party,

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.140
all sorts of extraordinary
political parties

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.810
and subparties.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:29.980
And it survived 9/11.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.280
As a nation, it survived
and recovered itself.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.290
It's surviving, it seems,
the current recession,

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.640
which we're climbing out of.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.610
And it will survive
the nonsense that

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.650
seems to be going on in
Washington these days.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.960
This is just aberrant behavior.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.730
And America just sort
of shrugs it off.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:51.330
Is wounded by it,
but bounces back.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.230
And that's one of
the things that I so

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.380
like about this country, that
nonetheless it dusts itself

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.570
off, and thought, well,
that was pretty idiotic.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:03.760
But I have to say that-- I mean
one of the things that I go on

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.310
about in the second part of the
book is the early geologists.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:12.210
And there are four great
surveys in the 1860s.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:17.370
And two of the were a man called
Hayden, who essentially mapped

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.900
Yellowstone, and John Wesley
Powell, who despite only having

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.629
one arm, the earlier
one being shot off

00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:23.670
in the battle of Shiloh--

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:24.480
ANDREW LITTELL: Amazing story.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.896
SIMON WINCHESTER: --mapped and
went down the Grand Canyon.

00:16:26.896 --> 00:16:30.130
Those two, I think,
great heroes of mine,

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.060
would have been
spinning in their graves

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.690
I think if they knew that the
national parks that they had

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.650
essentially discovered,
Yellowstone and the Grand

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:42.480
Canyon, were shut down, that
the public couldn't see them

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.890
because of some trivial
ideological dispute

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:47.649
in Washington, DC.

00:16:47.649 --> 00:16:49.690
I think they would have
thought that was madness.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.965
But we survived it nonetheless.

00:16:51.965 --> 00:16:52.840
ANDREW LITTELL: Yeah.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.570
It was interesting
reading this book,

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.800
just having come out
of that experience.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.360
And you only hope that the
wonderful characters, both

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.890
known and somewhat
forgotten I would say,

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.500
might serve as a reference
point for some of our--

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.950
SIMON WINCHESTER: Right.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:14.190
I don't know-- the
one political point

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.660
that sort of shines out of one
of the chapters of this book

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.282
relates to, well,
big government.

00:17:20.282 --> 00:17:22.490
I mean big government is
very important in this book,

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:23.859
as perhaps we can talk about.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:26.190
But if I could just talk
about one little thing,

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.540
which was rural electrification.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.870
I mean in the fifth part,
which is devoted in part to how

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:37.030
electricity was brought to the
farms in America in the 1930s,

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:41.180
there was a British-- and I
say this wearing my former hat

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:45.280
as a Britain-- so a man called
Samuel Insull, who essentially

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.770
controlled most of the
Midwestern electric utility

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.750
companies in the 1930s.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.650
And he thought it was a
complete waste of time,

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.150
and more importantly
a waste of money,

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.060
to wire the farms in
the middle of America

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:04.930
They're expensive beyond belief
to string poles and copper

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.690
wire to them.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.880
And yet, the farms-- there
were 800,000 of them,

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.750
and producing food at an
enormous pace because America

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.850
was getting hungry
and more prosperous.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.580
But they were left
without electricity.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.360
Well, Roosevelt, when he
came to power in the 1930s

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.250
and had this gigantic government
apparatus, one aspect of it

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:28.330
was the REA, the Rural
Electrification Administration.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.270
And the stories of how
it brought electric power

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.950
to people, I think they're
wonderfully touching stories--

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.680
the night the lights came
on in rural communities

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.720
all over America.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.750
But the political
point that I think

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:44.890
is worth making is that first
community in America to benefit

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:50.240
from FDR's rural electrification
was in Western Ohio,

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.530
in 1935, a little town called
Miami, Ohio-- actually,

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.880
a little town
outside Miami-- where

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.686
the farms got electricity.

00:18:58.686 --> 00:19:00.310
They were the first
ones in the country

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.630
to feel the largesse of
the federal government

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.000
at its biggest.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.180
Well, that town is in the 8th
congressional district in Ohio,

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.340
which is a congressional
district represented

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.980
in Congress today
by John Boehner.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.560
So John Boehner, the man
who is the archetype foe

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.850
of big government, his
people benefited mightily

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.480
from the biggest big government
America has ever known.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.059
So take that, Mr.
Boehner, I want to say.

00:19:31.059 --> 00:19:33.350
AUDIENCE: ANDREW LITTELL:
And as a citizen and a voter,

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.889
I am sure that you can
take actual action.

00:19:35.889 --> 00:19:37.805
SIMON WINCHESTER: I would
like to write to him

00:19:37.805 --> 00:19:40.590
and say-- but unfortunately,
I don't live in Miami, Ohio.

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:41.914
ANDREW LITTELL: Of Ohio, yeah.

00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:43.580
But it is interesting
to think about-- I

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.610
mean from Lewis and
Clark, who were funded

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.120
by Thomas Jefferson
and the government,

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.414
to the Transcontinental
Railroad,

00:19:53.414 --> 00:19:58.650
to the electrical projects of
the Depression, so much of that

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:03.150
was, if not completely
funded, it was certainly

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.795
driven by big government.

00:20:05.795 --> 00:20:07.170
SIMON WINCHESTER:
But it also-- I

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:11.370
mean this sort of is about the
professions that the two of us

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.480
are in today.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.060
The guidebooks
that I took with me

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.370
when I visited-- because
I must have visited I

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.400
think all of the states,
the contiguous 48

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.710
anyway, to do research
for this book--

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:25.730
I collected all
of the WPA guides

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.210
that had been made in
the 1930s because they

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.010
were stellar pieces
of literature.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.250
You get the guide for Iowa
or the guide for Oregon,

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.060
made in the 1930s
and the early 1940s,

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.720
financed by the
government, to give work

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.330
to unemployed writers,
and photographers,

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:46.310
and editors, who were all out
of work because of the Great

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:47.130
Depression.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.560
And you get the
California guide,

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.280
which has essays on California
written by John Steinbeck, who

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.670
didn't have work at the time
and accepted a government check.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.530
So I mean that's--
I, believe you me,

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.340
despite coming from Britain and
despite "socialized medicine"

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.470
and all those things which
we're supposed to have,

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.380
I think government needs
to be controlled of course.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:10.850
But when government works
well-- the REA, the WPA guides,

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:14.270
the Boulder Dam, the
Tennessee Valley Authority,

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.870
the Moon shot-- government
can be extremely effective.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:21.000
And it shouldn't in my view
be tossed overboard in the way

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.580
that some politicians
are threatening to do.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.560
ANDREW LITTELL: Well, it
be interesting to see how

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.143
the next couple
months in Washington--

00:21:26.143 --> 00:21:27.970
SIMON WINCHESTER:
It will indeed.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:29.345
ANDREW LITTELL:
I do want to make

00:21:29.345 --> 00:21:34.090
sure we get to Google and
the internet and your opinion

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:34.590
there.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:37.700
But I would like to talk a
little bit about geology.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.440
And you were a geology major
at university, I believe?

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.740
SIMON WINCHESTER: Yes.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:48.720
ANDREW LITTELL: And I
think you were a geologist

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.070
by trade for a few years--

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.050
SIMON WINCHESTER:
For a year, yes.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.050
ANDREW LITTELL: --before
coming into journalism.

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.965
It's been wonderful to see the
books that you've written over,

00:21:55.965 --> 00:21:57.340
at last the past
couple of years,

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:03.060
have this very passionate focus
on what's beneath the surface

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.520
and beneath the Earth.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.274
And some of the most
interesting characters

00:22:07.274 --> 00:22:08.690
I think that came
out of this book

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:12.600
were some of the old geologists,
the original geologists

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.220
for the United States.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.170
So I'm interested in what
appealed to you originally

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.890
about geology and
how you maintain

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:27.212
that interest in the
science over the past years?

00:22:27.212 --> 00:22:28.920
SIMON WINCHESTER: I
wish I could tell you

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.995
that my entry into
geology was because

00:22:30.995 --> 00:22:35.667
of a passionate schoolboy
love of ammonites or rocks.

00:22:35.667 --> 00:22:36.250
But it wasn't.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.390
I initially wanted
to be a sailor.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.460
I wanted to wander
around the world.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.870
And I took all my
exams and everything

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.930
to go to Dartmouth, which is
the equivalent of Annapolis

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.520
in Britain, and
passed all the exams,

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.345
until I came to do the medical.

00:22:52.345 --> 00:22:54.790
And then, he showed
me, the doctor,

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.760
a loose leaf book with
circles, with dots on it.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.620
And he said, what number
do you see in that circle?

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.474
And I said 47.

00:23:01.474 --> 00:23:03.515
And he looked at me and
he said, are you serious?

00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:04.314
And I said yes.

00:23:04.314 --> 00:23:05.730
He suddenly turned
to another one,

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:09.770
they were red, green, and
blue dots and I said 23.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:12.090
And he shut the book with
this terrible finality

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.240
and said, Mr.
Winchester, I'm terribly

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.080
sorry to have to tell you
that Her Majesty, the Queen,

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.010
takes a rather
dim view of people

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:22.490
driving her very expensive
warships around the world who

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:26.380
can't tell red from green,
and therefore left from right.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.770
So I'm afraid
another career will--

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:34.280
So then there was an
advert-- in the school, sort

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:38.580
of career's office, there was
a picture of a man in shorts,

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.660
with a hammer, standing on
some mountain in Africa saying,

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.510
see the world, be a geologist.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.980
And I thought well, if I
can't tell red from green,

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:52.370
maybe I can tell ammonites
from graptolites.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:56.340
And so I took an O-level, which
is an exam you take at 16,

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.580
and passed it.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.830
And then went up to
Oxford to study it.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.600
And loved it, but wasn't
terribly good at it.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.030
And so was shipped off
to Uganda and worked

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:11.430
in the mountains between Uganda
and Congo, looking for copper.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.830
Didn't find a
microgram of copper.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.780
And then worked on an oil rig
in the North Sea for a while.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.135
And actually did quite a lot
of-- it was gas in those days.

00:24:21.135 --> 00:24:24.990
But then, through a
rather complicated set

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:28.400
of circumstances,
drifted away from geology

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.100
and into journalism.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.040
But still have this
affection for the science

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.860
and so write about
it whenever I can.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.120
ANDREW LITTELL: And it's
nice that now that you're

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.040
able to perhaps select
the topics that you'd

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.480
like to write about, you
can return to those roots

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.080
as it were.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.538
SIMON WINCHESTER:
Well, and indeed,

00:24:44.538 --> 00:24:47.390
the book I'm working on
now is quite a big book

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:48.390
about the Pacific Ocean.

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:50.165
And there's heaps
of geology there

00:24:50.165 --> 00:24:52.155
because there's the
whole ring of fire.

00:24:52.155 --> 00:24:53.970
And so I'll have
great fun with that.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:54.200
ANDREW LITTELL: That's nice.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.010
So you've gone
from the Atlantic,

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.376
to focusing on the continental--

00:24:58.376 --> 00:24:59.500
SIMON WINCHESTER: US, yeah.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.220
ANDREW LITTELL: And
now on to the Pacific.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.428
SIMON WINCHESTER: Well,
HarperCollins, my publishers,

00:25:03.428 --> 00:25:07.700
who I'm enormously fond of, of
course, I keep saying trilogy,

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.247
trilogy, trilogy.

00:25:09.247 --> 00:25:11.330
Whether it will ever a be
boxed set, I don't know.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.960
But it does seem to
have a logic to it--

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.290
ANDREW LITTELL: It does.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:13.430
Yeah.

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.346
SIMON WINCHESTER:
--Atlantic America, Pacific.

00:25:15.346 --> 00:25:16.359
We'll see.

00:25:16.359 --> 00:25:18.400
ANDREW LITTELL: So you
end the book by discussing

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.640
the internet, and
its power to connect

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.230
not only the US, but also
the world, whether as a dream

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.320
or as a nightmare.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.415
SIMON WINCHESTER: Yes.

00:25:28.415 --> 00:25:30.790
And incidentally, I should
say that of the one the places

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:34.030
that I lingered at, but
wasn't able to get into,

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:40.070
was Council Bluffs in Iowa,
where the old drive-in movie

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.650
theater is now a great
big Google server farm.

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:45.310
Very impressive, I must say.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.500
I went to server farms.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.210
But Google was rather
private about their own.

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:49.710
So--

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:50.240
ANDREW LITTELL: Too many.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.500
SIMON WINCHESTER: --I
stood outside, like a boy,

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.675
sort of in a zoo,
and looked through.

00:25:54.675 --> 00:25:57.530
But I think I know more
or less what's in there.

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:02.720
But yes, the thing that
I think interests me

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:08.340
about whether the internet is a
unifying thing or not, I think

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.670
goes back to my
feelings about radio.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:14.790
I think radio is the great
national and cultural unifier,

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:18.379
the image you have of the
walnut-paneled behemoth

00:26:18.379 --> 00:26:20.670
in the living room, with the
family gathered around it,

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:24.350
mother, father, children,
dogs, cats, all listening

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:29.040
to a program that's the NBC
Symphony Orchestra being beamed

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.940
in from New York City, or
a comedy program coming in

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:36.270
from Los Angeles, or a drama
being sent down from Chicago,

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:40.220
is an image both of
sort of national unity

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.950
and also familial unity.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.150
But then came television,
which preserved this unity

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:46.740
for a while.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.410
Everyone watched Johnny Carson.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.640
Everyone watch Jack Paar.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.220
But then came cable television.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.400
And cable television,
which came about initially

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.860
in West Virginia in
the 1970s, then had,

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:03.120
and unconsciously at first,
it started dividing people.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.790
So that dad was in
the den watching ESPN.

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.990
And mom, I don't want
to be sexist about this,

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.840
was watching another
kind of program.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.700
And then soon, the
internet exacerbated this.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.620
And everyone in the family
was doing something different.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:22.120
Seldom now, unless they're
big news events, like the Moon

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:27.000
landing, or 9/11, or the
killing of a president,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.430
few electronically transmitted
events bring everyone together.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:33.760
They tend to divide people into
their little interest groups.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.220
And I'm afraid, with
my belief that unity

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.960
in a country like this
is terribly important,

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.710
that splitting it into
intellectual subgroups,

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.730
which is something the
internet seems to be doing,

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:50.950
is inimical to that
basically, idea.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.530
I think society
will deal with it.

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.700
But at the moment, I think
it's an open question

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.710
as to how it will deal with it.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:59.680
So, of course, I think
the internet is wonderful.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:05.580
But I think it has social
aspects to disunity,

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.903
which are somewhat troubling.

00:28:06.903 --> 00:28:07.778
ANDREW LITTELL: Yeah.

00:28:07.778 --> 00:28:14.000
And it's interesting to think
about-- I mean all of your book

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.109
focuses on unifying the US,
where the internet is certainly

00:28:19.109 --> 00:28:20.150
a more global phenomenon.

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:21.566
SIMON WINCHESTER:
Well, certainly.

00:28:21.566 --> 00:28:22.400
Yeah.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.250
ANDREW LITTELL: Being able
to-- if the railroad started,

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.902
the US was the first country
with a transcontinental

00:28:28.902 --> 00:28:31.110
railroad and being able to
explain that to the world.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.090
There's certainly
some parallels there.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:37.482
But the internet I think is
the first mode to be able to--

00:28:37.482 --> 00:28:38.940
SIMON WINCHESTER:
Expand the world.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.630
ANDREW LITTELL:
--expand the world.

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:43.160
Which is-- in some
ways I agree with you--

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:49.721
which is a frightening, but
also very liberating idea.

00:28:49.721 --> 00:28:50.720
SIMON WINCHESTER: It is.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.289
And if I'm silent,
it's just that I

00:28:53.289 --> 00:28:54.580
don't know how to deal with it.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.170
It's a social enigma
to me at the moment.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.810
And the experience of cable
television and the internet

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:05.400
in dealing with
the United States

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.067
tends to run counter to my hope
and thesis that's in the book.

00:29:09.067 --> 00:29:09.900
ANDREW LITTELL: Yup.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.000
SIMON WINCHESTER: But as
I say, this book I think,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.915
and I hope you feel
it, radiates optimism.

00:29:15.915 --> 00:29:17.040
ANDREW LITTELL: Definitely.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.831
SIMON WINCHESTER: The
fact that the country

00:29:18.831 --> 00:29:21.990
has survived all these ills
and come up smiling every time.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:23.770
I'm not saying the
internet is an ill,

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.240
but I think the country--
society-- will deal with it

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.860
in a sensible and pragmatic way.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.318
ANDREW LITTELL:
And in the same way

00:29:29.318 --> 00:29:32.340
that-- I mean when
radio first came out,

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.380
there were tons of fears about
what this influence could

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:41.110
be on the hitherto other-- or
uneducated populace of the US.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:45.060
And did you want that
demon box sitting

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.130
in your living room
speaking to you?

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:54.050
And so I see similar reactions
to other previous mass

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:55.320
communication inventions.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.236
SIMON WINCHESTER: Yes.

00:29:56.236 --> 00:29:57.950
I mean almost
everything is in this--

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:01.010
I mean starting with the
telegraph and Samuel Morse's

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:05.240
invention, everyone
was hostile initially.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.130
I mean look at the
trouble that Morse

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:10.650
had to get Congress to agree
to any kind of experiment,

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:13.010
any kind of funding for it.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.100
But then of course,
suddenly, they

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.410
embraced it and
realized what Morse

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:19.750
had realized for some years.

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:22.220
So many of these people are
people pounding on the door

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.452
and saying look, believe me,
this is a great, great idea.

00:30:25.452 --> 00:30:27.910
But it's interesting, of course,
that the internet grew out

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.300
of the government
sponsored idea.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:33.830
The ARPAnet after all
was a government idea.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:37.380
I wonder whether it would
ruin the technology here

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.020
to play you the
first-- I don't it

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.670
will-- the first
voice that was ever

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:45.197
transmitted over the radio.

00:30:45.197 --> 00:30:47.030
Because getting back
to what we were talking

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:50.280
about a few moments ago
about how the radio is

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.740
a great unifying medium, well,
of course, when radio was

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.160
invented, it was all Morse code.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:59.000
What Marconi sent and
received from Signal Hill

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.380
in Newfoundland was Morse.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.210
But it took this extraordinary
and forgotten man

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:08.690
called Reginald Fessenden
to come up with AM and FM,

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:12.230
that we know all about, a
wonderful name, Reginald Aubrey

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:13.210
Fessenden.

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:16.090
And he was the first person
ever to broadcast human voice

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:18.630
over the radio, which began
the national conversation.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.120
And this was the voice.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.695
And I think I got to queued up.

00:31:21.695 --> 00:31:23.320
So if I'm anywhere
near the microphone,

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.050
I think you should
be able to hear it.

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:27.740
And this was sent
out to all the ships

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.820
at sea working for the
United Fruit Company.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:37.720
He send a message by Morse, just
before Christmas, 1906, telling

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.940
these operators to
listen out at one minute

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.710
at midnight on Christmas
Eve, for a special broadcast.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.530
And so it happened to be
a dark and stormy night.

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:50.260
And off Cape Cod, there was
a huge blizzard blowing.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.530
And the ships that were
bringing bananas up

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:55.060
from places like
Juticalpa in Honduras,

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.750
to Boston, and Baltimore,
and New York City,

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.580
tuned in their
radios and listened

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.280
through the static and the
Morse chatter of other ships.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.260
But instead of
Morse, they had this.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.760
[MUSIC, EMMI LEISNER,
"OMBR MAI FU"]

00:32:25.756 --> 00:32:28.530
Now, that's a singer
called Emmi Leisner,

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:31.730
singing "Ombr mai fu," which
has nothing to do with America.

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:36.370
It's all to do with a Persian
king and a shade tree.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:39.415
And after that was over,
then Fessenden himself,

00:32:39.415 --> 00:32:42.050
who was a big, burly man,
with a wonderful bass voice,

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.530
came and said the Lord's Prayer.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:46.740
And then said a very happy
Christmas to you all.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.590
And the first voice broadcast,
ever broadcast to the public,

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:51.160
ended.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.590
But within a week,
over in Pasadena,

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:57.940
a radio station opened above
Sherman's, a musical instrument

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:01.660
store, which still exists,
selling-- or playing music.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.800
And then three months,
are a cornfield

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.730
in Madison, Wisconsin,
an area was built,

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.260
and the first ever
radio station,

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:11.270
which became WHA,
which still exists.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:13.310
And then the national
conversation began.

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:15.877
But I love the thought that
that beautiful piece of music

00:33:15.877 --> 00:33:17.460
was the beginning
of the conversation,

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.448
all to do with bananas as well.

00:33:19.448 --> 00:33:20.322
ANDREW LITTELL: Yeah.

00:33:20.322 --> 00:33:20.821
Right.

00:33:20.821 --> 00:33:22.650
Yeah.

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:26.292
And that story
right there is one

00:33:26.292 --> 00:33:28.500
of the things that also
appealed to me about the book

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:35.580
is that you intersperse within a
lot of the biography or history

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.180
parts, your own personal
experiences of visiting

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.155
some of these places.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.380
At first, reading
the first person

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.930
in a nonfiction book
or a history book

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:48.690
sometimes can have
a jarring effect.

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.560
But I found this to
be very, very natural.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.030
SIMON WINCHESTER:
Well, thank you.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:57.030
ANDREW LITTELL: And being able
to visualize those places today

00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:00.540
I thought was a
fascinating look at how

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.810
we've forgotten
some of these very

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:05.910
important markers for example.

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.860
SIMON WINCHESTER:
One of the journeys

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:11.870
that I really enjoyed for
this book was discovering

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:14.600
the origins of the
interstate highway system.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.679
Conventionally, we believe
it's known as the Eisenhower

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:19.699
system of interstate
and defense highways

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:23.600
because Eisenhower saw the
autobahns in Germany in 1945.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.500
Well, he did.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:29.050
But that's not the reason
the system has got that name.

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:34.070
It's because he was an
observer, as a young major,

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:38.080
on an expedition run
by the Army in 1919,

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.139
to cross the country in military
vehicles from the South Lawn

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:43.350
of the White House
to San Francisco,

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.360
as rapidly as
possible, to thwart

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.330
a theoretical Japanese
invasion of California.

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:51.820
The generals at the
National War College thought

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:54.360
what if the Japanese, who were
getting somewhat restless,

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.430
even prior to the
last century, what

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:59.290
would happen if they
invaded California?

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:02.990
How quickly could we get troops
from the big bases in the East,

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:06.040
by road, across to
defend the West Coast.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.010
So they assembled this convoy,
about three miles long,

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:12.430
of tanks, and armored vehicles,
and commissary wagons,

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:14.520
and hospitals, and
jeeps, and things,

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:18.410
with the young-- he's in
his 20s-- Major Eisenhower,

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:20.856
as an observer, and
to keep a diary.

00:35:20.856 --> 00:35:21.980
It was a complete shambles.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.740
I mean it took 58 days.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.870
They went an average speed
of six miles an hour.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.430
And believe you me, if
the Japanese had invaded,

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:32.210
they would have swallowed
up California, and Arizona,

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:34.140
and New Mexico, and
probably, and possibly

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.460
for the benefit of us all, would
have taken most of West Texas

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.588
as well.

00:35:38.588 --> 00:35:42.940
But Eisenhower's diary--
I got a copy of it,

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.620
thanks to the
internet, of course--

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:48.260
and decided to follow and
go to each of the places

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.350
that these soldiers had been on.

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:53.825
And one of them
was a place that I

00:35:53.825 --> 00:35:57.080
had wanted to go to since
I was at 15-year-old,

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.270
and that was the town
of Dennison, Iowa.

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:03.420
And not too far actually
from the Google complex

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.190
in Council Bluffs.

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.970
Dennison, I had wanted
to go to because it

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:11.030
was the birthplace of the
woman that I as a 15-year-old,

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.250
thought was the most
beautiful woman in the world.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.960
And the Army team had
been there in 1919.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.365
They had played
I think baseball,

00:36:19.365 --> 00:36:23.220
had lost to the
citizens of Dennison.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.388
They had watched films in
the Dennison opera house.

00:36:25.388 --> 00:36:26.763
I mean how wonderful
that there's

00:36:26.763 --> 00:36:29.710
an opera house in a little
town in western Iowa.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:33.590
But two years later--
completely, obviously,

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:35.640
unconnected with
the soldier's visit,

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.140
a child was born
called Donna Mullenger.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.250
And she grew up.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:42.460
She was wanting to
become a teacher.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:46.020
But her parents didn't have the
money to send her to school.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.570
And so she got on the Union
Pacific train at Omaha

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:51.250
and went to Hollywood.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:55.955
Her attractiveness allowed
her to be signed by MGM.

00:36:55.955 --> 00:36:58.305
And initially, she was
called Donna Adams.

00:36:58.305 --> 00:37:01.250
But because the two As,
didn't allow her name

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:06.310
to be said very easily, they
changed her name to Donna Reed.

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:11.800
And Donna Reed, when I saw that
movie, the "Wonderful Life,"

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.530
when she played
Mrs. George Bailey,

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:17.260
I thought she, in
Bedford Falls, was just

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.420
the apotheosis of
American beauty.

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.390
And so I wanted to go
to where she was born.

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:22.265
And so, I went there.

00:37:22.265 --> 00:37:25.480
And the old opera house is now
the Donna Reed Performing Art

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.420
Center.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:30.500
And the Oscar she won for
"From Here to Eternity,"--

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.155
she, for some
reason, didn't win it

00:37:32.155 --> 00:37:34.980
for "It's a Wonderful
Life"-- is there.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:39.770
And Fat Mo's in Chicago
had donated a soda fountain

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:40.270
counter.

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:42.300
So that's there, which
is where young George

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.953
Bailey got hit in the ear.

00:37:43.953 --> 00:37:48.100
So you remember, he was deaf
in the movie or half deaf.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.650
But the extraordinary
thing about it

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:53.210
is that attractive
a town though it

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:57.120
may be, it absolutely stinks.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:02.220
And it stinks because two miles
away, to the west of the town,

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:08.730
is a gigantic feedlot, in which
200,000 cattle are standing

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:12.620
all the time, providing beef for
the hungry people of the East

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:13.260
Coast.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.450
But when the wind is
in the wrong direction,

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:19.530
this terrible miasma of cattle
and with all their products,

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.219
sweeps over Dennison and
makes it less beautiful

00:38:22.219 --> 00:38:23.635
place that I
Imagined it would be.

00:38:23.635 --> 00:38:25.000
ANDREW LITTELL: Yeah.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.760
Yeah.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.590
I mean I think-- and I see this
through many of your books--

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:33.490
is you're more of a storyteller
I see than a historian.

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:38.460
And there's such easy
books to read I find,

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:40.280
not to make it too simple.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.200
But, they're so engaging.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.250
And its stories like
that I think move you

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:45.250
through the book.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:47.500
SIMON WINCHESTER: Well, it's
very nice for you to say.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.480
But I'm pleased that the reviews
thus far, a number of them

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.670
have been by academics.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:54.120
And then I'm always wary
and thinking academics

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.740
might not like a
book that is, as you

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.580
say, more stories than
perhaps classical history.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.030
But, they've said nice things.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:03.150
ANDREW LITTELL: So
you've very productive.

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:07.046
And since-- I guess I look
at 1998, when you really

00:39:07.046 --> 00:39:08.920
started being an author
full time, let's say.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.836
SIMON WINCHESTER: Yes.

00:39:11.095 --> 00:39:12.470
ANDREW LITTELL:
10 books, I think

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:16.480
in 15 years and five "New
York Times" best sellers.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.007
So we at Google have certainly
looked at a lot of metrics

00:39:20.007 --> 00:39:22.340
and done a lot of research
on how productive people are.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.200
SIMON WINCHESTER: I'm
now getting terrified

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.725
about what you're
going to tell me.

00:39:24.725 --> 00:39:26.308
ANDREW LITTELL: We've
certainly looked

00:39:26.308 --> 00:39:28.570
at what makes people
productive, and not

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.980
only quality, but quantity.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:35.240
Any tips that you
can provide on how

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:40.600
to maintain such a high
level of work, but certainly

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.620
have been so productive
over the past?

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:45.540
SIMON WINCHESTER: Well, I
remember when I was small,

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:48.190
my father's the preferred
newspaper in our house

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.010
was "The Daily Telegraph."

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:51.970
And they ran an
advertisement every day,

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:55.260
I think on the front page, for
some course called Pelmanism.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.660
I have no idea
what Pelmanism was.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:01.744
But the question at the top was,
do you have a grasshopper mind?

00:40:01.744 --> 00:40:03.410
If you have a grasshopper
mind, then you

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:05.350
should take a
course in Pelmanism.

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:06.480
My father had threatening.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.190
He said, you just
keep-- everything's

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:10.950
all over the map with you.

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.460
You're going to be a dilettante.

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:15.550
You're going to know
nothing at all well.

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:17.550
I'm going to sign up for
a course on Pelmanism.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.420
And I'm jolly glad he didn't.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.446
So my first piece
of advice is do not

00:40:21.446 --> 00:40:22.570
take a course on Pelmanism.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:23.240
ANDREW LITTELL: Right.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.323
SIMON WINCHESTER: But, no.

00:40:24.323 --> 00:40:26.830
And I think if you're got a
grasshopper mind, encourage it.

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:30.660
But, I mean you've got
to be very focused.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.400
And I think I am.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.120
I live on this farm in
Western Massachusetts.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.000
And I've got a study.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.470
And I just bury myself
away for months at a time

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:39.690
and get it done.

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:42.090
But I love every aspect.

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:42.940
I love the research.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:43.900
And who wouldn't?

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.900
ANDREW LITTELL: And I
know you do all your own--

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.100
SIMON WINCHESTER: I do.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.320
ANDREW LITTELL:
--research as well.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.490
SIMON WINCHESTER: And
then the writing is nice.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.960
The editing, when you
have to slash away things

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.610
that the editor--
like, "you're not

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:54.825
allowed to put airplanes
in the air" chapter.

00:40:54.825 --> 00:40:56.882
In fact, get rid
of the air chapter.

00:40:56.882 --> 00:40:58.090
And that's a bit frustrating.

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:00.420
But that aside, the
process is great fun.

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.200
So, enjoy it.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.630
ANDREW LITTELL: And
in my imagination,

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:06.290
you have a book of
like 500 book ideas

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:09.160
that you've been collecting
over the past 50 years.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.750
Is that accurate?

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.040
You just jot down some--

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:12.540
SIMON WINCHESTER: Sort of.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.331
There are all sorts of
things I want to do.

00:41:14.331 --> 00:41:16.820
And now, of course, I'm
just coming up to 70.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.950
There is the feeling
that, you know,

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:21.710
so many books to write and
not enough time to do them.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:22.240
ANDREW LITTELL: So little time.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.898
SIMON WINCHESTER:
But at least, I've

00:41:23.898 --> 00:41:25.885
got three or four sort
of waiting in the wings.

00:41:25.885 --> 00:41:26.410
ANDREW LITTELL: Yeah.

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:27.410
SIMON WINCHESTER:
The Pacific is next.

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.570
And that's what I'm
concentrating on now, yeah.

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:30.361
ANDREW LITTELL: OK.

00:41:30.361 --> 00:41:31.364
Great.

00:41:31.364 --> 00:41:32.780
So I would like
to point out one--

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.394
I have one part of your
book that I took issue with.

00:41:35.394 --> 00:41:36.560
SIMON WINCHESTER: Oh, right.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.480
ANDREW LITTELL: So we're here
at Google's New York office,

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.500
in the middle of Manhattan,
state-of-the-art building,

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:49.830
with sun-filled offices
and communal work spaces.

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:52.130
Does being here change
at all your view

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:55.040
of employees at
technology companies?

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.610
One of the last
lines of your book

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:58.870
is "The new pioneers
of unification

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:01.670
will be technical men,
hidden quietly out of sight

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.110
in their blue-lit
warehouses, surrounded

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:07.600
by silent frenzies of
blinking server lights."

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.480
And I'm not sure if we should be
flattered or offended by that.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.730
SIMON WINCHESTER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:13.150
I have been to
your establishment

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:14.085
a number of times now.

00:42:14.085 --> 00:42:15.710
I've eaten in your
wonderful cafeteria.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:17.710
I've ridden on your
Razor scooters.

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:19.000
I've been to Apple.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.580
I've been to-- yes.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:26.690
The place where the connections,
the connective tissue--

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:31.710
is-- of these cages of servers,
with these silent guardians,

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:35.530
in Mountain View,
and in Cupertino,

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:40.050
and in Council Bluffs,
Iowa-- those are the people

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:41.020
I'm writing about here.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.790
Not the creative
people like myself.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:43.610
So forgive me.

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:46.959
And in the paperback,
I'll amend it accordingly.

00:42:46.959 --> 00:42:47.750
ANDREW LITTELL: No.

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:49.420
No, need to.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.410
And, as we were talking
about before this,

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:53.750
I think there are a lot
of still open questions

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:56.410
that we're working to solve
here, not only here at Google,

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:57.970
but anybody working
in technology.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:00.650
And information is
a powerful thing.

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:02.150
SIMON WINCHESTER:
Well, if you think

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:03.940
my metrics are
impressive, I think

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.740
you metrics are astonishing.

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.240
ANDREW LITTELL:
Thank you very much.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.510
If anybody has any
questions from the audience,

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:11.770
feel free to ask them now.

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:18.624
AUDIENCE: As a historian, which
other historians from the past

00:43:18.624 --> 00:43:20.165
do you find particularly
interesting?

00:43:22.379 --> 00:43:23.920
SIMON WINCHESTER:
Well, oddly enough,

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.020
there's an English
historian, who probably you

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.520
won't be familiar with,
called Arthur Bryant,

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.240
who did a series of books,
the history of Britain

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.180
and the history of Europe,
in the 1930s and '40s.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:39.290
And became wildly popular
because he told history

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.200
through human stories.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.900
I mean I like
Mayhew, for instance,

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:46.930
who wrote the history of
London, once again through-- not

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:50.130
through so much through
theses or social movements,

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:53.710
but the history of ordinary
people, and told stories.

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:57.710
Narrative social history
is what I'm interested in.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:59.800
And those are the kind
of people that I like.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.710
But I mean of course,
David McCullough,

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:03.190
I think is absolutely wonderful.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:06.370
Plus, he drives the same kind
of Land Rover that I drove,

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:08.000
a nice old Land Rover.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.010
And he lives in Maine.

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:11.720
So he's a good guy, as
far as I'm concerned.

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.390
But he's the sort
of chap I like.

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:16.870
And Arthur Bryant,
in the past too.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:18.870
ANDREW LITTELL: Another
question I had is you've

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:21.380
written about all these
different periods in your book,

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:22.910
here in the US.

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:29.910
If you could return and live
during one of those ages,

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:31.461
do you have a favorite?

00:44:31.461 --> 00:44:32.710
SIMON WINCHESTER: I do really.

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:36.400
And expanding this
beyond the United States,

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:40.650
I love the time when there
were polymaths around,

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:44.660
people that knew
everything or that

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.980
had an interest in
just about everything

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.890
and a huge level of competence.

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:51.840
And my great hero
is James Murray,

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.910
the editor of "The Oxford
English Dictionary."

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:58.530
I mean he-- Latin, and Greek,
and chemistry, and physics,

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:02.440
and philosophy, the tendrils
rules of his imagination

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.940
spread everywhere.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:07.300
And there was such people in
the United States, of course.

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.050
I mean, Jefferson.

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:10.770
I mean, good god, I mean
what an amazing man Thomas

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:12.040
Jefferson was.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.590
So to live in a
period which fostered

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:18.140
the Jeffersons in
the James Murrays

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:21.680
suggests to me-- because
such people are now

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.010
either nonexistent,
or not revered,

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:26.934
or they're just jabbering on
the street corners in Manhattan.

00:45:26.934 --> 00:45:28.610
I don't know where they are.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:31.180
But I'd like to live
in a society-- I'm

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:32.930
very happy to live
nowadays-- but I

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:34.810
would like to
revisit a time when

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.760
such people were
cherished and revered.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.120
ANDREW LITTELL: Certainly.

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.110
Well, thank you very
much for your time.

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:40.940
SIMON WINCHESTER: Thank
you very much, indeed.

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:41.773
This has been great.

00:45:41.773 --> 00:45:43.480
Thank you.
