are working actively on the problems and
hopefully as I mentioned before have

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340
hopefully as I mentioned before have
 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.300
hopefully as I mentioned before have
brought forward solutions practical

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310

in a different industry I would have a
different subject certainly that I would

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490
different subject certainly that I would
 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.149
different subject certainly that I would
be focusing on but that's the area where

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159
be focusing on but that's the area where
 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.109

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420
are sustainable now when I see like in
 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.780
are sustainable now when I see like in
our case at one of the aspects which is

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790
our case at one of the aspects which is
 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.970
our case at one of the aspects which is
water which is being needed in order to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980
water which is being needed in order to
 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.259
water which is being needed in order to
produce the raw materials for our

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269

produce the raw materials for our
company if this is not sustainable then

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819
company if this is not sustainable then
 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.449
company if this is not sustainable then
my enterprise is not sustainable so

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459
my enterprise is not sustainable so
 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.860
my enterprise is not sustainable so
therefore I have to do something about

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870
therefore I have to do something about
 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.190
therefore I have to do something about
it

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200
it
 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.460
it
so shareholder interest and societal

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470
so shareholder interest and societal
 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.940
so shareholder interest and societal
