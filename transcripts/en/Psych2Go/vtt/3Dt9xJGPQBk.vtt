00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.140
Mental illness awareness has been high in 2017

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.860
as people open up about their personal battles.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.500
There's been so much progress, but we still have a far way to go.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.380
There's still a stigma surrounding different types of illnesses

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.880
and a long way to go in understanding them.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.480
Out of all the mental illnesses, personality disorders are the least talked about.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.680
Most people think of those who suffer from a personality disorder as crazy or dangerous.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.140
Today, we'll be shedding light on one personality disorder in particular:

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.200
BPD, or Boderline Personality Disorder

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.880
is a personality disorder marked by  unstable and insconsistent moods,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.720
behavior, and functioning.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.320
This often results in unstable relationships, impulsivity,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.940
anger, depression and anxiety.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.720
BPD is a personality disorder where you feel as though you lack control, creating frustration.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.100
It is though to be triggered by a traumatic event in early childhood,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.480
though there is no direct correlation.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.840
Researchers believe that those with BPD, due to a possible traumatic event,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.140
experience diferent structural changes in the part of the brain that controls emotions and impulses.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.280
However, it should be noted that this shows up in people who do not have BDP,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.360
Which makes BPD even more mysterious and unknown.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.620
BPD can be hard to detect as it so often overlaps with other mental illnesses.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.200
One might talk about depression,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.420
but not talk about or be aware of their other symptoms.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.940
This results in one being wrongfully diagnosed with depression and not BPD.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.700
The list of symptoms of BPD includes

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.000
frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment;

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.460
a pattern of intense and unstable relationships with family,

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.880
friends and loved ones,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.740
often swinging from extreme closeness and love or idealization,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.100
to extreme dislike or anger, or devaluation;

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.260
distorted and unstable self-image or sense of self;

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.820
impulse and often dangeous behaviors such as spending sprees,

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.100
unsafe sex, substance abuse, reckless driving and binge eating;

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.380
reoccuring suicidal beheaviors or threats or self harming behavior;

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.540
intense and highly changeable moods;

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.360
chronic feelings of emptiness;

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.040
innappropriate and intense anger or problems controlling anger;

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.160
stress-related paranoid thoughts;

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.060
severe dissociative symptoms such as feeling cut off from oneself,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.760
observing oneself from outside the body or losing touch with reality.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.740
Interpersonal relationships are quite difficult,

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.800
but DBT or Dialetical Behavior Therapy can offer skills to not only cope with,

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.260
but sucessfully live with BPD.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.480
Since its creation,

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.340
DBT has been used to help not only BPD,

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.720
but other mental illnesses as well.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.160
Boderline Personality Disorder is a personality disorder not much spoken about,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.820
as many are afraid of it,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.620
but it's important to remember that those with BPD

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.700
are still people,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.240
and deserve to be heard and loved.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.780
