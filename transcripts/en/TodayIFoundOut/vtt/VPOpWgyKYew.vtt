00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.600
Born in Cincinnati, Ohio on May 18, 1915,
John R. Fox grew up in Ohio before attending

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.030
Wilberforce University, an African American
college located in a town of the same name.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.080
He met his future wife, Arlene, there while
he studied biology and science.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.720
The couple moved to Brockton, Massachusetts
after getting married, where they had a daughter,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.720
Sandra.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.240
At the age of 26, Fox joined the U.S. Army
at the end of February 1941 and graduated

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.320
from Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia
in August, not long before the Japanese attack

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.559
on Pearl Harbor in December of that year forced
the United States to enter World War II.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.260
Three and a half years later, in December
of 1944, Lt. Fox found himself working as

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.190
a forward operator with the Cannon Company
of the 366th Infantry Regiment, the 92nd Infantry

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.070
Division.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.670
He was stationed with his unit in the town
of Sommocolonia, Italy when German soldiers

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.030
disguised as civilians snuck into the town
on Christmas Day.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.670
The German attack from the outside began at
4:00 am the morning of December 26th.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.520
As for the enemy soldiers who’d infiltrated
the town the day before, they bolstered the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.800
attack and, combined, the two groups managed
to quickly overwhelming the American soldiers.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.110
However, when the outnumbered American soldiers
began their hasty retreat, Lt. Fox volunteered,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.400
along with a few Italian soldiers, to remain
behind as eyes and ears in the town.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.120
Fox’s job was to direct the artillery stationed
outside the town against the German troops

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.500
with the hope that it would slow their advance
long enough to allow for a safe retreat, and

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.610
re-formation outside of town.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.980
So while the American soldiers retreated,
Lt. Fox stationed himself on the second floor

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.030
of a building in a spot that allowed him to
see the approaching enemy.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.790
As the day, and the enemy soldiers, progressed,
Fox called for the artillery to aim shells

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.840
closer and closer to his position, matching
the German advance.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.840
Finally, just before noon on December 26th,
Fox radioed into the Cannon Company’s command

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.680
post with the request that the artillery be
aimed squarely at his position.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.770
The soldier manning the radio, Lt. Otis Zachary,
and his commanding officer then asked Fox

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.860
if he knew this strike would destroy Fox’s
position.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.620
Fox’s reply was, “Fire it!”

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.460
Lt. Zachary then ordered the artillery to
“Converge, sheath.”

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.740
That instructed the soldiers manning the artillery
to direct their fire in a line, “walking”

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.900
it toward Fox’s position until they converged
on his building.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.829
Zachary later said: “That was with high
explosive [shells], and that’s the last

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.780
I heard of John Fox.”

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.120
In the end, the attack forced the Germans
to delay their advance through the town.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.450
The American soldiers then had time to reorganize
and launch a full-scale counterattack that

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.349
allowed them to retake the town from German
control.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.760
When the soldiers went to recover Lt. Fox’s
body and the eight Italian soldiers who’d

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.349
been killed as well, they also found the bodies
of about 100 German soldiers around the wreckage.

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.920
For this selfless act of bravery, Lt. Fox’s
commanding officer nominated him for Distinguished

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.920
Service Cross.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.180
However, the United States military overlooked
his sacrifice, much like they overlooked the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.900
contributions of many other African American
soldiers during World War II.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.280
For instance, the U.S. military awarded the
Medal of Honor—the highest honor that can

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.049
be awarded to a serviceman or –woman—a
total of 464 times due to the conflict in

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.299
World War II with 324 being awarded to soldiers
in the Army.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.225
None of those soldiers were African American,
and the racial bias continued with other awards.

00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:15.620
The awards eventually trickled in for Fox
though.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.870
In 1982, some 38 years after being nominated,
he was finally awarded the Distinguished Service

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.870
Cross.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.069
Next up, research conducted by Shaw University
in North Carolina, commissioned by the U.S.

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.019
Army, worked to uncover whether or not African
American soldiers had been unfairly denied

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.019
the Medal of Honor.

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.030
The results were that, “Shaw’s team…
recommended the Army consider a group of 10

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.279
soldiers for the Medal of Honor.”

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:39.569
Lt. Fox was among those soldiers recommended,
seven of which were ultimately chosen, and

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.260
six of which were posthumously awarded the
medal by President Bill Clinton in 1997.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.969
(One, Vernon Baker, was still alive to accept
his award in person.)

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:54.360
As for Fox, his medal was accepted by his
widow, Arlene Marrow.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.680
Captain America may have jumped on a fake
grenade to save his fellow soldiers in training,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.769
but in real life Lance Corporal William Kyle
Carpenter actually did this… only the grenade

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.489
was real.

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.370
On November 21, 2010 while in Afghanistan,
a grenade was thrown into his sandbagged position.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.260
Rather than run, he used his own body to shield
the single other soldier with him from the

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.260
blast.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.520
Miraculously, though severely injured, Carpenter
lived and was awarded the Medal of Honor in

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:30.700
June 
of 2014.
