00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:02.570
RYAN LOREN: So Abiah, welcome.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.400
ABIAH: Thank you very much.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.150
RYAN LOREN: It's so
good to have you here.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.119
I'm really looking
forward to this evening.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.260
It's going to be great.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.510
ABIAH: I'm excited to be here.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.070
RYAN LOREN: Excellent.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.800
So the first thing I
wanted to talk about

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.549
is just give us a
little bit of background

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.760
on how you came up and
started your music career

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.970
and what your influences
were growing up.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.370
ABIAH: I started singing when
I was about nine years old.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.580
And I come from a
slightly musical family.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.210
My mother was a pianist for
the late opera singer William

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.759
Warfield.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.670
So I grew up around
classical music,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.860
and obviously, I grew up,
I used to go to church,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.050
and I started in the choir.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.090
But when I was about
nine years old,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.520
I heard Anita Baker
sing "Sweet Love,"

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.420
and I fell in love with her
voice, but also with music,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.120
at the moment.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.540
So I started writing feverishly.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.520
I would even fake sick to stay
home and try to write songs.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.500
And within a year, I had
written a whole album of songs,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.390
and I was writing and
writing and writing.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.490
By 12, I probably
wrote 100 songs.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.460
And so I had the bug very early.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.630
RYAN LOREN: That's great.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.110
When I stayed home from school,
I was not doing these things.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.130
Playing video
games, and you know.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.200
So that's great.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.510
You got the passion
from a very early age

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.710
ABIAH: Absolutely.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.500
RYAN LOREN: So can you talk to
me about your writing process?

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.480
Is it the same every
time, or do you-- how does

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.280
it evolve for you?

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.680
ABIAH: Honestly, I think
because I started so young,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.220
the craft was being honed
at a very young age.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.810
Obviously went
through high school,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.940
I went to performing
arts high school,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.160
the same school that Taye Diggs
attended, and Tweet the singer.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.780
And so, I had this
really wonderful process

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.710
of people around me.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.010
But for me, writing, music
comes to me pretty whole,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.150
it's very through composed.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.430
So when I get a song, usually
the lyrics, the melody,

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.370
the whole arrangement
comes at one time.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.210
RYAN LOREN: OK.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.970
And that leads me
to my next question.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.350
Was your album, "Life is a
Ballad," from what I recall,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.930
it was written and
done and recorded

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.560
in a very short period of time.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.330
ABIAH: Yes, I wrote the
songs, majority of them,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.340
within two weeks
of the recording,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.710
and recorded the whole
record in one day.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.630
RYAN LOREN: OK.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.060
If you wouldn't
mind, I would like

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.210
to recite a few lyrics of yours.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.480
ABIAH: Sure.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.930
RYAN LOREN: So here we go.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.930
It's not the same.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.910
Every day whispers your name.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.450
Since you've been gone,
the wind stops moving.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.960
Now that you're gone,
it's a barren place.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.450
Since you've been gone,
my heart is silent.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.940
Life is a ballad,
the saddest song.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.270
So if I had to guess, you've
been through some things,

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.500
you know.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.960
But tell me where the title
of the album came from,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.330
and also what inspired you to
write this particular song.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.910
Because I find it gorgeous.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.240
Like, it's hard for me to
even keep a straight face

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.980
while reading that
because I want to tear up.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.350
But it's beautiful, and I just
wanted to ask you about that.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.959
ABIAH: I appreciate that.

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.000
"Life is a Ballad," the
title actually came to me

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.724
about four years ago.

00:03:09.724 --> 00:03:11.140
So even before I
wrote the record,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.590
I had the title for the record.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.173
I knew what it was
going to be called,

00:03:14.173 --> 00:03:18.100
but I didn't have the song
yet, that one particular song.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.950
But just before Oprah
Winfrey went off the network,

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.980
I was watching her show,
and it was around the time

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.870
that Steve Irwin, the
crocodile hunter had died.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.750
He was killed by the stingray.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.730
And his wife and his
children were on there

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.230
and they were crying.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.650
And the wife said, ever since he
left, the wind stopped moving.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.750
And it touched me very deeply.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.675
And the song just started
pouring out of me,

00:03:43.675 --> 00:03:46.290
and I really like 15 minutes.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.080
I was waiting for the
inspiration of the title,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.290
and it made perfect
sense at that moment.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.540
RYAN LOREN: That's great.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.670
So when you write, it's not
only from your own experiences.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.545
Is that true?

00:03:56.545 --> 00:03:59.870
ABIAH: Yeah, "Life is a Ballad"
is unlike my first album.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.920
This album was really
not so autobiographical.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.901
Only two songs are my real
life stories, "Foolish Heart"

00:04:05.901 --> 00:04:07.650
and "Turn the Light
On," which is, I know,

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.320
one of your favorites.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.070
But the rest of the
record was really

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.530
about me just
being a storyteller

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.430
and telling stories.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.320
I mean, when you
have great friends

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.790
and you experience
people's stories

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.480
through their own heart, I
think, their own experiences,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.690
it can inspire you.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.930
And I happen to be
drawn to melancholy.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.550
Even when I'm in the
happiest moments of my life,

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.790
for some reason I can always
write from a very sad place.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.021
But in the midst of that, I
think there's always hope.

00:04:33.021 --> 00:04:35.020
RYAN LOREN: Yeah, I think
that's a common thread

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.811
throughout the whole
album for those of you

00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:41.350
who haven't listened to it,
and I would suggest you should.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.890
OK, so a couple of
things before we wrap up.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.790
I know you do vocal coaching--

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.290
ABIAH: I do.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.980
RYAN LOREN: --as well.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.360
Just real quick, what's
one of the challenges

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.670
you face with that, and
what's one thing you like

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.810
a lot about it, to
both sides of that?

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.550
ABIAH: The first
part is that people

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.560
come in a lot of times
with the wrong expectation.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.670
I think we live in a
very microwave society,

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.730
and people want quick
results like that.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.660
But someone like me, people come
to me because of my reputation

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.470
as a singer.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.780
But I put years into my
craft of working on it

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.170
and making sure that I'm a
singer worthy of the calling.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.310
And so, when people
come in and they say,

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.800
oh, I want to
sound like Beyonce.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.950
Well, there's only one Beyonce.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.970
And you may not
have that talent,

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.612
but let's see what we can
do by sculpting and working

00:05:32.612 --> 00:05:34.320
on the craft to be
the best thing that we

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.110
can be based on what
God has given us.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.390
But what I love about
it is the process.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.050
I think that if someone
is patient and willing

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.900
to be vulnerable and do the
homework, meaning study,

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.010
I think that it's an incredible
experience to watch people.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.385
Even the singer,
Kimberly Nicole,

00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:54.330
who's performing tonight,
she's someone that I coach.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.470
And to see her who's a bit
more seasoned as a singer,

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.469
and to be able to add to what
she does, is a real person.

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:02.510
RYAN LOREN: That's great.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.060
I'm going to have to
disagree with one thing.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.380
I sound a lot like Beyonce.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.121
ABIAH: Oh really?

00:06:07.121 --> 00:06:09.560
That's your shower voice.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.310
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.260
So I want to play a
game with you real fast.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.110
It's called Bob Dylan
or Backstreet Boys.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.000
If you could just tell
me, is this Bob Dylan

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.941
or Backstreet Boys?

00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:19.440
OK.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.730
If not for you, babe, I
couldn't find the door.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.840
Couldn't even see the floor.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.720
I'd be said and
blue if not for you.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.940
Bob Dylan, or Backstreet Boys?

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.140
ABIAH: Backstreet Boys.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.830
RYAN LOREN: Bob Dylan.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.410
No.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.310
It's a tough one.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.150
I think this these
very, very well.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.650
OK.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.100
So--

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.891
ABIAH: Yes you did.

00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:41.670
RYAN LOREN: Tell us, levity
aside, what's next for you

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.910
after Life is a Ballad?

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.570
ABIAH: So already, based on the
response of "Life is a Ballad,"

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.780
I've decided to record
a new record already.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.490
So I'm going to go in the studio
probably within the next four

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.870
to six weeks and knock
out a new record.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.439
Yeah, so that's
what's on the plate,

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:59.730
and I'm really excited about it

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.200
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.180
Well, thanks so
much for being here.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.050
ABIAH: Thank you, Ryan.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.258
RYAN LOREN: Yeah, definitely.

00:07:03.258 --> 00:07:04.130
Cool.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.980
ABIAH: Thank you.
