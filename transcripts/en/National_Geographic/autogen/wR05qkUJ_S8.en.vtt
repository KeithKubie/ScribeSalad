to have inbred lines here in the future
 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.250
to have inbred lines here in the future
because the more inbred there are the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260
because the more inbred there are the
 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.230

obviously the first is they bite and

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780
obviously the first is they bite and
 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.900
obviously the first is they bite and
they can they can kill you so you have

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910
they can they can kill you so you have
 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.910
they can they can kill you so you have
to develop a technique where you can

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920
to develop a technique where you can
 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.100
to develop a technique where you can

work with them with the least amount of
 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.540
work with them with the least amount of
stress because you don't want stress on

stress because you don't want stress on
 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.970
stress because you don't want stress on
these animals so we developing various

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980
these animals so we developing various
 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.830
these animals so we developing various

from artificial insemination and it's a
 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.899
from artificial insemination and it's a
case of sticking with it and actually
