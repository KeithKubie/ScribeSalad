00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.290
funding for this program is provided by

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:15.290
additional funding provided by

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.859
today we turn to John Locke

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.270
on the face of it

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.180
Locke is a powerful ally

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.420
of the libertarian

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.710
first

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.040
he believes,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.940
as libertarians today maintain

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.930
that there are certain fundamental individual
rights

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.520
that are so important

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.690
that no government

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.670
even a representative government even a
democratically elected government

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.440
can override them.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.110
not only that

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.090
he believes

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.159
that those fundamental rights include

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.200
a natural right

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.290
to life liberty and property

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.240
and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.160
furthermore he argues

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.050
that the right to property

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.350
is not just the creation

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.000
of government

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.520
or of law

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.860
the right to property is a natural right

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.760
in the sense that

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.550
it is pre-political

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.510
it is a right

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.390
that attaches  to individuals

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.549
as human beings

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.630
even before government comes on the scene

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.289
even before parliaments and legislatures enact
laws to define rights

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.479
and to enforce them

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.609
Locke says in order to think about

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.789
what it means to have a natural right

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:17.980
we have to imagine

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.429
the way things are

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:24.199
before government

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.450
before law

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.139
and that's what Locke means

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.039
by the state of nature.

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:38.039
he says the state of nature is the state of
liberty

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.709
human beings are free and equal beings

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.569
there is no natural hierarchy

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.459
it's not the case that some people are born
to be kings and others were born to be

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.589
serfs

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:57.119
we're free and equal in the state of nature

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:59.109
and yet

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.779
he makes the point

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:04.719
but there's a difference between a state of
liberty and the state of

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:08.959
license

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.659
and the reason is that even in the state of
nature there is a kind of the law it's not

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.469
the kind of law the legislatures enact

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.889
it's the law of nature

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.379
and this law of nature

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.900
constrains

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.469
what we can do

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:25.819
even though we're free

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.989
even though we're in the state of nature

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.329
well what are the constraints?

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.979
the only constraint

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:39.029
given by the laws of nature

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:40.639
is that

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.069
the rights we have

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.509
the national rights we have

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:49.430
we can't give up

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.759
nor can we take them from somebody else

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:55.569
under the law of nature I'm not free

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.299
take somebody else's

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.699
life or liberty

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.839
or property

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:04.230
nor am I

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.829
free

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.409
to take my own

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.029
life liberty or property

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:14.059
even though I'm free,

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:15.229
I'm not free

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:18.419
to violate the laws of nature, I'm not free
to

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.699
take my own life

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.569
or to sell myself into slavery

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:24.240
or to give to somebody else

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.030
arbitrary absolute power

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.619
over me

00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:30.789
so where does this constraint

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:37.219
you may think it's a fairly minimal constraint,
but where does it come from?

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:40.299
Well Locke tells us where it comes from

00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:43.490
and he gives two answers 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.669
here's the first answer

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.129
for men

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.029
being all the workmanship

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.830
of one

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.050
omnipotent and infinitely wise maker,
namely God,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.149
they're his property

00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:03.189
whose workmanship they are, made to last during his,

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.909
not one another's pleasure.

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.909
so one answer the question is why can't I
give up my

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.889
natural rights to life liberty and property

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.969
well they're not strictly speaking yours

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:20.319
after all

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.460
you are

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.089
the creature of God.

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:26.220
God has a 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.120
bigger property right in us

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.449
a prior priority right

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.189
now you might say that

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:38.219
an unsatisfying unconvincing answer at least
for those who don't believe in God

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:41.430
what did Locke have to say to them

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.780
well here's where Locke appeals to the idea

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.160
of reason

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.939
and this is the idea

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:52.030
that if we properly reflect

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.939
on what it means to be free

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:57.180
we will be lead to the conclusion

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.499
that freedom can't just be a matter of doing
whatever we want

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:04.520
I think this is what Locke means

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.169
when he says

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.240
the state of nature has a law of nature to govern it
which obliges everyone

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.770
and reason

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.569
which is that law

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.780
teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that
being all equal and independent

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.839
no one ought to harm another in his life health
liberty for possessions

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:26.770
this leads

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.199
to a puzzling paradoxical

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.529
feature to Locke's account of rights

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:36.479
familiar in one sense

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.930
but strange in another

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.719
it's the idea

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:44.199
that out natural rights are inalienable

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.990
what does unalienable mean?

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.930
it's not for us to alienate them or to get them
up to give them a way to trade them the way

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.599
to sell them

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:54.169
consider an airline ticket

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.389
airline tickets are nontransferable

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.889
or tickets to the patriots or to the red
sox

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.810
nontransferable tickets

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.259
are unalienable

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.739
I own them

00:07:07.739 --> 00:07:09.340
in the limited sense

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.180
that I can use them for myself but I can't
trade them away

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.609
so in one sense an unalienable right,
a  nontransferable right

00:07:18.609 --> 00:07:21.630
makes something I own

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.620
less

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.589
fully mine

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:27.789
but in another sense

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:29.370
of unalienable

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.580
rights

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:37.039
especially where we're thinking about life liberty
and property

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:42.520
for a right to be unalienable, makes it
more deeply more profoundly mine

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.150
and that's Locke's

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.250
sense

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.469
of unalienable

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:51.520
we see it in the American declaration of independence
Thomas Jefferson

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.469
drew on this idea of Locke

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:56.050
unalienable rights

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.650
to life liberty

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.949
and as Jefferson amended Locke,

00:07:59.949 --> 00:08:04.889
to the pursuit of happiness. unalienable rights

00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:08.139
rights that are so

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:11.479
essentially mine

00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:17.520
that even I can't trade them away or give
them up

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.030
so these are the rights we have in the state of 
nature

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.089
before there is any government

00:08:24.089 --> 00:08:29.379
in the case of life and liberty I can't take
my own life I can't sell myself into slavery

00:08:29.379 --> 00:08:36.379
anymore than I can take somebody else's life
or take someone else as a slave by force

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.360
but how does that work in the case of property?

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.590
because it's essential to Locke's case

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.020
that private property

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.350
can arise

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.850
even before there is any government

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.580
how can there be a right to private property

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.830
even before there is any

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.440
government?

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.730
Locke's famous answer

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.330
comes in section twenty seven

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.290
every man has a property in his own person

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.780
this nobody has any right to but himself

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.660
the labor of his body

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.650
the work of his hands

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.260
we may say are properly his

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.230
so he moves

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.270
as the libertarians later of would move

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.980
from the idea

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.180
that we own ourselves

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.250
that we have property in our persons

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.080
to the closely connected idea that we own
our own labor

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.610
and from that

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.710
to the further claim

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.330
that whatever we mix our labor with

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.870
is unowned

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.350
becomes our property

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.180
whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature 
has provided, and left it in,

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:58.400
he has mixed his labor with, and joined to it  
something that is his own,

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.540
and thereby makes it his property

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.750
why?

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.180
because the labor

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.520
is the questionable property of the laborer

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.860
and therefore 

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.310
no one

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.610
but the laborer can have a right

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:18.320
to what is joined to or mixed with

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.820
his labor

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.400
and then he adds this important provision

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.350
at least where there is enough and as good
left in common

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:29.470
for others.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.550
but we not only

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.700
acquire our property in the fruits of the
earth

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.470
in the deer that we hunt

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.750
in the fish that we catch

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.890
but also

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:48.350
if we till and plow and enclose the land 
and grow potatoes

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.260
we own not only the potatoes

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.610
but the land

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.800
the earth

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:59.870
as much land as a man tills, plants, improves,
cultivates, and can use

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.430
the product of, so much is his property.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.490
he by his labor

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:11.820
encloses it from the commons. so

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:17.870
the idea is that rights are unalienable seems to
distance Locke from a libertarian

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:18.410
libertarian

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.090
wants to say we have

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.670
an absolute property rate in our selves

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.400
and therefore we can do with ourselves whatever
we want

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.920
Locke is not a sturdy ally for that view

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.120
in fact he says if you take 

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.450
natural rights seriously you'll be led to the
idea that there are certain

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:41.720
constraints on what we can do with our natural
rights, constraints given

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.080
either by God

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:50.080
or by reason reflecting on what it means
really to be free and really to be free

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.220
means recognizing

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.950
that our rights are unalienable

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.390
so here's the difference between Locke and
the libertarians but

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:58.369
when it comes

00:11:58.369 --> 00:12:01.830
the Locke's account of private property

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.770
he begins to look again

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.270
like a pretty good ally

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.640
because he's argument for private property

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.960
begins with the idea that we are the proprietors
of our own person

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.540
and therefore of our labor and there of the
fruits of our labor

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.900
including not only the things

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.000
we gather

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.550
and hunt

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.380
in the state of nature

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:34.140
but also we acquire a property right in the
land that we enclosed and cultivate and improve

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.190
there are some examples that can bring out
the

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:40.420
the moral intuition

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.140
that our labor

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.490
can take something that is unowned

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.050
and make it ours

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:54.180
though sometimes there are disputes about this

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.400
there's a debate among

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.050
rich countries and developing countries

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:04.350
about trade related intellectual property
rights

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.839
it came to a head recently

00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:09.160
over drug patent laws

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.830
western countries and especially the united states
say

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.920
we have a big pharmaceutical industry that develops 

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.030
new drugs

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.750
we want

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.540
all countries in the world

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.030
to agree

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:25.000
to respect the patents

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.010
then there came along the aids crisis
in south Africa

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.960
and the American

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.080
aids drugs

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.270
were hugely expensive

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.440
far more than could be afforded by most Africans

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.520
so the south African government said

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.910
we're going to begin

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.190
to buy a generic version

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.270
of the AIDS

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.970
antiretroviral drug

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.970
at a tiny fraction of the cost

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.000
because we can find an Indian manufacturing

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.690
company

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.440
that figures out how the thing is made

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.440
and

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.630
produces it

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.949
and for a tiny fraction of the cost we can
save lives if we

00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:09.040
don't respect that patent

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.380
and then the American government said

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.959
no here's a company

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:16.730
that invested research

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.200
and created this

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.080
drug

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.090
you can just

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:22.710
start mass-producing 

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:23.960
these drugs

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.649
without paying the licensing fee

00:14:25.649 --> 00:14:30.380
so there was a dispute

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:36.660
the US and the pharmaceutical companies sued the
south African government to try to prevent

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.050
their buying the cheap

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:38.730
generic

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:39.800
this they saw it,

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.670
pirated version

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.070
of an aids drug

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.750
and eventually

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.130
the pharmaceutical industry gave in

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:49.649
and said

00:14:49.649 --> 00:14:53.800
all right you can do that but this dispute
about what the rules

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.460
of property

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.130
should be of intellectual property

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.490
of drug patenting

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:01.499
in a way

00:15:01.499 --> 00:15:04.930
is the last frontier of the state of
nature

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.810
because among nations where there is no uniform
law

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.270
of patent rights and property rights

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.070
it's up for grabs

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.490
until by some act of consent

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.220
some international agreement

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.820
people enter into

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.620
some settled

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.410
rules.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:27.880
what about

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.270
Locke's account of

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.870
private property

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.950
and how it can arise

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:36.350
before government and before law comes on
the scene

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.900
is it successful?

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.430
how many think

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:46.590
it's pretty persuasive?

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:47.850
how many

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.790
don't find it persuasive?

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:53.530
now let's hear from some critics

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.150
what is wrong with Locke's account

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.210
of how private property can arise

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:03.230
without consent

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.759
I think it's justifies

00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:08.680
European cultural norms as far as you look at

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.919
how native Americans may not cultivated American
land

00:16:11.919 --> 00:16:14.190
by their arrival

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:14.759
in the America's 

00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:16.800
that

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.720
that contributed to the development of America
which would have otherwise necessarily happened

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.840
then or by that specific group

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.430
so you think that this defense this
defense of private property in land

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:32.109
yes because it complicate original acquisitions
if you

00:16:32.109 --> 00:16:34.410
only site the arrival of

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.580
foreigners that cultivated the land

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.430
I see, and what's your name?

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.830
Rachelle

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.390
Rachelle? Rachelle says this account of how property

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.060
arises

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.020
would fit

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.550
what was going on

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.270
in north America

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.780
during the time of the

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.290
settlement, the European settlement

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:57.689
do you think

00:16:57.689 --> 00:17:00.050
Rochelle, that it's 

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.880
it's a way of defending

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.590
the appropriation of the land

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:05.949
indeed, because he is 

00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:08.250
also

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.850
you know, justifying the glorious revolution, so
I don't think it's inconceivable

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:13.230
that he's also

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.980
justifying colonization as well

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.950
well that's an interesting

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.230
historical suggestion

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.790
and I think there's a lot to be said for it

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:27.520
what do you think of the validity of his argument though?

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.770
because if you're right

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:33.620
that this would justify the taking of land
in north America

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:38.030
from native Americans who didn't enclose it,

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.190
if it's a good argument

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:44.360
then Locke's given us a justification for that
if it's a bad argument

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.620
then Locke's given us

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.139
a mere rationalization

00:17:48.139 --> 00:17:51.730
it is morally indefensible

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:57.470
I'm leaning to the second one. You're leaning 
to the second one, but that's my opinion as well

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:58.960
alright

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.040
let's hear

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.750
if there's a defender of  Locke’s account
of private property

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:10.270
and it would be interesting if they could
address Rachelle's

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.140
worried that this is just a way of defending
the

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.990
the appropriation of land by the American colonists

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.790
from the native Americans who didn't 
enclose it

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.740
is there someone who will defend Locke

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:27.510
on that point?

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.510
you're ready are you going to defend Locke?

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:34.110
but you're you're accusing him of justifying
the European basically massacre of the native

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.850
Americans

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:39.350
but who says he's defending it maybe the European
colonization isn't right

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:45.540
you know maybe it's the state of war that
he talked about in his second treatise, you know

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.179
so the war is between the native Americans

00:18:49.179 --> 00:18:50.520
and the

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.410
colonists, the settlers

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.520
that might have been a state of war

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.490
that we can only emerged from

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.980
by an agreement or an act of consent

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:04.010
and that's what would have been required

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:08.280
yeah and both sides would have to agree to
and carry out and everything

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.380
but what about

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.360
and what's your name? Dan.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.360
Dan, what about

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.369
Rachelle's says

00:19:14.369 --> 00:19:15.810
this argument

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:19.600
in section twenty seven and then in thirty
two

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.460
about appropriating land

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.210
that argument if it's valid would justify

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.669
the settlers

00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:31.260
appropriating that land and excluding

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.370
others from it

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.590
you think that argument’s a good argument?

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:41.590
well does it kind of imply that the native
Americans hadn't already done that?

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:47.100
well the native Americans as hunter gatherers
didn't actually enclose

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.760
enclose land so I think Rochelle

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.210
is on to something there

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.140
what I wanted

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:53.920
I

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:59.160
go ahead Dan. At the same time he's saying that just by
picking an acorn or taking a apple or

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.200
maybe killing of buffalo on a certain amount
of land

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.690
that makes it yours because it's your labor and
that's your labor would enclose that land

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:07.550
so

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.270
by that definition maybe they didn't have fences

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.470
around

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:12.820
little plots of land but didn't

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.889
they were using it

00:20:13.889 --> 00:20:17.040
so by Locke's definitions, so maybe by Locke's
definition

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.850
the native Americans could have claimed a property
rights

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.539
in the land itself but they just didn't
have Locke on their side

00:20:23.539 --> 00:20:24.710
as she points out. good

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.000
okay that's good

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.169
One more defender of Locke

00:20:31.169 --> 00:20:35.240
well I mean just to defend Locke, he does say 
there are

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:40.110
some times in which you can't take another person's
land for example you can't acquire land

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:44.650
that is common property to people and in terms of 
American Indians I feel like they already have

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.140
civilizations themselves

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.670
and they were using land in common so it's kind 
of like

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.140
an analogy to what he was talking about
with like the 

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.310
common English property

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:57.830
you can't take land that everyone has in common.
That's very interesting

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:59.150
and you can't take land

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:03.700
unless you make sure that there's as much
land as possible enough for other people take as

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.790
well

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:06.430
so if you're taking common, 

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.620
so you have to make sure whenever you take land or

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.890
that there's enough let for other people to use

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:15.740
that's just as good as the land that you took

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.760
That's true, Locke says there has to be this

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.660
right to private property in the earth is
subject

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:25.130
to the provision that there be as much and as good 
left for others

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.380
what's your name. I'm Fang

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:31.690
So Fang in a way agrees with Dan that maybe
there is a claim within Locke's framework

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.770
that could be developed

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:38.830
on behalf of the native Americans

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:42.580
here's the further question,

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:48.320
if the right to private property is natural
not conventional,

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.409
if it's something

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:54.620
that we acquire even before we agree to
government

00:21:54.620 --> 00:22:01.620
how does that right constrain what the legitimate
government can do

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.400
in order for finally to see,

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.150
whether Locke is an ally

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.750
or potentially

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.040
a critic

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.320
of the libertarian idea

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.990
of the state

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.860
we have to ask what becomes of our natural
rights

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.400
once we enter into society

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:28.840
we know that the way we enter into society
is by consent by agreement

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.230
to leave the state of nature and to be governed
by the majority

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.520
and by a system of laws, human laws

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.420
but those human laws

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:44.060
our only legitimate

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.880
if they respect

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.410
our natural rights

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.340
if they respect

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:54.799
our inalienable rights to life liberty
and property

00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:56.059
No

00:22:56.059 --> 00:22:57.620
parliament

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.490
no legislature

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.000
however democratic

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.320
its credentials

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.640
can legitimately

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.870
violate

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:09.840
our natural rights.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.560
this idea

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.740
that no law can violate our right

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:19.140
to life liberty and property would seem

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.510
to support

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:25.190
the idea of a government so limited

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:28.320
that it would gladden the heart of the libertarian

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.210
after all

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:31.860
but

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:35.420
those hearts should not be so quickly gladdened

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.800
because even though

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.890
for Locke

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.120
the law of nature persists

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.790
once government arrived

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.520
even though Locke

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.789
insists on limited government

00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:49.990
government limited

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.389
by the end for which it was created

00:23:52.389 --> 00:23:54.330
namely the preservation of property

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:55.650
even so

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:57.429
there's an important sense

00:23:57.429 --> 00:23:58.180
in which

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.570
what counts as my property

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.970
what counts

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:05.320
as respecting

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.200
my life and liberty

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.990
are for the government

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:15.330
to define

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.970
that there be property

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.120
that there be respect

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.250
for life and liberty

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.970
is what limits government

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:31.020
but what counts

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.790
as respecting my life

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:38.120
and respecting my property

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.260
that is for governments

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.020
to decide and define

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.820
how can that be

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.260
is Locke contradicting himself

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:54.060
or is there an important distinction

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:59.900
here in order to answer that question which will
decide Locke's fit with the libertarian view

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.659
we need to look closely

00:25:01.659 --> 00:25:03.710
at what legitimate government

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:04.990
looks like for Locke,

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:11.990
and we turn to that next time.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.510
Nikola, if you didn't think you'd get caught

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:24.040
would you pay your taxes

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.390
umm, I don't think so

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:27.610
I would rather

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.679
have a system personally

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:33.970
that I could give money to exactly those

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:39.430
sections of the government that I support and
not just blanket support everything.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:46.430
you'd rather be in the state of nature at least 
on April fifteenth

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.890
last time

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:54.890
we began

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:58.470
to discuss Locke's state of nature

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:02.830
his account of private property

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:05.370
his theory of legitimate government

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:12.330
which is government based on consent and also
limited government

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:17.560
Locke believes in certain fundamental rights
that constrain what government can do

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.740
and he believes that those rights are natural
rights

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.020
not rights that flow

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.320
from law

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.169
or from government

00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:31.070
and so Locke's great

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.590
philosophical experiment is to see if he can
give an account

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.190
of how there could be

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:38.950
 aright of private property

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:42.020
without consent,

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.660
before government

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:48.310
and legislators arrive on the scene to define
property

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.419
that's his question

00:26:49.419 --> 00:26:50.980
that's his claim.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.320
there is a way,

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.240
Locke argues,

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.740
to create

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:55.450
property,

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:58.290
not just in the things we gather and hunt

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:01.270
but in the land itself

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:01.960
provided

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.520
there is enough and it's good enough for others

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.710
today I want to turn

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.190
to the question

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.510
of consent

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.970
which is Locke’s second big idea, private
property is one

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:14.529
consent

00:27:14.529 --> 00:27:19.159
is the other

00:27:19.159 --> 00:27:23.930
what is the work of consent

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:24.850
people here

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:27.560
have been invoking the idea of consent

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.800
since we began

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.090
since the first week you remember when we
were talking about

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.420
pushing the fat man off the bridge someone said
but he didn't agree

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.690
to sacrifice himself

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.880
it would be different if he consented

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.620
or when we were talking about the cabin
boy

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.070
killing and eating the cabin boy

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:53.540
some people said well if they had consented
to a lottery it would be different then it

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.390
would be all right

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:58.120
so consent has come up a lot

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.140
and here in John Locke

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.370
we have one of the great

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:02.780
philosophers

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.170
of consent

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:11.420
consent is an obvious, familiar idea in moral
and political philosophy

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.130
Locke says that

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:17.220
legitimate government is government founded
on consent and who nowadays would disagree

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.429
with him?

00:28:20.429 --> 00:28:25.649
sometimes when ideas of political philosophies
are as familiar as Locke’s

00:28:25.649 --> 00:28:28.659
ideas about consent

00:28:28.659 --> 00:28:33.000
it's hard to make sense of them or at
least to find them very interesting

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.120
but there are some puzzles some strange features

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:43.490
of Locke’s account of consent as the basis of
legitimate government

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:47.960
and that's what I’d like to take up today

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.440
one way of

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.840
testing

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.000
the possibility of Locke's idea of consent

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.950
and also probing some of its perplexities,

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.260
is to ask just what a legitimate government

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.740
founded and consent

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:07.610
can do

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:11.500
what are its powers according to Locke,

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.620
well in order to answer that question

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.269
it helps

00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:17.990
to

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:21.690
remember what the state of nature is like.

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:25.460
remember the state of nature is the condition

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:28.230
that we decide to leave

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.750
and that's what gives rise to consent

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:36.669
why not stay there why bother with government
at all?

00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:39.150
well, what's Locke's to answer to that question

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.510
he says there's some inconveniences

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:45.330
in the state of nature but what are those
inconveniences?

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:49.680
the main inconveniences is

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.420
that everyone

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.060
can enforce the law of nature

00:29:55.060 --> 00:30:00.039
everyone is an enforcer or what Locke calls the
executor

00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:02.950
of the state of nature

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:06.330
and he means executor literally

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:10.750
if someone violates the law of nature

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.929
he's an aggressor

00:30:13.929 --> 00:30:16.690
he's beyond reason

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:20.769
and you can punish him

00:30:20.769 --> 00:30:23.500
and you don't have to be too careful or fine

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.830
about gradations of punishment

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:28.100
in the state of nature you can kill him

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:33.720
you can certainly kill someone who comes after
you

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.090
tries to murder you

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:37.350
that's self-defense

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:42.010
but the enforcement power the right to punish
everyone can do the punishing in the state of

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:43.420
nature

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:48.130
and not only can you punish with death people
who come after you

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:48.740
seeking

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.000
to take your life

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.260
you can also punish a thief who tries to steal
your goods because

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.490
that also counts as aggression against

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:01.460
the law of nature

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.480
if someone has stolen

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.700
from a third party

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.680
you can go after him

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.890
why is this

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:14.350
well violations of the law of nature are an
act of aggression

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.630
there's no police force there are no judges,

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:18.539
no juries

00:31:18.539 --> 00:31:24.570
so everyone is the judge in his or
her own case

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:28.980
and Locke observes that when people are
the judges of their own cases they tend to

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:33.280
get carried away

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.240
and

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.620
this gives rise to the inconvenience in the
state of nature

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:44.240
people over shoot the mark there's aggression there's
punishment

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.919
and before you know it

00:31:45.919 --> 00:31:50.200
everybody is insecure in their enjoyment of

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.950
his or her

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:56.340
unalienable rights to life liberty and property

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:59.740
now he describes in pretty harsh and

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.870
even grim terms

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:04.500
what you can do to people

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.350
who violate the law

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:07.450
of nature

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:11.070
one may destroy a man who makes war upon him

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.580
for the same reason

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.030
that he may kill a wolf or a lion 

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:20.019
such men have no other rule, but that of force and 
violence,

00:32:20.019 --> 00:32:21.510
listen to this

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:25.430
and so may be treated as beasts of prey

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.330
those dangerous and

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.309
noxious

00:32:28.309 --> 00:32:29.450
creatures

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.950
that would be sure to destroy you if you fall
into their power

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.620
so kill them

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.110
first

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:37.590
so

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:40.030
what starts out

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:42.910
as a seemingly benign

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:46.889
state of nature where everyone's free and
yet where there is a law

00:32:46.889 --> 00:32:49.419
and the law respects people's rights

00:32:49.419 --> 00:32:52.520
and those rights are so powerful that they're 
unalienable

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.990
what starts out

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:57.360
looking very benign

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.799
once you look closer

00:32:59.799 --> 00:33:01.710
is pretty fierce

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:03.360
and filled with violence

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.390
and that's why people want to leave

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:09.200
how do they leave

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.260
well here's where consent comes in

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.710
the only way

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:16.090
to escape from the state of nature

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:19.840
is to

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.929
undertake

00:33:20.929 --> 00:33:24.250
an active of consent where

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:25.990
you agree

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:29.560
to give up the enforcement power

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.220
and to create a government

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.960
or a community

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.640
where there will be

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.400
a legislature

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.590
to make law

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:42.110
and where everyone

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.800
agrees in advance

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.580
everyone who enters

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:47.650
agrees in advance

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:51.350
to abide by whatever the majority decides

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:55.810
but then the question and this is our question
and here's where I want to get your views then the question

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.740
is

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.380
what powers

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.160
what can the majority decide

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.520
now here it gets tricky

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.330
for Locke

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:07.970
because you remember

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:09.820
alongside the whole story about consent

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.769
and majority rule

00:34:11.769 --> 00:34:16.989
there are these natural rights,
the law of nature these unalienable rights

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:18.010
and you remember

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.229
they don't disappear

00:34:20.229 --> 00:34:22.019
when people

00:34:22.019 --> 00:34:26.299
join together to create a civil society

00:34:26.299 --> 00:34:29.809
so even once the majority is in charge

00:34:29.809 --> 00:34:31.999
the majority can't

00:34:31.999 --> 00:34:34.909
violate you' re

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:36.839
inalienable rights

00:34:36.839 --> 00:34:41.499
can't violate your fundamental right to life
liberty and property

00:34:41.499 --> 00:34:45.699
so here's the puzzle,

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:48.189
how much power does the majority have

00:34:48.189 --> 00:34:50.580
how limited is the government

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:55.339
created by consent?

00:34:55.339 --> 00:34:57.309
it's limited by

00:34:57.309 --> 00:35:00.670
the obligation

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.029
on the part of the majority to respect

00:35:03.029 --> 00:35:06.059
and to enforce

00:35:06.059 --> 00:35:07.589
the fundamental

00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:09.229
natural rights of the citizens

00:35:09.229 --> 00:35:13.359
they don't give those up we don't give those
up when we enter government

00:35:13.359 --> 00:35:16.400
that's this powerful idea taken over

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.309
from Locke

00:35:17.309 --> 00:35:18.329
by Jefferson

00:35:18.329 --> 00:35:22.680
in the Declaration

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.470
unalienable rights

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:27.739
so let's go to our two cases

00:35:27.739 --> 00:35:31.599
remember Michael Jordan, Bill Gates libertarian
objection

00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:36.089
to taxation for redistribution well what about
Locke’s limited government

00:35:36.089 --> 00:35:38.399
is there anyone who thinks that

00:35:38.399 --> 00:35:40.769
Locke

00:35:40.769 --> 00:35:43.779
does give grounds

00:35:43.779 --> 00:35:46.039
for opposing

00:35:46.039 --> 00:35:46.749
taxation

00:35:46.749 --> 00:35:50.979
for redistribution

00:35:50.979 --> 00:35:55.279
anybody?

00:35:55.279 --> 00:35:58.509
if you, if the majority rules that there should
be taxation

00:35:58.509 --> 00:36:00.059
even if

00:36:00.059 --> 00:36:03.550
the minority should still not have to be taxed
because that's

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:06.019
taking away property which is

00:36:06.019 --> 00:36:09.380
one of the rights of nature

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.890
so

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:14.799
and what's your name? Ben

00:36:14.799 --> 00:36:15.920
so

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:22.499
if the majority taxes the minority

00:36:22.499 --> 00:36:27.839
without the consent of the minority to that
particular tax law

00:36:27.839 --> 00:36:33.059
it does amount to the taking of their property
without their consent

00:36:33.059 --> 00:36:36.779
and it would seem that Locke should

00:36:36.779 --> 00:36:40.049
object to that

00:36:40.049 --> 00:36:41.340
you want some 

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.049
textual support for your 

00:36:43.049 --> 00:36:48.169
reading of Locke, Ben

00:36:48.169 --> 00:36:52.959
I brought some along just in case you raised it

00:36:52.959 --> 00:36:58.239
if you've got, if you have your text look at
one thirty eight passage one thirty eight

00:36:58.239 --> 00:37:00.309
the supreme power

00:37:00.309 --> 00:37:05.459
by which Locke means legislature, cannot take
from any man any part of his property without his

00:37:05.459 --> 00:37:07.569
own consent

00:37:07.569 --> 00:37:11.150
for the preservation of property being the
end of government

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:13.409
and that for which men enter into society

00:37:13.409 --> 00:37:15.540
it necessarily supposes and requires

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.749
that people should have property

00:37:17.749 --> 00:37:20.549
that was the whole reason for entering a society
in the first place

00:37:20.549 --> 00:37:22.869
to protect the right to property and

00:37:22.869 --> 00:37:26.490
when Locke speaks about the right to property he
often uses that

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:28.930
as a kind of global term

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:35.180
for the whole category, the right to life liberty
and property

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:38.199
so that part of Locke

00:37:38.199 --> 00:37:41.799
at the beginning of one thirty eight seems to
support

00:37:41.799 --> 00:37:43.389
Ben's reading

00:37:43.389 --> 00:37:47.299
but what about the part of one thirty eight

00:37:47.299 --> 00:37:48.989
if you keep reading

00:37:48.989 --> 00:37:52.390
Men therefore in society having property

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:55.399
they have such a right to the goods

00:37:55.399 --> 00:37:56.900
which by the law

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.160
of the community

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.660
are theirs,

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.179
look at this,

00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:06.219
and that no one can take from them without
their consent

00:38:06.219 --> 00:38:08.929
and then at the end

00:38:08.929 --> 00:38:12.980
of this passage we see he said so it's a mistake
to think that the legislative power

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.549
can do what it will to dispose to the estates

00:38:15.549 --> 00:38:18.590
of the subject arbitrarily or take any part
of them

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:21.460
at pleasure

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:24.989
here's what's elusive

00:38:24.989 --> 00:38:26.589
on the one hand he says

00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:32.189
the government can't take your property without
your consent he's clear about that

00:38:32.189 --> 00:38:35.270
but then he goes on to say and that's the
natural

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:36.099
right to property

00:38:36.099 --> 00:38:41.420
but then it seems that property, what counts
as property is not natural but conventional

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:45.859
defined by the government

00:38:45.859 --> 00:38:52.319
the goods which by the law of the community are theirs

00:38:52.319 --> 00:38:53.559
and the plot thickens

00:38:53.559 --> 00:38:56.159
if you look ahead to

00:38:56.159 --> 00:38:58.229
section one forty

00:38:58.229 --> 00:39:03.699
in one forty he says governments can't be
supported without great charge. Government is expensive

00:39:03.699 --> 00:39:07.819
and it's fit that everyone who enjoys his
share of the protection should pay out of

00:39:07.819 --> 00:39:08.290
his

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:10.929
estate

00:39:10.929 --> 00:39:13.140
and then here's a crucial line

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:16.669
but still it must be with his own consent

00:39:16.669 --> 00:39:19.989
i.e. the consent of the majority

00:39:19.989 --> 00:39:23.220
giving it either by themselves or through their
representatives

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:28.319
so what is Locke actually saying

00:39:28.319 --> 00:39:29.949
property is natural

00:39:29.949 --> 00:39:32.019
in one sense but conventional

00:39:32.019 --> 00:39:33.180
in another

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.969
it's natural in the sense that

00:39:34.969 --> 00:39:38.479
we have a fundamental unalienable right

00:39:38.479 --> 00:39:40.329
that their be property

00:39:40.329 --> 00:39:46.009
that the institution of property exist and
be respected by the government

00:39:46.009 --> 00:39:48.719
so an arbitrary taking property

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:52.289
would be a violation of the law of nature

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:55.410
and would be illegitimate

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.660
but it's a further question

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:03.459
here's the conventional aspect of property, it's
a further question what counts

00:40:03.459 --> 00:40:06.019
as property, how it's defined

00:40:06.019 --> 00:40:08.409
and what counts

00:40:08.409 --> 00:40:12.849
as taking property, and that's up to the government

00:40:12.849 --> 00:40:15.419
so the consent

00:40:15.419 --> 00:40:17.689
here we're

00:40:17.689 --> 00:40:19.190
kind of back to our question

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:22.099
what is the work of consent

00:40:22.099 --> 00:40:25.269
what it takes for taxation to be legitimate

00:40:25.269 --> 00:40:26.319
is that it be

00:40:26.319 --> 00:40:28.189
by consent

00:40:28.189 --> 00:40:33.829
not the consent of Bill Gates himself that he's
the one who has to pays the tax

00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:38.650
but by the content that he and we, all of us
within the society gave

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:43.569
when we emerged from the state of nature and 
created the government

00:40:43.569 --> 00:40:45.539
in the first place

00:40:45.539 --> 00:40:50.150
it's the collective consent

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:54.209
and by that reading

00:40:54.209 --> 00:40:55.760
it looks like

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:59.920
consent is doing a whole lot

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:06.779
and the limited government consent creates
isn't all that limited

00:41:06.779 --> 00:41:13.779
does anyone want to respond that or have
a question about that? go ahead, stand up

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.880
well I'm just wondering

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:20.149
what Locke's view is on 

00:41:20.149 --> 00:41:22.819
once you have a government that's already
in place

00:41:22.819 --> 00:41:24.299
whether it is

00:41:24.299 --> 00:41:28.359
possible for people who are born into that
government to then leave

00:41:28.359 --> 00:41:30.779
and return to the state of nature

00:41:30.779 --> 00:41:32.779
I mean, I don't think that Locke

00:41:32.779 --> 00:41:34.839
mentioned that at all.

00:41:34.839 --> 00:41:36.839
what do you think?

00:41:36.839 --> 00:41:39.689
well I think

00:41:39.689 --> 00:41:43.599
as the convention it would be very
difficult to

00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:44.759
leave the government

00:41:44.759 --> 00:41:46.859
because

00:41:46.859 --> 00:41:50.130
you were no longer

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:54.629
there's because nobody else is just living in the 
state of nature, everybody else is now

00:41:54.629 --> 00:41:57.929
governed by this legislature

00:41:57.929 --> 00:41:59.900
what would it mean today, you're asking

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.829
and what's your name? Nicola

00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:05.390
to leave the state, suppose you
wanted to leave

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:07.539
civil society

00:42:07.539 --> 00:42:09.839
today, you want to withdraw your consent

00:42:09.839 --> 00:42:13.759
and return to the state of nature. Well because you 
didn't actually consent to it, 

00:42:13.759 --> 00:42:16.639
you were just born into it, 

00:42:16.639 --> 00:42:18.489
it was your ancestors

00:42:18.489 --> 00:42:20.989
who joined

00:42:20.989 --> 00:42:22.170
you didn't sign

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:25.039
the social contract I didn't sign

00:42:25.039 --> 00:42:30.910
all right so what does Locke say there

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:35.819
I don't think Locke says that you have to sign anything
I think he says that it's kind of implied consent

00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:39.959
by willingly taking government services you
are implying you're consenting to the government

00:42:39.959 --> 00:42:41.769
taking things from you

00:42:41.769 --> 00:42:45.779
all right so implied consent, that's a partial
answer to this challenge

00:42:45.779 --> 00:42:49.609
now you may not think that implied consent is
as good as the real thing is that

00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:52.509
what you're shaking your head about Nicola?

00:42:52.509 --> 00:42:54.599
speak up stand up and

00:42:54.599 --> 00:42:57.239
I don't think that necessarily just by

00:42:57.239 --> 00:42:59.459
utilizing the government's 

00:42:59.459 --> 00:43:01.130
you know various

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:02.749
resources that

00:43:02.749 --> 00:43:04.709
we are

00:43:04.709 --> 00:43:06.839
necessarily implying that we

00:43:06.839 --> 00:43:07.490
agree with

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:08.689
the way that this

00:43:08.689 --> 00:43:11.469
government was formed

00:43:11.469 --> 00:43:16.049
or that we have consented to actually join into the
social contract

00:43:16.049 --> 00:43:21.109
so you don't think the idea of implied consent
is strong enough to generate any obligation

00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:23.599
at all to obey  government

00:43:23.599 --> 00:43:25.899
not necessarily no,

00:43:25.899 --> 00:43:29.539
Nicola if you didn't think you'd get caught

00:43:29.539 --> 00:43:32.919
would you pay your taxes

00:43:32.919 --> 00:43:35.069
umm

00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:37.389
I don't think so

00:43:37.389 --> 00:43:38.640
I would rather

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.649
have a system, personally,

00:43:40.649 --> 00:43:43.420
that I could give money to exactly

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:44.849
those

00:43:44.849 --> 00:43:46.730
sections of the government that I support

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:49.160
and not just blanket

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:56.160
support everything. you'd rather be in the state of
nature of at least on April fifteenth

00:43:58.039 --> 00:44:02.289
but what I'm trying to get at is you consider
that you're under no obligation since you

00:44:02.289 --> 00:44:05.509
haven't actually entered into an active
consent

00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:11.529
but for prudential reasons you do what you're
supposed to do according to the law. exactly.

00:44:11.529 --> 00:44:16.050
if you look at it that way then you're violating another
one of Locke's treatises which is that

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:20.020
you can't take anything from anyone else like
you can't

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.460
you can't take the government's services

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.119
and then not give them anything in return

00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:26.130
if you

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:28.769
if you want to go live in a state of nature that's
fine

00:44:28.769 --> 00:44:31.940
but you can't take anything from the government
because by the government's terms which are

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.470
the only terms under which you can enter
the agreement

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:37.870
say that you have to pay taxes to take those things.
so you're saying that

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:42.290
Nicola can go on back to the state of
nature if she wants to but you can't drive on

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:44.069
Mass Ave. Exactly

00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:49.019
I want to raise the stakes beyond using Mass Ave, 

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:51.279
and even beyond taxation

00:44:51.279 --> 00:44:53.279
what about life

00:44:53.279 --> 00:44:56.299
what about military conscription

00:44:56.299 --> 00:44:58.939
yes, what do you think, stand up

00:44:58.939 --> 00:45:01.139
first of all we have to remember that

00:45:01.139 --> 00:45:04.380
sending people to war is not necessarily

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.959
implying that they'll die, I mean obviously

00:45:06.959 --> 00:45:10.160
you're not raising their chances here,

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.679
it's not a death penalty

00:45:12.679 --> 00:45:17.380
so if you're going to discuss whether or not
military conscriptions is equivalent to

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.670
you know suppressing people's right to life

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:22.999
you shouldn't approach it that way

00:45:22.999 --> 00:45:27.289
secondly the real problem here is Locke has
this view about consent

00:45:27.289 --> 00:45:29.809
and natural rights

00:45:29.809 --> 00:45:32.799
but you're not allowed to give up your natural
rights either

00:45:32.799 --> 00:45:35.309
so the real question is

00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:38.259
how does he himself figure it out between

00:45:38.259 --> 00:45:40.519
I agree to

00:45:40.519 --> 00:45:41.790
give up my life

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.679
give up my property when he talks about taxes

00:45:44.679 --> 00:45:47.239
or military conscription for the fact,

00:45:47.239 --> 00:45:49.880
but I guess Locke would be against suicide

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:54.619
and that's still you know my own consent
I mean. Good. What's your name?

00:45:54.619 --> 00:45:55.869
Eric. so I Eric

00:45:55.869 --> 00:46:00.609
brings us back to the puzzle we've been wrestling
with since we started reading Locke

00:46:00.609 --> 00:46:02.409
on the one hand

00:46:02.409 --> 00:46:04.790
we have these unalienable rights

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:10.640
to life liberty and property which means that
even we don't have the power to give them up

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.039
and that's what creates the limits

00:46:13.039 --> 00:46:18.160
on legitimate government it's not what we
consent to that limits government

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.929
it's what we lack the power

00:46:20.929 --> 00:46:23.249
to give away

00:46:23.249 --> 00:46:27.499
when we consent that limits government

00:46:27.499 --> 00:46:28.539
that's the

00:46:28.539 --> 00:46:30.879
that's the point at the heart of

00:46:30.879 --> 00:46:32.279
Locke's whole account

00:46:32.279 --> 00:46:34.959
of legitimate government

00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:37.049
but now you say well

00:46:37.049 --> 00:46:38.240
if we can't

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.890
give up our own life, if we can't commit suicide

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:46.499
if we can't give up our rights to property how
can we then agree to be bound by a majority

00:46:46.499 --> 00:46:48.199
that will force us

00:46:48.199 --> 00:46:53.719
to sacrifice our lives or give up our property

00:46:53.719 --> 00:46:59.469
does Locke have a way out of this or 
is he basically

00:46:59.469 --> 00:47:01.899
sanctioning

00:47:01.899 --> 00:47:04.060
an all-powerful government

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:07.169
despite everything he says

00:47:07.169 --> 00:47:08.929
about unalienable rights

00:47:08.929 --> 00:47:11.670
does he have a way out of it? who would speak here
in defense

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:13.390
of Locke or make sense

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:15.439
find a way out of this

00:47:15.439 --> 00:47:16.049
predicament

00:47:16.049 --> 00:47:19.599
all right go ahead. I feel like there's a general distinction
to be made between

00:47:19.599 --> 00:47:21.220
the right to life

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.160
that individuals possess and the

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:27.839
the fact that the government cannot take away
an individual's right to life

00:47:27.839 --> 00:47:29.329
I think

00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:31.129
if you look at conscription as

00:47:31.129 --> 00:47:34.329
the government picking out certain individuals
to go fight in war

00:47:34.329 --> 00:47:36.679
then that would be a violation of the rights
their 

00:47:36.679 --> 00:47:38.009
national right to life

00:47:38.009 --> 00:47:41.190
on the other hand if you have conscription
of

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:43.670
let's say a lottery for example

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:44.680
then in that case

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.029
I would view that as

00:47:47.029 --> 00:47:51.199
the population picking their representatives
defend them in the case of war

00:47:51.199 --> 00:47:54.969
the idea being that since the whole population
cannot go out there to defend its own right

00:47:54.969 --> 00:47:58.649
of property it picks its own representatives
through a process

00:47:58.649 --> 00:48:00.359
that's essentially random

00:48:00.359 --> 00:48:01.539
and the these

00:48:01.539 --> 00:48:05.519
these sort of elected representatives go out
and fight for

00:48:05.519 --> 00:48:06.669
the rights of the people

00:48:06.669 --> 00:48:11.969
it looks very similar, it works just like
an elected government in my opinion 

00:48:11.969 --> 00:48:16.389
alright so an elected government can conscript citizens
to go out and defend

00:48:16.389 --> 00:48:17.989
the way of life

00:48:17.989 --> 00:48:19.779
the community

00:48:19.779 --> 00:48:20.719
that makes

00:48:20.719 --> 00:48:23.339
the enjoyment of rights possible.

00:48:23.339 --> 00:48:25.699
I think I think it can because 

00:48:25.699 --> 00:48:29.229
to me it seems that it's very similar
to the process of electing

00:48:29.229 --> 00:48:31.899
representatives the legislature

00:48:31.899 --> 00:48:35.339
although here

00:48:35.339 --> 00:48:36.499
it's as if

00:48:36.499 --> 00:48:37.929
the government

00:48:37.929 --> 00:48:41.029
it's electing by conscription

00:48:41.029 --> 00:48:42.779
certain

00:48:42.779 --> 00:48:46.259
citizens to go die for the sake of the whole

00:48:46.259 --> 00:48:47.829
is that

00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:51.390
consistent with respect for a natural right
to liberty

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:55.819
well what I would say is there's a distinction
between picking out individuals 

00:48:55.819 --> 00:48:58.339
and having

00:48:58.339 --> 00:49:00.319
a random choice of individuals.

00:49:00.319 --> 00:49:04.989
between let me make sure, between picking out 
individuals, 

00:49:04.989 --> 00:49:08.119
well I don't, let me what's your name? Gogol.

00:49:08.119 --> 00:49:11.569
Gogol says there's a difference between
picking out individuals

00:49:11.569 --> 00:49:13.819
to lay down their lives

00:49:13.819 --> 00:49:16.429
and having a general law

00:49:16.429 --> 00:49:18.019
I think this is

00:49:18.019 --> 00:49:23.249
on I think this is the answer Locke would give, 
actually

00:49:23.249 --> 00:49:28.289
Locke is against arbitrary government he's
against the arbitrary taking

00:49:28.289 --> 00:49:29.819
the singling out of

00:49:29.819 --> 00:49:32.490
Bill Gates to finance the war in Iraq

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:35.949
he's against singling out a particular citizen

00:49:35.949 --> 00:49:37.739
or group of people

00:49:37.739 --> 00:49:40.009
to go off and fight

00:49:40.009 --> 00:49:42.609
but if there's a general law

00:49:42.609 --> 00:49:44.389
such that the

00:49:44.389 --> 00:49:50.049
the government's choice the majority's action
is non arbitrary,

00:49:50.049 --> 00:49:54.829
it doesn't really amount to a violation

00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:56.539
of

00:49:56.539 --> 00:49:58.229
people's basic rights

00:49:58.229 --> 00:50:00.450
what does count as a violation

00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:05.079
is an arbitrary taking because that would
essentially say not only to Bill Gates, but

00:50:05.079 --> 00:50:06.650
to everyone

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:11.989
there is no rule of law there is no institution
of property

00:50:11.989 --> 00:50:13.630
because at the whim

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:16.749
of the king or for that matter of the parliament

00:50:16.749 --> 00:50:18.559
we can name

00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:19.499
you

00:50:19.499 --> 00:50:21.589
or you to

00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:22.979
give up your property

00:50:22.979 --> 00:50:24.999
or to give up your life

00:50:24.999 --> 00:50:30.129
but so long as there is a no arbitrary
rule of law

00:50:30.129 --> 00:50:33.349
then

00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:34.759
it's permissive

00:50:34.759 --> 00:50:37.509
now you may say this doesn't amount

00:50:37.509 --> 00:50:39.939
to a very limited government

00:50:39.939 --> 00:50:42.069
and the libertarian may complain

00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:45.599
that Locke is not such a terrific ally after
all

00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:48.269
the libertarian has two grounds

00:50:48.269 --> 00:50:50.799
for disappointment in Locke

00:50:50.799 --> 00:50:53.829
first

00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:58.849
that the rights are unalienable and therefore I
don't really own myself after all

00:50:58.849 --> 00:51:00.830
I can't dispose of my life

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:02.849
or my liberty or my property

00:51:02.849 --> 00:51:05.399
in a way that violates my rights

00:51:05.399 --> 00:51:08.170
that's disappointment number one,

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:10.159
disappointment number two

00:51:10.159 --> 00:51:13.829
once there is a legitimate government based
on consent

00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:15.290
the only limits

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.799
for Locke

00:51:17.799 --> 00:51:19.970
are limits on arbitrary

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:22.519
the takings of life or of liberty

00:51:22.519 --> 00:51:23.969
or of property

00:51:23.969 --> 00:51:30.969
but if the majority decides or if the majority
promulgates a generally applicable law

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:34.319
and if it votes

00:51:34.319 --> 00:51:37.479
duly according to fare procedures

00:51:37.479 --> 00:51:39.719
then there is no violation

00:51:39.719 --> 00:51:41.759
whether it's a system of taxation

00:51:41.759 --> 00:51:43.379
or system

00:51:43.379 --> 00:51:44.959
of conscription

00:51:44.959 --> 00:51:46.150
so it's clear

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:47.309
that Locke

00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:48.570
is worried about

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:50.839
the absolute arbitrary power

00:51:50.839 --> 00:51:53.829
of kings

00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:55.549
but it's also true

00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:58.819
and here's a darker side of Locke

00:51:58.819 --> 00:52:03.519
that this is great theorist of consent came up
with a theory of private property that didn't

00:52:03.519 --> 00:52:07.169
require consent

00:52:07.169 --> 00:52:08.489
that may

00:52:08.489 --> 00:52:12.029
and this goes back to the point Rochelle
made last time,

00:52:12.029 --> 00:52:15.779
may have had something to do with Locke's second

00:52:15.779 --> 00:52:16.789
concern

00:52:16.789 --> 00:52:18.030
which was America

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:18.999
you remember

00:52:18.999 --> 00:52:22.559
when he talks about the state of nature he's
not talking about

00:52:22.559 --> 00:52:25.659
an imaginary place

00:52:25.659 --> 00:52:31.349
in the beginning he says all the world was
America and what was going on in America

00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:33.259
the settlers

00:52:33.259 --> 00:52:36.169
we're enclosing land

00:52:36.169 --> 00:52:37.999
and engaged in wars

00:52:37.999 --> 00:52:41.259
with the native Americans

00:52:41.259 --> 00:52:44.049
Locke who was an administrator

00:52:44.049 --> 00:52:46.150
of one of the colonies

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:47.899
may have been

00:52:47.899 --> 00:52:48.960
as interested

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:51.410
in providing a justification

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:55.749
for private property through enclosure
without consent

00:52:55.749 --> 00:52:57.859
through enclosure and cultivation

00:52:57.859 --> 00:52:59.539
as he was

00:52:59.539 --> 00:53:01.729
with developing a theory

00:53:01.729 --> 00:53:04.279
of government based on consent

00:53:04.279 --> 00:53:06.239
that would reign in

00:53:06.239 --> 00:53:08.650
kings and arbitrary

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:09.479
rulers

00:53:09.479 --> 00:53:11.649
the question we're left with

00:53:11.649 --> 00:53:16.929
the fundamental question we still haven't
answered is what then becomes of consent

00:53:16.929 --> 00:53:18.669
what work can it do

00:53:18.669 --> 00:53:20.559
what is its moral force

00:53:20.559 --> 00:53:24.029
what are the limits of consent

00:53:24.029 --> 00:53:26.010
consent matters  not only for governments

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:28.619
but also from markets

00:53:28.619 --> 00:53:29.330
and

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:32.069
beginning next time we're going to take up

00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:34.679
questions of the limits of consent

00:53:34.679 --> 00:53:36.189
in the buying and selling

00:53:36.189 --> 00:53:43.189
of goods
