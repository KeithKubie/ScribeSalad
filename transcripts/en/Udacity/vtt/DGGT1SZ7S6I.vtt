00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.640
Bipolar disorder is characterized by normally widened

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.840
moodswings, ranging from mania, which is an abnormally

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.570
and persistently elevated mood; to depression, a state

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.630
of sadness and intense loss of pleasure or

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.000
interest in life. Now, the onset of

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.630
symptoms for bipolar disorder are usually between the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.310
ages of 18 and 25. Though over time

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.730
the severity of the mood swings can intensify.
