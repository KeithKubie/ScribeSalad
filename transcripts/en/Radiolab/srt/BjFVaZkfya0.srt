00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,980
You are listening to radio lab radio lab

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,680
from [inaudible], w.N y.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,820
S. E. N. N. P. R.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,800
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm
Robert Krulwich, Radiolab,

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,040
the podcast chest. So today on radio lab

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,300
we've got a shorty for you, but it's
like it's a good, it's a good thing. Yup.

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,420
We're going to introduce
you to two different,

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,080
I am a v S Ramachandran at the
University of California San Diego.

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,900
I direct the center for
brain and cognition there.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,650
Okay. My name is Dr Carol Berman. I'm at
NYU Medical Center. I'm a psychiatrist.

11
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:37,990
So there's,

12
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,620
there are two folks and they're going
to tell you two different stories

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,120
that really, it's the same story, just
two different versions of it in a way.

14
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:48,460
That's right. That's right.
Can we start with Carol Berman?

15
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,840
So my patient,

16
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,870
who is this 37 year old patient comes
back to her house and sits next to this

17
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:59,140
man who's wearing a red
plaid shirt, trucking boots.

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,030
And this woman looks at this man,
doesn't quite know what to make of them.

19
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,230
I think the gene she recognized and the
boots and she takes a look at him and

20
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:11,510
says, who are you? And he says
to her, well, who are you?

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,910
Come over here. Give me a kiss.

22
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,720
So she leans in little
tentatively gives him a kiss,

23
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,480
but it feels wrong. Everything
about this situation feels wrong.

24
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:26,380
She was thinking this was some
strange man who is sitting here in a,

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,760
you know her husband's clothing.

26
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,180
This did not look like her husband to
her and she was wondering what he was

27
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:32,230
doing in her apartment.

28
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,010
Okay, so that is one story.

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,800
And now we want you to
hear a second story.

30
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,370
This one comes from Dr v S Rameshchandra.

31
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,890
I saw a patient not long ago, was in
coma, two weeks, came out of the coma,

32
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,720
a student on our campus, intelligent,
quite articulate, a little bit slow down,

33
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,610
but overall quite intact. But here's the
problem. When he looks at his mother,

34
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,230
he says, doctor, who is this woman?
This woman looks exactly like my mother,

35
00:02:00,231 --> 00:02:03,500
but she's an impostor and
imposter. She is an impostor.

36
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:06,170
She some other woman
pretending to be my mother. No.

37
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:10,070
Is this person coming into his in his
actual is his mother and of course this is

38
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:13,700
very alarming to the parents. Sometimes
it's still spills over to the father.

39
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,901
Okay.

40
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,260
It's usually somebody very close to you
and he has nothing else wrong with him.

41
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,990
He just doesn't think that his
mother is really his mother. Yeah.

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,320
This person looked like her husband,
but there was something off like what?

43
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,610
There was something about him.

44
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,050
Some essence like the feeling you have
was towards someone when you see them,

45
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,630
right. The feeling or the
essence of the person,

46
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,220
the soul of the person isn't in there.

47
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,310
[inaudible]

48
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,300
so it turns out that these two people
are suffering from the same delusion,

49
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,390
delusion, pronounced like cop grass',
very rare cop named [inaudible],

50
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,111
g r a.

51
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:54,111
S are these kinds of cup grass delusions
appear sometimes with brain injuries

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,010
where certain kinds of dementia
or sometimes just out of the blue,

53
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,130
but the result is almost always

54
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,500
that you feel like your
left ones have been replaced

55
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,453
by imposters.

56
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:06,831
No,

57
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:10,760
still no one knows the underlying cause
and there are lots of different ways to

58
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:12,920
explain it. We explain it psychologically,

59
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,260
there might be some negative aspects
of the person that you don't want to

60
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:18,650
recognize. Like maybe
my patient, you know,

61
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,450
saw some negative things in her husband
that she didn't want to recognize.

62
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,610
So when the negative aspects came in,

63
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:27,840
he had to be a completely different
person for her too because she couldn't,

64
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,980
you know what I mean? On some level
you think it's a kind of denial, right?

65
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,390
So it'd be like Robert, if,

66
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,290
if there was something about you that I
just couldn't handle and every time that

67
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,370
thing appeared, whatever it is,

68
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,570
the only way I could deal with it
psychologically was to make a break and to

69
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:47,190
say, oh, well that's not the Robert I
know. Therefore it isn't Robert at all.

70
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,920
It's some fraud. Yeah, it's a fake.

71
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,750
But if you think there's
some psychological basis
when you try and treat that

72
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,700
psychological cause or whatever it
is we do. But we don't get too far.

73
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,350
We tried this stuff,

74
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:03,620
but when a person starts breaking
from reality and become psychotic,

75
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,600
you could take a fingerprints,

76
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:09,020
you could show them everything about
the person and you can't get any place.

77
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,110
I think what's happening is
something quite specific.

78
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:13,270
You can explain this in terms of
the known circuitry in the brain,

79
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,650
the visual centers of the brain funneling
information to the fusiform gyrus.

80
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,980
But you recognize your mother
or a dog or a table, a chair,

81
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,240
because this a stranger is a Jo. Is
that my mom? Is a dog, is that Fifi?

82
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,430
Then the message goes to the Migdal of
its cages, the emotional significance,

83
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:32,400
emotional and relevance of what you're
looking at for you. So wait, so,

84
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:33,121
so to cap,

85
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:38,121
to make that into a normal English mom
is a face I recognized as mom any set of

86
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:41,430
feelings that I associate
with my correct. Absolutely.

87
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,360
Now what happens is in this
patient, because of the head injury,

88
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,000
that wire is cut. So then no mommy
feeling no mommy feelings. So you say, my,

89
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,600
my God, this is my mom. She looks
like my mum, but what I'm doing,

90
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,250
I know feelings. There's something really
weird here. She must be an impostor.

91
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,740
Now, that's a very farfetched delusion.

92
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,340
Why doesn't she just say
she doesn't feel like mom,

93
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,520
but of course she's my mom and
why doesn't he do that to be sure?

94
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:07,890
Sometimes that happens, but
most often he says, not my mom,

95
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,480
because our thought processes are
much more dependent on our gut level,

96
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:16,020
emotional feelings. Then we
realized, so absent a feeling,

97
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:20,130
a familiar feeling of mom,
some part of my brain says,

98
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,100
that's your mother, and some
part of me says, no, it can't be.

99
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,780
And the deal that the brain works out
is a deal that creates this fiction.

100
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,730
It's an imposter because that solves the
problem and the equation that says it

101
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:37,700
can't be. It was from your emotions
wins. But now here's the twist.

102
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,450
Now if she goes to the next room, speaks
to them on the phone, he says, mom,

103
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,530
where are you? How are you? It's
wonderful to talk to you, Huh?

104
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,430
All the emotions come flooding
back and he is not delusional,

105
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,950
right? Why would that be? And are
literally, she comes to the room, he says,

106
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:58,970
who are you? You look just like my
mother, but you're not my mother.

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,290
So seeing the face seems to set
off this problem. The reason is,

108
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,400
does a separate wire going from the
auditory regions in the brain to the

109
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,400
Amygdala emotional centers?
That wire was not cut.

110
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,560
So what you hear can be very
familiar, but if you see it,

111
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:19,520
then you got a problem. When people ask
me, how come? What if she just Keke?

112
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,630
What if she comes and talks
to him? Right? What was the,

113
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,040
why doesn't the hearing kick in
and say, look, she is your mother.

114
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,650
The answer is she our brains.

115
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,170
There's a hierarchy of of priorities.
You're highly visual creatures.

116
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:36,440
We pay much more attention division,
give much more weight to vision,

117
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,380
dental hearing and to voice. Huh?
So you say this is an imposter.

118
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,680
She sounds a little bit like
my mother. I don't know why,

119
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:46,100
but she's obviously an impostor rather
than she doesn't look like my mother,

120
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,570
but has my mother's voice.

121
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,680
You tell me if you don't feel
comfortable talking about this,

122
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:55,880
but I understand that you have personal
experience with cap grass dilutions.

123
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,440
Yeah. Actually my husband,

124
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,820
he started not recognizing other people
first and then at some points I didn't

125
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,050
even think I was his wife.

126
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,100
I'm very stressed out with this whole
situation because my husband was a

127
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,430
charming, intelligent,
wonderful person in all ways.

128
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:14,300
And his dementia has been getting worse
and worse. Yeah, you're a psychiatrist.

129
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:19,160
So does, does your understanding of how
that might work in the brain change your

130
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,490
experience of it in some way? Well, no,

131
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:24,470
it can't really change your
feeling because you know,

132
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:29,390
when I get home and I'd like to, and I
get home, I kiss my husband and say hi,

133
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:33,920
how are you today? And I hope he's
recognized. I May and if he doesn't,

134
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:36,890
you know, I feel terrible. I
couldn't, after a hard day's work,

135
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:39,770
I want to be able to hug him
and kiss him and you know,

136
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:42,140
have a nice friendly
environment when I get back.

137
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:45,650
But you never know what you're
going to get when you get back home.

138
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,043
