00:00:00.114 --> 00:00:02.439
 In ancient Rome they had tampons of wool, 

00:00:02.559 --> 00:00:06.442
 In Indonesia, plants and Japanese women used rolled paper. 

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:09.180
 It has been commercially produced since the 1930s 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.003
 and for life a woman consumes up to 12,000 of these products. 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.314
 Is it really necessary? 

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.062
 Shouldn't we stop? 

00:00:17.182 --> 00:00:21.374
 Mentruation is a common biological process involving half the population 

00:00:21.494 --> 00:00:23.714
 but it still remains taboo. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.423
 The menstrual cycle is repeated about every 28 days 

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:29.580
 from puberty to menopause. 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.514
 Thanks to the progesterone and estrogen, the uterine mucosa always gets stronger 

00:00:33.827 --> 00:00:36.870
 as a preparation for a possible pregnancy. 

00:00:37.126 --> 00:00:39.194
 But when a woman is not pregnant, 

00:00:39.314 --> 00:00:42.523
 the level of progesterone drops and the mucosa separates. 

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:46.763
 Thus, menstrual blood from the uterine arteries also contains these particles. 

00:00:46.883 --> 00:00:51.000
 This is not common in animals, menstruating very little of them. 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.633
 Except as people, primates, bats, or brucons, 

00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.735
 in most animals, the uterus becomes stronger only during pregnancy. 

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:03.251
 In menstruation, 30-90 ml of fluids leave the body, 

00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:07.908
 and as the main method of capturing 81% of women use tampons, 

00:01:08.028 --> 00:01:09.930
 occasionally along with inserts. 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.762
 Tampons are made of very absorbent materials 

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:15.485
 reacting with water like cotton and silk. 

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:19.532
 But unlike them, the remainder of the tampon is not degradable. 

00:01:19.652 --> 00:01:23.173
 This will create over 130 kg of waste for your life. 

00:01:23.293 --> 00:01:28.105
 These materials also create a favorable environment for Staphylococcus bacteria. 

00:01:28.225 --> 00:01:31.391
 This causes a rare but life-threatening disease 

00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:33.308
 Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). 

00:01:33.428 --> 00:01:36.291
 Blood supplies the uterus with neutralizing proteins 

00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:40.606
 it reduces acidity and reduces the ability to destroy bacteria. 

00:01:41.174 --> 00:01:45.581
 More than 2,200 TSS cases were officially reported in 1983, 

00:01:46.685 --> 00:01:49.580
 but in 1997 there were only 5, 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.614
 by knowing about swabs 

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:55.275
 such as the need to change after max. 8 hours 

00:01:55.524 --> 00:01:57.858
 or selecting the lowest possible absorbency. 

00:01:57.978 --> 00:02:02.224
 In addition, they can dry out the vagina and rub the skin, 

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:04.169
 which increases the risk of infection. 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.184
 Women spend about 2 500 CZK a year on tampons and pads 

00:02:08.304 --> 00:02:12.134
 and although they are necessary, they are often highly taxed. 

00:02:12.437 --> 00:02:15.782
 The protests have already changed in countries like Canada, 

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:20.419
 but in some poorer countries girls cannot go to school. 

00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:24.570
 In South Africa, 9 million girls at the age of 13-19 miss lessons 

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:28.965
 due to lack of hygiene needs or room for replacement. 

00:02:29.272 --> 00:02:32.135
 They can be replaced with a menstrual cup 

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:35.969
 airtight container for blood collection for reuse. 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.306
 It is significantly cheaper than tampons 

00:02:38.426 --> 00:02:40.647
 and can be used for several years. 

00:02:40.767 --> 00:02:42.676
 It changes after 12 hours 

00:02:42.796 --> 00:02:46.173
 so women don't have to exchange it at school or work 

00:02:46.293 --> 00:02:49.173
 and much less on the planet. 

00:02:49.293 --> 00:02:51.486
 In a study with women between 19 and 40 

00:02:51.606 --> 00:02:55.930
 that previously used tampons and replaced them with a cup for 3 cycles, 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.624
 91% of them preferred it 

00:02:58.744 --> 00:03:01.226
 and despite the need for adoption, they would recommend it. 

00:03:01.346 --> 00:03:03.466
 Mentra's blood saves lives! 

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:07.038
 Scientists create diagnostic tests for home use 

00:03:07.158 --> 00:03:10.835
 that from this blood recognize the beginnings of cancer, endometriosis, 

00:03:10.955 --> 00:03:13.699
 reproductive and sexually transmitted diseases. 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.706
 Stem cells of this blood 

00:03:15.826 --> 00:03:18.407
 they are stronger than those of the bone marrow. 

00:03:18.527 --> 00:03:21.935
 Up to 9 different cell types can be created. 

00:03:22.194 --> 00:03:26.936
 Thus, menstrual blood can be an uncontrolled, easily accessible, cheap 

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:31.500
 and an ethical source of cells for regenerative medicine. 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.487
 From taboo through "normal" to saving life. 

00:03:34.607 --> 00:03:37.014
 Menstruation is actually great, don't you think? 

00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:40.599

 In other videos as a therapist and emotional coach 

00:03:48.527 --> 00:03:50.128
 I advise how on relationships. 

00:03:50.248 --> 00:03:52.549
 Thanks to my brother Mitch for help,
