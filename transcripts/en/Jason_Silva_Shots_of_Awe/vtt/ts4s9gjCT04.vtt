00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.480
So here in Shots
of Awe, we trade

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.176
in the currency of optimism.

00:00:15.176 --> 00:00:19.110
We're tired of doom and
gloom, fatalistic thinking,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.970
the world is going to
hell, and all that.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.630
We need solutions to address the
grand challenges of humanity.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.396
See, I believe in
boundless possibility.

00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:29.285
Human beings are
a curious species

00:00:29.285 --> 00:00:30.990
because we have the
ability to conceive

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.960
of delightful, exotic
future scenarios

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.500
and we can actually
move the popular will.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.350
We can pull the present
forward and meet and actualize

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.850
any of those possibilities.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.040
That's what we do.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.365
We pull the present
forward into the future.

00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:49.780
The future that we
create, that we map out.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.570
Today, we hear a lot in the
media about the energy crisis.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.356
We hear a lot about
sustainability.

00:00:54.356 --> 00:00:57.530
We hear a lot about
strangleholding the planet.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.220
These are all
legitimate concerns,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.490
but again, doom and
gloom has been fatigued.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.870
We need solutions.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.200
So let's talk about
The Solutions Project.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.715
The Solutions Project is
an amazing new initiative

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:12.110
led by Hollywood celebrities,
brilliant civil engineers,

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.625
the popular will of some of
the smartest men the world

00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:17.480
who have come together
to leverage their brains,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.280
to create a plan to take us
100% renewable here in America.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.775
Literally, 50 plans
for 50 states by 2050

00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:29.390
using technology that
already exists today.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.440
The proposal is straightforward.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.310
Eliminate combustion
as a source of energy.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.553
The sun gives us
in one single hour

00:01:36.553 --> 00:01:39.405
more energy than we would need
to power the Earth for a year.

00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:41.069
And the technology
used to capture

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:42.860
that energy is getting
exponentially faster

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.850
all the time.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.670
The fact that less than 2% of
the United States' land mass

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.020
would support all of the wind,
solar, and hydroelectric power

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.054
generation required to meet
energy demand is amazing.

00:01:54.054 --> 00:01:55.720
Now again, it all
comes down to the fact

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.410
that we need to make
a cognitive leap.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.130
We need to realize that this
is already possible-- now,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.010
today with existing technology.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.509
We change minds, we
change paradigms.

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.050
So again, I encourage
all of you guys

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.600
to check out
thesolutionsproject.org, get

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.770
educated, get involved,
join the conversation.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.780
Thank you very much.
