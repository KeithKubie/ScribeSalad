Speaker 1:          00:00:00       You are listening to radio lab radio from W. N y. S. C e.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:00:11       I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab. And today we have a little experiment in democracy, diversity and division. Yeah. Comes to us from our reporter, producer Simon Adler. Okay. All right. Sign. Okay. What, what do you have to tell me?

Speaker 2:          00:00:25       So couple months back, I took the train down to southern Brooklyn, 95th Street, bound to a little neighborhood called Bay Ridge that's known for its portrayal in the movie. Saturday night fever.

Speaker 4:          00:00:42       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:00:43       w w you weren't heading there for disco? Uh, no. Uh, not exactly. The auditorium appears to be a filling up. I was actually down there to go to this Catholic High School Auditorium. Huh? How you doing? Hey Sir, to the Classic High School Auditorium, sloping down with the stage in front and like an American flag on one side of the stage in a New York state flag on the other, maybe a thousand seats. And I would say half of them are filled. Like surprisingly, there's a big turnout for this thing. Look familiar. Have you seen me before? Well, mid this question handsome. Oh. And uh, it would not be unfair to say that the crowd has an average age of 62. The reason I was there. So, uh, what brings you here tonight? Uh, Tom seated debate was to watch the local candidates for the New York City city council. Duke it out. Who's most likely to do something for you, do you think? I have no idea. I've been hurt on both sides. And can I ask you a question or two? As I was talking to people beforehand, uh, weaving in and out of the rows of chairs, the issues that people were concerned about, uh, were really what you would expect

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       will be in this neighborhood for five years. I've been fighting for a light at this level of politics. In the meantime, I get aggravated. We have to run for our lives when we cross the streets. Yeah, it's horrible. You know, small stuff. Taking away the 5 cent bottle tax with you, drink a lot of mountain dew or something. So the 5 cents are going to have my water bottles. It jumps up the price. When I buy those, I'm 24 packs of water right places. We're about to be

Speaker 2:          00:02:14       eventually the MC for the evening. This woman in her seventies dressed from head to toe in pink, walks out onto the stage.

Speaker 4:          00:02:21       Jace is America in action. We Paddock Hooray selection here.

Speaker 2:          00:02:28       She invites the candidates up, five Democrats, four Republicans. They sit down at their respective tables and okay, we're ready. It gets underway. You know, and I'm all get set, go. And at first

Speaker 4:          00:02:41       I have a city council woman, I will help them make sure that those that have limited in common on fixed income,

Speaker 2:          00:02:47       it's pretty dry.

Speaker 4:          00:02:49       You have enough resources and the help to take care of that path. [inaudible] yeah, so you don't have to put them down and they don't have to put them out.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       But then about an hour, hour and a half into it, there's this moment where, what are your solutions for the overcrowding in schools in this district? Bug Panel. One of the Republican candidates, this guy, Bob Kapono goes off on this riff.

Speaker 5:          00:03:14       It's a matter of budgetary priorities. It takes some money to build schools. So perhaps if we put an end to some of the cities, sanctuary city policies, like spending $27 million to defend those here illegally will commit felonies for deportation perhaps. And you'd have more money to build more public schools.

Speaker 4:          00:03:38       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:03:38       and then just as it seems like people were settling down against the next question. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:03:45       Devil's breath, right

Speaker 2:          00:03:49       man on the far right side of the auditorium stands up and then goes on to say the Arab people and the freaking Asians out of here.

Speaker 4:          00:04:05       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:04:06       why are you selling your houses? You're letting everybody take over.

Speaker 4:          00:04:10       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:04:13       Everybody sort of sat up in their seats and uh, nobody was quite sure if this thing was gonna escalate. And shortly after he said this, one of the candidates up on stage, this tall guy like six foot three, salt and pepper beard stood up from behind the table and actually walked out in front of it. I want to say something, at least forgive me. And uh, and said,

Speaker 4:          00:04:38       that is an elephant in the room and it's called racism and discrimination. And this give you that the right to be here. You don't have enough [inaudible] to build the message for Trump and to the world that the people of the 43rd district are not afraid to send the first American city council to represent [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:05:00       So the reason I was at this debate is um, like it feels right now, like America is just at its own throat. It's certainly as divided as I've ever seen it and I just keep wondering like in this moment, can one person stand for all of us anymore? And here you've got this guy, the guy you just heard other Ellia team, a Palestinian American trying to win an election in one of the most conservative and most divided neighborhoods in New York and he's running on behalf of a group of people who currently are at the flashpoint of those divisions, Arab American Muslims. And just to make things a little more common.

Speaker 5:          00:05:42       Okay. The other Elliot team

Speaker 2:          00:05:46       is a Christian. That grace of our Lord is the Christ, the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit. Christian minister.

Speaker 4:          00:05:57       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:06:04       yeah, we've been the one in the office. Yeah, it was [inaudible] check, check, check. I sat down with him in his office for the first time this past march. I am an Arab American Palestinian Christian Lutheran Pastor in southwest Brooklyn running for office. That doesn't say that for me. Can you say that once more in Arab American Palestinian Lutheran Pastor in south was to Brooklyn who is running for city council because I want to bring a new bold, fresh, inclusive, powerful voice to present our district and city council is that you've got a nice cadence there. You though you said that you know, being a preacher, you know it helps a little bit to what's this guy's backstory? How did he end up being in Brooklyn and running for the seat for Cities Council world? So he was born and raised in Bethlehem on the West Bank in a Palestinian, a Christian home into a family that was poor to a middle class.

Speaker 6:          00:07:07       His father was a carpenter and made most of his money, was the carving. You know those little like nativity scenes with the wooden camel and the wooden Christ. He carved those for a living. My mother was housewife and she helped my father in the factory. They worked extremely hard to provide for us a good life. So it's, it was amazing, wonderful symbol life. It wasn't a complicated. So I went to school, grew up in the church and after high school, Ellia team went into the seminary of the Bisley Himba College. And then when he was in his second year, this was 1989, I was arrested by the Israeli soldiers. Um, I was picked up from my bed, from home, uh, three in the morning and the took me to prison. Uh, for what reason? I don't know. I never been given a reason why I was arrested. I never been convicted of anything.

Speaker 6:          00:08:01       I was picked up from my bed, uh, three in the morning from my father's house and taken to prison. I was in a solitary confinement in a small cell. He says that the Israeli soldiers basically tortured him, hitting me and putting me outside against the wall with a bag of my head under the rain and the cold. And they kept asking me, you tell us what you did wrong. Tell us what you did wrong. I said, I have nothing to tell you. Uh, and a few months later, he was released with no explanation. This was a bizarre experience. When he got home. After I get back from, uh, Kmart from prison, there was a lot of people came to our house. They will say, oh, look, see what they did to you. Now you have to do this to them. You know, they'd come to recruit you a to belong to a political party.

Speaker 6:          00:08:46       In this case, it was the Palestinian Liberation Organization, which at the time was explicitly an armed resistance movement that often targeted Israeli citizens. And the, they will say, oh, look, see what they did to you and now you have to do this to them. And I said, absolutely not. Uh, this is not the way I want to live the rest of my life. You know, I always wanted to be engaged in a place where I can bring hope. I can, uh, help people. And, uh, the only way I can do that was through, uh, being, uh, become a minister. So he doubled down in his studies, finished seminary with working in Palestine. And then in the early nineties, uh, he was actually sent to start a new Lutheran Church in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.

Speaker 2:          00:09:34       So, uh, I came to Brooklyn 1995. I remember on the first day I was shocked because Viking Down Fifth Avenue, if you take the whole neighborhood in, and we are in Bay Ridge, which I actually did not too long ago on eight bike. Uh, what you notice is, uh, on the right we have Leif Erickson park a nod to the, uh, neighborhoods Scandinavian past this sort of crazy mix of different kinds of people. The Bay Ridge Bakery, beautiful neon sign looks like it hasn't changed much since the 1960s. Johnny pumps a firemen bar, firefighter bar. Did I hit record?

Speaker 2:          00:10:19       I did hit record. I write skinflint pub. It's sort of like looking at a geological cross section of the neighborhood's history, the bean post pub, the Schnitzel House. On the left, you can see how groups of people layered themselves on top of groups of people making themselves part of one of the most deeply mixed neighborhoods in the country. And when you get just a little bit south, it's impossible to not notice. One of the latest groups trying to settle in [inaudible] furniture almost got hit by a car on the Yemen cafe, El Zahar. Hello. Meet women walking around and do job. I've got a hookah lounge who can nuts. That sounds nice. Turkish Kebab as are. And how

Speaker 6:          00:11:02       large is the Arab community in the 43rd district? We don't have the exact, because again, Father Leo team, when the sensors, the Bartman kid 10 years ago, they told the Arab community if you are an Arab chick white, uh, so we don't have specific numbers, but the estimates I heard are somewhere between 20 and 30,000. Wow. Living in southwest Brooklyn, that's a huge community. Yeah. I mean that's only about 10% of the total population. But uh, in a Democratic primary for city council, we need only about 4,000 votes to one 4,000 votes total. Yeah, that's it. That's it. Wow. Yeah. I mean the turnout is very low and we have an open seats so we'll have a bigger chance winning because we're not running against an incumbent. How, what's the margin of victory typically? Uh, they can be squeakers I mean a just, uh, several years

Speaker 7:          00:11:54       back, uh, the race was won by just 31 votes. Ah, 31. Yeah. So, so it would seem that if this guy can just, well, despite the fact that there's never been an Arab American on city council before, uh, it seems that if he can get out the, uh, the Arab American vote, he's got a shot shot. I mean, you just told us there's a lot of Arabs there, so he should, he should own this election. Yes. But at the same time,

Speaker 3:          00:12:20       the neighborhood is such a microcosm. I think that Islam is an evil ideology. That's what I think of, like everything that's going on. This is Kayla. Kayla Santos, who also, she's the former deputy director of the Arab American Association of New York. I am from, I'm what you call it. And she said, if you look around the neighborhood, you'll see all these sort of national level issues playing out on the ground. It's like a, you know, like a shadow play or something and I fucking take the travel ban. I mean you've got one of the largest Muslim neighborhoods in the country, right, right next to all of these people who voted for Trump, who support the travel ban. No immigration whatsoever, none, zero and shifting national demographics. We're one of the last remaining New York City neighborhoods where there is still a strong white working class that is in the process of being priced out. Gentrified.

Speaker 7:          00:13:14       [inaudible] is really hitting white people hard and so clearly there's going to be tension there like we've just got a lot of the elements of the struggles and the anxieties that are going on on a national level. So

Speaker 3:          00:13:30       candidate log 1:10 AM with all of this in mind, we still are there in search for new voters. Their Elliot team ended up signing up along with the help with his came pain manager. He's full of dad jokes. It's kind of amazing. The woman you just heard a couple of seconds ago. Kayla? No, I'm the campaign manager for Elliot Team for City Council. Have you guys become like best friends? She is my mother-in-law. Why do you call me your mother-in-law? Cause I love my mother in law set out to represent the Arab community. I am a candidate glowing with no other candidates have gone before. Captain Sea captain encourage this captain Kirk, captain huddles.

Speaker 7:          00:14:14       Was it the fruit? But Dad joke aside, it's true. He really is trying something that's never been tried before and one reason that it's never been tried before is that those 20 some thousand Arab Americans for the last 20 years they've been hiding. Like for me just it's been unnerving to to be in a district where you don't feel like people are watching out for you in your community. This is Linda Sarsour. I have Palestinian Muslim American community organizer born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and she says the key thing to know is that not long after the nine 11 attacks, the u s government in 2003 did engage in a registration. Yeah. She program

Speaker 3:          00:14:50       a registry called n Sears,

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       the national security entry exit registration system, which meant that males over the age of 16 who were from these like 29 countries of origin countries that had a historic connection to terrorism, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Egypt. Go down the list.

Speaker 7:          00:15:09       People from those countries that were visitors, temporary workers, non US citizens had to come and formally register with the federal government.

Speaker 1:          00:15:19       That really told me, give me people, Muslim people treating us like animals. That's it. Linda was there with some of these men providing translation services in this post office like room where there are all these windows the men would be called upon at a time, photographed, fingerprinted, look at their passport, asked them general questions and I noticed that at one point that there were some men that were being told to either leave or just go home and got some stamps in their passport with future appointments or they were telling them to go to the 10th floor. That's when my like something like I got punched in the stomach, like I felt really nauseous. I was like, what's going on here? So when I went to ask the officer, she was told the 10th floor was the FBI headquarters. This wasn't just some information gathering operation. They were planning to deport people. And as this realization sunk in throughout the waiting room, I can't tell you the faces that these people had, like they didn't know what their destiny was. And in fact about 10% of those that did go register were put on deportation proceedings and many of them were deported. No going home, no packing a bag. And I think that's where the divide starts.

Speaker 7:          00:16:23       And so the Arab American population in New York and a Bay Ridge learned it was better to not show up, to not be counted. And then just a few years later,

Speaker 1:          00:16:33       the Associated Press came out with their investigative reports. The Associated Press reports, details how police used informants and New York police department has operated on intelligence unit targeting Muslims. Turns out that after nine 11 the NYP was putting large sections of the community under varying degrees of surveillance. This is not a Puzo. I'm a reporter for the New York Times based in Washington and he, along with this team at the AP back in 2011 broke this story. We found out there was a unit called the demographics unit, secret team of NYP d intelligence officer. These detectives, they were mapping the human terrain of New York snooping around neighborhoods going into different shops, all the Muslim, what's your shops? The cafes, the bookstore's bars and nightclubs. Restaurants could bars marking down things like they play Al-Jazeera and it's this far from a mosque. Informants known as mosque crawlers. Our mosques were under surveillance and so the Arab community in Bayridge who had done nothing wrong, they were terrified. I mean the police were even keeping track of their kids, like which parks do our kids where, where we're playing soccer.

Speaker 7:          00:17:42       Couple of things worth noting here, one, in the end, the operation never turned up any terrorists and to when those things happen,

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       none of their local representatives, no state legislator, no local elected officials stood up and said, this is wrong. Don't target my constituents. You know, these are these people are from my district, nothing. And what that does is it makes you feel like the people quote in power don't care about us. Like we were out on our own. And I started realizing that there was going to have to be a moment where we had somebody in, in the local area, somebody who is Arab, stand up and protect us. And this is where Al Elio TeamSTEPPS in? No, not quite yet. So first Linda started to raise these thoughts with the moms and business leaders, whole bunch of leaders from different institutions and they decided that the first step was to run a candidate, um, for the New York City Council. The idea was start small and start in a place where they have a strong base bay ridge, which also happened to be Linda's neighborhood. And according to her, a lot of the unions and a lot of the people in the politics were like, Linda, this is your seat. You have to run for the seat. So I saw it like unfold before my very eyes.

Speaker 8:          00:18:52       But Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. The politics changed. I think Islam hates us. You know, nobody talks about we need American Muslims on our front frontline. Yes, we have to look at my politically correct radical Islamism. We have to see what's happening and I'm joining me now as let as our floor executive director of the Arab in this new political climate I profile and grew and as our sewer, Jesus, Linda Sarsour. I started doing a lot of national work. She was on all the cable news shows, became a national figure and really a polarizing one. What

Speaker 1:          00:19:31       why is that? Well, in large part because, and I'm sure she would hate me saying this, but her brand oddly is very similar to Donald Trump's. She can be very reactive. She's just going to say it like it is. I say straight. I'm very Brooklyn and maybe too, cause I was born and raised here, but I tell it like it is. I don't really, more than just telling it like it is, she's a provocateur. She's tweeted some tongue in cheek posts about how sharia law wouldn't be that bad. More recently she called the CNN anchor, Jake Tapper, a member of the outright. I mean, she's Brash and feminist poster child Linda Sarsour that this sour sour Linda Sour tits are the conservative media. Yeah,

Speaker 8:          00:20:05       I don't need counseling after I hear Linda Sarsour speak, I just need a bucket jumped all over for it. There is the witch Linda sourcer. She is a radical antisemites. I did not submit to you taking these missteps and warping them into totally unfounded claims. Linda Sarsour, um, she is an extremist who has backed terrorists and that the space won't be happy until this whole goddamn country is Muslim. Very conscious. Emily, thank you for being Tracy.

Speaker 1:          00:20:35       So it just didn't feel right at the moment and didn't want to run for the New York City Council. And so after four or five years of planning, organizing and laying the groundwork so that Linda Sarsour could run and represent

Speaker 7:          00:20:48       the Arab community, there was suddenly this moment of, Oh God, what are we going to do? You know this by the way again is Kayla Santo Sue Oso who at the time was working with Linda at the Arab American Association.

Speaker 9:          00:21:01       And then I remember a moment when at the association I walked in and I said to her like, I just got out of a meeting that Father Kay was in and I was like, well, at that time I was like, I think I was calling him reverend Elliot team. I don't remember what we wrote when I was calling him, but I was like, don't you think he'd be a great person to run for council? And she like slammed her hand down on the table and she's like, Kayla, I was just thinking about the same thing. It was like a light bulb went off. So, uh, we both like started going through our heads of like why he meets us in the middle, got all these connections with people outside of the Arab community. He's a parent, a public school students. He worked at an Orthodox Jewish hospital. He's the clergy, the liaison to the NYP. Di Is Lutheran. He's Arab, but he's Christian,

Speaker 7:          00:21:43       he's not Muslim. And they started thinking like he's going to be able to get votes that no other Arab could

Speaker 9:          00:21:50       like, oh my God, he's like the most intersectional. Let me not use that jargony term. He's like the person with the most complex identity that might just be so complex that it'll work.

Speaker 7:          00:22:03       And so the reached out to me on this said, listen, we want you to do this. And you know, he thought about the fact that doing this it would require him to quit his job. It would be tough on his family, but it felt again like here was an opportunity to help the people around it to help the people in my community. So, so I think, I'm not sure if it's like the end of the September where I became like, yes, 100%

Speaker 10:         00:22:31       [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         00:22:32       and so I would bring my Bush to Sydney Council. A couple months later I announced on February 26 this is not only my campaign, this is yours. Lasage restaurant, a local Lebanese restaurant. Yes. Keith upfront shouting into the microphone, blowing out the speakers. Every single seat was filled. We are going to win as we go into it. And His message to them was essentially we cannot sit and live in the shed anymore. We have to be engaged. We have to be involved. We had to be part of the decision making of this country. We have to bring our perspective to the table because the fact is other people cannot represent us. So let's not stick this to me. We have to present ourselves. I'm really getting lucky with the book in the splits. It's your relationship with God. I don't think so. And

Speaker 7:          00:23:37       pretty much right off the bat, those words like us and ourselves, they presented a series of challenges for father led team. Uh, the first one

Speaker 11:         00:23:46       being a large number of Arab Americans who are American citizens, but they are not registered and they refuse to be part of the political system in this country because they don't trust it. Like here is a community that has avoided government to the nth degree for the past decade and a half. So what does he do? Well, during the month of Ramadan, which is the holy month, and three or four nights a week, he would show up to the mosques with a stack of literature and a larger stack of voter registration forms. They might if I leave my backpack in the car here on the night. I tagged along with him and his campaign manager, Kayla is mosque is actually technically outside. It was hot, muggy Elliott team was dressed in his minister garb, you know, suit and collar and I'm used to the boards and as we walked into the mosque and I take my shoes out here, it wasn't at all clear to me how this was going to go.

Speaker 11:         00:24:40       Considering what's happening in the Middle East, the ward and the division and the different groups. I was not sure if they were ready to support the candidacy of an Arabic Christian to represent them. So we're standing in the back of this huge room that has like green carpet and a low low ceiling. There are like 700 people there standing shoulder to shoulder, all praying in unison, have to do this ritual four times. And then there was a break in the prayer are going to allow me to speak no to address the peoples who didn't know that I am here. So we sort of tiptoe through all these people. They're up at the front of the moon, they introduce him

Speaker 8:          00:25:32       [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         00:25:32       and he launched into this space

Speaker 8:          00:25:34       just in the middle of prevented my disability to New York [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         00:25:39       basically saying, you know, this is our historic opportunity for the Arab community to send their first ever Arab American to city council. And even with the language barrier, you can hear the passion in this speech and to respond to that was tepid

Speaker 4:          00:26:00       at best. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:26:06       So when he was done, we headed out to the front of the mosque and as the service led out, this sea of 700 people come crashing out of the mosque

Speaker 8:          00:26:18       so that my liquor, you haven't had good luck.

Speaker 11:         00:26:24       Their excitement for him is on open display. They're giving him hugs, they're saying we're behind you. We love it.

Speaker 8:          00:26:32       I believe in this guy. I think he is the best candidate in the field and he will well represent the community.

Speaker 11:         00:26:38       Only you can represent the community. We are behind you. 100%

Speaker 8:          00:26:42       yeah, establish [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:26:45       and that evening, 1225 in the morning, we are at mosque number two we went to a second mosque. [inaudible] need to go and then a third. Are you doing good? Get to see each time that same energetic response, people are just pouring out. He seems to know everyone and most importantly, all of the pins people were signing his petition to get on the ballot. Okay. 39 Harden Avenue. Okay, so just sign here and registering to vote. It would just tell him please. No, just throw him. So you just registered to vote? Yes. This is my first time registering many of them for the first time. The best. Did you just register on first time? First Time only for him. You're just a voter. You know what I mean? Oh, what's up brother? Ultimately everybody thinks we're insane when we say we're investing a fair amount of our resources and people who have never voted before and people are kind of like, what? You know, like don't do that. It's a waste of money

Speaker 7:          00:27:50       because for many of these people, the whole thing about registering and then later voting, it was a foreign language to them.

Speaker 8:          00:27:58       Sometimes when he'd ask people to register to vote, they'd respond back while we ordered the give you money and there's 10 but this is the process. Other people thought that just registering to vote was the same as voting for him. I said, no, no, you're the black vote for me. The potter, September 12. But I signed the papers two weeks ago and on top of that we did see signs of that mistrust of government. I have the register. You don't, you want to get the first era of American and city council [inaudible] the first time for a lot of people. [inaudible] hiding under the radar. But still, this is crazy. I didn't think that we would get this much

Speaker 7:          00:28:41       after going from mosque to mosque through all of Ramadan, by like three months before the election, we have registered close to 300 voters. So just at the mosques. Yeah. And do you think, do you think you can get those 4,000 votes from the, from the Arab community alone? We, we are, uh, you know, uh, uh, not counting on the Arab. We can think about 1000 votes from the Arab community. Wait, only a thousand votes. Yeah, just a thousand. Didn't you just say they were tens of thousands of Arab Americans living there? Well, yes, there are. There are. So, but first of all,

Speaker 9:          00:29:16       if I get this correct, about 250 Arab American votes were cast in the last council primary 250

Speaker 7:          00:29:23       even getting to that 1000 number was going to be a heavy lift. And there's one more wrinkle here. So I'm in Brooklyn. We have about 800 families that attend our church. The folks you might expect to be his most ardent supporters, other Arab American Christians. We main Orthodox

Speaker 11:         00:29:41       church in Egypt, like Sharif here, Sharif, s. H. E. R. I. F. Um, I am a deacon in the church. We're gonna vote failure. I don't know. Yeah, they were really interested in supporting him. Will you be voting for Father Heather Elliott team? No. No, no, no. No. You won't be. No. The beginning of my campaign, I tried to reach out to them. No. For me personally, no. I feel pushback. No, no. I don't know. Why is that and what, what, what's going on?

Speaker 6:          00:30:10       Well, the Arabic Christians in our districts are, uh, the vast majority are Republicans. Uh, so yeah, I will say 95% of them are Republicans. So that's number one. Number two, you have the situation in Egypt where Christians are being,

Speaker 7:          00:30:30       um, four now been killed after bombing Christian churches in Egypt, uh, of churches are being burned.

Speaker 11:         00:30:37       George's Church and Taunton ripped apart these radical groups,

Speaker 7:          00:30:40       isis claiming responsibility.

Speaker 11:         00:30:42       Many of the dead are children.

Speaker 6:          00:30:45       Um, yeah, you, you see there's tensions. Well, and so is there a level of distrust in the Christian Arab community of you because you are so close with the Muslim Arab community here? I mean, I will give you an example. I have very close, a friend of mine, his name is Francois. And so people went out to him and saying, we cannot support him. And he said, why not? Why? He said, because he's very close with the Muslims and they will take advantage of him. So, but this is the dynamics, this is what's happening. So eventually they decided only going after the Arab vote. Wasn't the right numbers game, like that's just not, it's just not gonna work. And so what that meant was I need to get 3000 votes from non Arabs in the district to win this election.

Speaker 11:         00:31:31       In other words, he was going to have to convince the majority white voters that he could represent them too, which wasn't going to be easy. All right. Walking down fifth year, as I discovered when maybe a month before the election, I went on a stroll to try to take the pulse of some of the neighborhoods, white residents. Have you lived here in Bay Ridge for awhile? All my life. Has the neighborhood changed a lot? Yes. It's more, it's more foreigners than American. Scary. Listen to us as 78 year old Irish woman. You have newcomers coming into our district. What do they know about it? Nothing. They do not know. And when I asked them about Father Lee team specifically, what did, do you know anything about him? No, I don't. And I don't care to, honestly, I'd never heard of them. The one that's running right, he's Egyptian. He's Palestinian. Okay. Pouch still Egyptian. That's how I feel. I just completely turns

Speaker 7:          00:32:40       me off. And just to be clear here, you're a democrat. Yes. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. These are Democrats. If anybody asks me to the vote for Donald Trump or he was running, I would turn around and Hell No. But I feel this is our country. This is America. And I feel American person should be in for office. Was that representative of what you heard? Was that, uh, on that street on that day? Yes. Uh, but clearly it's not like everyone down there has these opinions and this by no means excuses their behavior or language, but I think it explains some of it that they see rent prices going up and dozens of new Arab folks moving into the neighborhood every month. But these are not the gentrifying forest though. This is oddly enough, the Arab immigrants and even more so the Chinese immigrants, they in some ways are, let's talk about the issues that I hear and, and every issue, jumping back to the debate from the top of the piece, this is one of the Republican candidates, Liam McCabe, overcrowded schools, whether it's infrastructure and transportation, it can be traced to one particular issue in South Brooklyn.

Speaker 7:          00:33:47       And that isn't illegal home conversion. Absolutely. Developers or landlords are taking these single family homes, knocking out all the walls on the ground floor in the second floor, and then putting up these, uh, these temporary walls, building these very tiny cramped domiciles that they can then rent out to 10 or 15 families. Oh. And what that does is first of all, it's incredibly unsafe for the people living in the house, but also it's putting stress on the sewer system and streets. Uh, it causes classroom sizes to go up. Uh, housing prices go up because there are just less actual single family homes on the market. Uh, it's making the neighborhood more dense than it was ever meant to be. And so for a lot of these people who have lived in this neighborhood for a long time, uh, I think it feels like their daily lives are being effected by these forces outside their control and they are reacting emotionally to those things.

Speaker 6:          00:34:45       So you're fighting for 'em I'm fighting for the district fighting to make sure the quality of life. Just one example, there's a couple months before the election lea team was going around knocking on doors. And what are your views on illegal immigration? Uh, we need to do the immigration reform. We need to make sure the undocumented are protected. Our sanctuary city. No, no, you don't read my book. It's not a sanctuary city. No, I'm interested in to follow federal law. I get my clock out of my sight. Alright, thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          00:35:15       You paid it all

Speaker 7:          00:35:21       in several of the Republican candidates.

Speaker 5:          00:35:23       You know, I deeply believe that illegal immigration has, it is a big group because of this.

Speaker 7:          00:35:29       We're trying to harness those emotions.

Speaker 5:          00:35:32       Come here legally. Get a handout. Public health benefits. That must stop it.

Speaker 4:          00:35:39       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:35:40       one Republican candidate wrote about me. I am a radical leftist Palestinian clerk. Presumably they're using the word cleric insinuating that you are not, are not in fact Christian but you are Muslim. Is that the insinuation there? Yeah, I mean that is part of the plan. They tried to use the feel of the people against my candidacy. Then the comments and the need that post it is just terrifying. I'm going to hang him. For example, one guy said all this one, I cannot read it on radio, but I will show it to you. Read it. He, he's a fucking asshole and should be treated as such. I have lived in this community for the best 22 years and never in my life faced anything like this. And does really interesting because the attacks not only coming from Republicans but also coming from Democrats in the race a but the Democrats, they don't kind of under the table.

Speaker 6:          00:36:33       Oh, your team claims that some of the Democrats are making the argument that yes, he might be able to win a democratic primary. Uh, but because he's Arab, he won't be able to win the general election. So don't waste your vote on him. And Justin Brandon, who's really the establishment, Democratic Front runner in the race, his flyers and his lit says, oh, what a neighborhood, our guy, uh, so for me as an Arab American who are living here, what that supposed to mean, it is a [inaudible] a statement of exclusion and that I, I'll just say on that, uh, as a white dude from Wisconsin, when I see that flyer, I don't see that division in that. Am I just blind to it? We, you have to understand the context of the neighborhoods and the context is everything wrong in the neighborhood is [inaudible] the Arab and the Chinese, you know, if the streets is dirty because of these dumb erupts, you know, like when I go out and say I'm fighting for the community and say Hasi is just only fighting for his community, it means only the Arab people. But if somebody else said the word community, it's okay. It means everybody. And I don't mean to push back, but it seems like, okay. It seems like you two are essentially doing the same thing to one another. Yeah. He's saying, when you say the word community, it's only about the Arab community. And when he says our neighborhood, you're saying he's just talking about the white folks in Bay Ridge. Isn't it the same thing happening in both directions?

Speaker 6:          00:38:05       It could be a, but we need to understand the backgrounds. We have a president who use so much rhetoric. He came up with the Muslim ban and building the wall and, and attacking minorities and people of color. Uh, our councilman and his staff never took a stand on these issues and came out in support of the Arab and Muslim community. That's, you have to look at the history and, well, it seems like maybe his opponents are playing up this kind of identity politics over and over again. I saw Elliott making explicit

Speaker 11:         00:38:36       attempts to reach out across those boundaries. I like this. And Republicans take this, for example, at this noisy firefighter bar, he strolled up to this table of burly white men and just started giving hoax. And I mean, just listen to how Brooklyn he sounds here. Let's do that once more. Are you filming? Is he behaving like you'd be like, yes please.

Speaker 9:          00:39:03       The whole thing has been a really delicate line. Kayla Santos who so because we really want it to be honest and, and not adjust too much. Um, but while also like letting people know that this campaign wasn't just for the Arab community, it was for them as well,

Speaker 11:         00:39:17       nine, nine to 59 and so the campaign was also focusing on things that, well, things that mattered to everyone. What's happening here,

Speaker 9:          00:39:26       they're doing a complete renovation of the station. There's no r train at the station,

Speaker 11:         00:39:30       you know, a real daily life concerns. The physician is going to be closed for at least five months. As you see, it's chaotic. On a cloudy morning lea team set up a podium right in front of the cordoned off staircase of a closed subway station and railed against the MTA for doing with next to no warning at all these repairs that were really just cosmetics weren't needed at all. We think about our students, we think about our small business owners a months about shoves, who will be affected, impacted for the closing this station for no reason. I mean, what's more unifying here in New York then complaining about the subway to improve the city. And he also went after specific groups, groups who were traditionally white.

Speaker 11:         00:40:14       I just want to say thank you so much for this opportunity to invite me to be with you tonight. Uh, like on this rainy Thursday night in this wide WCA multipurpose room that felt a lot like an elementary school cafeteria. And I thank you for inviting me to share my reasoning why I'm running for city council. And also to tell you that I will be very proud to be the first one to represent the democratic socialist in City Hall, who, who are the Democratic Socialists? These are the Bernie Sanders people. And the important factor now is there are lots of anti-establishment white people in this district.

Speaker 9:          00:40:52       This neighborhood in the presidential primary went Bernie and went Trump. He beat Hillary. He beat Hillary in this district. So, oh, your team has to put on the clothes of yes. A Brooklyn Jew and watching him try to do that

Speaker 11:         00:41:05       couple of things struck me. It said that was born and raised in Bethlehem, Palestine. Uh, and my father actually also carpenter, no, no relation. Not In this first how he was intentionally bringing parts of himself to the for uh, well pushing other parts into the background. So I'm going to tell you that uh, we have some commonalities together and second we are committed to justice and I think that's why you are here tonight, right? Yeah. Otherwise you all in the wrong room.

Speaker 6:          00:41:34       No. How we highlighted specific policies that represented those parts of himself. Issues like economic justice. If free education, our universities, I have two daughters in college and I know how much it cost me. I know that my wife and I, we have to get a second job to be able to pay for them to go to college. So they decide to support them or no?

Speaker 3:          00:41:56       Well in fact they did. He was endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America, both the local and national chapters of the organization, which was a huge deal. Yes. 100%. And that was like, hey, we are a business now. It's now it's interesting, right? Because with that endorsement came some real support. I came to the campaign through the DSA. DSA seemed like a good conduit locally. They committed hundreds of volunteers. We had 150 200 volunteers yesterday. The sort of manpower that allowed them to flood the neighborhood and knock on thousands of bottles. Michael, I mean need to about trying to convince people to vote. Flint people understood the stances on the legislation. Really excited about that. I'm feeling good,

Speaker 6:          00:42:52       Dara, and more than just helping them knock on doors because of the national endorsement on many evenings of the week, they actually had folks from all over the United States phone banking for him, calling from places like Florida to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Again, pitching people to vote for father your team. I'm trying to show that my candidacy for city council. It is for everyone in this district and this is this. I find this so fascinating about you that I see such a contradiction in everything you're saying there that you're saying you want to represent the whole community, which I'm sure you do, but at the heart of it, like what's motivating that is wanting to give voice to this group of people that don't have a voice. Absolutely. I mean that is 100% and I cannot deny that. I mean one of the most motivating factors me running because I wanted to make sure my community has a voice and has representation, but I'm running to the present everyone, you know, I mean at this weird, because you know, uh, was that a question in your mind going into this, like how do I walk this in incredibly tiny, tight rope of telling the Arab community, I am you and this is our moment, but simultaneously telling the majority of the neighborhood like, but I'm still you too.

Speaker 6:          00:44:24       Like don't worry. I can be both. People have to understand my identity. I mean I went and knocked on thousands doors. We talked to people and my, my talking points of the door was always, I'm a father of four. My wife is a school nurse. Um, uh, I love this community. And then the, I didn't speak on the, about the Arab and Muslim community. I spoke about affordability, livability in the community. We spoke about transportation, we spoke about, uh, police accountability. We spoke about things that people in the community said in this district said, yes, we are going to support you. We need somebody like you who can go and our behalf. So at the end of the day, uh, my identity is who I am. I am running as who I am and I will not allow anybody to take that away from me.

Speaker 7:          00:45:15       And so just a couple of days before September 12th, uh, before the election, I checked in with Kayla to see how things were looking. How many days do we have left here? Five days.

Speaker 12:         00:45:26       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:45:31       Yeah. And apparently she told me, uh, as l u team and his canvassers had been going around to all of these doors knocking. They had been taking notes on people. And in those notes, each person was given a number from one to five

Speaker 3:          00:45:44       based on their level of support. One is like that person was so pro Elliot team, you didn't even need to go to that door. You're just marking them down. Five is like, sorry, I'm voting for somebody else. Twos and ones are positive ids

Speaker 7:          00:45:58       and just a couple of days before the election, an election, I'll remind you, they only need 4,000 votes to win. The number of positive ids they had was 5,500 so you currently have 5,500 give or take. Yeah, ones and twos.

Speaker 6:          00:46:13       Yeah, so will be very interesting to see how the prime minister will be translated in numbers when the September 12 comes.

Speaker 7:          00:46:20       Okay, well we're going to take a break and when we come back it'll be election day. Election Day.

Speaker 3:          00:46:27       This is Jeffrey and this is Marjorie from Boise, Idaho. Radiolab is supported in part by the offered piece, Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 8:          00:46:46       in Los Angeles. You know about the $4,000 a month apartment to hundred dollars pet grooming sessions and the $7 lattes. But what really causes gentrification and who wins and loses as a neighborhood changes. I'm soul Gonzales, host of, there goes the neighborhood la from KCRW and w NYC studios. It's a new podcast series about a change in Los Angeles. Listen and subscribe to their goes to neighborhood where ever you get your podcasts.

Speaker 7:          00:47:19       Jad Roberts, Radiolab, and we're going to go back to Simon Adler. Should we do election day? Yeah, yeah. Let's have an election. Okay. What happens? So the election, uh, this is September 12th. All right, so it is six

Speaker 11:         00:47:30       in the morning when he 17 son is yet to rise. We are outside the a l e a team a get out the vote headquarters. Here we go.

Speaker 3:          00:47:39       Where's the lift that we're using for that, ma'am?

Speaker 11:         00:47:43       And so I show up at six in the morning and everything is already a buzz already over there. It's crazy. There were dozens of volunteers, staff workers.

Speaker 3:          00:47:50       You're all so amazing. Thank you for coming this morning. I'll bring around these plastic folding tables that were set up everywhere. Don't leave without one or two signs. So what we're going to do is we're going to give you a giant stack of literature. Says, all right, sweet. And shortly, shortly after I got there, uh, Kayla [inaudible], Father Elliott team both arrived

Speaker 4:          00:48:15       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:48:16       we're matching. That's pretty awesome.

Speaker 11:         00:48:18       No, it's got the memo. Yeah, right. They were in a matching Democrat, blue Kayla in blue jeans and a blazer father Elliott team, uh, in an Oxford with the, the white collar and blue through saying today's election that wow, this is a September 12th and as quickly as he arrived. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:48:36       no, uh, no opposition, insight and uh, enjoy yourself was sent out to start that. Oh yeah. 86th,

Speaker 1:          00:48:44       beautiful day in the neighborhood.

Speaker 11:         00:48:46       And so a sub beautiful day in the neighborhood. We hopped in his car and that was sort of the beginning of the day. And really his job was just to shake as many hands of as many people as he could in as many different disparate parts of the district as possible. Are you boarding today? The hot southeast you speak Arabic or English, what should be

Speaker 9:          00:49:04       be the basis of whether or not you win a race, his Id and pull id as many positive ideas as you can. Pull out as many of those people on election day pull out, meaning pull them to the polls. Exactly. Get as many of your positive ideas out to the polls as you can and for their campaign to do this, we have to effectively have two different operations.

Speaker 11:         00:49:27       First and foremost.

Speaker 1:          00:49:28       I know, sorry [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:49:33       There's gotta be an Arab community operation. You've worked, so we have likely Arabic speakers.

Speaker 11:         00:49:37       Their assumption was that an Arab voter is going to need their handheld much more tightly to get them to the polls.

Speaker 1:          00:49:45       It's like a lot of these people have never been to the polls before and so, okay, can you just give her a message? Then they had like six people on their phones just going down these lists. I'm calling to speak to [inaudible] calling people saying, have you come out and voted today? The family, thank you so much. Simultaneously, that same person who has been called, I'm basically the person that actually make sure that you go boat is being flanked by a group of canvassers. All right? This is a Mohammad

Speaker 11:         00:50:11       marching up to their apartment and banging on their door saying

Speaker 1:          00:50:16       one C, two e BD, four a and 40 come out and vote. We're gonna pull you out to you eyes. Know what

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       time we're going to say like, what time are you going to the polls up from the wartime nine or, yeah, nine [inaudible]. We need you to go, go father k needs you to go. I met him.

Speaker 7:          00:50:36       They had this very, uh, long script they would go through and I don't remember all of the Arabic, but they would often say, so are you going to the polls today? And the response would be, and Shalla like God willing. And they weren't supposed to accept that. They'd have to say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and Charlotte tomorrow, today, not God willing. You Willing? And then they would have to get them to say either like I promised on my head or I promise on my heart. And if they got either of those, then they felt like they had imposed social pressures that would work on the Arab community. Yeah,

Speaker 9:          00:51:06       and then on top of all this, we have to do the standard operation of get out the vote with the triple prime voters, which is like the voters that have that reliably vote in primaries in this community. Largely white, largely over the age of 50 all right.

Speaker 11:         00:51:20       Saint Nicholas old folks home, he voted. I am back again going into nursing homes, sending out even more canvassers and even the occasional shout out the passenger window of your car and early on in the day back at the campaign headquarters.

Speaker 3:          00:51:40       All right. If I need to read that [inaudible] yeah, I need somebody who's a free now when he needs it to go become a quote from him.

Speaker 11:         00:51:48       It was clear just how complicated and resource intensive running these two parallel campaigns was. Just a couple of people at to vote a, I'm going to say the that'll your team had just received a call from several Muslim women saying that they needed a ride to the polls. His wife, grace was going to go pick them up, but she needed someone to,

Speaker 3:          00:52:06       I mean the, and you know I'm going to go with them to get the voters. So this organizer said she would do it, but she, no, no, no. You can leave the table. You guys do. Yeah, I'll deal with it.

Speaker 7:          00:52:18       Pain directors, Andy, it said no, you've got to stay.

Speaker 3:          00:52:21       Don't text whatsapp. WHATSAPP. I live with a girl. Take this one. I'll take care of this. Can pick up a voter. Yes. Mohamed, can it be Mohammed like just send Mohammad [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:52:34       it turns out, uh, Mohammed doesn't speak.

Speaker 3:          00:52:36       Somebody speaks Arabic, which no, look necessarily eventually turned out to not actually be a problem. So why doesn't Mohammad please those I know. I know. I know. So why does it mamas, they can too much come here. So go. But then we dad pointed out earlier that if these are women,

Speaker 11:         00:52:57       it would be more appropriate for all those going to pick them up to be women.

Speaker 3:          00:53:01       Um, [inaudible] you know, cultural stuff that say what can be here. I can take my place for a little bit. I'll think your president. So finally busy day, hectic.

Speaker 7:          00:53:13       They said we. Dot. Just go. Yeah, exactly. And this was all for just two votes, but I will say despite all that, midway through the day, it did appear like this two pronged approach was working. This is his first time voting. I

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       voted yes. Good. Yeah, I did. Yeah, you did those 50 doors. 50 doors. Yeah. 71 people,

Speaker 11:         00:53:33       canvassers. We're getting good feedback. And on the street that that Adam anthem, both first time voters will have just told him Arab folks

Speaker 3:          00:53:41       and hello, I bought it for your white folks. We're coming up to him and saying like what happened about hey, we voted for you. [inaudible] this is rob yet the canvasser who's been with the campaign from the beginning. You don't understand what this means for the Abbey medical community. You only know what it means. So it's pretty personal. Have you voted today right? I'm going to get all the money. You're getting emotional. I don't want to be emotional. My husband is banned in Malaysia because he swim yet, man.

Speaker 4:          00:54:18       Okay, Ken, do this cause I'm chilling. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:54:21       Yeah, that's good. Have you voted. Thank you. So yeah, it is very personal.

Speaker 4:          00:54:34       Okay.

Speaker 11:         00:54:35       But then, hi, how are you in Elliott team's car at about two in the afternoon. How's the numbers looking? They got their first sense of what voter turnout was looking like.

Speaker 4:          00:54:54       Yeah, right, right. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:55:04       So the numbers side of that were underperforming in a few poles sites where we should be doing better. And you know, uh, sorry, let me start that again. I'm like frazzle now. Um, this is Mohammad con the campaigns treasurer. Yeah. The number said that, you know, poll sites where we have strong support are showing lower turnout than we are hoping for. Um, so obviously we don't know who people are voting for, but we're guessing that since the last people are voting their overall, that means that less folks are voting for us. And then pull sites where we know our opponent has strong support and we're seeing higher turnout. And so w what are the strategies to remedy that? So we just need to allocate more canvassing resources to areas where we see underperformance so we can turn more people out to vote. So go knock on those doors hard, knock on the doors, pull people out of their homes and make sure they vote.

Speaker 3:          00:56:02       And so with about four hours remaining. Yep. So right now it's all about talking to individuals, dragging people off the streets. All of the leaders of the campaign, including Linda Sarsour. You literally got to find people that are recognizable. If hit the streets, I'd go to shops. I got Steve at the move of North Bay Ridge. They were literally going into Arab owned stories, telling them, you gotta go to the polls and you did not. I'm taking you right now. Barbershops, Delis, hookah, lounges. Yeah, he's going go vote. This symptom is $80 fee to vote. [inaudible] changing his clothes. You're going to vote. See, they could have two votes. And while this was happening, I don't live in a district. I'm here to help out my way. I'm here to canvas for the final push of volunteers. We're showing up. It's a good time to push again. Yeah. Do we go a fourth pass?

Speaker 8:          00:56:47       Yes. Go, go, go, go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

Speaker 7:          00:56:52       And when they got the updated turnout numbers. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:56:54       Yeah. We have two of our poll sites that have been hit at 115% of turnout already seem to be working. So we just got to keep that up. What's the, what's the emotion at the moment? Yeah. I don't know. I mean it's a close race there. I like it. At least it feels like it based on the turnout numbers that we're seeing in the way that turnout is happening. There's basically two strongholds that are currently developing North Bay Ridge, South Bay Ridge.

Speaker 7:          00:57:16       Oh, a South Bay Ridge, which is largely white, seems to be turning out hard for the establishment candidate, Justin Brannan. Uh, and North Bay Ridge is where, uh, the majority of the Arab Americans live. And in that moment, uh, the campaign makes it,

Speaker 3:          00:57:31       um, so at this point we're zeroing in all of our efforts on just, you know, everything north of 75th street,

Speaker 7:          00:57:39       that the only way to win is to push hard to get as many votes as they can in those Arab American neighborhoods and essentially right off trying to convince the white voters. So this is like, you know, we got it. It's our people are going to make the difference. It'll be good for our people. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:57:56       We're doing good. We've got to stay in our town. Yeah, that's it. And the focus on our part of town. And so

Speaker 7:          00:58:01       would like an hour remaining. Everyone went out. Let's do this for one final point.

Speaker 3:          00:58:06       Sure. [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:58:11       I see when I come back, cars were driving by honking their horns for him in southwest Brooklyn. Really believe this just wrote the 12 hour shifts. [inaudible] thank you so much. Thank you so much my man. Thank you so much brother. Thank you. I'll be in my living room as I'm going. I'm going to all the best companies. Can you take a picture of us? Sure. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:59:04       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:59:05       uh, by my watch, it is a nine o'clock.

Speaker 2:          00:59:10       [inaudible] the campaign is over. [inaudible] shall love. I didn't, I was with lea team right when we hit nine o'clock. And in that moment, I don't know from where, but someone handed him what's up baby. Okay. An infant. And he was just standing on this dark street, uh, his back against a minivan, his face illuminated by the light pouring out from his campaign headquarters with this baby in one arm and his cell phone press tightly up against his ear asking Kayla,

Speaker 3:          00:59:44       I don't know what the numbers were looking like. We're still counting.

Speaker 11:         00:59:55       All of his volunteers, staff and supporters were gathering in the patio of this bar pizzeria called the firefly that over to the soul waiting there for Elliot team to arrive as well as the results. Kayla called me as I was woken up to the firefly pizzeria because at that time, the numbers from South Brooklyn came in. She said, I've added these results with what we already know. And uh, she said, uh, we lost.

Speaker 4:          01:00:28       Mm.

Speaker 11:         01:00:29       The moment before I walked into [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:00:31       badly, let's see about the fight or flight.

Speaker 4:          01:00:49       [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         01:00:59       after word got around that they had in fact lost on Linda Sarsour.

Speaker 3:          01:01:04       So, um, stood up on this picnic table and addressed everyone. I know a lot of folks who are here who are not children of immigrants, or if you're not Arab American or Muslim, you do not understand what this campaign meant to us and to our communities. And for us it is not over. And I want to say to father, father, father color did not have to do this. He did not have to quit his job, a father of four. But Father Heather did it. He did it to help us build the political voice that we knew we always had in this community to allow people to pay attention to us and our issue. Guys, we're doing this again without any backup.

Speaker 4:          01:01:57       [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         01:02:05       wait, so we lost do we to, do we know, do they know why? Yes. So ended up losing by a just under 700 votes, which is about 7% of the total votes cast, which we know what, what, uh, what, what accounted for the difference? Yeah. We, we can't

Speaker 7:          01:02:20       know for sure why, uh, because the voter records don't come out until December. But there are a couple of things that we do know. One was that, uh, there were no Arabic translators at the polls. Really? Yeah. You see how far I can get? I'm just following. We actually had reporters, Syrah, Karrie go down into one of the polling locations to see exactly what was going on.

Speaker 3:          01:02:42       Hi. Can I just ask what languages you guys are translating Cantonese and Mandarin? I bet you kintone Spanish. English to Spanish. Okay. Is there somebody a, an Arabic translator?

Speaker 2:          01:02:55       Fortunately Arabic is not a approved language for him to have an interpreter in Brooklyn will actually in New York. I believe it's sustainable.

Speaker 7:          01:03:04       Turns out what languages are provided in any borough of New York City. A are decided upon based on census data and because there is no census data. Oh, come on in Arab community. So angry. Yeah. That's why. Did they say you can't come here? Like are they or do they just go neutral? Well, the, the problem was, uh, the interpreters that the campaign was attempting to provide for these folks at several of the polling locations, they were actually turned away from the polls. I told you by the New York state officials, by the election, people, by the folks working the polls were really, which I, which it turns out is illegal. They were illegally turned away. They were illegally turned away. But, um, despite all that, they did in fact get out more Arab American voters than have ever turned out for a race like this, like by a factor of four by oh four.

Speaker 7:          01:03:55       That's interesting. Where they ended up, uh, coming up short, it would seem, uh, is with the white voters and uh, nobody has a perfect explanation for this, but I, I did talk to some political movers and shakers down in the area and they, uh, they offered up sort of three different explanations. Um, one is that, uh, the message that he was delivering to the white folks just failed to connect. The second one is that, uh, having these two campaigns at the same time, one for the Arabs, one for the white folks, that that just damned him from the beginning. Just like in terms of resources or in terms of messaging, all of the either a and then the third one is that, uh, this had nothing to do with him. This had nothing to do with this campaign. Just in this moment there were not enough white folks who would be willing to vote for an Arab candidate. Uh, no matter what.

Speaker 2:          01:04:41       No, no. It's nice to hear, to be able to speak back to it. We're emotionally, where are you? Are you like, all right. Have you or you like gotten past

Speaker 7:          01:04:55       a couple of weeks after the election? Um, I headed back down to Bay Ridge to sit down one more time with father lea team. Well, the truth is that I haven't taken a day off yet. Why? Because I've been so busy. Why are you doing this to yourself? Not doing this to myself. It is just a, a, the outcome of this campaign has been unbelievable. So

Speaker 6:          01:05:18       the moment we finished with the campaign, we continued to meet to discuss the political power that we have built, whether we are going to do with it, because we have almost 3000 people came out and voted. We can make a difference in any election. And that's why I said we cannot slow down. Now. We need to continue to educate the community. We need to continue to be engaged with them. We cannot lose the momentum. We cannot afford to lose the momentum. We just can't. So this is, are you a politician now? Like in that way, this is the will of the community. We have demands, we have political power and um, we have an address now and the address is Heather Elliott team. Uh, so elected officials, we will not talk to us. You come and speak to us through Heather Elliott team. That's the only way you can talk to us.

Speaker 13:         01:06:10       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          01:06:11       wow. Yeah. I feel like what struck me in that conversation, uh, with like he spent his entire campaign trying to speak to all sorts of different groups. He was saying, I can represent you all. I am yours. Everyone, but in that final conversation, uh, what I heard from him in that it was a can becoming more and more a voice of just one group, one community, his community.

Speaker 11:         01:06:39       Mm. Well that's, yeah, but I sat co, you know, this is the game. I feel like this is him recognizing the nature of the game and deciding to come from a position of strength. And I say awful. I'm also, you want him to basically tightened his grip on the Arrow vote and then walk into room after room. Of course, New York City, you say, when you want to our votes deal with me. I've got votes to push. I've got votes to given with hold of my boss. I tell you what I want. I want that community to step out and be heard and have a voice and this is how it happens. I think it has to, if you believe in this system, it has to be possible for someone talented enough to be able to stand up and say two things at the same time. Two things that seem contradictory that he does believe in and that has to be possible. Yeah, I understand that. But I mean in this particular moment, in this particular, I mean, I don't think identity politics is a choice in this moment. You know? I mean, you remember the woman who was like still Egyptian, still Egyptian. He's being seen as one thing that he is not, that that doesn't mean choosing what do you do? You can't just like pretend to have a rainbow coalition when there's no chance of that or you can fight.

Speaker 7:          01:07:49       Ah, you got that out of your system.

Speaker 11:         01:07:54       Yes. Sorry, just you were saying through your piece here. I'm sorry. Yes. So how does he feel?

Speaker 7:          01:08:00       Yeah, I was going to say, oddly enough, uh, I tried to put all of this in front of him. Well, that uh, that brings me actually to the question that I think is at the heart of everything I've watched is you were really trying transcend identity politics. You were trying to at one time speak to those people and yet at the same time say no, that my Arab ness has nothing to do with this. You tried to do both. And I think

Speaker 4:          01:08:27       that,

Speaker 7:          01:08:29       I worry that that is why it didn't, yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:08:31       Work.

Speaker 6:          01:08:34       Mm. I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:08:36       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:08:38       Uh, I have to think about what you just said, but, uh, uh, you know, I went out there as myself as an Arab American Lutheran Pastor, but I had to take stands on issues that really mattered to me and to the things that I am passionate about.

Speaker 7:          01:08:56       What does that mean? You're sort of a better person than you are a politician?

Speaker 6:          01:09:01       I like to see myself like that. Definitely. I mean, I did, I did what I thought, what my team thought was the right thing to do.

Speaker 4:          01:09:11       And, uh,

Speaker 7:          01:09:12       would you, would you run again?

Speaker 6:          01:09:18       Uh, sure. Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:10:10       [inaudible] [inaudible]
