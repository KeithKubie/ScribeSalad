Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and

Speaker 3:          00:00:08       ahhh

Speaker 2:          00:00:17       just checking in on you. Are you doing, sorry. It's like eight 15 in the morning. My wife's gonna fucking kill me. I'm sorry. It's eight 39. All right, so on the other side, eight 30. You don't, let's take those construction rules. You can't hammer a nail until 7:00 AM I can't yell. I'm just checking in on you until, uh, after eight 30 in the morning. That's the deal that we have. All right. Um, what's going on? How were, how was your, your, um, your in between Christmas and New Year's? Do you guys get the time off? You know, I know the kids do kids on break, you know, just in time to fucking run into that chick from high school, you always try to beg, give it a shot, right? Everybody else did. You have to go to work on the 26th and the 27th year right there. You're right back.

Speaker 2:          00:01:06       It's the fucking worst. Everybody should be off. You shouldn't even be able to buy food this time of year. Everything is fucking closed. Everybody just sit down, fucking relax. You know, take a week for yourselves. We could this fucking country, man, we gotta be more like Europe. I don't know how they do it over there with their fucking God damn skinny jeans. You know they fucking legs are skinny as their arms over there and those tall people, countries, you know the Scandinavian countries, you know down in the Mediterranean, these motherfuckers, they get like six weeks vacation a year. It's fucking incredible. Why don't we do that? Huh? President to be Donald Trump. You want to make this country great? You can make this country what? It never fucking had six weeks of vacation every, you know fucking ah, that would be good one. How great would that be? Every two months you just get a week off, right? Then you work for seventh lucky seven. You work for seven fucking weeks. Then you get a week off and just sit there and fucking chill out and start, you know, let all the stress of your job go fucking start over. Everybody is off at the same time. Cops, pilots, you know, people who watch the nuclear fucking facilities, you just, you know, it's not good. Not that's going to happen. Right. What's this? The Simpsons? It's fine. Everybody just chill. Even a war. That's it. Every fucking seven weeks. Boom.

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       Right?

Speaker 2:          00:02:47       Several weeks you try to kill each other and then, you know, right when it hits the eighth week, somebody stands up out of that trench. [inaudible] oh really? I

Speaker 4:          00:03:01       oh, Liz.

Speaker 2:          00:03:04       Oh right. He just fucking chill up. This is it. This is basically the deal. I am mom really trying to, uh, I think I'm going to fucking talk to somebody. I got to fucking get my temper under control because I don't want to be an angry dad. Uh, I want to break this cycle. Um, so somebody told me yesterday, they go, well, why don't you try metta meditation? And I got the fuck out of here. That works. And the person was like, yeah, I do it twice a day for 20 minutes. And uh, like I'm going to have the time to do that when I have a fucking kid. Uh, twice a day for 20 minutes. And um,

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       he said like, if you just meditate, shut your brain off, your body just starts getting rid of stress. And I asked him, I said, this has made you less angry. He said much less angry. So I'm going to give that a shot and I'm going to talk to somebody, you know, I've been cleaning up all my shit, trying to get rid of a bunch of stuff and I found this empty notebook and I was like, all right, this is going to be like my fucking angry journal, you know, figure out, oh my God. Yesterday I got the, you know, the amount of shit that I just, I just completely, I go from zero to 9,000 fucking degrees. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:04:25       you know, yesterday I pulled up and there was some guy fucking parked in the top of my driveway cause yet another thing was fucked up with my house. They tell you guys the awning fucking broke. It's just, it just never fucking ends. It just never this fucking house. It never rents. I just find myself, I feel like I'm a running in a giant circle that I'm, once I get everything fucking fixed, you know, 360 degrees, rotisserie fucking, uh, uh, whatever the fuck rebuild of this fucking house. The second I do the last thing, the first thing I fixed is going to break and it's just going to start all over again. So, um, anyways, I'm going to try to do that. And um, you know, it's fucking hilarious is like when I actually am calm and I am relaxed, it actually makes my wife nervous in a way. Like not like nervous, like she's afraid I'm going to do something. She's just like, she's like, are you a everything okay with you? Uh, what's, what's going on with you? It's just like nothing. I'm just quiet and relaxing. She's this. Yeah. Are you okay. So, um,

Speaker 2:          00:05:41       I got to dial it way the fuck down. You know, I think my average energy you ever played like pickup whatever sport and there's always that person taking it way too seriously in before the game even starts. They skate up next to you or are they stand next a post up or whatever, you can just feel their fucking energy and you're just like, Oh God, not this fucking guy. I hate to admit it, but I think I'm that guy, except I'm not playing a sport. I'm just fucking walking around my house.

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:06:12       I Dunno what the fuck it is, but uh, I have to work on that shit. So, um, as I've been mentioning, you guys have been getting rid of a ton of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:06:21       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:06:22       You know, selling stuff, having a buddy mind sell it on craigslist, trying to take as little as I can to goodwill because I really believe that they just fill that fucking truck up with 90% of the shit, just throw it in the ocean. So I'm actually trying to sell it to people. Um, just the sheer amount of shit that people bring down to goodwill. Like people use goodwill, you know what I mean? Without ever addressing their fucking consumerism. And I did it too, like how much shit I bought and just how every time you leave the house, she come home with something else in a bag and then it's just in your fucking house. Like when me and Nia first moved in with two people in a fucking house, I mean, it was like echo, echo, and all of a sudden, five years later, it's fucking filled up. I'm like, what? What happened? How did we become these people? So Woo Woo. So I'm, I'm, I'm getting rid of like all of this clutter.

Speaker 1:          00:07:22       Uh, you

Speaker 2:          00:07:22       know, like I have every fucking laptop just about that I've ever fucking had. I've always kept them because I dunno, like I always hear that, you know, they end up in junk yards and something leaks out of him. And I'm like, well, why don't I just leave it in my fucking closet? It's not hurting anything. It's just sitting there and then I got to where there, then I got three, then I got four. So a, I'm going to try to find a place that recycles them responsibly. Um, so anyways, throughout all of this, people go, you gotta check out this documentary, these guys, the minimalists. And um, I started to watch it the other night and, uh, I'm totally on board. It's what I want. And I'm watching it with the [inaudible]. It's fucking hilarious is I can feel her getting annoyed. And I'm like, yeah, you watching this shit?

Speaker 2:          00:08:08       She goes, yeah. She goes, you know, I don't, you know, I like my stuff, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I kept poking at it to see what the deal was. And she was finally just like, yeah, I just don't give a shit about a bunch of white people that are all excited that they're now living with like absolutely nothing. You know, they, they, you know, if they fucking fuck did she put it? She goes, there's a lot of people live in like that not out of there wasn't a choice. Right. And I was like, Oh, Jesus Christ, we're going to go down that fucking road. We actually had a great conversation. I was like, you know, there's a certain kind of white person that fucking annoys the shit out of you. She goes, no, there it's like, yeah, there is. It's still white person that is not happy in life.

Speaker 2:          00:08:47       It is trying to, to, to figure out what true happiness is because the stereotype of a white person is that they just show in all their dreams come true. All right. These are just a group of people that were living away certain way. It wasn't making them happy. They tried something new, it made them happy and they just want to share it with you. And this is why my wife says shit. She goes, hi. Now that you put it that way, okay, fair enough. I was being judgmental but blah, blah blah. We came, we came to a good place, but it was fucking, she went, I wish you guys could have heard she went on one of her fucking epic rants. I was dying laughing because I, I heard the element of truth in it. But um, I dunno if there is all of that shit though. There is that, that fuck it thing. How every group of people is like defined.

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09:34       You know, by a negative. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09:39       You know, I guess with white people is that, you know, we have yachts and were raised by the maid who's not white and uh, whatever we want we get and then we screw it up and then our parents come in and save us cause they know the judge, you know, and that's definitely, that's an option as a white person, but that's, you know, you've really slicing off the top of the ham there. Anyways. Um, so

Speaker 1:          00:10:07       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:10:08       this is going to be the new me, you know, let's see how long, who the fuck's kid who, let's see a long, I can sustain this. Okay. Because the reality is is you are who the fuck you are. And I am a wound up son of a bitch and um, I'm going to try to unwind as much as I can for as long as I can before I go back into that deep groove than I've worn into how my brain is functioned. A, I'm going to try to fucking meditate. I'm going to get rid of all of this fucking shit that I have accumulated.

Speaker 1:          00:10:48       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:10:49       You know, for years already I've gone to like comedy events and stuff and they're always giving you like this gift bag of it's and it's shit shit. It just, you know, I don't know what the fuck I have to shit. I don't even know what the fuck it is. Little things that jelly beans with the fucking festivals name on it, some toiletries, some travel bag shit, you know, all in a little bag that has the logo, the thing on it. And you're like, I gotta keep this, you know, part of my scrapbook that I don't fucking have and I just, when I started to do is I just say no. I say no. And then if it gets weird and they had this vibe of like, Hey, I'm trying to give you a gift here and you're turning it down. I kind of feel insulted me a little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:11:33       Kind of insulted me a little bit here. I will take the bag and then what I do is I come home and then I just, I give it to somebody. Hey, no, I just did the stay of techie show. You don't want it. Yeah. Take it, take it, get it the fuck outta here. And what's funny too is actually not when you go out and you try and sell your shit, you realize how little fucking value it has. You know what I mean? Um, I dunno. And I should tell you when, as I sell this shit have an element of guilt and I always think of that movie. What about Bob? When that therapist's pass Bob onto Richard Dreyfus, that's what I feel like I'm doing with my stuff is I'm selling it to these people. I'm just looking at him and say by, and I'm like, you're not gonna fucking use that.

Speaker 2:          00:12:16       It's your problem now buddy. Um, so anyways, that's what I've been, uh, that's what I'm doing. I got to a, I have to chill way the fuck out, um, for the next 18 to 22 years, evidently. And uh, so I imagine I'll get some tweets. Don't you think that's going to hurt your comedy? No, I don't. I've been fucking up my life for almost half a century. I have plenty of drawn and just the fact of someone being his wound up as me trying to walk around and act like, you know, wearing a sweater and laughing at small talk is going to do it for me. Right. Right there that there'll be something in that. Right. Well maybe you weren't thinking that. Maybe that's what I'm worried about and I'm saying that you're saying it so I don't look like I'm on fucking weak on some level. Um, so anyways.

Speaker 2:          00:13:09       All right. Jesus Christ's I've just been fucking babbling. Like some chick on one of these fucking shows booked bill. Maybe you got a little fucking reality chicken. You ever think that was fucking God damn cough ever go away. I'm sorry. Let's do that again. You know, I find it really irritating that I uh, took some medication for a cough a long time ago, but a month ago and I haven't, and not smoking cigars. I am getting a good night's sleep and I just, for some reason in order to do this is my wife, uh, is so pregnant right now that she doesn't remotely get cold. So the fucking heat has been off in the house all day. I walk around with like a sweatshirt on. I just looked at, I go, you're not cold at all. Like my feet are fucking free. Like we literally in the house, it's like a log cabin.

Speaker 2:          00:13:57       There's like no, no heat on whatsoever. Even hear it. Now I've got around the background cause she's fucking upstairs. Right. Um, but like, you know, I got this old house and they got these cool fucking old windows and I don't want to get rid of them because they don't make them like that anymore. But the wind just fucking passes through. Oh, the wind just goes right through my fucking house. I swear to Christ. It's unbelievable. Only thing missing is just like leaves just blowing by when I'm in the fucking living room. So I'm always cranking up the fucking hate. She starts looking like she's under like 20 blankets. So I have to, she know what the deal is. As a guy, you're going to fucking lose. You fucking lose. Why do I keep trying to turn on my computer? Like, like I actually have internet connections down here. Um, all right, let's get into the point where I've got to read some of these. Uh, some of these fucking reads here. I've got a doctor's appointment with my wife today. Stupid fucking you've got to go to as

Um, all right, where the fuck am I in this podcast? 20 fucking minutes. And you know something, some days it doesn't feel like work in other days it does. This is one of these days. Um, what do think Obama's thinking right now? I always think like this time of year, this time, like when a president is in their second term, it's fucking December. Okay, you've got another couple of weeks before the next fucking poor bastard comes in there. You know, and I do meet bastard cause it's always going to be a, but it's always going to be a guide. Ladies always going to be a guy. All right? That job is for a man. There's certain things that men can't do and there's certain things that women can't do and women can do a bunch of things, but running the country is, is just not one of those things. I mean people are gonna just gonna take that clip and take all the fucking, you know, I'm just fucking around of it. Out of there.

Speaker 5:          00:21:43       Is he saying that women's, um, hey, what do you call those? Youtube fucking stars, those fucking cunts. You know like when like that guy punched the kangaroo in the face and you want to see it and you go to click on it. And then this is just this fucking high energy. 20 something Douche with the Janet Jackson fucking microphone. Can I take your order? Please? Go on. Okay guys, so you don't get to believe it's okay. See this carrying a root. Okay. We're all familiar with the kangaroo and then they cut to some shit about Kangaroos and they just take this fucking, this fucking clip. It's, it's like, it's like, dude, I don't fucking need you. I know what's going to happen to show me the original clip and these fucking cunts insert themselves into it. And then they, they making like 250 grand, a Goddamn fucking video of some shit. You know, they like the DJ's

Speaker 2:          00:22:38       of Youtube.

Speaker 5:          00:22:40       Yeah. Way Do, do, do, do, do, do to do, to, to do the same fucking thing they're doing that they fucking remix in this shit that take another people.

Speaker 2:          00:22:49       I don't even know what deejaying is. I have no fucking idea. I don't even know why I make fun of boy. Yeah you do bill, because you got to fuck in a half hour to fill up here. Um, anyway, so did I mention I was, I've been trying to do the impossible. I can't remember if I already talked about this. I'm trying to watch like every Bruin game and every Celtic game this year cause you got to choose you either a basketball guy or a hockey guy and I been trying to watch the other night I watched a Bruins game and then a then a fucking Celtic game. I watched the um, I don't know if I already talked about this cause I fucked up the podcast and I just started again. I don't give a shit. I watch the Bruins lose four to three, to the blue jackets and then I watch the Celtics after that beat the uh, Memphis Grizzlies.

Speaker 2:          00:23:33       I believe I already talked about this. I have no idea. All I know is the fucking NFL playoffs are coming up. Does anything repeat anything go by faster then the fucking NFL regular season, you know it goes by faster. My fucking train of thought. I was talking about presidents this time of year. You know how fucking site that would be after eight fucking years of being president. The stress of that, the fucking stress of that. All the bodies, all the people that died because of the decisions that you made, it's fucking inevitable. Okay. Cause you answer, you answered to the, the, the reptilian people at the top. You know, and I don't mean shape shifters, I just mean people who do not give a fuck about anything but themselves and their money and power. That's all they care about. They don't care who suffers. They don't give a shit. They don't believe in God. They believe that their God or they believe that God is fucking, you know, bestowed them with this great responsibility to run the fucking world to try to take over it or whatever. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:24:50       I always just think like, as much as Obama doesn't want to see Trump, he has to be so fucking site. You know, like if I was a bomber right now, I would just be like, dude, I'm getting all the fucking sports packages. I'll get myself a pair of silk fucking pajamas, you know, with sheepskin fucking slippers and I'm not doing shit. I am not going to do fine, but they have to do shit. You know why? Because the president only makes 500 grand and fucking year. So now what he has to do is now for the rest of his fucking life, he has to go out and give these speeches. Okay. Which is, you know, to the people that put him in office, they pay him like six fucking figures to get out there and tell his fucking jokes and do his little song and dance.

Speaker 2:          00:25:34       And the reality is, is that just washing their fucking bribe money, you know, so he would push through all the shit that they wanted or as much of it as they could while he was in office. And then they also get to see like, yet, see, we own this guy, you know, is it bringing new lizards into their fucking dead to me? Like, see this, we actually have former presidents come here and do a little song and dance for us. You know why? Because we own this fucking guy. We owned them before you even fucking went in there. We own the fucking next guy. You know, that's probably why, you know, as much as the upper 1% probably did not want to see Donald Trump get in there because he's this fucking road guy and all you fucking progressive lefties glow. I got to say, shut the fuck up. They're actually gonna end up love in that guy because it seems what he wants to do is deregulate everything because guys at his level of wealth, this so fucking rich, they find the government annoying.

Speaker 5:          00:26:32       I have to answer it. A Ho who's at the door, the u s government, uh, these fucking assholes. They opened the door. What, what, what now? Oh, you know, just

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       uh, you know, kind of appreciated for as the way the u s government talks to that level of wealth because they need them to get into fucking office. Right. You know, kind of appreciate if a, you know, you wouldn't build that golf course, uh, over that homeless shelter and those native Americans, you know that, you know what? I don't know. I'll think about it. I'll think about it. All right. Just fucking go fuck yourself. I do what I want.

Speaker 6:          00:27:11       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:27:11       I'm making money off opiates. Shut the fuck up. I don't know. I'm a, I don't know. I don't know what to tell you, but you know what? I'm in fucking limbo right now is where I am. Um, I haven't been doing stand up. I can't go out. I can't really leave the house. I'm afraid to fucking leave the house because you know, I, I stay within like a certain fucking radius. So if my wife does not have our kid, uh, by January 2nd, I am going to the rose bowl and I am going to do the unspeakable at there. I am going to be sober as a church mouse. I won't even smoke a cigar because I have to let those fucking things go because I have to get life insurance and, uh, I don't want to pay the, I'm a smoker and I don't want to be a smoker.

Speaker 2:          00:28:04       You know what I'll fucking smoke like for a year. That's what I think. Oh, well I enjoy the fucking shit out of those. Uh, yeah, dude, I'm, I'm getting to that point in my life. I'm getting my affairs in order. You know? It's actually, it's, you know what I've actually found going through the whole process of getting life insurance and putting together a trust and a will and all of that Shit, I've actually found that to be just as enjoyable is getting rid of all this shit in my life. All the clutter. It's the same thing like this, you know, as a guy, I think there's something like how we just don't deal with our mortality and, uh, so you don't want to think about it, but I gotta tell you once, you just like, you think you're like, yeah, okay. And something happens to me. You get this, you get debt. And I'm fucking out. Right. And nobody is, you know, nobody has to worry about anything. And then they can't be like, you know what, that son of a bitch, I don't know what he was doing a swimming with those sharks. But uh, I gotta tell you he'd say one thing about that guy, you know, he had his affairs in order.

Speaker 6:          00:29:07       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:29:07       You got to be that guy. If you have any sort of wife, children, anything, you got it. You got to get your fucking affairs in order. And um, I haven't done it like a lot of my friends didn't and none of them had their affairs in order and a number of them died. And uh, that is just a fucking thing. I'm telling you right now. You do not want to put your fucking family through that. And I'm not going to be that guy, so hopefully I won't die before. Uh, I get everything all fucking straight down here. But that is my, that's my first thing I'm going to do in the, in 2017 I'm going to prepare my affairs. May Affairs will be in order. Oh God, this is gonna be so weird. You know, so weird about getting life insurance as you then give your partner motive. You know, my wife doesn't have fucking life insurance. She doesn't even think about it. They don't give a fuck about us. Right. And you know, one, I don't want her to have life insurance, you know, because then I got to deal with the cops. If something came, lol. Didn't you make fucking six figures when she fell down that flight of stairs?

Speaker 2:          00:30:17       I swear to God, I was by myself. I was playing drums in a rehearsal space. You know, I spent so much time alone every day that I would never have a fucking alibi. God forbid if something ever happened. Can Anybody, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:30:34       can anybody vouch for you that that's where you were at? And then I would have to go into my head. Who did I yell at on the way there or the way back in a fucking car that I get their license plate so I can call them up and say, do you remember that bald red bearded asshole who screamed at you? You know? Yeah. That you remember that you can, do you remember what time of day that was? This is really critical for me. Um, yeah, it's, it's a very bizarre thing to go out and uh, it's, it's, it's uh, makes you feel at peace and then also, you know, it makes you, you know, when your wife, you know, brings over, you're like some food, you kind of looking at her, then you're looking at the food, you know, she gets up, you switch plates.

Speaker 2:          00:31:24       I think I've watched too many of those first 48, you know what I mean? I love those guys to where they, they fucking, their first two wives die mysteriously and then someone else fucking Mary's. It's just like, this is the fucking thing. You can marry somebody who had one person die. Okay. That happens. Unfortunately that fucking happens. But once they're there, they're at to get the fuck away from that person. What are the, what are the fucking odds, you know, you got married in both, your husband's died, he married twice. They, I'm a, I'm a two time widower. We at, well you're not going to be a three time the fuck away from me. Check please. Right. Gives that hacky fucking out to every comedy scene. I'll just, I'll have what she's having. Um, yeah you gotta get the fuck out of there. You know you can only have one spouse die. And after that, if I was running shit, if I was one of the Lizard people and I was running shit, this would be the rule. Anybody who had two spouses die and you know, we can't prove that you fucking did it. You are only allowed to date other people that had that, that are already had two people die. Okay. And then you know,

Speaker 1:          00:32:41       yeah

Speaker 2:          00:32:41       whoever dies in that who gives a shit cause then you just got rid of one murder in psycho and then you just keep having them date each other and eventually then there's only one and then you stick that person in a giant like human, like perky cage and like the scary, it's there's the winter or this. She is right. All 48 of her husband's died mysteriously can never prove it. You know, take it down and put her on Coney island. Does that still exist? That fucking rollercoaster. You ever go to Coney island goal? Net one, that fucking rollercoaster. It's one of the scariest fucking rides I've ever been on that because it's, it's like a scary ride. It's because the ride is so fucking old and there's no padding in this seat. I swear to God, I got off that ride. I felt like I was in a fucking three car accident. You know, my fucking back was killing me. My shoulder was fucked up.

Speaker 1:          00:33:32       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:33:34       I don't know. You don't. I'm probably fucking up my life right now cause I'm trying to do too many things at once as I always do. I'm going to meditate. I'm going to do yoga. I'm going to fucking eh, stop yelling. I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to therapy and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I think I'm freaking out because I'm a fucking, a volatile fucking loony ticket and I don't want a, I don't want to be that person. You know? You know what? I want to be able to be like fucking Joe Pesci in casino. You know, minus watching my brother getting beaten to death in a Cornfield, like not that part. The part where he's making pancakes for his kid, you know, despite the fact he squeezed somebody's eyeball out in a vice like 20 minutes earlier than he could come home, he could shut it off. It was very inspirational. Like, Hey, you want some more syrup? I, you know, I love you. Right. Kisses him on the head, you know, and that's it. Then he goes out and he fucking kneecap somebody's, you know, 20 seconds after the bus drives away with his kid. That's who I want to be.

Speaker 2:          00:34:28       All right, man. That's it. That's the podcast. Um, and I got to admit, you know, it's been hard for me to watch a, the Bruins this year, man. So I've actually been watching more NBA hoop, which I'm really fucking embarrassed to say because I've always been a hockey guy, but you know, I will always be occupy, but it's also, I can't ignore watching what Danny Ainge is doing. It's fucking great. There's so much fun to watch. Um, so you know what, let's look up here. Who Do we got next? I don't know who the Celtics have next, but you guys here, Aaron Kaufman is leaving fucking gas monkey fast, fast and loud. It's fucking brutal. But the way a discovery talked about it, it sounded like he was going to get his own show, but it's just like, what the fuck? I don't want to see that. I want to see this spinoff.

Speaker 1:          00:35:21       You know

Speaker 2:          00:35:23       the Vernon Shirley were on happy days. That was one of the, one of the best times ever, and then they got their own show wasn't as good. It's like when a super group breaks up and then the lead singer does their thing and then the other bag gets a new, since like Van Halen, David Lee Roth was never better than when he was in Van Halen.

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       Van Halen was never better than when David Lee Roth was there. You know what I mean? Sammy Hagar was better when he was by himself. What are you talking about, Bill? I don't know. Just fucking talking. Oh, you know, I'm just listening. All right, Bruins. What do we got next? Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh. To to, ah, we got a home and all, I'm against the fucking buffalo sabers. I never understood that home at home. It's a home and an away. Who is this fucking Hitler youth that they got number 55 on defense? Risto, Laney had, we're still laden. Jesus Christ. Tell me his grandfather doesn't live down in fucking South America. Ah, let's it all Nazi fucking hundred joke. All right, we're going to end on that. Um, that's the podcast for this week. Uh, um, just checking in on you. That's all the fuck it was in. If you guys want to, uh, you know, keep listening to here. We're going to play a little fucking music and you're going to listen to some, uh, some greatest hits from a podcast gone by in a time. I can't remember. All right. Have a great weekend. You constant. I'll talk to you on Monday.

Speaker 7:          00:36:51       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:36:52       Yay. Go. [inaudible] oh, just [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          00:37:31       Um, new year's everybody. Here we go. Dear Billy, ball drop. I'm not going to ask you what you're doing on New Year's cause I already know you and your Rosebowl crew will be tap dancing at the Wiltern over there. Uh, I'm going to be there with a girl. I'm 50% into. Okay, well then that affects what you should be buying her that night. He goes, she's cool, she's hot and I don't have any major complaints about her. I'm also not in love with her and really can't see anything beyond hooking up. My plan is to laugh my ass off and see what happens. All right, if we hook up, that's great. If not, no big deal, dude. You're in the zone. You're in the zone. This is some Dimone shit. You don't care if she comes, stays laser praise. Now you've got the attitude. Um, I don't, I told two friends and they boast, advised against hooking up with her. All right, well I don't know your friends and I don't know what their motive is. Let's see if you explained this. Here he goes, I would never let that decide whether or not I would. But the interesting thing is that they both said independent of each other, that hooking with a girl on

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       New Year's Eve, Mike, give her the wrong impression at t and that she's going to be a leach afterwards. Oh, that's fucking, that's just fear mongering. That's bullshit. What has your finger on is the ball drops. All of a sudden you have a relationship. I had a good time, had some laughs, so like you don't want to go to the farmer's market now. I don't have something against farmers markets. Not really. Well do you want as you where to go cause you know I don't, I don't feel like going with you. I don't feel like a spark your fucking ass off for what being honest I have. Fuck you there. It's, it's the end of the relationship. Anyways, he goes, I can't even fathom why New Year's Eve would be be considered a special occasion that would lead to her thinking that this whole topic is ridiculous and I can't even stand to waste time talking about it. But I wanted to hear your opinion. I think I just gave it to you. My question to you is, do you agree with that? And also, do you think there are any days on the calendar that would make a girl think you were into her? Oh yeah. If you took around on Valentine's Day.

Speaker 2:          00:39:47       Yeah, it's about it. Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day that that would be good. What else? What other day? Saint Patrick's Day?

Speaker 9:          00:39:57       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:39:59       You know, you sitting there eating a fucking meat pie next door, hammered out of your mind with a green plastic had on hi Vic. He really likes me. Um, the key and if I could, if I could do my single life over again is I would have been way less fearful to be honest. You know, when relationships were starting, you know, uh, women are not as psycho is you think, I mean, a lot of times when you say that women are psycho, it's because you were being deceptive and uh, yeah. Then they go fucking psycho. Yeah, they definitely do. But you, a lot of times creative if you just tell them straight up front when they're like, so what is this? And just be like, look, I'm not looking to get in a relationship right now or like, listen, I enjoy your company, but I'm not feeling like this spark.

Speaker 2:          00:40:51       Like there's something to that next level. I just feel like you should know that. And you'd be surprised at how well they take that. You know, they, it's not that always, you know, if you say that the second you feel it, it's usually pretty early on. So there's no really deep feelings and that's all people just don't want to get hurt. Okay. Believe me, I heard a lot of fucking people believe me. And um, so that's what I learned. I remember one, um, Jesus Christ years ago and I was just a lad living in New York. I remember I hooked up with this, this woman, and she was just like, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:41:33       so what is this? Where's this going? And I was just like, uh, nowhere. I'm like, fucking 12 was I 35? She was 23. I'm like, I'm like 12 years old. And then you, you know, by the time you took 30, I'm going to be like 60. What do you think it's going is? She actually laughed and I was just like, you know, she goes, so what are we doing? But they're just hanging out, having fun. So whatever crazy thing you want to try, but you don't want to do it with your husband, do it with me.

Speaker 5:          00:42:04       And that was it. And she was just like, all right, cool. We had fun for a few weeks and then that was fucking it. And nobody got hurt and uh, you know, lost touch with her and that was it. No harm, no foul. Had a great fucking time. So there's no light, but look, you take them out on Valentine's Day and you get them a rose and all of that shit. You start leading them on. So what you're really talking to, I feel he's, you're talking to younger guys like me probably at that, like meet like how I was, I mean, how am I trying to say this? You're talking to two guys who had their age right now. I, their skill level was what my skill level was where they don't know how to set it up. So they're sitting there going, oh, don't do this. Don't bring them out on this day. Cause that makes them think this. Um, oh that says to me is that they don't know how to communicate what's going on. So they feel like they, and they're also in that thing where they feel like they have to fucking throw their jacket over a mud puddle and let them walk on it in order to get fucked that night. Which you don't. You just have to be honest. Because women enjoy sex too, and they also enjoy you telling them what the fucking deal is. All right, so there you go. So you don't have anything.

Speaker 8:          00:43:18       Don't worry about [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          00:43:57       [inaudible] Hey, what's going on? It is,

Speaker 10:         00:44:00       and this is the Monday morning podcast. Welcome. Welcome. If you're new to it. I do one of these every single Monday. I answer questions. People email me, questions people send me in there. A underrated, overrated lists, things that they feel are underrated, things that they feel are overrated and a new year's resolution. That's what we're doing this week, Huh? That's what we're doing. This is like the sixth time I've tried to start doing this podcast. I don't know what the fuck's going on with me this week. It's 10 in the morning. I think I started too early. I don't know why I started so early. I have the ability to hang up at this point and I could just erase it, but for some reason I'm just, I'm plowing through on this one.

Speaker 10:         00:44:52       Holy Shit. He's had a dog fight, I think two dogs and fighting. You hear that? You get that shit. The fuck is with that dog. The owner doesn't do shit about it. Let's see what this dog looks like. Let's describe both people as they come up the street. Okay. That's kind of a fat person or those people who wears that, that you know those hats, like it looks like you're going to be playing tennis, but you're not. She has the one of those hats. She's got one of those little fucking terriers, miserable fucking dog and they're getting into some sort of a, a little Volkswagen Gulf. Wow. That's a picture for you, Huh? What or the, where the fuck did those dreams go off the road?

Speaker 10:         00:45:47       I hate dogs, man. I love him, but I fucking hate him. I've been talking about how I'm going to get a bulldog and now I don't know if I can do it. I think just as a man, you just, they just look awesome and then I'm watching youtube clips of them and they're just a genetic fucking mess. They, they, I, I'm watching these, these youtube videos, the dog snoring or I can't deal with that. That'd be like, you know, my dad's used to snore like that and I, I wanted to kill him. He trying to watch the game and he would like fall asleep and just start snoring. And I literally would think about taking off one of my, you know, the eighties back when tube socks were a lot longer. And I was like, I can choke them with this, you know, and, uh, that's my own dad can have a fucking dog with sleep apnea, you know, bulldogs when they sleep, they sound like they used to play offensive line in the NFL. You know what I mean? You have is they got to sleep upright in a chair that's not a fucking dog. It's like a, it's just a blob. You know, I got like 18 stairs. You've got to climb up into my apartment. Things are going to have a fucking heart attack. And then what do I gotta do? I gotta give them doggy fucking CPR.

Speaker 10:         00:47:12       Jesus Christ. I just love the face. Is there a fucking dog out there that has that bulldog face that can breathe but can actually exist in an apartment? I really liked boxers, but they're just too big. I mean, why don't I just live with a pony at that? Oh God, what a fucking week I had, man. What a fucking week. I had just stayed home for the holidays. I had the best and the best time it was calling everybody up, wishing everybody merry Christmas. I was in the best fucking mood because I was home. You know, I didn't have to fly anywhere. And I'm telling you people out there, don't let your parents guilt you any more into the fact that you have to go home for the holidays. You don't, you don't visit them, visit them during different times of the year when the whole world isn't flying back to the east coast or out the fucking Wisconsin or wherever the fuck you going.

Speaker 10:         00:48:11       I'm telling you, you don't have to put yourself through it and then he can just sit there and watch the news and you see those people sleeping on the airport floor and you can just laugh your ass off just knowing that that could have been you and now it isn't. And now someone else is you and it's not you. And you can laugh at you while not feeling the pain. That makes sense. I hope it did. I'll tell you what doesn't make sense as a fucking New England patriots or 11 and five and the San Diego chargers are eight an eight if fucking eight games better than, than lions. And they are in the playoffs. Oh, that's sad. Sack fucking organization. They just can't buy a break. You know, even though the, they kill the Broncos and then at the end of the game with Damion Thomas and still fucking engines themselves, you know, I don't know.

Speaker 10:         00:49:02       I don't know where I'm at with the charges. I hated them a few years ago when they blew that game and then they started calling the patriots a classless organization. You know what I mean? It's like, oh, really? You guys with your fucking convicted steroid user? Who does is taunting dance the entire fucking game. Then he'd get mad cause our players taunt him back in know Jesus Christ and just fucking babies. You know, you fucking net poor excuse for a football stadium. You have, uh, that left over concrete from the highway that they molded into a stadium back when Jimmy Carter was in office. And he just fucking annoy me. They annoy me and, uh, I don't know. Okay. This is my big sleeper pick for the, uh, for the NFL. I think, uh, the Carolina Panthers are going to surprise people. I like Jake alone. I remember how that guy played in the Superbowl years ago against the Patriots.

Speaker 10:         00:49:53       And I think they got enough. I think they got enough to go deep into the playoffs. And, um, I dunno about the giants. Giants looked great, but it's just so hard to repeat. Um, I dunno how you guys doing in Dallas, Huh? Jesus Christ. That was a raping. That really was no loop either. That was just fucking, I was done. I was brutal and it was really brutal. I Dunno. I Dunno about that Tony Romo. Um, anyway, let's plow ahead here. You want to something, I'm actually in a great mood despite the fact that this happened, I went to pink's hot dogs. Now for those of you who don't live in Los Angeles and he never been to Los Angeles, they got this fucking, ah, they got this hotdog stand, okay. That evidently has the greatest hotdogs that you'll ever taste in your life. But every time you drive by there, there's literally, I mean, I'm not joking.

Speaker 10:         00:50:50       There's like 80 people in line. I went there and when I first came out here the first week and I literally stood in line for like an hour for a hot dog. So I was like, well that was fucking stupid. I'm never doing that again. And Lo and behold, for some reason I went to go pick up my lovely girlfriend from work and someone at work had mentioned to her about pink's hot dogs. So she got a craving and she was like, oh my God, can you take me a pig's hotdogs? I T I don't know if somebody dementia, I just want, you don't want girls get like that. And it would just look adorable. And they deliberately act like they're like a little kid and you just, you just can't fucking resist it. So I'm like, all right sweetie, I'll take you over to get you a hot dog.

Speaker 10:         00:51:31       We pull up in the line is like two and a half times longer than it usually is. It's literally wrapped all the way around this fucking tin shack, by the way. It's a tin shack. All right? It's on Labrea in Melrose and I'm giving you guys some great advice. Don't ever fucking go there. All right? So I'm like, you know, I just laugh. I'm like, this is ridiculous. I'm bill. I'm like, you know what? It's the holidays. I didn't fly. I'm not sitting in an airport. I'll stand in this fucking line just to continue to, to do the tradition of me standing in fucking lines that I really don't need to be standing in around Christmas. So I stand in this fucking line and this is the funny part. We get their right standing in line and as he's four Asian dudes in front of me and was standing there for 15 minutes, the line may be moved like six feet.

Speaker 10:         00:52:20       So finally one of the agents, dudes, you know, mumbles something in Cantonese or whatever the hell he was talking and he fucking walks up to the front of the line and he comes back. And you know, I don't know if you know this about me, but I'm not bilingual. And I certainly don't speak Chinese, but I know what this kid said and his hot talk, I thought, don't, I'll fucking language. He just said, dude, you gotta be shitting me. Fuck this. This is just hot dogs. It's not worth it. That's what he said. What the honkytonks and his language and I, I, you know, I told them and they are the other three Asian dudes laughed, looked at each other, nodded and made the smart move. They got the fuck out of the line. They got out of the line and my dumb ass was like, oh great.

Speaker 10:         00:53:01       I get to move up another half foot stupid bay. Right. I stay on them for like another half hour. We're freezing our ass off to the point. My girl has to go to the car. She gets to the car and somebody writing us $145 a ticket because evidently it became a toso after four o'clock so she starts freaking out because we got to move the car. She's like, forget it, forget it. Let's just leave. And at this point I'm stubborn. I'm like, no, fuck that. I got $145 tickets. Got Damn and I'm at least going to get a fucking hot dog out of this. So I had to pull the car into the lot. I stand there for like another hour and hour and a half. I'm finally turning the corner to get to the front of the Tin Shack for a fucking hot dog. I can't feel my toes. I'm jumping up and down. I'm doing a little boo ballistic fucking movement here.

Speaker 10:         00:53:59       Trying to keep the blood in the extremities of my body for fucking hot dog. I'm already down 145 bucks, but I'm going to see this thing through and just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, this we're right at the corner of liberal, real Bria and Melrose. So at every red light people are just staring at us like we're in an exhibit of fucking idiots looking at us the exact way they should be looking at us. Like, why would you stand in line for two hours? It's a fucking hot dog. You can buy packs of eight of them at the grocery store. Take them home, grill them up, and you know you don't even have to stay on hold. What are you doing? So this lady basically rolls down the window. It's alternative comedian looking fucking twat sticks their head out the window and starts dripping with sarcasm goes you guys standing in line for hot dogs, right?

Speaker 10:         00:54:57       Just dripping with sarcasm. There's nothing else. There's nothing else on that corner that we could be doing dripping with sarcasm and the fucking democratic demographic of shitheads that were in the line. Do not hear the sarcasm and actually answer her question like she was being serious. This, this one guy's like, yeah. So then she goes, are they good? Just dripping with sarcasm and this other guy answers the question [inaudible] nothing on Hassan choose the country. And at that point I just hung my head in defeat going, you know what? I fucking deserve this. I really want to get mad at that girl in the car, but I can't. I can't. She's absolutely right. She's actually trying to help us right now to let us know how fucking stupid is what we're doing. And I, I just, I just hung my head and I stood in fucking line and I swear to God, I ended up getting up there and I'm looking at the hot dogs and you know what?

Speaker 10:         00:55:58       I forgot, they don't even toast the Bun. They don't even toast the fucking bun and you just, they just stick it on there. And if you have to cheese, they just sprinkle some cheese on it. You Chile, they just put Chili on it and then you go into the shack and there's no heat. So you still cold and you eat basically a ballpark frank. And you stood in line for two hours and you know, I'm one of these fucking guys, man. It just, I swear to God, you know, that fool me once, shame on you fool me twice, shame on me. I, you literally fool me like nine times before I finally start picking up on it. And now I finally, I finally realized it. Okay, if you come out here to Los Angeles and, and you know, and you ask people, Hey, what do you do out here?

Speaker 10:         00:56:45       And somebody suggest to you, oh, you got to go to pinks. You got to go to pinks and get a hot dog man, or the best fucking hot dogs. No, they say that shit just slowly draw your right. Let me maybe going to be a lefty. Maybe lefthand. I Dunno what drive back overhand. Right. Overhand left. Right. Right into their mouth. Don't even hit that note. Just put it right in their fucking mouth because that's what I'm trying to say. It's overrated. Okay. And those of you who aren't new to my podcast, I do underrated. Overrated. That is my big overrated thing of the fucking week. Alright. Pink's hot dogs and La Sucks. A big bag of fucking elk dick. I've walked into fucking four star restaurants and they've been like, I go, how long is the wait Deanna innovation know how long is the way it's going to be? About 45 minutes. And I always look at the person I'm with and we'd go, you know what? Fuck that. Fuck that. I'm not doing that. I don't give a shit if, if, if Mario Batali is cooking the meal, I'm not standing. I'm not here for 40 I'll go get a slice. I don't give a shit. And I stood in line for two hours for Goddamn hotdog and got a $145 ticket.

Speaker 10:         00:57:56       Okay. All right, I got that out. Alright, that's it. You know, that's been my week and I'm still actually in a decent mood despite the fact that my 11 and five patriots are not in the playoffs. All my God, what a week of sports. And then the Celtics lost to the Lakers, which was actually a great game. Hopefully foreshadowing another great NBA finals. But I gotta tell you something. I don't think I've ever laughed harder in my life than watching Pau Gasol, whatever his fucking name is that Kenny Loggins looking Croatian Jackass fucking pump hitting his fist off his chest. Every time he hit a lay up, what the fuck was he doing during that game? I thought he's going to start singing the theme of the titanic. It's fucking running down the court like Celine Dion. Every time he hits the shot, what the fuck did he really thought?

Speaker 10:         00:58:48       He proved something, didn't he? Yeah, I guess you showed us, you know, you disappeared during the finals and didn't get a championship ring buoy. Watch out for Pau Gasol during a regular season game in December. You know that that's what's wrong with sports. You know what I mean? Act like you've been there. Okay. Act like you've been there and when you fucking winter, regular season game after choking in the NBA finals, don't fucking start pounding your chest. You know when this 50 games left in the season, what a fucking moron. But I that he did it, him and that other guy with the, with the hairdresser haircut, when he hit that layup and he just starts fucking pounding his chest, like he said, Braveheart, you know, like he just ran over a hill with blue paint on his face and just defeated an army twice the size of his in a lay up, get back on defense jackass.

Speaker 10:         00:59:45       Ugh. I really hope that that pissed the Celtics off. I know it did. I know it did. And that's only, it's only going to help us out. That fucking, who is that guy? That guy with his hair cut. They're talking about how he just chose each other would even, we agreed on Christmas. They totally j hate this joke. Oh yeah, I guess you showed them, you know, green, you know is also a part of nature. It's a part of Christmas. It doesn't have to mean Celtics, but if you want to ruin your holiday and wear blue man. Um, but whatever note, you know, my biggest thing is, uh, I liked, uh, what's his face there? Andrew buying a man. That guy is the shit. You know, I didn't see any fucking chest pumping from him and he could fucking put both of those two other jackasses and fucking snap him over his knee like a couple of number two pencils and he wasn't thumping his chest.

Speaker 10:         01:00:33       He scared me. He had a quiet confidence about him. Those other guys look like a cup. You know what they look like. You have to see, like when the spazz in elementary school finally decides to fight back, you know, you've been flicking them in the back of the year for like three periods in a row and he finally decides to fight and you want to respect him, but you can't cause he's making those spazz noises as he throws punches like, and he's like half crying. That's what those two jackasses look like fucking pumping you goddamn fucking just, I really wish I could remember the titanic song. I'd fucking start singing it now even though I know I can't sing as I proved a couple of podcasts ago. All right, let's get into the podcast here. Um, the new year's resolutions. Okay. Last week I talked about my new year's resolution.

Speaker 10:         01:01:20       If you new to my podcast, my new year's resolution, um, for next year is I'm not going to tip when I get bad service. Okay? And at a, at a, at a restaurant, I've been doing that religiously no matter what the guilt that I always have, I have to tip 20% no matter if you actually drop my piece of cheesecake on the fucking floor, you know, and spit on my fork. I still give you 20, 20% and I'm not doing it anymore. All right? If you suck, I'm not tipping you. I can't just like not tip, but you know, you're not doing your fucking job. You suck. All right, so here, that's my new year's resolution. If you give you give me a bad service, I'm not tipping. Um, that's when I always hate to like in a like what's like celebrities? Have you noticed that?

Speaker 10:         01:02:05       Like in like, um, and whatever. Like I'm one of those, like those, those, those celebrity blog things or, or page six in New York there'll be like lagoon. Ted Danson was at a diner and evidently his finances aren't looking too good, is he tipped 4%. You know, at no point did they ever think maybe that the, the service sucked. Maybe ask for cheese and scrambled eggs and they didn't give it to him. And then he sent them back and then they did what they did was took a cold piece of cheese and just slapped it on top and just gave it back to him that way. And maybe he was a little bit miffed and maybe that's why he didn't tip immediately go, oh, he's famous and he doesn't tip. He's achieved. Fuck. You know, cause I'm miserable with my own life and um, so I'm going to attack the celebrity.

Speaker 10:         01:02:54       I Dunno if Ted Danson never got busted for not tipping, but you know what the fuck I'm saying. So anyways, here's people's New Year's resolutions. All right. Um, New Year's resolutions. I want to make a conscious effort to connect with the people around me because human relationships are vital and I've been too quick to take them for granted or dismiss them all together. When I stopped to think about what, of what I value most of my life, it's all the memories, good and bad with my friends and families. That's what makes life worthwhile. You know what? That was actually really nice, but because of my choppy out loud reading skills, that's why I could never host the 700 club because that fucking big headed jackass could have read that email with his eyes closed through the last third of it are already getting ready to be like, praise Jesus.

Speaker 10:         01:03:40       Praise Jesus. Let me see if I can do that. Like the guy on the 700 club and this one here comes from Chattanooga, Tennessee. Praise God, praise God for Chattanooga, Tennessee and his new year's resolution. Is this lowered. I want to make the conscious effort to connect with the people around me because human relationships, Archie is so, so vital to me and I lowered, I apologize, I've been too quick to take them for granted or just dimiss dismiss, then fuck, dismiss them altogether. And when I stopped to think about what I value most of my life, Jesus, it's all the memories, good and bad. Even when you challenged me, it's still good. All the memories, good and bad with my friends and family. That's what makes my life worthwhile. You know? I think he made a very good point there. I think a lot of times and laugh, we do forget things that are most vital and everybody's talking about getting a new guitar hero or the latest iPhone. Those are just gadgets. Paypal, if you really think about it, did Jesus have any gadgets? Hey, he didn't even have any fucking shoes. You didn't hear him bitching. He was too busy putting his hands on a leper. Okay?

Speaker 10:         01:04:50       So I want you all to put your hands on the TV screen right now. Pray with me, probably of me. Just pray with me right now. Please. Lower gees class my savior. Please help me to remember relationships in my life. They're so, so very vital, okay? And how I have a pot to piss in. And even though the bankers, she is still three cores. If $1 trillion, I don't give a fuck. I'm just happy because some day when I die and I'm in the ground and the worms are eating in my eye sockets, I'm going have a couple of wings and I'm gonna be flying around in the clouds. Praise Jesus. And please seem your contributions to the 700 club so I can get the, the crow's feet taken off my face cause I spent half the show squinting. All right. See I can read out loud. I can read out loud. I just have to get into praise Jesus. All right, new year's resolution number two. Um, number two, I am going to stop dwelling on all the garbage of the past and look forward to the garbage of the future. All right, that's uplifting.

Speaker 10:         01:05:54       Um, I really thought I was going to get more new year's resolutions. I guess people didn't wait. I have one other one in there. I thought I did somebody saying that they weren't going to do the hacky going to the gym thing. That's the worst. Oh look at me. I'm clicking on that. I'm clicking on the computer again. We did find out what the clicking noise was. That was me doing that. I'm going to stop doing that because it bugs people. Although somebody was so miserable, told me to keep doing it because he enjoys when I annoyed people. Um, last week I talked about going to the movie milk and saying I really enjoyed it, but I actually was avoiding the movie because of all my straight friends kept saying it's a great movie, but I gotta warn you there's a lot of male kissing in it.

Speaker 10:         01:06:30       And um, I was just talking about how, you know, that was something that was actually pushing me away from that movie. And I was like, does that make me homophobic? I don't think so. I just think, you know, I don't think it's anything wrong for another man and another man to lock lips. I personally just don't want to look at it and I certainly don't want to pay $10 to see it. Um, so this guy says, ah, this guy I think put me straight here. He said, I understand that the sight of two men kissing makes you slightly uncomfortable. I feel the same way. The reason for this is that you are heterosexual. That being said, I think you may be taking it a bit far to let it stand in your way of enjoying a movie. Just because something is uncomfortable to watch. Doesn't mean it ruins the movie.

Speaker 10:         01:07:15       I find it marginally uncomfortable to see someone get tortured. But I'm not going to write off a whole movie because of that and the porn analogy. That's actually a great point because yeah, I would never want to get tortured, but I've seen a bunch of movies where, you know, guys get tortured and that type of thing. But uh, but you know something, I can actually argue that point because, you know, when I watched lethal weapon and I watch Mel Gibson, you know, dislocated his shoulder, I know that it's not real. He's not really dislocating his is a shoulder. But when you go to see milk, um, that guy's really kissing that other guy really, really kissing that other guy. All right, so, but I understand what he's saying. He is right on a certain, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if this is the whole fucking Oprah. Let's turn guys into a puddle of Mush. You think John Wayne would go see milk? You know, I'm not going to go see another guy fucking another man. See?

Speaker 10:         01:08:19       Oh God. That was a terrible impression. All right, here's the second half of his, uh, his analogy and the porn analogy you made while hilarious, was somewhat inaccurate. Okay. Gotta be open to this criticism. I'm not going to lose my temper. Um, he says when I watch porn, I jack off. However, I do not check off every time a man and a woman kisses on screen during a regular film. In fact, I usually go boneless. God dammit. That's a good point. Likewise, I imagine gay men Jack off while watching gay porn, but not necessarily in the middle of Brokeback mountain. Um, I'm going to argue with you on that one. I'm going to argue with, don't let me do on that one. I bet. Um, I bet a lot of gay guys did jerk off to that even though I didn't watch that movie once again because I didn't want to watch two guys fucking a 10th.

Speaker 10:         01:09:11       Um, and not even that, even if it was a man and a woman fucking intent, I wouldn't go see it because it's basically a chick flick and I really don't care about watching two people make a relationship work. Um, speaking of which, have you guys seen that new movie coming out with Leonardo Dicaprio and that fat chick from the titanic? That's so mean. Um, that little fullback with the big head from uh, the titanic. I'm really being mean during the holiday season. Um, have you seen the thing like, I guess, you know, they had two people with dreams and then they moved out to the suburbs and then they have a kid and then they just start yelling at each other about how awful their life sucks and they have all this dramatic music and that's another movie I'm not going to be able to see because the entire, I can't go see it in public because I'm going to ruin it for the people around me because the entire time I'm just going to be yelling at the screen, you know, why don't you just move, sell your house, go back to the city. It's a free country. You're able to do that. Hello? I mean I'm, what am I going to watch 90 minutes of them yelling at each other. I even want Tupperware honey. Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:10:25       He wanted an Ottoman, not me. Feel wanted it and him fucking punching a cupboard right near her head. And I just, you know, move, get divorced. You know, I, I've really learned that about anger is, is that's when a lot of anger is when you feel powerless in the situation and you're not powerless. You have the intelligence to make the decision to get out of a bag. I mean, I know it's not that easy, but you know, but anyways, you know, I want to come in that guy who sent in all that stuff, he really made some great points. Um, you know, I think you made some good points, but like, ah, yeah, there's a big part of me while I still feel like I'm right. I mean, I don't know. Do I want to get comfortable watching two guys out? We'll go, let's see.

Speaker 10:         01:11:14       What am I afraid of? The obvious. Then I'm going to watch that. It's going to turn me gay. Stupid. All right. You know what Mike Flynn, you're fucking right. Okay. You're right. You're God that you're absolutely right. And, uh, you said Ts. Fuck the Bruins. Well, you can say that all you want to, they're like fucking 27 five. All right, which one's your team? Exactly. Let you sit there and deal with that. All right. Um, what do we got next? Movie reviews. Movie reviews. No, I did this last week. Jesus Christ. This is why you always see the clicking sound because I'm not organized. Okay, here we go. Underrated. Overrated. Okay. I think you guys know not to go to pink's hot dogs at Labrea and Melrose. Do not go there and feel free to make fun of the people who stand in line at pink's hot dogs because evidently we don't understand sarcasm.

Speaker 10:         01:12:14       So you know, do anything you want. Stick your head out the window and just be as sarcastic as you want and they will just answer your questions. You know what? That's the big thing that you should just drive by and heckle the people at Pink's hot dogs. I think I'm going to do that next time, which is very hypocritical because I stood in line last week. I want to go down there and protest them. Just have a sign and just be like, you know, it's, they're not that good or it's not worth it. Or maybe I'll just yell out obvious shit just to hear people answer it, aren't you called? Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:12:50       Um, all right. Overweighted if we go over rated, this person says this week overrated. Owen Wilson over 1 billion in box office. But, but the, but uh, Jesus Christ, I can't read out loud. This is actually funny. Let me go back to the beginning to restart the comedy momentum. Okay. Overrated. Owen Wilson over 1 billion in box office, but does this Douche bag really make anyone laugh? This guy makes cute movies like wedding crashers and Rushmore. Both. Cute but not funny. I will never bust a gut laughing watching this crooked nose. No talent. And why do they always pucker his lips in every promo shot? I'll leave that to your imagination. Wow. He's going after Owen Wilson didn't that guy just tried to kill himself a few months ago. You know, I think he tried to kill himself because he, he keeps making, yeah, he makes these cute little movies. Remember that you, me and dupree, I mean that the, the, the fucking title or that movie alone, you know it's going to suck. And you know, he's, he's got another one of those coming out. None of those kind of movies. You mean to pre meet you and Magoo? He just, he just know they're going to suck. You're going to Improv and the crew's going to be laughing cause they're afraid not to laugh because you're famous after each take. I think he popped his lips so maybe you don't look at his nose. I think that that's what he does. Or maybe he's like coming to the realization that he's actually in a movie called you, me and dupree.

Speaker 10:         01:14:24       It rhymes. That'll get them, you know what? I bet you I, you know, I don't even know how to look up box office numbers. I bet. I bet it did. Great. You know, I, this is, I know what I think why, like guys like that ended up killing themselves because I think you've very subtly get taken off track in this business and you forget who you are and why you ever even gotten this business. And I actually had that feeling last night when I was watching one of those, uh, cooking shows. I basically watched football all day, watch my patriots do what they had to do and then I want you to fucking fumbling, bumbling, stumbling jets, kill my fucking post season. Um, so yeah, I watched eight hours of football, so at that point it my girls, so like, okay, it's my turn. So she puts on the cooking network and I'm watching one of those iron chef shows and some, some sort of throw down.

Speaker 10:         01:15:24       I don't know what the fuck it was, but I'm watching Bobby flay and a, you know, pretty famous Goddamn chef with his own TV show already and all his own restaurants. Any standing there getting judged by these jackasses, just regular people going, you know, I thought the falafel, the outside was a little too greasy while the inside was a little too flaky. And I'm just sitting there looking at the expression on his face and he really, it really comes one of those moments like, what the fuck am I doing? I don't need to do this. Why did I get into this business I got in this business because I love to cook. I like to cook. I like to make people, you know, make a little money off the shit and make people happy. Just eat my food and shut the fuck up. Why am I, what am I, why am I standing here is just construction worker.

Speaker 10:         01:16:16       Is His fucking critiquing my falafels you don't, it was, it was, uh, John Starks from the Knicks was critiquing. Actually, he liked his flat. I don't know who the fuck it wants. Some Queen Latifa. I don't know the fuck it was, but it was almost feels like, dude, you didn't have to go through this fucking humiliation. You already made it, you know, and you're standing here on TV and that they're, they're filming your fucking humiliation. And I think that that's what happens to guys like Owen Wilson. He got into this business. No one gets in this business to be in me, you and dupree you want to make on the waterfront. You want to be in the next Godfather, whatever you want, you want to do that shit. But what happens? You've got a mortgage payment. He got shit you have to do, you know, all your relatives and third cousins know you're famous.

Speaker 10:         01:17:03       So the very least you got to buy them all iPods for Christmas. That costs money. And next thing you know you're, yeah, you're in me, you and Magoo. And that's still only about he can have on your face, sort of put puckering up your lips. Like, it's not like, you know, do you want to kiss me? And so like, Ooh, Ooh, they guess this one's gonna suck. Sorry about this one guys. I swear to God, the next one's going to be a little more artistic, you know, and then you look, somebody asked for an hour and a half and somehow that ends up in the paper and they call you the butterscotch stallion. And the next thing you know, I don't know. I don't fucking know. I don't even know what, I don't even know what any of that even meant.

Speaker 10:         01:17:45       But uh, yeah, I wouldn't say that. That guy's overrated. I think you know he's a actually is because this will just keep making money. I think he's a good actor, but he doesn't make good movies. All right. Underrated. Um, this guy says the movie, the last dragon, anything with two lead characters named shown enough. The shogun of Harlem and Bruce Leroy has my attention, my ads or admiration. Once again. What's your, what the fucking guy wrote? I mean, you know what I mean? You guys are going to have to start getting like leaving me voicemail messages and then I'll just press play cause I cannot read out loud to save my life. Alright, overrated. Um, find my space bitches sending you invites to join them at clubs, record release parties or New Year's events. I'm not really gonna meet them. And what am I going to say if I do meet them?

Speaker 10:         01:18:32       Like good boy, you put my mind space Dan coming. Oh we you exactly. You might as well go stand in line for a fucking hot dog at pink's. Um, you don't, half the time it's not even, it's not even the person you know, choose usually some fucking fat bald guy who just takes some random picture of a girl with a bikini, you know? All right, here's another underrated guy. I liked this one. Somebody said, Billy squire is underrated. It gets no client. His music gets no classic rock radio play anymore. But tell me that. Don't say no, doesn't kick ass. And I don't know. I don't know about Billy squire squire. He's kind of like drew Bledsoe. You know, he sorta has hall of fame numbers, but he never, he never won a ring. You know, I don't know. Let's, let's see. He further defense and let's see what else he has to say.

Speaker 10:         01:19:26       Said, admittedly it's not as in the same league as back in black. Yes, exactly. But when lonely in the night or the stroke or mind kind of love or unexpectedly do get radio airplay, you blast the car stereo. All right. I gotta tell you something. When the stroke comes on, I actually turn it down a little bit. I'd have to be in the middle of the Berkshires somewhere in the middle of nowhere to actually turn that song. It just, I don't know that song. Uh, I think if you're in seventh grade, that's song holds up, you know, and in that hand, yeah. Heard stroke mi stroke me. I mean, eat guys, he's a rock star. He really still just getting the hand jobs and I don't get it. Um, I bought, I got to say the drummer and Billy Squire's band did the best John Bonam impersonation I ever heard. And I actually looked him up one time on the Internet. I found out that he actually passed away. So, uh, arrest and peace drummer from Billy squire. All right, here's his, yeah. Isn't that Nice during the holidays? All right, Bill. No. What's really underrated. I like this one. How do she, someone comes off when they say they liked the foreign film.

Speaker 10:         01:20:43       All right, here's his story. This guy I work with who likes to try and sound cultured cause he sees these, these uh, these independent Philly's foreign movies that won best picture at the Albanian film festival if some shit like that. And everyone he talks and every time he talks up a movie, it just sounds like a moving only a douche bag would enjoy. But what makes it worse is what he'll totally is. That'll totally dismiss any movie that sounds that anyone else likes. I recently saw the wrestler with Mickey work and I was telling someone at work that it was, it was pretty good and right away this douche chimes in going, you went to see a movie about wrestling. This comment from a guy who watched the three hour movie about some old man who likes to make pottery and he had to read the whole thing because it was, the dialogue was in Turkish by the way.

Speaker 10:         01:21:36       It goes. See Wrestling. You don't have to like wrestling to appreciate the story. Exactly. Um, all right. First of all, just because it's a foreign film and you have to, you know, read subtitles doesn't mean it's sucks, but that also doesn't mean that it's great. And just because of movies about wrestling doesn't mean it's sucks because this guy is absolutely right. I saw the wrestler to fuck, I think it's a really good movie and Mickey Workers. Great. And um, I don't know. Go see it back. Come on, let's make you Brooke. What did the guy put on 40 pounds of muscle? Wink, wink. You know, anybody else out there? Work out. How much protein do you have to ingest? Wink, wink to put on 40 pounds of muscle. But then again, those wrestlers put on 40 pounds of muscle muscle. Wink, wink. So he did the same.

Speaker 10:         01:22:21       He was method acting. He did what he had to do to put on 40 pounds of muscle. And I looked pretty good in the tights. They're all right. Uh, here's a question or the weekend and I'm going to wrap up this podcast just because, um, I listened to last week's podcast is I was fixing some things on my page and I thought it went along way too long. I think somewhere around a half hours, a good amount of time. All right. [inaudible] question number one, Bill. As a, a former member of planet fitness and having a moral obligation a few weeks ago, I had no choice but to quit planets. Uh, what am I doing here is just overrated, underrated. See, I, I just, I'm just disorganized. All right. I started reading it tonight. I have to read it. What is this? Planet fitness disappoints me on several levels. First off, all their franchises, branch branches, paint.

Speaker 10:         01:23:14       Most, if not all the floor equipment. Uh, gay, purple and yellow color. Oh, this is a guy trying to say that all gyms are gay now. And, uh, um, is there a question at the end of this? Okay. What ever happened to real gyms? Okay. Yeah. The equipment is painted a gay, purple and yellow color. Yeah, just like the Lakers. Oh to comfort sensitive people that are intimidated by muscle heads and or fitness clubs or reality in general. And that is gay. I think by gay he means stupid. And what is even more gay is the fact that you're not allowed to have a barbell on the floor. That means no dead lifts, free standing squats and separate that. Doesn't that mean don't leave the bar there? Cause they don't want to be sued? I Dunno. And it's not like when others I work out with, we are intentionally trying to intimidate people.

Speaker 10:         01:24:11       We're not acting like Hulk Hogan did back in the day to excite a crowd before a match. I'm five eight 160 pounds of scared white meat. I had to quit because I don't want to be converted anymore into a pussy by conforming to their lame rules. I didn't know what the fuck. You know what half of this is might me not being able to read out loud as corporate America's comforting. Most Mormons in this country, they are also eradicating conventional wisdom in American culture to increase their revenue regardless of repercussion. La Fitness sucks balls to actually see, I don't know what, what am I having to the real gems. There's this question. Ah, there are real gyms and you go there and you lay on the floor to do a fucking setups. In the next day you have some sort of rash, like you're on the ultimate fighter and then they have them.

Speaker 10:         01:25:00       They don't mop down there. Fucking Matt's enough. I'm number two. I'm sorry I butchered that whole thing. I apologize. I'll send you a refrigerator magnet or something. All right, Bill. Um, you occasionally mentioned having a girlfriend and you recently went on a hockey trip. Uh, yeah, I did. I went on a three day trip. I went to a home game of the Calgary flames, Edmonton Oilers and the Vancouver Canucks. He, she, he goes, I assume she did not go along. What kind of obstacles did you have to hurdle to avoid a hearing? A bunch of stupid girl complaints about that trip. I didn't have to hurdle any of them. I have a great relationship because I fought the battles I needed to fight so that when I say I'm going on a hockey trip, they can't be like,

Speaker 11:         01:25:43       oh see what does that me, you don't care about me.

Speaker 10:         01:25:47       No, that's not what it means. Is that what it means at all? It means I like hockey and I want to go on a trip. That's all it means. See you on Monday. Yeah. No, earlier in my, my dating career, I used to have to go through shit like that. But you know, you just, you just have to have the battles and you don't get, don't scream and yell if you just say in a very nice way. Listen, I worked very hard this year. You know, I've, I've, uh, you know, done. I'm not going to get until the intimate details of shit that I've done. Okay. I've earned the right. Okay. I'm coming back. I'm not going to go up there and fucking bang an Eskimo. I'm just going up there with, you know, with some friends to go on a hockey trip. There's no problems.

Speaker 10:         01:26:32       Okay. Stop making me feel guilty for doing something fun and uh, that pretty much ends it. In other words, grow with Dick and your fucking relationship and a, yeah, don't, don't paint yourself. If you're in a relationship right now where you're not allowed to go do something fun with somebody other than the person you're dating, you're not in a relationship, you are actually a hostage. And you need to get out of that situation. You know, make a youtube video, blink, SOS, do whatever the fuck you have to do, but get out of that relationship because just get out of it because it's not going to get better once you've given up that territory. You know what I mean? It's like all these Mexicans you see protesting about, you know, getting Texas back. You're not getting it back. You know, it's over. It's fucking done. You know, you need to pick up a gun to get it back.

Speaker 10:         01:27:18       So put down your signs cause it's fucking over. All right. Question number three, uh, Bill podcast, quite a podcast. What's the, okay. One of my favorite things to do every month is flipped a flipped to the back of vanity fair to see if an artist, I like his answer, answering the Proust questionnaire. Um, whatever the fuck that is. There are. Okay. Basically, there are a slew of questions and I would love to hear how you would answer all of them. But for the purpose of this email, I will only specifically ask, what are your favorite favorite qualities in a man and what are your favorite qualities in a woman? Oh, okay. So this is obviously a questionnaire where they, they ask celebrities what they're looking for in a mate. What am I favorite qualities in a man? Um, he's not a Douche. Uh, he adheres to Guy Code, which I'm not going to tell you what that is because only men should know what that is. Um, has a strong jaw orders for me when I go out to dinner, holds the door, act like a gentleman, but isn't afraid of my opinions.

Speaker 10:         01:28:30       Um, yeah, I don't know. What am I favorite qualities in a man? Uh, I don't know. He eats with his mouth closed. You know, I don't like those fucking a crow, like fucking half a caveman guys. You know what I mean? Like those guys like, uh, like morons. I don't like hanging around with dumb people, men or women and uh, yeah, I, you know, I like to be hanging out with the guy who's in a relationship that he's happy to be in so I don't have to listen to them bitch about it or pretend to be happy in it. Common sense stuff. And one of my favorite qualities in a woman, um, I like a woman who's, who's a neat one of my biggest turn off of women's, a women's. I don't, we don't, I don't like about the women's is when the bitches be messy.

Speaker 10:         01:29:19       No, seriously. A woman who's Messi is one of the biggest turnoffs ever. You know what I mean? That's like a guy who can't pick up something heavy. You know, if you're like a woman, you know, like, oh, can you give me a hand with this? And he like breaks a nail. Like when that turn you off, that's like ground zero of being a man is you should actually have some sort of physical strength and what the woman is, they should know how to keep the house clean. That's right. I just said that and I don't think that is sexist. All right. I think that's one of the fucking great things that a woman does, teaches you how not to live like a fucking animal. It's one of the things that they're allegedly naturally good at. Although I find a lot of women to be pretty fucking messy and I'm, yeah, I'm old school women who can cook and clean and all that type of stuff, you know?

Speaker 10:         01:30:10       Um, I'm not saying that I'm going to walk, walk in like a cave man with mud on my shoes and you should have to sweep up behind me, but like the same way women still want guys to know how to be handy around the house. Yeah. Women who can cook or the shit. Women with a sense of humor woman who actually are into sports a little bit. I understand. Most of you think it's retarded. Yeah. That type of Shit, you know, and uh, I don't like horse. I like classy women. Women who live around. Yeah. Classically beautiful. Yeah, I dunno that type of shit and see, know it's none of your fucking business. All right.

Speaker 10:         01:30:47       After that was, I just felt bad divulging all that personal information and I just felt like I was opening up too much. I got a little scared. Okay. The very least in this podcast question, you know, you got to listen to, to doing there. My impression of the 700 club. All right, question number four. Um, do you believe in God? If so, how can you be so fucking stupid? Um, you know, I actually understand what you're saying that, but I definitely do believe in a higher power, but I don't believe in it within the context of organized religion. Um, if that makes any sense. I definitely believe in a higher power, something, whatever it is.

Speaker 10:         01:31:26       Like, I mean, how the fuck did all this stuff get made? But it's just so crazy. I think that there's this big thing that that made all of it in. Where was he when he made it or did he have to be in something that had to be created? I don't know what the fuck's going on, but I know the answers are not in organized religion. That is just basically an updated version of, of cavemen paintings on the walls. And uh, you know, when people get really religious, super, super religious, they somehow get really angry and they get violent and it leads towards, and uh, yeah, I don't believe in it, but I definitely, you know, when I contemplate my own death, I do get scared that I'm not a member of any organized religion, you know, so, uh, I dunno. I Dunno. I, you know, I don't fucking know.

Speaker 10:         01:32:17       I, I believe in a higher power, but I don't believe in it within organized religion. Okay. The final question, here we go. Number five, Bill, is there any way to listen to on the uninformed show you do on Xm? I don't have an, an, an an XM subscription, but I did enjoy the live version you did on opie and Anthony a couple of weeks back while the one we did on opie. And Anthony was on Xm, wasn't it? Um, no, there's no way to listen to it without that. And we don't have the money in the budget to, uh, I dunno. I Dunno what we have to do with that. That's something that's one of my New Year's resolutions to somehow get it up on the Internet. For those of you new to the podcast, I do this radio show on informed. It's on Xm. I do it with Joe de Rosa.

Speaker 10:         01:32:59       We do a once a month or lately, once every other month because shit has been fucking weird. But anyways, that is the end of the podcast. Um, I appreciate you guys all this year. You know, I just want to say thanks to everybody for everybody sending in your questions and uh, you know, your contributions to the podcasts are the reasons why that it's now 50 minutes long as opposed to the back in the day. Remember back in the day when I used to do it in a one room shack and I could only talk for eight minutes and then I'd have to hang up. Well thanks to you. It works for all of us to build burn Monday morning podcast. All right, you guys have a very happy new year and um, oh, there's one for you. That's what I think is fucking overrated is new years. It's, it's, it's the dumbest fucking thing ever.

Speaker 10:         01:33:44       I'm actually going to walk out and make a peanut butter sandwich while I talk about how overrated fucking new years is this. This is bonus time. You guys didn't have to listen to this. This is like after the game when you know who won and you're listening to the postgame analysis and there's really no reason to fucking do that. This is what this part of the podcast is seen on obligated to listen to any of that as I make a fucking peanut butter sandwich. MMM. Look at that. Does the parking tickets from a tank sweat on my refrigerator? Just mocking me. Huh? Mocking me and the awful fucking hot dog that I done. Yeah. You don't need to go out on new years. You know, I've actually been, cause I'm finally taking new years off. I'm looking at all these regular bars, you know, of course my girl wants to go someplace fancy so she has a place to where her new year's dress, which I totally understand, but now all of these regular bars that have like a fucking $10 cover charge, it's all 40 bucks, 50 75 some places are leaving even like 150 bucks to do what?

Speaker 10:         01:34:48       Go out and drink, which you can do at home for free and now he's standing next to fucking day was jam packed. It's hot. People with plastic hats, those stupid fucking horns blowing it in your ear. That's how you really want to bring in the new year, getting completely overcharged for some shit to stand with a bunch of other douche bags. Three, two, one, you know that's all overrated and all you fucking scared whores out there whose dads didn't stick around. So you have low self esteem and you drink too much and then you go into that panic way like, oh my God, I, it's new year's. I need someone to kiss. I have to have someone to kiss. You don't, don't give into peer pressure. You know, sweetheart, if you want to wonder why you always end up in the bathroom on your knees in the stall. It's because you given to herd mentality. You don't have to do that. You don't, you don't need somebody to kiss, but you need to do is contemplate, you know, the fact that you don't have someone to kiss and that that's okay and that you should hold out for someone who's going to treat you good rather than drag you in it into the fucking bathroom at 1201 to make you fucking, you know, so you can suck your first deck of 2009 2000 oh nine 2009 you know what I mean?

Speaker 10:         01:36:14       I don't know. You don't actually put jelly on it. I've been trying to just do the protein, but I had to put jelly on a sandwich because you know, you try to eat a peanut butter sandwich and you know, you dislocate your job by the time you'd done shoe and all of it. It's just a fucking pain in the ass. So anyways, thanks for listening to the podcast. Everybody. Please keep the questions coming and it's not too late to send in your New Year's resolutions. And you know what? I liked that a lot of people didn't send any new year's resolutions. You didn't follow the fucking pack and make one. You could make one anytime of the year. And uh, that's it. I'm in my little breasts, breakfast Nook, and the sun is shining it
