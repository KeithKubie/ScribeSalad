00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:27.329 align:start position:0%
people so it's I like she's sort of
 

00:09:27.329 --> 00:09:29.150 align:start position:0%
people so it's I like she's sort of
being<00:09:27.509><c> pulled</c><00:09:27.809><c> everywhere</c><00:09:28.319><c> and</c><00:09:28.559><c> that's</c><00:09:28.740><c> again</c>

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
being pulled everywhere and that's again
 

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.850 align:start position:0%
being pulled everywhere and that's again
that's<00:09:29.369><c> a</c><00:09:29.550><c> big</c><00:09:30.230><c> heavyweight</c><00:09:31.230><c> you</c><00:09:31.559><c> know</c><00:09:31.679><c> on</c>

that's a big heavyweight you know on
 

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.970 align:start position:0%
that's a big heavyweight you know on
someone<00:09:32.160><c> that's</c><00:09:32.490><c> said</c><00:09:32.970><c> to</c><00:09:32.999><c> be</c><00:09:33.329><c> you</c><00:09:33.660><c> know</c><00:09:33.980><c> they</c>

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
someone that's said to be you know they
 

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.439 align:start position:0%
someone that's said to be you know they
have<00:09:35.189><c> so</c><00:09:35.399><c> many</c><00:09:35.519><c> great</c><00:09:35.730><c> expectations</c>

00:09:36.439 --> 00:09:36.449 align:start position:0%
have so many great expectations
 

00:09:36.449 --> 00:09:40.639 align:start position:0%
have so many great expectations
essentially<00:09:36.959><c> so</c><00:09:37.790><c> yeah</c><00:09:38.790><c> so</c><00:09:39.449><c> I</c><00:09:39.480><c> still</c><00:09:40.019><c> like</c><00:09:40.230><c> it</c><00:09:40.470><c> I</c>

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:40.649 align:start position:0%
essentially so yeah so I still like it I
 

00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:42.499 align:start position:0%
essentially so yeah so I still like it I
hope<00:09:41.189><c> some</c><00:09:41.670><c> of</c><00:09:41.699><c> the</c><00:09:41.819><c> more</c><00:09:41.939><c> episodes</c><00:09:42.329><c> have</c><00:09:42.480><c> a</c>

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:42.509 align:start position:0%
hope some of the more episodes have a
 

00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:43.850 align:start position:0%
hope some of the more episodes have a
little<00:09:42.660><c> bit</c><00:09:42.749><c> more</c><00:09:42.899><c> time</c><00:09:43.110><c> dedicated</c><00:09:43.589><c> to</c><00:09:43.649><c> this</c>

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
little bit more time dedicated to this
 

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.309 align:start position:0%
little bit more time dedicated to this
but<00:09:44.100><c> again</c><00:09:44.309><c> it's</c><00:09:44.429><c> only</c><00:09:44.490><c> only</c><00:09:45.420><c> 12</c><00:09:45.869><c> I</c><00:09:46.139><c> mean</c>

00:09:46.309 --> 00:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
but again it's only only 12 I mean
 

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:48.139 align:start position:0%
but again it's only only 12 I mean
that's<00:09:46.529><c> that's</c><00:09:46.740><c> that's</c><00:09:47.459><c> tricky</c><00:09:47.939><c> for</c>

00:09:48.139 --> 00:09:48.149 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's tricky for
 

00:09:48.149 --> 00:09:50.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's tricky for
especially<00:09:48.420><c> for</c><00:09:48.809><c> you</c><00:09:49.470><c> know</c><00:09:49.529><c> coming</c><00:09:49.769><c> off</c><00:09:49.980><c> with</c>

00:09:50.119 --> 00:09:50.129 align:start position:0%
especially for you know coming off with
 

00:09:50.129 --> 00:09:52.100 align:start position:0%
especially for you know coming off with
something<00:09:50.279><c> like</c><00:09:50.399><c> avatar</c><00:09:51.029><c> which</c><00:09:51.480><c> did</c><00:09:51.720><c> this</c><00:09:51.839><c> so</c>

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.110 align:start position:0%
something like avatar which did this so
 

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
something like avatar which did this so
well<00:09:53.569><c> so</c><00:09:54.569><c> yeah</c><00:09:55.170><c> we'll</c><00:09:55.499><c> just</c><00:09:55.829><c> see</c><00:09:55.920><c> where</c><00:09:56.040><c> it</c>

00:09:56.119 --> 00:09:56.129 align:start position:0%
well so yeah we'll just see where it
 

00:09:56.129 --> 00:09:58.009 align:start position:0%
well so yeah we'll just see where it
goes<00:09:56.220><c> from</c><00:09:56.279><c> there</c><00:09:56.490><c> that's</c><00:09:57.029><c> about</c><00:09:57.209><c> it</c><00:09:57.569><c> take</c>

00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.019 align:start position:0%
goes from there that's about it take
 

00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
goes from there that's about it take
care
