Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. That's called theirs. I think they should bring, they shouldn't, you know how hockey that you still fighting hockey? Nascar fights. Yeah. Pull out in the pit. Stop wants Duke it out. Let's, yeah, let's say if there's a caution. Everyone else was lapping. You've got two guys. Have a beef pullover. Get out of the car. Whoa. In the middle of the infield grass, we have a wrestling rink and it's like full on. Let's go get in the rink. We'll get it, we'll give you two minutes. And then if you win that match, maybe you get a little time shaving off. You know? So it's uh, there's advantage to, uh, I'd watched that more if it were like half wrestling, half now put the Natya leap, right. Mascot Nascar's a weird one, right? Because it's, it's obviously fun to watch. It's fun to be there, but it's not as fun as Formula One.

Speaker 1:          00:48          You Watch Formula One, you're like, well, these guys are going way faster when those wheels. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's a whole nother thing. Yeah. Those wheels touch. It's over. You're in the air right now. Yeah. These guys now is called. A lot of that happens and it's fine. It's true that one wheel. Wow. Yeah. And those guys die. Yeah. Well I guess Nascar guys did too. Yeah. Not as much anymore, but mean anybody's driving a fucking car going fast can die. What am I saying? But there's something about, have you ever see the video between um, they showed gt three race racing versus formula one racing. It's the same track and they show a good gt three car look, a Porsche going around this car really fast and then they show the same exact path being taken by a formula one car. And you're like, Jesus watches watches.

Speaker 1:          01:36          Yeah. One on the left, the tool and won't how much faster they are now. What's the Oh, okay. That's the same track as the same track. Exact same turn. Look how much goddamn faster. They are bad at it so far. Is that car going on the right? I don't know, man. That's insane. It seems amazing and perfect line. He's cutting. See how the line perfect racing line is cut into the groove. Like you see that darkness. Yup. Yup. That's a bunch of talented drivers. Another thank you. I think the fastest I've ever been is like maybe 115. You ever been on a racetrack? I've been on a race track. Yeah. Yeah. But not, you know, not at a pace car, you know. Oh, the Nascar. Yeah. Yeah. But uh, but the Daytona 500 has that huge, you know, the incline and just being down there and seeing that standing there next to it like, well, I didn't know his best steep.

Speaker 1:          02:29          You have to go faster and stay on that then that is pretty wild. And people get hit up there. They bump wheels up there and collide and fucking spin out. Yeah. Look at that thing. Yeah. Yeah. That's a serious bank, like a wall that is a little turn to the picture, but still. What is, um, what do you think that degree is? Like what angle? Uh, they've told me before, I forgot. It's probably like, it's pretty serious. 20 degrees first one third or one degree. One degree. Whoa. Wow. That's crazy. That's insane. That's, I mean, if you would be nervous if you're on a skateboard on that thing, you have to go a certain speed just to stay up on the probably, right. Yeah. It's such an American sport, man. Nascar's so American because it's allowed as fuck. Yeah. The cars are gross. Yeah. They look to Scott.

Speaker 1:          03:22          They're so gross looking. Yeah. They don't look anything like the real car. How many sponsors are all right? Yeah. If you have a really nice car that's supposed to be the model that that car is and that the Cask, our car looks gross and they, the decal, they make fake headlights. It's a sticker of the head. I won't even put that on there. Yeah. What are we doing? Why are you lying to me? Yeah. Yeah. It's a fascinating piece of equipment though. Yeah. That we've decided to make these things that just drive really fast and then hurl them around the circle, this oval over and over and so high tech, like every, they count every little, the drafting of it, they, they know it. Every angle. It's, you know, all of that. But back in the day, it was just a couple of good old boys.

Speaker 1:          04:05          That moonshine. I'm trying to outrun this actually. Yeah. That's actually what I want to say. That was hot rodding and it's fine. It's, that's what it was. That's what I want to say. Put money down in them cars and that fun that, that's where it all came from. Yes. Guys are trying to figure out how to get the fuck away from cops. Cops used to have the fanciest cars, man. Yeah. You think that they had to chase people and like caprice classics with Bob Bench seats? Yeah. That is the worst car from handling with dress shoes. Yeah. Oh my God. They make them wear a stupid shoes. Yeah. Yeah. Some Nike's that's back in the day. That's like the fur on the beach while I taught I was on the ocean was Daytona 500 the first event. Uh, you know, I think so. I think, well, I'm not, no, I don't know about that, but I know that's, it was on the, on the sand.

Speaker 1:          04:53          Okay. The first Daytona was on the sand. I believe she's around the sand. Yeah, they're driving in the sand. This is crazy. They're not going as fast. All those cars are social, convertible. It looks like the Batmobile. They are convertibles. Convertibles. Wow. That's what I want to see. I'll bring back the dam convertible in Nascar. I want to see these dudes faces. Wonder why they made them in convertibles? I'd have no, yeah, well they got the roll bar. Yeah. But still, I mean I bet it gets too hot in there and they probably didn't have air conditioning. Right. And yeah, that's probably it was, it's on fire. It's easier to get out when you don't have a roof. Yeah. Yeah. Those people probably died. Those things all the time. Those shitty cars. Like if you are a car racer back then you were going to crash. There's no way you're going to know. You're not going to keep it together every time. Uh, what's the fastest you think you've been in a vehicle? I don't want to say cause we're on there. Ah, well you know, you say where, what country it was in. Uh, I don't know. This could be on Germany, on the auto mile. In the one hundreds yeah, yeah.
