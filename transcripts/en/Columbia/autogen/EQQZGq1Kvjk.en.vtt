of this was fairly early on in the

00:11:59.069 --> 00:11:59.079
of this was fairly early on in the
 

00:11:59.079 --> 00:12:00.540
of this was fairly early on in the
process that this interview took place

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:00.550
process that this interview took place
 

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.840

and

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:04.850
 

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:09.860
in this particular clip I think you can

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:09.870
in this particular clip I think you can
 

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.769
in this particular clip I think you can
hear a little bit of the hesitation as

00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:12.779

it doesn't come out quickly at first it
comes out haltingly and then the

comes out haltingly and then the
 

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.370
comes out haltingly and then the
memories start coming together like

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:24.380

these oral history interviews that was
 

00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:41.360
these oral history interviews that was
one of the first things that I noticed

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:41.370
one of the first things that I noticed
 

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.440
one of the first things that I noticed
like within a half an hour

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:42.450
like within a half an hour
 

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:50.690
like within a half an hour
the voices started getting hoarse it was

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:50.700
the voices started getting hoarse it was
 

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.140
the voices started getting hoarse it was
it was kind of a process of unfolding

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:53.150

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.180
it was kind of a process of unfolding
during these interviews and it takes

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:56.190
during these interviews and it takes
 

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.250
during these interviews and it takes
years it takes six years for a woman

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:58.260
years it takes six years for a woman
 

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.300

this slow steady integration into the

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.010
this slow steady integration into the
 

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.480
this slow steady integration into the
community who ended up being nerd in my

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:08.490
community who ended up being nerd in my
 

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.630
community who ended up being nerd in my
own involvement in this project like I

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:11.640
own involvement in this project like I
 

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.360

told I was in Switzerland and spoke at a

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:14.370
told I was in Switzerland and spoke at a
 

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:18.019
told I was in Switzerland and spoke at a
couple schools and I said it to the

00:13:18.019 --> 00:13:18.029
couple schools and I said it to the
 

00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:21.410
couple schools and I said it to the
students I I needed to take six years to

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420
students I I needed to take six years to
 

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.690

learn about the culture not before
writing about it and they said it took

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:26.640
writing about it and they said it took
 

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.470
writing about it and they said it took
six years and I hadn't thought about it

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480
six years and I hadn't thought about it
 

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.320
six years and I hadn't thought about it
before but it takes that exact amount of

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:33.330
before but it takes that exact amount of
 

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.970
before but it takes that exact amount of
time for a woman to go through the

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980
time for a woman to go through the
 

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.250
time for a woman to go through the
process of formation one year of

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.260
process of formation one year of
 

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.820

make final vows and it just so happened
 

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.329
make final vows and it just so happened
that it mirrored that kind of a

00:13:52.329 --> 00:13:52.339
that it mirrored that kind of a
 

00:13:52.339 --> 00:13:55.930
that it mirrored that kind of a
structure

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:55.940
 

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.690
initially when I was making photographs

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:57.700
initially when I was making photographs
 

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:02.280
initially when I was making photographs
because they prized their hiddenness I

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:02.290
because they prized their hiddenness I
 

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:07.240
because they prized their hiddenness I
tried to not photograph them directly

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:07.250
tried to not photograph them directly
 

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:12.040
tried to not photograph them directly
based on there are a few few photographs

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.050
based on there are a few few photographs
 

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.980
based on there are a few few photographs
from the photographic series that are

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:14.990
from the photographic series that are
 

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.020
from the photographic series that are
straight in their faces I did end up

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:17.030
straight in their faces I did end up
 

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.680
straight in their faces I did end up
making portraits of them of their faces

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:19.690
making portraits of them of their faces
 

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:26.980
making portraits of them of their faces
later on but I really tried to respect

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:26.990
later on but I really tried to respect
 

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:31.000
later on but I really tried to respect
their their desire for hiddenness and

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.010
their their desire for hiddenness and
 

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:36.220
their their desire for hiddenness and
anonymity this is so much of this

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:36.230
anonymity this is so much of this
 

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:40.120
anonymity this is so much of this
process with I mean it was just such a

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:40.130
process with I mean it was just such a
 

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.360
process with I mean it was just such a
learning experience like when I was in

viewer truly but my role has kind of
 

01:08:08.099 --> 01:08:11.269
viewer truly but my role has kind of
shifted and I really think that it just

01:08:11.269 --> 01:08:11.279
shifted and I really think that it just
 

01:08:11.279 --> 01:08:13.760

01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:18.430
wouldn't have said now I'm gonna do this
but it just kind of evolved that way and

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:18.440
but it just kind of evolved that way and
 

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:22.189
but it just kind of evolved that way and
I don't think I could have done this

01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199
I don't think I could have done this
 

01:08:22.199 --> 01:08:25.099
I don't think I could have done this
without having done that like it it had

01:08:25.099 --> 01:08:25.109
without having done that like it it had
 

01:08:25.109 --> 01:08:27.309
without having done that like it it had
to happen

01:08:27.309 --> 01:08:27.319
