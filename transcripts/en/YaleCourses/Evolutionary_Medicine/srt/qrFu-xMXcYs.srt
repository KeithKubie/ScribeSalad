1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,300
As we saw in the last lecture.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,220
The recent history of humans is one
of spreading across the planet and

3
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:10,730
encountering different diets and
different pathogens as they spread.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,860
They also changed for random
reasons genetically as a result,

5
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:19,730
patients very genetically and ability
to resist infectious disease and in

6
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:22,730
susceptibility to degenerative diseases.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,430
Because of this recent
evolutionary history,

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,030
there were observations quite a while
back that suggested that people very

9
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:36,860
genetically and their susceptibility to
disease children are at greater risk of

10
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:41,390
succumbing to an infectious disease if
one of their parents had it for several

11
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:44,960
diseases that include TB
and bacterial meningitis.

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,800
Many are infected but few gets sick,
so some are resistant.

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,810
People living in an area where a disease
is endemic are often more resistant

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,000
than those in a region where the disease
is not exist indicating that there's

15
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,120
some local adaptation to disease.
No.

16
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:06,960
There are a number of approaches to
find genes for disease resistance.

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,850
The first is the candidate gene approach
and this is the older of the two

18
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:15,870
approaches. For example, a
combination of biological insight,

19
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:20,871
biochemistry cell biology was used
to identify sickle cell anemia,

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,120
other hemoglobin variants that
confirmed malaria resistance.

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,700
The more recent approaches a genome
wide association studies g was,

22
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:37,370
so these are based on single nucleotide
polymorphisms and whole genome sequences

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,040
and they have suggested
many more candidate genes,

24
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,870
most of which have much smaller effects
than those that were identified with

25
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:47,100
Kennedy gene approaches.

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,873
Okay.

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,030
Some of the susceptibility genes that
were discovered with Kennedy gene

28
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:55,400
approaches are two major diseases.

29
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:58,040
And let's first take a
look at the diseases.

30
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:03,041
So we can see here that out of this list
of six genes that have been identified,

31
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,320
four of them relate to malaria.

32
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:11,270
This is a real signal of how important a
selective agent malaria has been in the

33
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:12,470
recent human past.

34
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,540
Another is for quite filled yakoff
disease that is a prion disease.

35
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,990
Another is for HIV one,

36
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,080
so for the virus that causes AIDS,

37
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,590
that is a receptor called CCR five and
another is for Norwalk virus diarrhea.

38
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:31,041
And by the way,

39
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:34,970
it's not surprising that a gene providing
resistance to diarrhea would be on one

40
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:39,830
of the top lists because diarrhea is one
of the major causes of infant mortality

41
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,933
on the planet.

42
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,640
So here we have the
particular names of the genes,

43
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:47,940
both their uh,

44
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,020
acronym and the condition or the
variant that is associated with these.

45
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,730
And these were discovered
between 1954 and 2003.

46
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,480
One of the,
uh,

47
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,620
genetic systems that's implicated in
disease resistance is the blood Abo blood

48
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,230
group system.
For example,

49
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,920
people who are blood type
a are more susceptible and
people who are blood type o

50
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,600
are more resistant to
plasmodium falciparum.

51
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,010
That is the pathogen that causes
the Nastier type of malaria.

52
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,550
Okay.

53
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,060
People with blood type O on the other
hand are more susceptible and people with

54
00:03:29,061 --> 00:03:32,450
blood type B are more
resistant to Norwalk virus.

55
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,350
And so these are both serious issues
and you can see here that there's a

56
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:39,050
tradeoff going on among
these genetic variants.

57
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,730
The one that's good for resisting one
disease is not good for resisting another.

58
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,850
Yeah.

59
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,600
Oh. And a are both more susceptible
to helix. Go back to Pylori,

60
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,560
which adheres to gastric epethelial
cells that use blood group antigens

61
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:54,850
associated with,
oh,

62
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,510
so people with type O are going to be
more susceptible to having a stomach

63
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:02,110
ulcers and gastric cancer.

64
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:04,580
Okay.

65
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,580
That blood group is more common in
isolated populations in central and South

66
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,423
American Indians.

67
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:11,560
Okay.

68
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,340
Susceptibility to syphilis collar
and play. Also the pen on Abo genes

69
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,060
and mutations can cause reduce secretion
of Abo into saliva and those that are

70
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,760
homozygous nonsecure heaters. There are
at higher risk of infectious disease.

71
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:33,250
For example, meningitis. However,

72
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:37,060
see critters are at higher risk of
upper respiratory tract infections,

73
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,740
so you can see that even within this
system just how much of it is expressed

74
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:46,741
leads to a tradeoff between susceptibility
to meningitis or upper respiratory

75
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:47,770
tract problems.

76
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:49,890
Yeah.

77
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,150
Here is an example of a g was result
to give you some familiarity with it.

78
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,720
What you see here on the x axis is
the DNA sequence along a particular

79
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:06,000
chromosome. This chromosome 18 and
these are positions in kilobytes,

80
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,040
so marching down the chromosome.

81
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:13,041
If this is 18,000 that means that we are
18 million positions from the beginning

82
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:18,111
of the chromosome and the black
dots and the colored dots.

83
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:24,651
Here are the probabilities that a
particular snip is associated with the

84
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:28,200
disease.
So the way this is done,

85
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:32,190
as you have a sample of people that do
or do not have the disease and do or do

86
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:36,810
not have the sniff and you marched
down in doing the analysis,

87
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:40,710
you go right down the chromosome
looking at each position and asking how

88
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:45,711
strongly is this position position
associated with the disease on the y axis,

89
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,220
what we have basically is the probability.

90
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,210
So the higher the position on the y axis,

91
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:56,190
the more significant the result is.

92
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,580
This result here with the purple dot
has a probability of being observed at

93
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:04,670
random of about one in a billion.

94
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,850
It's about actually a
third of one in a billion.

95
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,800
So this is a highly significant result
and as you go down the chromosome,

96
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,810
you can see that many of the
results are now highly significant.

97
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,940
And then suddenly when
you hit this position,

98
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,870
which has this particular
name for that snip,

99
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,010
you get a highly significant result.
Now

100
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,560
the other thing that you should note are
these green lines down here with these

101
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,710
little spikes in them.
These are recombination frequencies.

102
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:43,030
What they show basically is the chunk of
the chromosome which is associated with

103
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:49,460
the snip, so this area is
recombining fairly frequently here.

104
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,630
This one is certainly recombining
frequently in these somewhat less.

105
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,290
This particular snip therefore is strongly
associated with any gene that's in

106
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:04,811
this part of the chromosome and particular
one which is called Rbb p eight so it

107
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:11,330
is riding through the generations
and through many different people,

108
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,620
mostly in association with this gene.
So you can think of it.

109
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:21,200
You can think of the snip is a flag
planted into the chromosome that marks a

110
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:21,860
chunk of it,

111
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,860
which is reliably associated through
recombination events and continues to be

112
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,220
associated with it.

113
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:33,221
It is passed through parents and offspring
and descendants and this is the kind

114
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,940
of result that leads to the identification
of a gene associated with particular

115
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:43,370
illness by g was in particular.

116
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:48,371
This one is for tuberculosis and it
is using mostly results from people in

117
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:52,520
Africa
using that method.

118
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,980
Here is a list of genes for disease
resistance that were confirmed and then

119
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:02,030
extended by Ge was and up at the top.

120
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,280
Basically we can see many of
the ones we've seen before,

121
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,150
but then you can see that there are quite
a few others that have been added to

122
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:11,984
it.

123
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,140
And in addition we find protection for
particular variants against Noro virus

124
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:21,470
against leprosy, against
meningitis, against bacteremias.

125
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,410
Interestingly, there are one, two, three,

126
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,720
four entries here for leprosy indicating
how important leprosy has been as a

127
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:31,880
selective agent in recent human history.

128
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,850
So to summarize,

129
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:39,851
first on g was the sequencing of the
human genome made possible the development

130
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,120
of these Genome Wide Association Studies,

131
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:49,390
g was some only had had been identified
with significant impacts on important

132
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,030
common diseases.
However,

133
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,620
their effects sizes
are often fairly small.

134
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:00,270
We're not able to explain very much of
the susceptibility to those diseases

135
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:02,250
through genetic variation of this type.

136
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,240
There are causal links to the diseases
can be obscure and that means that the

137
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:12,780
promise of individual medicine based on
information and genetic sequences is not

138
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:17,130
yet really fully realized.
However,

139
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:21,420
the cost of sequencing a human
genome is dropping. Remarkably.

140
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,660
The white line here is Moore's law that
relates to the processing power of chips

141
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,230
and uh,
it has been dropping steadily.

142
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:36,120
This is a log scale here.
This is time along this axis.

143
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,260
And what you can see is that the cost
per genome was dropping about at the rate

144
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:43,410
of Moore's law up until about 2007.

145
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,490
And since then it's going much
faster. And in fact, in 2015,

146
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,520
one can sequence a human genome
for about a thousand to $1,500.

147
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,250
And that is putting whole genome
sequencing within the reach of clinical

148
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:00,840
medicine for individual patients,

149
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,960
for people who are in rich developed
countries and have good insurance support.

150
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,150
So to summarize,

151
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,170
as humans spread across the planet
and differentiated genetically,

152
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,310
they produced populations that have
different kinds and amounts of genetic

153
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:18,144
variation.

154
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,670
Genetic variation for Disease Resistance
has been identified for malaria,

155
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:28,470
leprosy, HIV, typhoid, fever,
Norwalk virus, prion disease,

156
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,760
and tuberculosis.

157
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,890
The patterns that are now observed could
have been produced both by a loss of

158
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:38,530
resistance in some groups and
by its acquisition in others.

159
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,840
This can work both ways.

160
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,050
Genetic variation for susceptibility
has been identified for 11 diseases,

161
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,310
including type two diabetes,
biliary liver cirrhosis,

162
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,610
inflammatory bowel disease,
and pancreatic cancer.

163
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,540
Proper treatment will often require
precise determination of an individual's

164
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:05,541
that genomic state and the current cost
of sequencing that state is about a

165
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,070
thousand to $1,500 so it
is getting within reach.
