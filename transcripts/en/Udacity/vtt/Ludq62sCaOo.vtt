Let's experiment a bit more. What if we wanted to print Hello World on separate

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.840
lines, like this. Hello on the first line, and World on the second line. Can

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.060
you write this program? Try doing it in BlueJ, and then pasting it into our

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.830
IDE. If you can't get BlueJ working right now, then just use our IDE.
