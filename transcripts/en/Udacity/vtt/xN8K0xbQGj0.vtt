00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.640
Now we know that there are four

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.130
different kinds of deoxynucleotides in DNA and each

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.740
one varies in this region here. These colored

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.660
variable regions are what we call the nitrogenous

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.740
base. It's called a nitrogenous base because

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.860
it contains an element from the periodic table

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.490
called nitrogen, that's what the N represents right

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.350
here in each of these structures. The reason

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.370
there are four different types of deoxynucleotides is because there are four

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.411
different types of nitrogenous bases. The

00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:37.761
four different chemical structures for nitrogenous bases

00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:44.660
in DNA are adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. Sometimes we note the names

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.810
of these nitrogenous bases or bases

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.590
in shorthand by using one letter abbreviations.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.810
A for adenine. T for thymine. G for guanine. And C for cytosine. Now if we

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.500
go back up to our strand of DNA

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.600
and we replace the nitrogenous base, the chemical structure,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.150
with the letter that represents each base, we

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.020
get a very different looking model that's much easier

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.770
for your eyes to distinguish which type of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.780
deoxynucleotide is in each position of the DNA. So

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.680
now take this new single strand of DNA

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.140
that has a different sequence or order of deoxynucleotides.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.830
See if you can look at this chemical structure

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.220
of the nitrogenous bases in the single strand of

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.050
DNA and write the order of the bases

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.180
in this text box here. Obviously you can use

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.810
the key here at the bottom of the screen

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.770
to see which chemical structure corresponds with which letter.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.920
When you think you know the right answer go ahead and put the sequence

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.820
of letters here in text box altogether with no spaces in between the letters.
