00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.032
No, they're not equivalent.

00:00:02.032 --> 00:00:04.990
Again, let's do what's in
the parentheses first.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:12.951
6 divided by 2 is 3, so we can rewrite
this as 12 divided by 3, which equals 4.

00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:15.495
12 divided by 6 equals 2, so

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:20.038
we can rewrite this as 2 divided by 2,
which equals 1.

00:00:20.038 --> 00:00:25.340
1 does not equal 4, so
these expressions are not equivalent.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.208
The associative property
does not work for division.

00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:31.169
