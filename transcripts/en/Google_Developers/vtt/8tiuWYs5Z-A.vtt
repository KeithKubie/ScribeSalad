TOMER SHARON: Hi, my
name is Tomer Sharon,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.550
and I'm a Google Search
User Experience Researcher

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.730
and the author of
"Lean User Research."

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.940
I'm here to help you ask
your customers, users,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.600
and potential customers
better questions

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.895
and get even better answers.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:24.860
"Converse like a talk show
host, think like a writer,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.820
understand subtext
like a psychiatrist,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.500
and have an ear
like a musician."

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.680
This beautiful thing was said
about interviewing people.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.870
An interview is
gathering information

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.290
through direct dialogue.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.400
Before you start an
interview, though,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.850
ask yourself why
before you get into the

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.340
how to phrase the questions.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.200
Think about the
reason you're there.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.580
What is it that you're
trying to learn?

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.170
A key aspect of
interviewing people

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.880
is getting familiar
with the phenomenon

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.470
that is called rationalization.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.740
Rationalization is
when people, when

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.170
asked about a certain situation
that happened in the past,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.870
they tend to change
reality a little bit

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.080
to be perceived as
good people, to be

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.990
perceived as smart people.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.700
The example I have for
this is if I have ask you,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.830
would you throw a banana peel on
the floor if nobody's looking?

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.580
You would probably say
no, I don't do that.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.310
I'm not that kind of a person.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.680
But given the opportunity
that no one is looking,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.350
two weeks from now,
you might do that.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.390
And it's not because
you're a bad person.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.920
It's not because you don't
believe in what you say

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.830
or you're trying to lie to me.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.770
You rationalize.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.570
You want to be perceived
as a good person,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.910
as a helpful person.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.790
When you interview people,
when you ask people questions,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.040
look for the story.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.940
This is the most important
thing in an interview.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.990
Ask about stories, about
things that happen.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.600
Ask about behavior.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.120
For example, so
in that situation,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.560
you keep quiet and
see what people say.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.580
Better yet, if possible,
ask to observe behavior.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.620
If you're asking
how they read email,

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.660
how they check their email,
ask them to show you that.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.390
Show me how you do that.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.700
Ask about perceptions.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.470
Not because you're
interested in them,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.130
but because they
will help you, again,

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.240
to pull out these stories.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.360
For example, what is the
difference between X and Y?

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.070
Not a very interesting
question, but it

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.170
might cause them to
remember something

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.560
about something
interesting that happened.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.860
The most important
thing in an interview

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.090
is something that doesn't look
like the most important thing--

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.880
follow-up questions.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.170
These will tell you, give
you, a lot of insight

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.350
into what really happened.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.230
Why do you roll your
eyes when you say that?

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.020
What do you mean?

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.690
Why do you call your
phone "my third arm"?

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.720
These are extremely helpful
in understanding behavior.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.860
A few don'ts.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.830
Don't ask people
about the future.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.760
Three questions
product developers tend

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.790
to ask their interviewees are,
would you use the product?

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.020
Would you pay for it?

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.620
And how much you'd pay for it.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.640
These are all very,
very bad questions.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.520
Why?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.430
Because they ask people
to predict the future.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.000
The problem is,
people have no idea.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.390
The even bigger
problem is that they

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.610
think they do have an
idea, and they answer.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.230
Another don't is about
leading the witness.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.420
Don't insert your opinion into
the questions you're asking,

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.990
and then biasing
your interviewees

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.070
into understanding
what you're looking for

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.970
and then give you the
answers that you want, maybe.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.980
Don't intimidate.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.910
If you stand over the shoulder
of someone who's sitting

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.440
and then ask them
a question, that

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.650
is an intimidating
body language.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.520
Don't do that.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.570
That will affect how they
answer your question.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.560
Don't explain the question.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.660
Shut up and see what happens.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.730
When you ask a question,
sometimes there's

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.060
silence from the other side.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.240
Maybe the person is thinking.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.850
Maybe the person is trying
to remember something.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.420
Maybe they don't
understand the question.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.410
Keep quiet.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.750
Your intuition would be
to explain the question.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.470
Don't do that.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.589
Just wait a few seconds
and see what happens.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.220
People will fill in the gap.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.020
And finally, don't
ask for feedback.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.630
This is another
very popular thing

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.750
product developers
do during interviews.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.830
They describe the product
or show off the product

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.310
and then ask for feedback.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.230
If you have the product,
ask people to use it.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.980
Even if you have a mock of
it, ask people to use it.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.900
Use a pencil and use it.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.570
To sum it up, here
is a little exercise

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.637
about leading questions.

00:04:48.637 --> 00:04:50.220
I'm going to show
you a few questions,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.130
and let's talk about whether
they're leading or not.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.560
First one.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.750
"Would you rather use
the current version

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.150
or this new, improved one?"

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.800
The word "improved"
is a way for you

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.980
to insert your opinion and
biasing people into the answer

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.030
that you're looking for.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.700
"How does this compare to
the way Netflix works now?"

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.720
Now you're biasing people with
their opinions about Netflix.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.110
Good, bad-- you're biasing
them into an answer

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.540
that is not neutral.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.950
Try and ask about the
thing without comparing it

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.380
to anything else.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.160
"What did you think about that?"

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.180
When you ask that,
you are forcing people

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.840
to think about
something they might not

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.900
have thought about
if you didn't ask.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.580
Don't do that.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.690
"Would you click
here to log in?"

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.850
It's exactly as saying,
click here to login.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.000
This is an extremely
biased question.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.100
"What's wrong with this?"

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.660
Again, inserting your
thought that this is wrong,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.880
and then expecting people
to cooperate and say

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.630
that it's wrong.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.830
Here are three
resources I recommend

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.480
for learning more about
how to ask questions--

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.120
a book, an article, and a video.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.900
The book is called "Interviewing
Users," by Steve Portigal.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.430
The article is "16
Interviewing Tips,"

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.290
by Michael Margolis
from Google Ventures.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.110
And the video is "What
people Are Really

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.880
Doing," by IIT's
Institute of Design.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.770
Here's a quick recap.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.900
Look for the story.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.820
Ask about behavior.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.090
Better yet, ask to
observe behavior.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.550
Ask follow-up questions,
extremely important.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.960
Don't ask about the future.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.750
Don't lead the witness.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.360
And don't ask for feedback.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.890
But do ask great questions.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.670
Thank you.
