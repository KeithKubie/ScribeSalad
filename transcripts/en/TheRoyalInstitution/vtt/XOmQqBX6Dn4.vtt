00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.799
so thank you [very] much for this introduction and especially for

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.820
Presenting the book not as a book of futurology

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.949
Because um for me something very important to make everybody

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.430
Understand if they're going to go and read this book

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.509
But it's definitely not a book of prophecies about the future. It's rather tries to map

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:41.128
Different possibilities that might or might not be realized. We still have some agency regarding that

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:49.079
Writing a book of prophecies. I think is an is a sterile exercise if it becomes through or doesn't doesn't matter

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.378
[I] mean, you can't do anything about it. It's much more interesting

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.210
It's much more vital to write about different possibilities

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.620
And if you don't like some of these possibilities, then do something about it

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.319
- try to prevent the worst possibilities from being realised and

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.569
What I want to discuss [today] is one particularly important

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.700
possibilities the possibility that we are now facing which is the rise of

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.340
artificial intelligence and [the]

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.710
potential that artificial intelligence will become the dominant life-form on Earth and

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.508
even Beyond the Earth and what would that mean for Homo Sapiens and

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.049
In order to understand this we need

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:40.649
To maybe go a step backward and take the really long view not just of history

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.369
But actually of biology not just of the history of man

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.819
But really of the history of life because what's happening?

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.619
Now is maybe not just the most important revolution in Human history, but the most important revolution in biology

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.009
since the beginning of life at least on Earth

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.439
For the last [four] billion years of Earth, - sorry of life

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:13.170
Nothing much changed about the fundamental laws of life all life forms for four billion years evolved by natural

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.930
selection and all life-forms

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.119
Were restricted to the organic realm

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.390
It doesn't matter if you're an amoeba or a giraffe or a tomato or a homo sapiens

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.729
You're made of organic compounds [and] your subjects -you're subject to

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.230
organic biochemistry

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.399
This is now changing we are on the verge

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.019
not only of replacing natural selection with intelligent design

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.250
not the intelligent design of some God our intelligent design [as] the

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.408
[principle] motor of the evolution of life we are also on the verge of

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.249
Allowing life [to] break out for the first time from the organic realm into the Inorganic and

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.200
creating the first inorganic life forms after [four] billion years of evolution which also implies

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:12.369
that life will for the first time have a serious chance of breaking out of [Planet] Earth and

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.959
beginning to spread in the rest of the Galaxy in the rest of the universe

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.878
Organic Life Have been adapted to the very unique conditions of this planet for [four] billion years

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.519
So despite what you see on star [Trek]. Which is just now celebrating 50 years

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:38.049
It's extremely difficult to sustain organic life in outer space on other planets

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.709
Which is why it's very unlikely that organic life will be able to spread and to flourish

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:51.549
Outside Earth, but once you switch from organic to Inorganic it becomes much easier

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.989
So we are really on the verge of these two intertwined

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.849
revolution moving from the organic to the Inorganic and moving from Planet Earth

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.789
Actually to the rest of the universe to the rest of the Galaxy

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.259
but

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:14.019
Coming back from the level of the Galaxy to the level of Day-To-day politics. What is- what will this [mean] for

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.108
Ordinary human beings, for society, for the job market, [for] the political system

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.589
I don't have time to cover all the different scenarios and possibilities. I want to focus on one

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.690
important issue, which is what it will do to the job market and what it will do to the economic [ah]

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:43.630
importance and power of Ordinary Humans in the next few decades because this is a very practical question [ah]

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.199
kids in the uk have just started the school the school year this week and

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:56.079
The question is what do they need to [learn] so that they will still be relevant?

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:03.309
They will still have a job when they are thirty or forty this is it's this kind of question which I think

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.029
Brings down the idea of Artificial intelligence

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:13.478
From the cloud and the Galaxy to the level of Society and economics and politics

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:22.570
[and] one of the big dangers which more and more experts are talking about is that in the next few decades

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.879
[not] in thousands of years, but within the lifetime of many of the people here in the room

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.780
Artificial [intelligence] will push humans out of [the] job market and in the same way

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.389
that the industrial revolution of the 19th century

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.149
Created [a] new massive class the Urban working class the proletariat

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.199
So in the 21st century a new industrial revolution

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.160
Will create a new massive class the useless class

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.949
People who have no economic usefulness because Ai artificial intelligence

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.369
Outperforms them in almost all tasks and old jobs people who are not just unemployed

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.219
They are unemployable there is no other with no jobs. No jobs to give these people

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.190
so to start with a simple example

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.709
[Ten] years ago. It was relatively accepted wisdom that our

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.250
Computers and artificial intelligence will never be able to drive cars and vehicles

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:32.139
Better than humans maybe in a laboratory under sterile conditions a computer could drive a car

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.579
But not in real-life situations [in] a real city like London

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.750
Today more and more experts are coming to the opposite

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:46.718
Conclusion to the opposite view but it's only a question of time and not a very long time

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.629
maybe in 10 20 30 years

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.719
humans will not drive vehicles at all because Ai will be so much better at

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.819
Driving taxis and buses and trucks and so Forth than human beings

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.609
They will not only drive it more efficiently and more [cheaply] with less pollution

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:13.539
But most importantly a I will drive far more safely than homo Sapiens the Newman drivers

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.300
today in the World every Year

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:21.399
1.3 million people die each year from car accidents

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:29.438
Around the world this is about twice as many death as the death caused by war

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:34.209
Crime and Terrorism put together and most of these

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:43.089
1.3 million people are killed as a result of human mistakes of human errors or negligence. It's cases like

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.879
people falling asleep while driving

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.519
Cases like people drinking alcohol

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:55.629
And then driving people ignoring traffic lights people ignoring the stop sign people driving too fast

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.719
Inside [a] city things like that

00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:05.348
This is the major reason for these more than 1 million deaths every year if you replace

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:08.169
Humans by Ai

00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:12.609
most of these errors will disappear will be prevented and

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.889
self-driving car a computer will never drink alcohol and then drive a

00:08:19.009 --> 00:08:24.068
Self-driving car will never fall asleep while driving if you program it

00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:29.919
Correctly or or if this is how you program it. It will never Disobey the traffic laws

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.199
It will always stop at a stop sign

00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:38.499
it will always stop at a red sign even more importantly from the Viewpoint of

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.500
safety um

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:47.919
Today each car is an individual unit when two cars are approaching an intersection

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:55.659
Each car sometimes tries to signal its intention the driver is trying to signal his or her

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:02.079
Intentions, but the two cars are really independent entities. Which is why sometimes they collide?

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.160
however if

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.510
you uhh

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.729
prevent humans from driving and all the vehicles on the Road I'll

00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:13.599
sell our autonomous and they are driven by computers by Ai

00:09:14.209 --> 00:09:21.039
Then the logical and possible thing to do is to connect all of them one to the others, so there are no longer

00:09:21.649 --> 00:09:22.699
independent

00:09:22.699 --> 00:09:24.139
vehicles on the Road

00:09:24.139 --> 00:09:30.729
But all vehicles are connected to a single network to a single Master algorithm

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:35.948
Which is far less likely to allow two of its puppets to collide

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:42.670
[so] from this perspective, it's quite likely. It's not, it's not a profit

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.250
It's not certain all kinds of things may prevent it from happening

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.810
But there is a good chance that in say 10 20 30 years

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:55.599
Humans all Human drivers, or most human drivers will be replaced by AI and

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:03.849
Which we shall have enormous good consequences, but which also means that millions of jobs will disappear

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:12.760
[the] same thing may happen with many many other professions. I'll just I don't have a lot of time, so I'll give [just] one example

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.550
What might happen to doctors?

00:10:20.569 --> 00:10:22.490
most doctors

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.539
what they do most of the time is to try to

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.760
diagnose a my disease and then offer the best treatment possible

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:35.589
Which is something I'm very aware of right now because I'm a bit under the weather

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.949
I drove to Manchester yesterday and got a cold on the way

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:44.769
I think it's a cold. I'm not sure I feel a bit dizzy. I feel a bit something in the throat

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:50.439
[I] think [it's] a cold. [I] can't go and ask my doctor because my doctor is back in Israel

00:10:51.589 --> 00:10:55.029
And even if I could even even if I was right now in Israel

00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:59.648
It's not so simple to go to the doctor. It takes time. I need to make an appointment

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.969
She's not always available and even if I make an [appointment] for tomorrow morning

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.180
So I have to leave my work and drive to the clinic

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.669
I then wait [in] the reception room for 10 minutes or 20 minutes or 30 [minutes]

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:17.039
And then finally I get [to] see the doctor, and I don't know how it is with the NHS in the uk

00:11:17.319 --> 00:11:22.889
But in israel my insurance pays for very short visits. Maybe five or [ten] minutes

00:11:22.889 --> 00:11:25.798
That's all that my doctor usually has for me

00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:29.369
during these five or ten minutes when she tries to

00:11:29.799 --> 00:11:36.989
Diagnose my disease so she would ask me three four questions about how I'm feeling. [do] you have [a] headache?

00:11:37.089 --> 00:11:39.089
Do you feel dizzy something like that?

00:11:39.249 --> 00:11:46.499
She may do one or two simple physical tests. She may ask me to say ahh and look  into my throat

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:53.879
She may take out a stethoscope and listen to my lungs or my heart. She may measure my heartbeat or my blood pressure

00:11:54.579 --> 00:12:01.498
She also knows something about my medical history because she's my personal physician, but obviously she can't remember

00:12:02.049 --> 00:12:08.939
Every illness I ever had and every blood test and DNA scan I are ever made she may look it up on the computer

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.429
[but] again, she doesn't have much time so

00:12:11.949 --> 00:12:14.789
She takes these few bits of Data

00:12:15.339 --> 00:12:21.928
About my present and past medical condition and now in order to diagnose my disease

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:29.159
She needs to compare that with all the different diseases in the world could be cold could be

00:12:29.619 --> 00:12:33.569
Influenza could be uhh breast cancer all kinds of things that

00:12:34.239 --> 00:12:36.239
might have these symptoms and

00:12:36.699 --> 00:12:38.909
obviously even the best doctor in the world

00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:45.808
she can't really be familiar with all the different medical conditions and all the different diseases in the world and

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:47.860
even if

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:54.719
And she obviously also she can't be updated every day about all the latest medical

00:12:55.629 --> 00:13:01.168
Researchers and articles and tests and drugs and so forth [so] both types of data

00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:03.269
What she knows about me?

00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:11.099
And what she knows about all the diseases and medical conditions in the world both are very limited in addition

00:13:11.649 --> 00:13:13.649
My doctor is sometimes

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.809
Sick herself, she is sometimes irritated, she is sometimes hungry

00:13:18.809 --> 00:13:26.019
She is sometimes tired so she isn't always at her peak of her performance when she comes to diagnose my disease

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.750
now compare that to

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:36.309
AI doctors artificial intelligence doctors that are already being developed as we speak the most famous

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.850
Example, but not the only example is IBM's Watson

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.810
Watson has immense advantages

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.040
compared to my

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:52.149
Flesh-And-blood physician first of all Watson] can be everywhere all [the] [time] on my smartphone?

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:58.720
Even if I go to give the talk here in London, [I] can take my personal physician with me on the smartphone

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:04.239
It accompanies me 24 hours a day, 365 days a year

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.869
It has all the time in the world for me

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.480
If I want I can sit [on] my living room

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:18.099
sofa and [just] answer questions about my health for hours and hours on end and do all kinds of tests

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:23.020
in fact Watson doesn't need to wait until

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:27.369
I ask until I come towards and I say hey something is wrong

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:33.700
What's wrong with me? Watson will be able to monitor my medical condition [all] the [time] using

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.090
biometric sensors on my body and inside my body

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:42.249
So when something just starts it will know about it much month before

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:49.420
I know that something is wrong, and it can try to do something about it to start a treatment even without my [mind] knowing it

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.519
In addition Watson has no limit at all or almost no

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:59.020
Limitations on the amount of Data it can access and process

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.910
Watson will be able instantly to know my entire medical history

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:09.519
Every illness I ever had every blood test or every DNA test

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.569
I ever did in addition, Watson will be able to [access]

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:19.959
Such data about my parents and siblings and neighbors and friends and then strangers

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.940
the other side of the equation

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:30.550
What about all the diseases in the world here [too] Watson has immense advantages [over] a flesh-and-blood doctors

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.110
Watson will be able to a large extent to be familiar with

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:39.670
All the different diseases in the world and with all the newest, latest

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:45.459
medical research about disease, about drugs, about these treatments, that treatment

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.340
so from this perspective

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:54.999
It's very likely that Watson will be able to diagnose disease and to offer treatment

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.900
Far far better than any human [doctor]

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:04.299
Now when people hear this they very often say okay?

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:11.349
Maybe Watson will be better in diagnosing disease. But there is one thing one other thing that we usually

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:17.860
Hope human doctors will do and that Watson will not be able to do and this is offer

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.600
emotional support. A

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.529
human [doctor] is not some machine some cold [machine]

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:31.389
that just diagnoses this disease and says take this pill, a good doctor is also very attentive to my emotional condition and

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.759
it not just treats my

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:41.260
physical difficulties it also gives me the proper emotional support that in many cases is a vital part of

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.670
of

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.599
confronting any kind of disease or medical condition

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.920
however

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:56.079
This criticism fails to [to] know to notice that emotions at least according to Modern science,

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.630
Emotions are not some

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.220
spiritual thing that God gave humans in order to appreciate poetry

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.110
emotions are a

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:07.250
biochemical

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:13.150
Phenomenon that not only homo Sapiens serve all mammals all birds and many many other animals have emotions

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:19.479
[they're] a biochemical phenomena in this sense emotions are like disease. [they] are both

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.040
biochemical phenomena

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:28.719
And therefore it is extremely [likely] that Watson will be able to diagnose my emotional condition

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:34.210
Just as it diagnoses my illnesses and my medical problems

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:37.509
if I go to my become a human doctor

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:45.279
How does my human doctor know my emotional condition she relies on two kinds of signals?

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.300
External signals that I'm giving she relies basic

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:57.589
On visual sing signals like my facial expression or my body movement my body language and she relies on audio our

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.010
signals audio cues she listens to what I say

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:05.898
Not just the contents, but even more importantly the tone [of] voice

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.089
[so] [if] I sit in her office, she looks at my [face] she listens to my [words]

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.990
And this is how she knows if I'm angry if I'm fearful or whatever

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.049
What [son] will be able to do all that?

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.750
Computers are already

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.149
outperforming humans in A

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.059
Diagnosing correctly analyzing correctly facial expressions and tone of voice

00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:31.759
in order to recognize emotions

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:37.099
But much more importantly an AI like Watson will have access

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:44.960
To another and even better source of data about my emotions data coming from within my body

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.209
When my [doctor] looked at a man I sit in her office, and she looks at me

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:56.779
She sees my face, but she can't see my brain and she can't see my heart and she can't see what's happening inside me

00:18:57.179 --> 00:18:59.179
Watson will be able to access

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:07.640
biometric Data coming from the brain coming from the heart coming from the bloodstream and therefore is likely to be able to

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:13.219
diagnose my emotional condition far far better than any human [doctor]

00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:23.029
Now ah there are still problems some technical problems and also legal problems that prevent Watson and things like Watson

00:19:23.309 --> 00:19:29.928
from replacing most doctors tomorrow morning - May take five years Ten Years [twenty] [years]

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.359
But what we need to realize that?

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.649
We need to solve these technical problems

00:19:36.929 --> 00:19:39.048
Just once just once [in]

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.390
the case of Human doctors

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:42.870
or Flesh-And-blood doctors

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.559
In order to get to get a doctor

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:49.129
You need to take a person and then you need ten years at least ten years

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:54.350
of going to medical school and doing all kinds of studying and

00:19:54.779 --> 00:20:02.148
Experimenting and experiencing in order after ten years and a huge investment in time and money and energy

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:10.469
At the end of this process you get one doctor if you want another doctor you have to start all over again

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:16.949
[and] invest all this time all this energy all this money again. Which is why in many?

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:21.449
Countries around the world there is an acute shortage of doctors

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.349
With Watson with an AI doctor you just have to do it once

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:33.329
Even [if] it costs a hundred billion dollars to solve the technical

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:39.360
Problems that still prevent Watson from replacing my human doctor if you invest

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:45.000
These hundred billion dollars and solve the problems what you get is not one doctor

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.390
You get an infinite number of doctors?

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:56.519
Available everywhere all the time for everybody even somebody in the middle of the jungle can have a personal physician

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:01.320
Only Smartphone or her smartphone which provides far better?

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.730
medical care than almost any doctor alive today

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.749
So the Potential is really is really immense

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:16.409
Which is why again more and more experts believe that not all doctors?

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:23.729
But many doctors maybe 50 60 80 [%] of doctors will be replaced by AI are

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:26.519
within 10 20 30 years and

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:32.339
The same thing may happen to many other professions lawyers, teachers

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.470
Insurance agents and so forth um

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:44.970
When people hear about this possibility again one of the most common objections is to say we've heard it before

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:50.880
We've heard it before this fear of machines replacing humans

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.880
it's not, it's not new [A]

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:59.669
Lot of people in the 19th and 20th century were afraid that as machines replace humans in

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.540
agriculture

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:07.230
and then in industry you'll have this massive unemployment and massive crisis with all the useless people and

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:11.579
It didn't happen because as new jobs disappeared,

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.740
Sorry as old jobs disappeared new jobs appeared to replace them

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.370
So we don't have a crisis today of mass unemployment

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:25.740
What happened? Is that most people [in] advanced societies stopped working in

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.600
agricultural industry today in a country like the uk or the USA about

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.439
[2%] of the Workforce are employed in agriculture

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.160
Compared to more than 90 percent before the industrial revolution

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:47.069
[maybe] 15 percent 20 percent still work in industry physical jobs, the vast majority are working in

00:22:47.679 --> 00:22:49.030
services

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:55.769
But the problem is we cannot be sure that the same thing will happen again with this new revolution

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:00.689
Because humans have basically two kinds of abilities

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.280
They have physical abilities and they have mental and cognitive abilities

00:23:05.559 --> 00:23:09.089
What happened in the 90s and 20th century is [that] machines?

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.140
competed and

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:19.049
Outperformed humans in Physical abilities so humans mostly moved to working in jobs that require

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.499
mental and cognitive abilities like the services sector

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:26.579
now machines are starting to compete with us and

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.390
outperform us also in mental and cognitive abilities

00:23:30.429 --> 00:23:32.380
And we just don't know

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.280
about any third kind of ability

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:41.639
[that] humans may have and that everybody could move to work in that [field] we just not know about it

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:47.040
Another problem is that even if new jobs appear

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:50.699
The pace of change is so quick that

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:59.189
Humans will have to reinvent themselves again and again during their lifetime which is something [that] is very very difficult

00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:01.679
Beyond a certain age

00:24:01.809 --> 00:24:06.779
when you are 15 of your 20 the main thing you do in life is basically to

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.379
Invent yourself or to reinvent yourself and even then

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.439
It's not very easy, but when you're 40 or 50

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.400
It's much much more difficult and let's say that in 20 years

00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:24.239
There are no jobs for taxi drivers and doctors and insurance agents, and they have to reinvent themselves

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:28.110
as let's say designers of virtual worlds

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:35.859
Now this is something very difficult for [a] 50 year old taxi driver or a 50 year old insurance agent to

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.169
Invent himself or herself again as a completely new [kind] of person now

00:24:41.169 --> 00:24:46.179
I am the creator of virtual worlds. How does a virtual world

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.499
created by a 50 year old insurance agent look like um

00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:54.908
it's it's a very difficult question and

00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.189
It goes back to what I started with which is what to teach children

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.199
Today at school and the answer is that nobody has a clue

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:10.869
[I] mean children who today start the first with this first week of school first grade

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:17.830
Nobody knows what the job [market] would be like when these kids are 30 or 40

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:22.959
It's very likely that almost everything they learn at school will be completely irrelevant

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:29.679
But what to teach them instead nobody knows because we just don't know what kind of job market

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:36.339
we'll have in 2050 and what kind of skills uhh people will need in these kinds of

00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:39.369
so Far unknown jobs

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:43.580
so um

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:47.439
As I said just as the 19th century created

00:25:47.659 --> 00:25:51.758
this new massive class the Urban working class and

00:25:52.129 --> 00:25:56.679
much of the political and social history of the 90s and 20th century

00:25:57.289 --> 00:26:00.069
Revolved around this new class the working class

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:08.739
similarly in the 21st century we may see the creation the rise of a [new] massive class the useless class and

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:16.779
much [of] the social and political and economic history of the 21st century will revolve around that class and

00:26:17.059 --> 00:26:21.849
around the question what to do with billions and billions of

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.519
economically useless people and

00:26:24.919 --> 00:26:32.648
Because they are economically useless the danger is also that they will be politically powerless because usually

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:40.210
Economic usefulness goes hand in [hand] with political with political power and as humans lose

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:46.900
Their economic usefulness they may also lose their political power [and] to give just one simple example

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:56.410
when you have all these millions of taxi drivers and truck drivers and bus drivers each of them commands a small share [of] the

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:01.540
Transportation market and this gives them not only a certain amount of

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:09.280
Economic wealth it goes who gives them a certain amount [of] political power they can unionise and if the government

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:15.429
Pursues a policy which all these taxi drivers or truck drivers don't like they can go and strike

00:27:15.559 --> 00:27:19.449
So they have also some political power now if you replace all

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:25.120
these drivers with driverless cars, which are basically

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:33.640
managed by a single algorithm, which is owned by a single corporation which is owned by a handful of billionaires

00:27:34.309 --> 00:27:39.489
So all the economic and [political] power that was previously shared

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:45.489
between millions of drivers is now being monopolised by maybe five or ten

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.100
individuals

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.510
As I said in the beginning, this is not a prophecy

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:59.739
Nobody really knows how the job market, how the economy, how the political system would look like in

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:07.090
2050 if you don't like this particular possibility you can still do something about it. Thank you
