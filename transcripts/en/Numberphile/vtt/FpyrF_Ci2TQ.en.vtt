00:00:00.295 --> 00:00:01.720
JAMES GRIME: We love
pi, of course.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.790
Everyone loves pi.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.480
But one of my favorite
pi facts is--

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.930
and I think it's fun.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.870
You only need 39 digits of pi
to be able to measure the

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.750
circumference of the observable
universe within the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.170
width of one hydrogen atom.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.760
And that's all you need.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.600
Shall we write out
the 39 digits?

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.850
So the 39 digits of pi.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.690
It's 3 point--

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.670
now, 3 counts as one
of the digits.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.720
So it's now 38 decimal places.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.510
Let's do the 38 decimal
places--

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:48.060
1 4 1 6 5 9 7 9 3 2 7 4 2 0.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.400
-He didn't memorize
that, everyone.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.260
There you go.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.570
Show them what you did,
just in case.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.780
JAMES GRIME: Wolfram Alpha
app, never leave

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.623
home without it.

00:00:57.623 --> 00:00:59.740
-You're not a pi memorizer,
James.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.020
JAMES GRIME: No, I'm not.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.140
And that's another thing
altogether, people that

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.140
memorize this pi figure to a
massive amount of digits.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.710
But people who calculate it
using computers, have

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.430
calculated it to, currently,
10 trillion digits of pi.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.070
-Go on then.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.650
Let's do it.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.510
JAMES GRIME: OK.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.090
So that would be all you need.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.470
And that's overkill as it is.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.260
Because that's all you need to
measure the circumference of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.155
the observable universe.

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:32.530
So the observable universe is
the distance that light has

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.150
traveled since the big bang.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.270
And if you say travelled in a
big sphere, in a big bubble,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.510
then if you measured the
distance around it, we'd have

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.330
the circumference
of the universe.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.480
And we would need pi to work
out that circumference.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.110
And we could be as accurate as
a hydrogen atom, if we used

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.350
just 39 digits of pi.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.810
We don't need to use the whole
thing, of course, which goes

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.370
on forever.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.950
So in fact, and in practical
day-to-day use in engineering

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.300
and real life, you would only
need a handful of digits of pi

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.270
to have an accuracy that would
be suitable for anything that

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.520
you need to do.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.290
So Wolfram Alpha told me that
the diameter of the universe

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.740
was 8.8 times 10 to
the 26 meters.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.280
So that's the diameter of
the observable universe.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.240
If you want to work out the
circumference, then

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.820
we times it by pi.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.550
So the circumference would
be pi times the diameter.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.860
What's the difference when I
take away my truncated pi?

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.640
What I mean is, what if I took
away my pi with 39 digits--

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.830
I've called it pi 39--

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.050
and did the same thing
times my d?

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.590
So that's the real circumference
of the universe,

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.670
take away my approximation.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.855
What's the difference?

00:02:52.855 --> 00:02:59.600
If I do that, what I got was
actually around about 2.5

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.460
times 10 to the minus
12 meters.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.710
So that's how accurate.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.370
That's the difference between
my approximation

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.780
and the real value.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.550
That's how accurate it is.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.980
And a hydrogen atom that Wolfram
Alpha told me had a

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.710
diameter of about 2.5 times
10 to minus 11 meters.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.950
So in fact, this is
more accurate.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.020
This is more accurate than
a hydrogen atom.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.670
So why do we calculate pi
to 10 trillion digits?

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.570
These days, it's a way to
test our computers, our

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.160
supercomputers and
our algorithms.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.110
It's a way to test them to
see how good they are.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.380
That's why computer scientists
are interested in

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.210
this sort of thing.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.100
Mathematicians have tried to do
this for thousands of years

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.170
out of curiosity.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.560
So it started with Archimedes.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.080
He tried to get an accurate
idea of pi about 250 BC.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.530
He didn't have decimals
in those days.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.390
He had to use fractions.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.060
But he tried to work it out.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.730
Then in the 17th century,
there was a Dutch

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.910
mathematician called-- now I'll
probably Anglicize his

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.580
Dutch name.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.790
And I apologize.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.870
He was called Ludolph
van Ceulen.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.490
And his life's work was working
out the digits of pi.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.240
And by the end of his life,
he had worked out

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.480
35 digits of pi.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.850
And they're on his tombstone,
which is kind of cool.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.560
It's kind of neat.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.160
We skip on to the
19th century.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.640
There was a guy who had about
707 digits of pi.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.700
This was the authoritative
example of pi for over 100

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.960
years, until 1945.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.716
And they found a mistake.

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:45.800
I know, shock.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.450
They found a mistake.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.540
And the last 180 digits
were wrong.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.160
Because somewhere along in his
calculations, somewhere around

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.120
the 500th decimal point,
he had made a mistake.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.390
And from that point on,
everything else was wrong.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.880
What a disaster.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.010
Fortunately, we were able to use
computers by this point.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.700
So in 1949, ENIAC, the American
computer, was able to

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.530
calculate pi to 2000 digits.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.880
So suddenly, it just exploded
after that.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.210
Once we've got computers,
it just exploded.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.720
We had more and more
digits of pi.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.110
And now, we've got 10 trillion
digits of pi.
