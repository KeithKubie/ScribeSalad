00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.470
- [Instructor] Hey, this
is Kim from Khan Academy

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.620
and today I'm learning about Article five

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.130
of the U.S. Constitution,

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.700
which describes The
Constitution's amendment process.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.880
To learn more about Article
five, I talked to two experts,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.150
professor Michael Rappaport,
who is the Darling Foundation

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.340
professor at the University
of San Diego School of Law,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.420
where he also serves as the director

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.930
of The Center for the Study
of Constitutional Originalism

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.570
and David Strauss, who's the Gerald Ratner

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.670
distinguished service professor of law

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.730
at the University of Chicago Law School

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.010
and author of The Living Constitution.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.940
Professor Strauss, Article
five provides this process

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.660
for amending The Constitution,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.950
can you take us through
that process a little bit?

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.040
How does it work?

00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:48.070
- [Professor Strauss]
Well the quick description

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.680
of the process is it's really hard,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.370
it's really hard to
amend The Constitution.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.220
There are actually a couple
of different processes

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.130
that are laid out in Article five

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.510
but only one has ever been used.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.508
An amendment starts in Congress

00:01:03.508 --> 00:01:06.210
and two thirds of each house of Congress,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.420
two thirds in House of Representatives

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.900
and two thirds of the Senate
has to approved the amendment

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.090
and then it goes to the states

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.905
and three quarters of the states

00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:18.980
have to approve the
amendment, so you have to have

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.720
a really strong consensus in order

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.180
to get The Constitution changed that way.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.719
- [Kim] So, Professor Rappaport,

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.100
take us through this process
of amending The Constitution.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.100
Why did the framers set it up this way?

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.102
- [Professor Rappaport] The framers gave

00:01:34.102 --> 00:01:36.680
a good bit of thought to coming up

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.630
with an amendment process
because they recognized

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.310
that The Constitution might
need to be changed over time

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.900
either 'cause there were problems with it

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.470
that weren't anticipated
or because circumstances

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.380
or values changed, so, there are two steps

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.550
to the amendment process, for an amendment

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.030
to go into The Constitution to become part

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.560
of The Constitution it has to
be both proposed and ratified.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.560
On the proposal side,
the Congress can propose,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.860
alternatively, a proposal can come from

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.470
the action of the state legislatures,

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.770
so, two thirds of the
state legislatures say

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.446
we'd like to have a
Constitutional Convention

00:02:17.446 --> 00:02:21.450
propose an amendment, so,
there's two parts to that,

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.510
obviously, the the state legislatures

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.370
have got to want it and
then you get the calling

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.850
of a Constitutional Convention.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.010
Okay, that's the proposal side,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.700
there's also the ratification side,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.181
which is a little bit simpler.

00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:36.147
You need three quarters of the states

00:02:36.147 --> 00:02:39.600
to ratify a Constitutional amendment

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.740
and they can ratify it either

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.280
through the actions of
the state legislatures

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.820
or the actions of state conventions,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.000
which are special bodies
which would be elected

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.210
in order to decide one
question, whether or not

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.030
to ratify that proposed
Constitutional amendment.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.300
- [Kim] This is fascinating, so,

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.750
I actually had no idea
about the two thirds

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.440
of the state legislatures being able

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.580
to propose a Constitutional amendment.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.520
How often does that happen?

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.160
- [Professor Rappaport]
It has never occurred

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.532
throughout our history,
although, a couple of times

00:03:15.532 --> 00:03:19.130
there were actions taken to
sort of move in that direction

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.240
but we've never actually had
a Constitutional Convention

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.630
that has proposed any amendments.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.230
It's important to go into why the framers

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.400
would have set up the
system the way they did.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.740
The most usual situation
is for the Congress

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.530
to propose the amendments
and that's happened

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.075
in all of the 27 amendments
which have been ratified

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:43.040
to become part of our Constitution

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.900
but what happens if the
Congress is the problem?

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.280
What happens if the
Congress is usurping power

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.140
or they're standing in the way of changes

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.410
that are important or
they need to be reformed?

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.460
You can't count on the
Congress to wanna reform itself

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.780
so what they did was to have
this alternative mechanism

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.019
which would bypass the Congress

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.810
and that alternative mechanism

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.120
was the Constitutional Convention,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.315
so the state legislatures
proposed, applied for,

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:15.570
and the separate entity, the
Constitutional Convention,

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.160
makes a proposal, so
they were quite explicit

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.630
in discussing this, that they wanted this

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.730
as an alternative to the Congress.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.563
- [Kim] So was this on purpose

00:04:22.563 --> 00:04:23.970
that they made it very difficult

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.922
to amend The Constitution?

00:04:25.922 --> 00:04:27.410
- [Professor Strauss] Well
it sure seems like it.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.500
Now, of course, we don't know back then

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.190
what they had in mind,
whether they thought,

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.030
"Well, the House, the Senate, the states,

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.030
"they'll sort of be all run
by the same kind of people

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.080
"and they'll kind of agree on things."

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.440
Maybe they thought
that, we just don't know

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.590
but whatever they were
thinking, what they gave us

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.930
was a very difficult
process to get through.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.995
- [Kim] So, how long
was it from the period

00:04:50.995 --> 00:04:55.160
when The Constitution was first ratified

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.464
to the first amendment to The Constitution

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:01.167
beyond the Bill of Rights?

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:02.133
- [Professor Rappaport] Okay, so,

00:05:02.133 --> 00:05:07.133
the first 10 amendments
were ratified in 1791

00:05:07.556 --> 00:05:12.556
and then, just a mere three years later,

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.370
we had the 11th amendment.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.630
- [Professor Strauss] There
was an 11th amendment in 1798

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.760
to correct really kind
of a technical problem

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.870
that the Supreme Court did something

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.270
that the framers really
didn't anticipate it would do,

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.960
didn't want it to do,
and the 11th amendment

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.770
was adopted to correct that.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.590
The 12th amendment was adopted in 1804,

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.940
after the, really, kind of a disaster

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.170
in the election of 1800,
when there was a tie

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.590
in the electoral college,
the framers had not foreseen

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.227
the rise of political parties

00:05:44.227 --> 00:05:46.870
and political parties made the system

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.108
for electing the president
they had given us

00:05:49.108 --> 00:05:52.190
very difficult to work with
but then there was nothing.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.830
That was 1804, then there was nothing

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.359
until after the Civil War
and after the Civil War

00:05:56.359 --> 00:05:59.240
there were three amendments,
then nothing again,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.787
really, until the progressive
era in the early 20th century

00:06:02.787 --> 00:06:05.170
when there were, again,
a bunch of amendments

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.360
and then after then, things
have sort of tailed off.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.620
So, we really see these kind
of waves in our history.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.180
- [Kim] What do you think
brings those waves on?

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.440
Why are there some eras
where there are lots

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.640
of Constitutional amendments
and then other eras

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.690
when there's nothing?

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.393
- [Professor Strauss] Well, Kim,

00:06:21.393 --> 00:06:23.250
here I'm gonna say something
I think some people

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.240
will disagree with but, you
know, but I think it's right

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.890
and that is that I don't think the process

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.110
of amending The
Constitution has really been

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.410
the way we actually change it.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.210
I think what happens is just because

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.620
the amendment process is so difficult,

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.257
we've worked out other
ways of changing things

00:06:41.257 --> 00:06:44.470
and so amendments come along, sometimes,

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.010
because a change has already happened

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.900
and people decide, "Well, let's put it

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.620
"in The Constitution
just so we can kinda have

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.690
"official recognition of it."

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.400
But a lot of time changes happen

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.670
and they are a little
bit too controversial

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.810
to get into The Constitution
but they seem pretty solid

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.327
and pretty secure, so, we just don't,

00:07:02.327 --> 00:07:04.990
I guess it's fair to say,
don't bother to amend

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.760
The Constitution or don't
wanna go through the process

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.920
of amending The Constitution.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.800
- [Professor Rappaport]
Very often peoples' values

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.700
may change or they may differ

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.420
from what's in The Constitution

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.210
and it may take a time or circumstances

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.210
may finally occur that crystallize this

00:07:26.251 --> 00:07:28.940
desire to change The Constitution

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.480
and all of a sudden the
opportunity is there

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.811
and people can suddenly pass
a Constitutional amendment.

00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:39.030
It's only gonna occur
during certain circumstances

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.080
especially when there's
strong support for it.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.910
- [Kim] Very interesting,
yeah, so it's unlikely

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.390
that we're gonna have a
Constitutional amendment

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.500
anytime in the near future.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.650
When was the last
Constitutional amendment?

00:07:51.545 --> 00:07:53.190
- [Professor Rappaport] So,
the simple answer to that

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.770
was in 1971 we got the 26th amendment

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.811
that was both proposed
and then, remarkably,

00:08:00.811 --> 00:08:03.056
it's an all time record,

00:08:03.056 --> 00:08:07.720
proposed and ratified in
three months and eight days

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.410
and that was the amendment
that guaranteed the right

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.330
to vote of 18 year olds.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.787
- [Kim] Ah, right, so
sort of as a response

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:17.630
to the Vietnam War?

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.040
- [Professor Rappaport] Yes, yes

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.110
but there actually has been
one additional amendment,

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.790
the 27th amendment, right,

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.140
so why isn't that the most recent one?

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.460
Well, here's the funny thing about it,

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.660
the 27th amendment was proposed as part

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.620
of the original Bill of Rights in 1789,

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.940
so this amendment was proposed in 1789,

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.850
ratified in 1992, so it took 202 years.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.850
- [Kim] What you're saying,
what's the 27th amendment about?

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.830
- [Professor Rappaport]
That has to do with

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.390
congressional salary increases.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:55.250
It basically says if Congress
wants to raise its own salary,

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:59.120
the increase can't take effect
until the next election,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.340
so it basically give the
voters a chance to say,

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.960
"Hey, we don't like what you did,

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.581
"we're gonna vote you out of office

00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:08.600
"for increasing your salary."

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.634
- [Kim] So, one thing
that strikes me about

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:15.150
Article five or just the
fact that the founders

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.200
included an amendment process altogether,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.660
it seems very humble and farsighted

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.235
to include a way for the document itself

00:09:25.235 --> 00:09:28.720
to evolve in a way, do you think

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.100
that the framers
approached The Constitution

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.470
with the idea that there
were things in the future

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.810
that they just wouldn't
be able to anticipate?

00:09:37.716 --> 00:09:39.330
- [Professor Strauss] They had before them

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.960
and were acutely aware of a history

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.920
in which efforts to establish
governments had failed

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.860
and they were really
trying to work with that

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.650
and make sure they
didn't do the same thing

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.987
so they knew what a hard
job they were embarking on

00:09:55.987 --> 00:09:58.660
and they made it clear, I mean,

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.410
there's a famous passage in
which James Madison said,

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.124
"Look, we know a lot of these provisions

00:10:03.124 --> 00:10:05.410
"that we're writing in The Constitution

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.720
"their meaning is
unclear and their meaning

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.120
"will have to be history's liquidated."

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.470
Which is to say, people have to figure out

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.410
what this means because we
know what we're giving you

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.240
is unclear in some
ways, so, yes absolutely

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.460
they knew there were things
they could not anticipate.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.000
The framers themselves
weren't in agreement

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
on what freedom of speech means, you know,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.990
some of them enacted and voted for

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.180
and got enacted laws
that restricted speech

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.850
in ways that we would
find intolerable today,

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.633
we'd say they violate the first amendment

00:10:36.633 --> 00:10:38.510
but here you have some of the guys

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.010
who drafted the first amendment
voting for those laws.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.220
- [Kim] So, near the end of Article five,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.290
there's this kind of
long-winded clause that says,

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.039
"No amendment which may
be made prior to the year

00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:53.460
"one thousand eight hundred and eight

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.795
"shall in any manner affect
the first and fourth clauses

00:10:57.795 --> 00:11:00.680
"in the ninth section
of the first article."

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.350
Now, if I'm cross
referencing this correctly,

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.380
what they're really saying here is,

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.620
you can't make amendments about slavery,

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.300
so why is this here and why are they

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.597
talking around it so obliquely?

00:11:13.597 --> 00:11:14.721
- [Professor Rappaport] The
interesting thing about this

00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:16.630
is what do they do, they basically said,

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.340
for 20 years there's not
going to be any amendments

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.240
that are going to speak to the slave trade

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:28.240
and The Constitution is
very, let us say shy,

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:33.640
about using the term slavery
or referring to slavery,

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.170
it actually never refers
to the term slave,

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:41.290
there's a variety of thoughts
about what was going on

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.990
but one very common view about this is

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:49.010
that The Constitution was sort
of a little bit embarrassed,

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.340
that the framers were a
little bit embarrassed,

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.250
or at least some of the framers

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.370
were embarrassed about it
and so they didn't wanna

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.480
make reference to it too explicitly.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.570
- [Professor Strauss] They might've been

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.999
a little bit worried about
what the verdict of history

00:11:59.999 --> 00:12:03.390
would be, so, they knew on some level

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.920
this sort of immorality of slavery

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.660
but there it is, right
there in Article five

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.750
and there are other places
in The Constitution too

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.400
where they don't use the
word but what they're doing

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.830
is protecting slavery.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.224
And they did add these
amendments to The Constitution

00:12:16.224 --> 00:12:18.854
about slavery and about, as you say,

00:12:18.854 --> 00:12:22.470
equal citizenship and
voting but, you know,

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.250
the 14th amendment
providing equal citizenship,

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.680
that was pretty much
nullified in most respects

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.840
for a large part of our history,

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.832
states found a way to get around that.

00:12:32.832 --> 00:12:35.250
The 15th amendment was also something

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.584
that was just not very effective

00:12:36.584 --> 00:12:38.900
in preventing African Americans

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.960
from being denied the vote

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.140
and, yes, there are
provisions in The Constitution

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.290
that are there and you can evoke them

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.880
and you can rely on them
but if you just look at

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.233
the text of The
Constitution, I think you get

00:12:50.233 --> 00:12:53.236
a misleading impression
about how The Constitution

00:12:53.236 --> 00:12:56.500
in our history has actually worked.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.860
- [Kim] This is a very good point

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.450
because I think one of the
hardest things for students

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.950
of U.S history to understand is

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.760
how is it possible that
after the 14th amendment

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.650
was passed, things like Jim Crow happened

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.641
and I guess the answer is The Constitution

00:13:13.641 --> 00:13:18.140
is only in force if it's enforced.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.500
- [Professor Strauss] Yeah,
Kim, that's exactly right.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.120
It's words on a page, you know,

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.916
the text is fine, it can
say all the right things

00:13:24.916 --> 00:13:28.340
but the institutions and the popular will

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.830
have to be in place to make
something of those fine words.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:33.860
- [Kim] Interesting, so how do you think

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.080
our government might be different

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.900
if The Constitution didn't include

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.951
this amendment process?

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:40.190
- [Professor Strauss] I
don't think it would've been

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:44.520
that different just because
Article five gives us

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.440
such a hard process to go through

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.890
just because it's so hard
to amend The Constitution,

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:53.750
we figured out other ways
to change The Constitution

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.350
in practice, even if the
words on the page are the same

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.440
and I think if there were no Article five,

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.160
we would've found a way to get to

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.400
where wanted to get to as a country

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.770
by those needs, by legislation,

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.030
by presidential action,
by Supreme Court decision,

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.240
and just by the people
in their lives saying,

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.810
"You know, we need to
go in this direction,

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:18.520
"we need to go, say, in the
direction of women's equality."

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.250
And, by the way, there's no amendment

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.220
giving women equal rights either

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.790
but that's where we've gotten to

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.690
and I think that would've been the pattern

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.370
if there were no formal amendment process.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.203
- [Professor Rappaport]
There's a second way

00:14:29.203 --> 00:14:30.510
in which you can have
Constitutional change,

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.610
which is you could simply say,

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:36.180
"Alright, this Constitution
was pretty good for awhile,

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.818
"it's now outlived its usefulness,

00:14:37.818 --> 00:14:40.320
"let's have a new Constitution."

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.957
That would seem like a very
radical, big thing to do,

00:14:42.957 --> 00:14:46.440
virtually no on proposes
that at the federal level

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.940
but in the states, lots
of states have changed

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.720
their constitutions, not simply passed

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.930
a Constitutional amendment,
but just gotten rid of

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.210
a whole constitution
and adopted a new one.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.410
That's happened many times and, so,

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.790
if we didn't have a
Constitutional amendment process,

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.590
it's quite possible that that's exactly

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.940
what we would've seen
at the federal level.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.750
- [Kim] Wow, this is really fascinating

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.364
because we really think a lot about

00:15:09.364 --> 00:15:12.010
what the framers intended, you know,

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.360
for certain amendments,
for example, you know,

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.940
freedom of speech, freedom of religion,

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.879
what did they really mean by those things

00:15:18.879 --> 00:15:22.880
but if we had just kind of
every now and again said,

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.347
"Okay, we're done with that,
let's do a new Constitution,"

00:15:25.347 --> 00:15:28.010
we wouldn't necessarily have that debate,

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.540
we'd just say, "Okay, this is
what we meant at the time."

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.600
- [Professor Rappaport]
Famously Thomas Jefferson said,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.340
"Oh, you know, it's
really not right to have

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.023
"a Constitution that's
going to continue over time

00:15:39.023 --> 00:15:43.163
"and bind future generations and, so,

00:15:43.163 --> 00:15:46.930
"we ought to have a new
Constitution every 19 years

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.170
"when there's a new generation."

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.584
And his close friend, James Madison,

00:15:52.584 --> 00:15:55.720
had to disagree with
him and basically said,

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.330
"Look, I understand why you're saying that

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.220
"but you also have to realize
the incredible disruption

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.660
"that would cause every 20 years,

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.250
"people wouldn't be able to
rely on the existing rights

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.520
"that are in The Constitution
'cause they would know

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:15.520
"in a certain period of time
new ones would be enacted."

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.990
We had that debate,
Madison won in the sense

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.340
that the U.S. Constitution
is supposed to last

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:27.340
for a long-term period,
there's no 20 year limit on it,

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.200
and one of the things
that's been beneficial

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.563
for the United States as a result of that

00:16:32.563 --> 00:16:35.270
is that we've inherited
these Constitutional rights

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.320
that people have a lot of reverence for.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.590
- [Kim] So, we've learned
that there are two ways

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.409
to amend The Constitution,
through Congress

00:16:43.409 --> 00:16:46.890
or through a special
Constitutional Convention

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.270
called by the states, either way,

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.000
adding an amendment to The Constitution

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.620
is really difficult to do, so much so,

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.710
that the American people have only

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:59.240
in special circumstances used
a Constitutional amendment

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.010
to affect social or political change.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.513
