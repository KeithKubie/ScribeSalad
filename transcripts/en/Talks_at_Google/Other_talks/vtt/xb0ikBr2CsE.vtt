MALE SPEAKER: Please welcome
Laura along with her guests.

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:03.868
Thank you.

00:00:03.868 --> 00:00:06.198
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.830
DR. LAURA PETICOLAS:
Welcome to our talk today.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.980
Go to the next slide here.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.360
So I first wanted
to thank Making

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.090
Science, the Google
Making Science team,

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.140
for hosting us today.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.850
They have been
very helpful today

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.270
and in a lot of our
conversations too,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.500
so I just wanted
to thank you all.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.610
OK, so I'm going
to show you here,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.620
this is an outline of our talk.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.770
And you can see it will
ignite with some information

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.370
about the initial
collaboration that we've had,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.960
and then talk about
our different missions

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.970
for our different
education efforts.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.330
We'll talk about science,
the science universe, as well

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.570
as the indigenous, or Navajo
universe specifically.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.450
We'll also then talk about some
of our educational programs

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.520
that we do, and some of those
impacts and some visions

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.150
for the future that we have.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.560
This model is based on a Navajo
organizational process model,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.900
and it's all about the
organization of information.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.310
So you'll see this helped
us to organize our thoughts

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.220
for this presentation,
and figure out

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.900
how best to share our
collaboration with you all.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.040
So we'll start here with
this ignition and Multiverse

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.860
mission.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.400
OK, so the igniter.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.720
This work started many years
ago with a collaboration

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.380
between our team at
the Space Sciences Lab

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.380
and the Indigenous
Education Organization

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.140
led by Nancy and David here.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.620
And really, the focus on that
collaboration is relevant

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.280
learning comes from context.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.180
So this idea of context
being very important,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.420
we know here at Google that is
why you all exist as well, how

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.410
Google got to be so big.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.410
So if you're interested
in connecting afterwards,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.730
this is my contact information.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.390
You can follow me on
Twitter for Laura Aurora.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.394
So aurora is my expertise.

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:09.060
That's what I studied
in graduate school

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.331
and at the Space Sciences Lab.

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.580
Also, I'm the director of
our group called Multiverse,

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.380
and you can follow
that through Facebook.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.582
We have a very
active Facebook page.

00:02:18.582 --> 00:02:20.290
We also have a Twitter
feed, but it's not

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.630
quite as active at this point.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.800
I am a senior fellow at
the Space Sciences Lab.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.590
And our mission is
really at this point

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.240
to increase diversity in
earth and space science

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.990
through multicultural education.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.230
So I'll be talking,
we'll be talking

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.050
a lot about that approach
and why do we do that.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.110
So first, I wouldn't
be here today

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.860
if I didn't have the
support of my family.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.410
I have two young children.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.306
And so I just
wanted to shout out.

00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:52.055
Thank you, family.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.720
And I couldn't do this
work without the team

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.490
that I work with.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.714
And many of you are here.

00:02:59.714 --> 00:03:01.130
Can you raise your
hand, if you're

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.000
part of the Multiverse team?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.180
So you'll see we're
sprinkled around.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.140
We really feel at our heart
that diversity matters.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.980
And we have a lot of discussion
about this word diversity

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.840
and what that means,
that it matters.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.210
And hopefully you'll get a
sense of some of our thoughts

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.230
through this talk.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.570
A quick way to say it is we
work with multiple communities

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.376
to acknowledge
their own universe,

00:03:26.376 --> 00:03:30.190
and then to teach about
the universe of science.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.210
So our name, Multiverse,
so multiverse

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.150
is actual physics
cosmology concept

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.370
that people are starting
to explore and understand.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.260
And the idea is that we don't
just exist in this universe.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.010
Well, we do, but there may be
other universities out there

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.130
with different laws of physics
and different things that

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.600
happen in those universes.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.770
And for me, it's a good analogy
for how different communities

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.730
look at the world,
to think about,

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.340
when you step into a cult a
community with a culture very

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.190
different from yours,
what that feels like.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.030
It's like going into
another universe, where

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.680
all the laws of
physics are different.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.830
We have a lot of
undergraduates come to our lab,

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.094
and the lab has a
very specific culture.

00:04:15.094 --> 00:04:16.760
And so we talked to
the undergrads about

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.800
what is that culture,
and what do they expect?

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.260
What should they expect to see
on a daily basis at our lab?

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.893
So that's one reason why
our name is Multiverse.

00:04:26.893 --> 00:04:27.720
All right.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.546
Nancy?

00:04:29.546 --> 00:04:31.420
NANCY MARYBOY: Well,
good morning, everybody.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.480
And I have to say, it's
very exciting for us

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.020
to be here at Google.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.570
And we want to thank
Google for allowing

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.400
us to be part of
this presentation,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.740
and also we so enjoy our work
with the Multiverse group

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.290
that we're almost like a family,
and this goes back many years.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.030
So I am the president of
the indigenous Education

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.617
institute, which started
out in Bluff, Utah.

00:04:56.617 --> 00:04:57.575
You can see the bluffs.

00:04:57.575 --> 00:04:59.590
That was right
outside where I lived.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.200
And now we're located in
Friday Harbor, Washington,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.582
the beautiful San Juan Islands.

00:05:07.582 --> 00:05:12.890
And you can find us actually on
Twitter and Facebook and Skype.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.590
So we have a mission too, and
it has evolved over the years.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.360
We're 25 years old.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.710
We have had this
nonprofit, and it's great.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.230
It's still going.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.440
We have an all native board
from all around the world,

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.630
Maori from New Zealand,
Australia, Hawaii,

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.900
and we're virtual.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.750
And we think this is great,
because we do everything

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.570
through telecommunications.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:48.190
Our mission is to preserve,
protect, and apply

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.600
traditional
indigenous knowledge.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.620
And what we're
doing is, we totally

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.930
believe we can find solutions
to problems, solutions

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.520
that are outside of
the box, solutions that

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.740
call on deep, ancient,
indigenous knowledge

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.580
from many different tribes.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.010
And so what we do is we
like to form partnerships.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.900
It's all about
collaboration as far

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.940
as we're concerned, but
collaborations with integrity,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:22.100
where we totally respect the
viewpoint of the other entities

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.950
we're working with
and vice versa.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.470
DAVID BEGAY: Equally excited
and honored to be here.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.870
Nancy and I, we've been
working for a very long time.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.450
Earlier, we were working
for a tribal college

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.790
called [INAUDIBLE] College
in Arizona and New Mexico.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.370
And I was a dean,
academic dean there.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.640
I became the vice
president, retired, and now

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.770
onto working with University
of Berkeley, and also faculty

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.720
at University of New Mexico.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.960
I got recruited and also
faculty at Northern Arizona

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.450
University in the department
of physics and astronomy.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.450
But that's where I'm at.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.090
And I'm trying to
retire for good,

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.890
but I can't really
do it right now.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.932
Things are just too excited.

00:07:15.932 --> 00:07:17.140
That's why I'm here, I guess.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:22.260
At Google, there's all
these opportunities.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.240
But I guess I'm really
here to talk a little bit

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:33.100
about indigenous knowledge,
how it's different and similar

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.520
to mainstream knowledge as well.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.780
And I'll just give you a few
examples in the slides that

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.220
are forthcoming.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.660
NANCY MARYBOY: And
this is our team.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.110
And some of you are
here in the room.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.410
And I have two children
in that picture too,

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.030
a little older than
Laura's children.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.430
And this is one we, like David
said, one of our great passions

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.580
is indigenous astronomy.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.620
And we teach a
course we developed,

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.010
an online course, Introduction
to Indigenous Astronomy.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.030
We teach it out of Northern
Arizona University.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.221
And we are coming out of Dene
College, the Navajo tribal

00:08:11.221 --> 00:08:11.720
college.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.290
We worked there for a lot of
years/ I graduated from there.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.030
I went to Stanford, so this
land is familiar to me.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:24.970
And we got our Ph.Ds
in indigenous science.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.800
You won't find too many people
that got that kind of a degree.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.760
And it's a long story, and
we won't go into it here.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.980
But anyway, here we
are in Washington DC.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.240
We had just showed a
planetarium show we developed,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.750
and we showed it at the
National Aerospace Museum,

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.130
and then we showed it for
a week at the National

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.150
Museum of the American Indian.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.030
OK, this is really important.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.530
We keep saying,
people might want

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.760
to know why we work together.

00:08:54.289 --> 00:08:56.580
DR. LAURA PETICOLAS: So we're
going to go through this.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.700
You'll see this throughout
the whole presentation,

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.121
really, about why
we work together.

00:09:01.121 --> 00:09:03.620
This is one of our projects,
which we'll talk about a little

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.160
more later.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.960
But you'll see that this
project brought together people

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.480
from all sorts of different
tribes around the United

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.620
States, as well as
scientists, science educators,

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.340
and CEOs of museums.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.870
So we're going to talk a little
bit about why it is we do that.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:23.970
So here.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.387
Do you want to
introduce this one?

00:09:25.387 --> 00:09:27.803
NANCY MARYBOY: Yes, we want
to show you the collaborations

00:09:27.803 --> 00:09:28.590
go way back.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.500
So you might recognize the
fellow in the headdress

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.125
as Einstein.

00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:37.700
He and his wife went out in 1931
to visit the Hopi reservation.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.500
And what's really
interesting is books

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.640
have been written by
people like Benjamin Whorf

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.230
about how much of
Hopi, and we could also

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.520
say Navajo, ways of
knowing correlate

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.050
with relativity and
relational thinking.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.630
So it's interesting
that he was out visiting

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.010
the Hopi in those days.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.510
So that's an early
collaboration, LOL,

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.933
we put in for you all.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.640
DR. LAURA PETICOLAS: So one
of the long term visions

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.100
for our team is that science
and technology really becomes

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.560
a place where
everyone, when they

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.070
come to these institutions
and that work,

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.660
that they have a feeling
that their culture is there

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.670
as well, that they're not
walking into a culture that

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:28.240
is outside what they're used
to when they're at their homes.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.100
So that is one of our long
term visions for this,

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.760
and we really feel
that one of the ways

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.590
to get there is by
working cross-culturally

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:36.820
with other people.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:42.360
So as I said, the foundation
of our work in this field

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.440
was with David and Nancy.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.020
And you'll see these books
that are available to you all.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.450
They are also available online.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.310
They were published
with your tax dollars.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.060
So it's an NSF project.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.150
So feel free to take
as many of those books

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.750
as you would like
and share them.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.210
And you'll see the title is
"Collaboration With Integrity,"

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.910
and talks a little
bit about our journey

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.000
through some of this work.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:10.540
All right.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.460
So here's our next.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.830
We're going to go to the
science universe and the Navajo

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.250
universe in the south.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.980
OK, so we're here at
hosted by Making Science.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.240
And of course, making
is very important.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.010
And it's important
in our work as well.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.760
So we're going to pass out
some materials for you all.

00:11:34.074 --> 00:11:36.490
Maybe, David, you could say
something while I pass it out.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.580
I'll hand it out to
some folks to pass.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:42.660
DAVID BEGAY: People are always
looking around for a model

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:48.940
to organize plans,
and activities,

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.510
and to do planning,
strategic planning.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.320
And they use different models.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:01.280
And there's several really well
known models circulating out

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.100
there.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:08.920
When it came to
our organization,

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.260
we ask each other that rather
than looking around or copying

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.600
other models or
using other models,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.520
we wanted to use what was
indigenous to our land.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.510
And so what we did is we went to
the elders, and we asked them,

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:28.510
is there an organization
that we can follow?

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.980
Is there one out there?

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.040
And they said, oh
yeah, it's out there.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.295
It's right here in
the whole universe.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.400
Where do we start?

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:45.550
And so, that's how we got around
to talking about the model.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:49.760
And so we started to put
the process in there.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.120
And the process provided the
structure and the organization.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.700
So when you think
about it, there's

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:07.380
a very sophisticated, tremendous
order provided by nature.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.780
It's an order.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.790
It's real dynamic.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.090
And so that's the
information that we used

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.010
to put these circles together.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:20.065
And so there's more circles,
circles within circles.

00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:23.730
Pretty soon you start to see
a fractal matrix, and circles,

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:27.370
and then within the circle there
are squares, and rectangles,

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.940
and triangles, and
they all work together.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.640
And so we just took
a little piece,

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.400
and we wanted to use
indigenous knowledge

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.160
to provide this organization.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.130
We wanted to
exemplify what we say.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.020
DR. LAURA PETICOLAS:
So you can tell

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.853
we've been working
together for a long time,

00:13:47.853 --> 00:13:50.750
because I can just
hand David the mic.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:56.210
So those of you who are here
now have these materials.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.930
Hopefully you have scissors,
or someone near you

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.040
has a pair of scissors.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.230
If not, we'll make sure the
scissors get over to you.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:09.600
And then also, you have
some the cellophane bags

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.100
that we're going to use.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.120
We also have some pipe
cleaners and some tape.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.820
So the purpose of
this-- in making,

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.960
often you give people
materials, and they

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.060
get to figure out what
they want to do with them.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.290
We will be talking
about these materials.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.750
And if you would like to
make some handmade glasses

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.709
with filters, then that will
be appropriate to our talk.

00:14:37.709 --> 00:14:39.500
So of course, you may
do whatever you would

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.540
like with these materials.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:48.155
But we'll be talking about
seeing with multiple filters.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.400
OK.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.324
So we're going to
start with the sun.

00:14:55.324 --> 00:14:57.490
I'm going to tell you a
little bit about the physics

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:58.345
that I know about.

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:02.940
So we're going to talk a
little bit about the sun

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.440
and looking at the sun
from multiple perspectives.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.570
So staying on this theme of
collaboration with integrity

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.890
and looking at the universe
from different cultural

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:11.800
perspectives.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.120
So scientists also
use this notion

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.124
of looking at things with
different perspectives.

00:15:17.124 --> 00:15:18.540
So I want to tell
you a little bit

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.170
about the sun when you do that.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.590
So the sun, of course you
shouldn't be looking at the sun

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.530
directly without some filters
over your eyes, some good ones,

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.520
so that your eyes
stay protected.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:35.810
But if you do either have the
sun projected onto a screen,

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.940
or you have good
filtered glasses,

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.580
then it will look like this.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.770
It's white.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.660
Sometimes, you'll
see spots on the sun.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:49.190
If you look at the sun with
a Lyman-Alpha filter filter,

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.090
then it could look like this.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:52.750
So it's red.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.210
Lyman-Alpha is a
filter that filters out

00:15:55.210 --> 00:16:01.090
a specific line coming
from the atom of hydrogen.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.500
And when you basically
filter out everything

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.040
that you can see from
the sun except this line,

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.560
now you can start seeing some
really interesting features

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.650
on the sun.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.710
So as you're making
your glasses,

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.150
you can hold up the
cellophane that you have there

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.210
and start to see what
disappears when you hold up

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.760
a color, what remains
there, what things change,

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.175
how d things change.

00:16:25.175 --> 00:16:26.840
And it's the same
thing with the sun,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.630
and we can learn a
lot about the sun.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:32.430
So the atmosphere,
this atmosphere

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.410
that we're living
in, it blocks a lot

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.616
of the sunlight from the sun.

00:16:37.616 --> 00:16:39.240
And a lot of the
sunlight we can't see,

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.660
so sunlight in the
infrared, sunlight

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.330
in the UV or ultraviolet.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.670
And so if we want to study the
sun and learn more about it,

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.070
we actually have to get
away from the filter

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.820
of the atmosphere of Earth.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.130
And so we do that by launching
satellites into space.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.880
So where we are at the
Space Sciences Lab,

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.330
we create instruments to
put on these satellites,

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.650
and we work with NASA
and other industries

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:07.160
to launch these into
space and study the sun,

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.310
is one of the things we do.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.400
So here you see the
stereo satellites.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.619
There are two of them
with identical cameras

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:17.510
in order to get multiple
perspectives of the sun,

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:22.020
and actually see the
sun in stereo at times.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.020
So when we do that, when we
get out of the atmosphere

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.349
and away into space,
and we look at the sun,

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:30.140
and we put these different
colored filters on our cameras

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.960
out in space, we can see that
the sun is this dynamic star.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.290
It isn't this kind of
constant glowing ball of gas

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.940
that people think about,
but it is this dynamic, ever

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.710
changing, interesting object.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:44.650
It's a star.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.160
Of course, it's
our nearest star.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.820
But then what we see when you're
looking at all these pictures,

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.360
you can see how with
a different filter,

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.729
you start to see these
features farther and further

00:17:55.729 --> 00:17:57.520
away from what we call
the Earth's surface.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.830
It's not a surface that
you could stand on.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.430
It's not very dense at all.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.290
But as you go farther away,
what scientists have learned

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.670
is that unlike a candle
flame or a fire, when

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:13.060
you go away from the candle
flame or fire, it gets cooler.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.460
As you go towards fire,
it gets hotter and hotter.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.344
The sun is a little
bit different.

00:18:17.344 --> 00:18:19.510
If you start from Earth and
you go closer and closer

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:23.210
to the sun, it gets hotter
and hotter, of course.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.280
But then, if you closer
in, closer to the surface,

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.521
it actually cools down again.

00:18:29.521 --> 00:18:31.770
So it's this very strange
thing that we've discovered.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.740
And we discovered
it first, in part,

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.530
from using filters to look
at the sun and see these.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:41.370
And it turns out that
these features of the sun

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.560
are magnetically
driven, and that there's

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.870
some really complicated,
very cool plasma magnetism

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:54.870
interactions that
then heat up the sun.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.530
So it's time to use
the filters you made.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.200
So here are the
glasses I made before.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.700
OK, so as an educator
and a scientist,

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.650
you can't worry about how
you look in this world.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.570
There's too many more
important things to do.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.054
So here I am.

00:19:13.054 --> 00:19:14.720
And I see some of you
also in this room.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.700
Those of you watching
remotely, hello.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.610
You can't see everyone
else, but many people

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:19.550
have their glasses on.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:20.440
It's awesome.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.520
I hope you do too, if you
had any glasses nearby.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.140
So when I look at you all
with my different glasses,

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.530
and I chose two
different colors,

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.360
then it changes how
I'm seeing the world.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.810
I'm definitely going to
focus on different things.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.310
And now I'm a little
bit visually impaired,

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:39.772
I have to say.

00:19:39.772 --> 00:19:41.360
So not so comfortable.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.520
And sometimes filters
aren't comfortable.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.860
That is a truth.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.520
So if you have your glasses,
or you have your filters up,

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.330
we brought these leis.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.920
So maybe Nancy could
hold one of those up.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.000
And, David, you could
hold one up as well.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.440
So we believe that
working hard is

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.440
really important in
this work, but we also

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.170
believe that having
fun is super important.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.840
So you can see.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.110
We'll be talking about some
pretty abstract, deep concepts

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.290
in a minute here.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:21.130
So if you can look at these
leis with different filters,

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:25.060
like if you hold up the
red one, then you can look

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.770
and see which colors
here do you actually see?

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.760
Or if you also want to
look at this screen,

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.400
does the red filter
block anything else out?

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.470
Does the blue filter
block things out?

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.040
Does this look different?

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.320
What do you learn about
that that you might not have

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.820
noticed with the new filters?

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.960
And so here's a picture
someone put together,

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.660
a scientist that I really like.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.130
It's beautiful, and it
really gets across this idea

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.730
that when we look at the
sun in multiple filters,

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.460
we just find out way more
than we did when we just

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.656
look at it with one color.

00:21:01.656 --> 00:21:04.080
NANCY MARYBOY: Yeah, I was
giving a talk in Seattle

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.420
to kids from all different
tribes, urban Indian kids.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.110
And so I was making the
same point about filters.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:15.030
And I was demonstrating with
three dimensional glasses,

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.260
3D glasses.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.070
So if you look at both
eyes, you can see,

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.810
and you've got the appropriate
screen you're looking at,

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.410
like on TV, a 3D
channel, you're going

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:25.800
to see it in three dimensions.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.460
If you close one
eye, you're just

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.412
going to see one dimension.

00:21:29.412 --> 00:21:30.870
And that's why you
can't be a pilot

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:34.390
if you have just vision
in one eye, by the way.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.290
But anyway, the
point we're making

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:44.360
is that we all filter our world
views, how we see the world.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.850
We filter them through
our own world views.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.130
We have our own tacit
infrastructure that

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.780
makes us see in a certain way.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:58.540
And in order to really work
cross-culturally with success,

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:04.020
you need to learn how to do
put those tacit infrastructures

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.850
away and try to look
without the filters.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.510
It's very hard to
do, because you'll

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:13.330
keep retaining a lot of what you
already have inherent in you.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.640
But by making that
attempt, you we

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.520
will be able to get
into an area where

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.430
you can really deeply
listen to the other people

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:23.400
you're working with.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.960
And then amazing things happen.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.110
DR. LAURA PETICOLAS:
So that is this analogy

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.460
that Nancy talked about.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.200
So learning science
together through

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.290
different cultural filters.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.160
So I want to talk just
briefly about when

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.480
we do this, what I found really
a fascinating and enriching

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.670
in my own science is I start
to think about what is science

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.050
in a way I never did before.

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:56.260
So of course, Earth and
space science is science.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.540
It has the word science in it.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.840
So we know that's science.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.990
And this is the field
I'm comfortable in.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.200
But a chemistry professor
once said to me,

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.120
cooking is chemistry.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.340
It has all these
different reactions,

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.740
and he loved to come up
with new concoctions,

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.870
but thinking of it through
his chemistry lens.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:21.700
So cooking could be considered
science by some people.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:27.480
Some of the traditional, native
Hawaiian experts in Hawaii

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.860
that we work with,
they definitely

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.050
talk about traditional
ecological knowledge

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:32.650
being science.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.210
So what you're seeing
here are some fish ponds

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:38.750
that they're restoring in the
ancient tradition in order

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:43.300
to keep their fish
production going strong.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.310
So what is science?

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:51.185
If you've ever thought about
and wondered what is science,

00:23:51.185 --> 00:23:53.330
there are actually
researchers out in the world

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.620
who research people
doing science,

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.070
and they write papers about it.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.650
So it's very meta.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:01.950
And then we're
trying to figure out

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:05.990
how to teach the nation about
science and about engineering.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.660
And so the National
Academy put together

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.550
this a really
fantastic report called

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.660
"A Framework for K-12
Science Education

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.180
Practices, Cross Cutting
Concepts, and Core Ideas."

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:21.340
And it was actually led by a lot
of physicist here at Stanford.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.950
I know we have some
Standford alums here.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.540
And they went and looked
at all the research

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.250
on what is science?

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:31.210
What happens when
people do science?

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.610
So I'm going to tell you
a little just briefly.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.530
Science fields have
their own language,

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.790
but the most common
language is probably math.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:42.780
So math is a way to take
what nature is telling us

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.880
and turn into a language that we
can use to predict and explain.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.020
So this is the equation that
I used in my Ph.D. thesis.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:56.210
And it's a time dependent
electron transport equation.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.880
So I wanted to show some quotes
from that, from that report.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.550
So I'm going to just read these.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.380
Although some kinds of
culturally valued knowledge

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.590
and practices, including
spiritual and mystical thought,

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:12.017
are at odds with
science, a growing body

00:25:12.017 --> 00:25:14.600
of published research shows that
some of the knowledge derived

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.340
from varied cultures
and contexts

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.550
provides valid and consistent
scientific interpretations.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:23.350
So you'll see some
of that today.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:26.540
Although any real system
smaller than the entire universe

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.870
interacts and is dependent
on other external systems.

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.800
So this technology that
everything's interconnected,

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.200
it is often useful to
conceptually isolate

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.420
a single system for study.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.040
So here I'm showing
our atmosphere

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.390
that goes out into space.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:43.240
And typically, we'll take
one layer of atmosphere

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:47.010
and study it really carefully.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:51.190
But there are these interactions
that happen between the layers.

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.880
We know scientists and engineers
investigate and observe

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.480
the world with
essentially two goals,

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.790
to systematically
describe the world

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.400
and to develop and test
theories and explanations of how

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.560
the world works.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.250
So here I am showing some
of our teachers in Nevada

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.740
that we work with,
and there we have

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.850
buried a magnetometer, which
is an instrument to study

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:12.270
Earth's magnetic fields.

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:15.710
And the teachers actually
use this with their students

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.930
to understand how the Earth's
magnetism is changing.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:25.490
Human beings are part of and
dependent on the natural world.

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:28.590
And the new technologies enable
new scientific investigations,

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:30.190
allowing scientists
to probe realms

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.820
and handle quantities of
data previously inaccessible

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:33.650
to them.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:35.506
So here's my son and his friend.

00:26:35.506 --> 00:26:37.130
I got permission from
his friend's mom,

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.279
today, to use this picture.

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:40.570
And they are part of the world.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:45.110
We're out hiking, and they
are a part of the trees

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.400
and everything around them.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.340
And then at the same
time, we're developing

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.660
these amazing technologies.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:55.340
This is our stardust
mission that we ran out

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.360
of Space Sciences Lab.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.380
And they went up and
captured all this stardust,

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.350
and then had people
in the public

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.560
actually analyze
that data online.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.880
And that was new
technology to figure out

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.130
how to do that kind of
citizen science project

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.630
with massive amounts of data.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.880
So what I'm trying
to show you here

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:18.374
is not only what is science,
but that different sciences

00:27:18.374 --> 00:27:19.540
each have their own culture.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.845
They have their own language.

00:27:20.845 --> 00:27:21.970
They have their own values.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:24.160
They have their own world views.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.900
I'm not sure they
have their own foods.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.970
I'm not sure physicists eat any
differently than ecologists,

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:32.600
but maybe someone
has studied that.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.300
So this takes us to
the Navajo universe.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.290
What is that universe like?

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.730
DAVID BEGAY: This
isn't another planet

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.030
or somewhere in the universe.

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:45.660
This is just right here.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:53.510
When I talk to other indigenous
people, Hopis that live next

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:58.090
to our land, they have
a similar worldview,

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:03.050
and they're going to depict
how they look at the world.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:09.575
And then there are other people
that National Geographic,

00:28:09.575 --> 00:28:14.110
some pictures of worldviews
of the Maya people,

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:18.770
and Incas, and other indigenous
people around the world.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.320
So they look at the
worldview different.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:26.400
And I think aside from
thinking in this way,

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.710
I was raised with this
culture and consciousness.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:35.280
And so this is, I guess,
if you call it a box,

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.420
this would be my box.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.990
And I have to think
outside that box

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:46.590
to think through the
Euro-American box.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:49.460
And so whenever
I went to school,

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:54.440
when I went to the university,
I had to think outside this box

00:28:54.440 --> 00:29:00.640
into this other box in order
to process information.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:06.500
And also coming outside
that box worldview,

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:13.230
even furthermore, I had to
drop a lot of my worldview,

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:17.640
including what Laura was
talking about, spirituality.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:23.970
That's a big part of the native
consciousness and worldview,

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:24.890
deep culture.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.650
That's where the deep
knowledge was at.

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:30.820
And so I had to
get away from that

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:35.580
and just think science as
science, talk that language

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:41.746
and imitate what
other people say,

00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:48.064
and be pure scientist in order
to survive in that laboratory

00:29:48.064 --> 00:29:51.430
and you know all the
math like everybody else.

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:55.560
But this is pretty
much the worldview

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.930
from which I come from.

00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:01.900
And just a little
explanation-- Navajos,

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.240
they believe that a long,
long, long time ago, they

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.866
don't put numbers
on it, they say

00:30:07.866 --> 00:30:11.120
that the evolution of
all life processes,

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:15.860
the original energy
was light, they say.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:20.766
Light evolved.

00:30:20.766 --> 00:30:26.480
And the formation of life
goes way, way, way back.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.140
Very similar to the
Big Bang, I think.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:38.790
And so from that evolved
all life in different forms.

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:44.590
So the whole universe,
we have our own way

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.760
of organizing our
constellations.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.550
And it's circular.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.450
It starts with the
North Star, and it's

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:58.290
counterclockwise as observed.

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:03.020
And so the constellation
organization

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:07.650
is a sort of spiral
counter clockwise.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.810
That's how we would
talk about it.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:15.450
Once you're an astronomer,
you can jump around and say,

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:16.400
there's Orion.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.462
There's Pleiades.

00:31:18.462 --> 00:31:20.870
There's Scorpius.

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:24.090
But when you talk about
our constellation,

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.980
you have to follow the
order, a certain way

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.145
of talking about it.

00:31:30.145 --> 00:31:31.900
There's the winter
constellation,

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.740
summer constellation.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:38.220
And some expand
across time and space.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.690
And pretty soon, we're going to
show one of the constellations.

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:43.540
They're pretty big.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.285
You just can't say there it is.

00:31:46.285 --> 00:31:49.200
It expands across
time and space.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.460
They're pretty big.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.430
So it's a different way
of looking at the world

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:55.110
and talking about
constellations.

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:58.560
There's teachings
in all of them.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:04.980
And so I guess I can go on, and
on, and on, and on about this.

00:32:07.722 --> 00:32:11.090
But a lot of the
words that we use,

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:13.150
I think that really
makes a big difference.

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:21.140
For example, in star,
we say [? setsuyo, ?]

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:25.060
which translated in English
is "my ancient relation

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.710
from which I came."

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:31.460
That's different from
saying the word star.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:34.270
Star had a different definition.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:37.770
If you say, my ancient
relation, my ancient,

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:40.930
going back way in
time, I'm related.

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:44.060
That's where I come
from, from which I came.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.660
I am of that.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:50.870
I think science
says, we're stardust.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:55.170
I think Native Americans
are saying the same thing

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.940
in so many words.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:05.920
So this is
information, knowledge,

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:10.640
that makes you think,
a little information

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:15.469
on the language, how it's
differently constructed.

00:33:15.469 --> 00:33:17.010
NANCY MARYBOY: Yeah,
we could mention

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:21.870
that what we usually have
to do when we talk with,

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:24.920
when we present with
Western scientists

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.280
or do workshops or things,
most people have all

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.510
gone to grade school,
high school, and college

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:31.600
in the Western sense.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.550
And so we all share in this
room those Western views,

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:39.070
but most people,
unless they're native,

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:43.060
don't know the native education.

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:47.810
And in a lot of cases back
home, on the Navajo reservation,

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.460
our kids aren't getting
the Navajo side of things,

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:54.160
unless their parents are really
making an effort to transmit

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.830
the knowledge and the language.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:02.400
And so one of our emissions
from IEI and what we do

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:07.160
is to create more
awareness of the Navajo,

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:12.199
or Cherokee, or Lakota
knowledge to bring it up

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:14.330
to a parity with
Western so then we

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.469
can start having
a real dialogue.

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:19.470
But we usually have to talk
somewhat about the native side

00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:23.030
of things first, just
so people understand

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:27.460
what another paradigm or another
worldview could look like.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.420
One of the things
that's really important

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:34.120
is that the traditional
knowledge, it

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.570
comes from nature, but
it's talked about in terms

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.489
of ceremony, and the
elders are very respected

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:42.580
for their knowledge.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.980
And so everything we
did in our research,

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.980
we'd go back and double,
triple check it with elders,

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.980
and make sure that it was
what they wanted us to say.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.310
So that's something.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.060
These are couple little
differences that we're just

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.290
going to examine.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.890
Another one is,
it's very important

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:06.180
the idea of interrelationships,
interdependencies

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.070
of everything.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:13.330
And so this knowledge emerges
from very careful observations

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:15.180
of the Earth and sky.

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.490
And so I can't tell you how
many nights David and I went out

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.750
for years, and years,
and years, looking

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:24.370
at Navajo constellations and
the patterns of the stars.

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:27.230
Because everything we were
researching wasn't in books.

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:30.000
And you couldn't go to a
library and just look it up.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.480
You couldn't go to some
expert and find out.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.380
We wrote a book on
Navajo astronomy,

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.900
of which we did bring one
copy here to show you,

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.720
which was an attempt to give
back to Navajo students what is

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.070
somewhat lost in the culture.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:49.360
But the careful observation
comes from the language.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:54.156
And so native languages
are so incredibly precise.

00:35:54.156 --> 00:35:55.530
You've probably
heard this before

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.660
that Alaskans have all
these different word

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.560
ways to describe snow.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.680
And Navajo do too.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.655
But they are so precise.

00:36:03.655 --> 00:36:05.860
They are probably
the epitome of what

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:11.212
a scientific language could
be if it wasn't in English.

00:36:11.212 --> 00:36:13.030
OK.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:15.890
OK, another one
that's very important

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:19.380
is the concept of
reciprocal relationships.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.210
Everything's in a relationship.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:24.820
We are in relationships.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:25.720
We have family.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.100
We have clans.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.120
We have cities.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.020
We have states.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.837
We have this Earth we live on.

00:36:31.837 --> 00:36:32.920
We're in the solar system.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.570
We go out to the local group.

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:39.030
It goes on and on, but it's
all in terms of relationships.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.130
And if you go into a
Navajo school, for example,

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:47.160
or where we worked, people have
on their door their four clans.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.950
And then they will
know how to relate

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:51.540
to a professor, or a student.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.669
And that student could
be your grandmother.

00:36:53.669 --> 00:36:55.960
And then you treat them as
if they're your grandmother.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.500
This is clan relationships.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.260
Now, it has nothing
to do with age.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.170
So relationships are
really important.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:07.300
And the whole example
of reciprocity--

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.180
you do something for
somebody or something,

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.160
and something comes back to you.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.640
It's all a balance.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.020
And so that kind of
thing is so lacking

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.240
in the dominant
societies of this world

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:23.500
today that these
are things we think

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.580
that knowing more of the native
of ways could bring to science,

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:31.710
or even bring to something like
Google, a new way of looking

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.410
at old things.

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.470
And the concept of
stewardship-- when

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:38.940
we started working with NASA,
it stunned some of them,

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:42.420
because they had never thought
of stewarding the Earth,

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.110
taking care of the Earth.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:47.010
It was more like, let's
go out and explore.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:49.890
And since we worked with
them over the years,

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:51.530
we've seen a real turn now.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:54.690
And there are wonderful
people, and some of them

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:57.060
are in this room, who
are really thinking

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.990
in terms of taking
care of the Earth,

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:03.000
and leaving something
for future generations.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.900
And you can see the way
the world is going so

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.770
fast in this other direction.

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:10.020
These kind of concepts, we
have a real strong belief

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:14.230
that it can help to know
some of these things.

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:19.640
DAVID BEGAY: I think when you
go to these native communities,

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:27.230
some native people, they
believe that what we have here

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:30.150
is really borrowed.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:35.500
It's from the future generation,
seven generations out.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:39.610
All of if what we have
here is being borrowed.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:45.750
And so what we do here is going
to affect the generation that's

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:46.350
forthcoming.

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:56.470
And so we're really living here
on borrowed time and resources.

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.350
It doesn't belong
to this generation.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:02.890
It belongs to our
feature generations,

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:06.080
and we should take care of it.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:10.760
I think that kind of mentality
and really believing in that,

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.940
and really living
that life, that's

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.110
different from just
thinking about it, I think.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:22.140
NANCY MARYBOY: OK,
another one is,

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.630
if you're doing research,
any kind of science,

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:28.390
like native science,
the validation is not

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:30.200
in peer reviewed journals.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.770
It's not in the having
your book published.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:35.890
It comes from the community.

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:38.590
Those are the people
whose validation

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:40.610
we needed for the work we did.

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:44.550
And then we could take it
out into the wider world.

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:47.440
But it's true of
indigenous communities,

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.930
a lot of these things are
true of indigenous communities

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:56.660
all over the world,
but whoever's

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.000
going to put that
stamp of approval on it

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.500
is going to be an
elder or community

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.410
leader or [INAUDIBLE] person.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.937
This one's a real
controversial thing today.

00:40:08.937 --> 00:40:10.020
And it's really important.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.580
But a lot of native
knowledge is protected,

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.470
and it always has been.

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:19.540
But a lot of it has
also been misused

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.810
by pharmaceutical
companies and people that

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:25.600
will learn about the use
of a plant, then go out

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.940
and harvest all the rest
of them there ever were,

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.295
like goldenrod, for example.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.070
And so the concept of using
a plant, which is really

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:39.640
your relative, in the
native way of thinking,

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.120
using it for personal
gain or corporate gain,

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.960
it doesn't exist in
the native world.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.730
And so this is why there's
some real controversies

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:52.670
about indigenous intellectual
property rights, where

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:56.250
the community is holding
the knowledge, and patents,

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:59.810
like in the United States, where
individuals hold the knowledge.

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:03.710
So if you want to work with
native communities and partner

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:06.680
with them, you have to know
some of these protocols.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.681
You want to know
and abide by them.

00:41:09.681 --> 00:41:11.430
And I'm just telling
you this because it's

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:14.410
a hot topic in indigenous
communities today.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.100
Nothing could be more
important than the language.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.050
And we're talking
in English today,

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:27.080
which is great, because we
can all understand each other.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.260
But just like, I
guess, to some extent

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:35.200
English defines an
American worldview, Navajo,

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:40.610
or any native language, really
defines the native worldview.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.130
And so when you hear of
language disappearing

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:48.550
at a very fast rate today, and a
tribe will have a last speaker,

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.780
not only does that
person pass away,

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.920
not only does the knowledge
of that language pass away,

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.340
but all that millennia
knowledge that goes with it.

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.790
And like I said, these
are very precise languages

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:05.600
that would be interesting--
I mean, scientists don't know

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.450
them, because who could
speak Navajo, and Lakota,

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:12.300
and Cherokee, and Inuit,
and all these languages.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.220
But there is just an
incredible science that

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:18.040
resides within these languages.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.770
So I'll give you an example.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:24.090
The reason we have that
road up there is in Navajo,

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:27.160
all these languages,
all of them, we think,

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.150
are languages of process
and relationship.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:36.070
And when a person looks at
English, or French, or Spanish,

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:39.090
they consider them very
static relationships.

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:41.950
And if you think back, and
when you all were in school,

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:44.914
and you learned French
or Spanish, for example,

00:42:44.914 --> 00:42:46.372
probably the first
word you learned

00:42:46.372 --> 00:42:48.130
was chair, and table, and door.

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:49.750
They're all nouns.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:53.380
But in the native languages,
they are very dynamic words,

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:56.360
and they can be
created as you talk.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.150
David's just an
excellent speaker.

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:02.090
He can make up things and talk
within an order in Navajo,

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:05.300
and you just could be amazed.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:09.180
But somebody counted
this up in Navajo.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.810
We have one word in
English called go.

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:15.840
Navajo has 200,000
ways to say go.

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.910
It's all about process.

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:20.400
It's all about a
movement, a world that's

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.920
in constant movement, a universe
that's in constant movement.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:28.620
I think quantum physicists
talk about this too,

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.310
that dynamic movement
of the universe.

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:39.290
But that's why it's so important
for more diverse languages

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:42.580
to stay on this Earth,
because the knowledge that's

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.220
embedded in them are
specific to a place.

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:49.074
And it's just very deep
knowledge of that place.

00:43:49.074 --> 00:43:50.740
DAVID BEGAY: Laura
wanted me to use some

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:56.360
of our words to explain this.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:02.271
And so we've got this
off Google and got it up

00:44:02.271 --> 00:44:05.570
here on the screen now.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:09.555
Our word for tornado,
we call it niyoltsoh.

00:44:09.555 --> 00:44:12.620
It talks about that
cyclonic action,

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:16.070
nyoltsoh, that cyclonic action.

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.620
It's a creation by the sun.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:25.620
You say, johonaa ei,
meaning, the sun.

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.130
It's creation.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:31.730
It comes from the sun,
interaction with the Earth

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:34.350
down here.

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.770
That's what it is.

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:40.330
When you see the tornado,
you see the sun's activity

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:42.550
and the sun's energy at work.

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:48.200
There's no one
name for a tornado.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:52.260
It's the sun's energy at work.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:58.810
And so with that, when a
tornado comes into being,

00:44:58.810 --> 00:44:59.790
[SPEAKING NAVAJO]

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:07.200
What comes into being is
also the gravity, the Earth's

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.670
gravity, and the gravity.

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:12.680
It's male and female.

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.490
It comes down, and
then it goes back up.

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:16.180
Now you see it.

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.790
Now you don't.

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:23.640
And then the energy
[INAUDIBLE] that lightning.

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:27.980
Male energy and
the female energy.

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:33.200
It's inherent in nature, as
it's inherent in a tornado

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.470
at a given time.

00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:39.190
It's fuel that
provides the energy.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:41.790
They say, [SPEAKING NAVAJO].

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:43.220
It comes into being.

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.300
So it's not the one thing.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.620
It's not one thing.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.280
It's all the interaction.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.125
It's nature.

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:59.980
It works as one system.

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:03.540
And so in our
language, if we were

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:09.000
to talk about, for
example, gravity,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.990
you have to talk about
the unity of all things.

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:20.750
In the Western world,
you can take gravity,

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:27.050
and you can talk about gravity
using Einstein's definition,

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:30.180
or the [INAUDIBLE]
and we can even

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:33.250
use math to talk about gravity.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:35.550
In the Native
American world, you

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:39.305
have to use the totality
of all these relationships.

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:44.530
Gravity does not
happen by numbers.

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:48.740
Gravity is in the
whole universe acting.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:52.980
The same thing
here, the tornado,

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:56.219
it's the whole universe acting.

00:46:56.219 --> 00:46:58.260
It's a different kind of
science, a different way

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.600
of looking at things.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:04.510
So it's all described
through that motion

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:06.070
that Nancy was talking about.

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:09.470
It's a verb-based language.

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:13.700
English, it's different,
a different construction.

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:16.700
So what you start to
see is a different way

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.950
of looking at things.

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:21.090
It's not the same.

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:22.140
It's a different way.

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:28.490
I guess, looking at all the
diversity of how people think,

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:34.270
I think that's what
it is needed, I think.

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:39.580
The more worldview,
the more ways

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.510
of looking at the
different world,

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:45.640
I think the more intelligent
people can become,

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:50.840
the more rich your thought
process could be, I think.

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.590
NANCY MARYBOY: Yeah,
this one [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:55.210
because we are talking about
integrity, collaboration,

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:56.480
diversity, and growth.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:02.350
And this was used in the
cover of "Dimension Magazine"

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:06.880
for Aztec, the coyote,
throwing up the stars.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.480
It's a Navajo story of how
the stars were created.

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.540
And the coyote is
a trickster figure,

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.610
who throws a wrench
into everything.

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:18.250
But he's also very smart,
and he has a big part

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:22.600
throughout all of Navajo
history and cosmology.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.140
It's also a way of
talking-- if you

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.470
want to go to another level--
it's a way to talk about chaos

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:34.320
theory and then complexity
theory, how the chaos is

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.710
contained by complexity.

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:42.730
And so you can go very
deeply into these subjects.

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:46.930
We used some quantum
physics concepts

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:49.390
for some of the work
we did, just because it

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:51.520
helped us find English
works to explain what

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.190
we were trying to talk about.

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:57.060
DR. LAURA PETICOLAS:
OK, so we were just

00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.515
talking about science universe
and the Navajo universe.

00:48:59.515 --> 00:49:01.900
So hopefully you
got a sense of how

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:05.390
those two worldviews and the
way we think about things

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:06.560
are very different.

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.740
We're going to talk next
about the programming

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:11.940
that we actually create from
these different worldviews

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:17.620
for children,
undergraduates, for adults,

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.440
educators around the US.

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.100
So I'm going to just
pretty quickly go

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.150
through some of these.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:25.510
I'm not going to give
you too many details.

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:27.230
I just want to kind
of wet your appetite.

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:29.030
I know we're near
the end of our hour.

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:33.010
So here we have found some
youth-- I think one of them

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:39.580
is in the room today-- learning
how to program, computer

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:43.920
software programming,
in order to bring NASA

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:50.370
data into the phones with
these Google Cardboard boxes,

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:55.390
so that kids can learn
more about the environment

00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:56.704
around them.

00:49:56.704 --> 00:49:58.370
And if you want to
know more about that,

00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:01.120
you can ask our guest over here.

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.740
So this is one of our programs.

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:08.560
It's one of our high
school programs.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.550
And the other thing I wanted
to mention about high school

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:14.290
programs and our Team
Multiverse runs right now

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:17.360
the Bay Area Teen
Science Organization,

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.770
which is a collaboration of
organizations around the Bay

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:25.080
Area to support teens and
help them learn science.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:28.690
So this is one of the examples
of the teen programs happening

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:29.550
around the Bay Area.

00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:31.970
But if you are interested in
that kind of work in the Bay

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:36.530
Area, then look for the Bay
Area Teen Science Listserv,

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:39.950
and you can sign up and
learn more about that.

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:43.370
We also really support
girls in science.

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:46.110
We work with Girls Inc
and also Girl Scouts.

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:49.700
This is a picture of some
after school providers

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:52.550
learning about
electromagnetic spectrum,

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:55.779
and doing it in a way
appropriate for their audience,

00:50:55.779 --> 00:50:57.070
for the girls in their program.

00:50:57.070 --> 00:51:00.630
So these girls are typically in
middle school and high school.

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:03.450
This program that
we ran was called

00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:08.180
Five Stars, because it
was to bring generations

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:13.410
from elementary grades, middle
school grades, undergraduates,

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:17.680
graduate students,
and scientists,

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.950
to have them all interact
in a meaningful way

00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:24.230
in after school programs to
learn about space science.

00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:25.750
We also work with
Lick Observatory.

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.820
Part of why we're
here at Google today

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:31.970
is our collaboration with
Alex Filippenko and the Lick

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:32.570
Observatory.

00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:36.430
We have a graduate
student here from there,

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:38.880
who's been doing research
up at Lick Observatory.

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:45.200
We also run a teacher workshop,
where teachers actually observe

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.180
the night sky using telescopes.

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:50.220
And then they download their
data and analyze that data,

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.780
so that they know what is
the scientific process like.

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:55.420
And that's really to
help one of our visions

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:59.150
for the world, which is that
people develop and sustain

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:02.250
the ability to think critically
using observation evidence.

00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:05.552
It's really important
to all of us.

00:52:05.552 --> 00:52:07.260
This is a picture from
energy of the sun.

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:10.680
We worked with also teachers to
teach them about electricity,

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.480
and magnetism, and
the dynamic sun

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.140
that I was showing
you about earlier.

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:18.230
So here they are making,
basically with solar panels.

00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:22.590
And that's been a
very successful model.

00:52:22.590 --> 00:52:25.860
Here are our undergraduates
that come and do

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:29.130
research projects with our lab.

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:33.150
So we have many, many different
labs within our space sciences

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:33.710
lab.

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:37.420
And we have undergrads come up
and do research in those labs

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.920
to support the research
being done there.

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.490
And this is our
last year's cadre.

00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:43.910
And then we have some
of the undergrads

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:45.350
from this year here too.

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:46.850
And a lot of these
undergrads come

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:48.900
from community colleges
in the Bay Area,

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.830
or around the United States.

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:59.450
So a lot of time, they're
saving money in order

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:02.790
to get into the state schools.

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:08.680
But this way they can launch
their career in sometimes

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:10.640
a limited resource
environment, and then

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:15.020
come into the system,
the pipeline--

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:17.180
I guess they would use that
word-- towards science.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:21.160
So we're here to support them
and their different worldviews.

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:24.000
Here, where we do work
with NASA satellites,

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000
our lab works a lot with that.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.520
So here Nancy, Nancy Mary.

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.630
I guess you all
see him over here.

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:36.450
Here, Nancy and I are doing a
webcast from the Maven launch.

00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:41.150
So Maven launched
in November 2013

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:43.507
from the cape down in Florida.

00:53:43.507 --> 00:53:45.090
And we were there
doing a live webcast

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:48.310
to some of these schools
with Navajo kids.

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:51.120
And so we talked about some of
these concepts at the launch.

00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.450
And then they got to see
the launch afterwards.

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:56.720
And then this is an
example of a curriculum

00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:00.820
we're developing to bring these
two worldviews for students.

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:04.680
So students who are
Navajo, or Caucasian,

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:08.690
and I think Hispanic as
well, are in these classes

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:11.260
so that you can
go into your class

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:13.080
and you see a little
piece of your culture

00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:15.820
somewhere along the curriculum,
so you don't feel so much

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:20.696
like, where am I in this,
which I think a lot of people,

00:54:20.696 --> 00:54:23.320
if they're not from the dominant
culture, that's how they feel.

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.430
I certainly did,
going through school.

00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:28.600
So this is an example
of some curriculum

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:31.830
that we're working in
collaboration on, David, Nancy,

00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:34.500
and I, and some
teachers as well.

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:37.340
So I'm going to pass this.

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.990
NANCY MARYBOY:
OK, in this one, I

00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:40.240
think we might have mentioned.

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.490
We built a planetarium show.

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:43.130
We were funded by NASA.

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:45.580
And for five years,
we've been working on it.

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:48.130
It's done now, and
we're going to be

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:50.390
putting it out and selling it.

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:55.400
We worked with this Brian
Mendez from Multiverse.

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.960
And we did the Navajo part,
and he did the Western part.

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:03.250
And so it's a series of modules
of Navajo astronomy and then

00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:05.120
comparative Western astronomy.

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:07.610
So if you're looking
at Orion and talking

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.490
about Orion in Navajo
terms, and then

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:15.580
you could be talking about it as
what it is in Greek mythology,

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.160
and as a birthplace for stars.

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:21.490
And we worked with
Hubble Telescope people

00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:23.830
to show what was
beyond, if you looked

00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:25.690
in the direction of a
Navajo constellation,

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:29.680
what else was out there that
could be seen by telescope?

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:34.120
And so we're just
about done with a book

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.880
now on it explaining
about Navajo astronomy

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:38.580
and the constellations.

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:40.990
And so we take it around.

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:43.320
We have a portable
planetarium, and we take it

00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.610
around to different museums
and different schools.

00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:47.450
And right, now
we're developing--

00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:48.860
it's a step backwards.

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:51.370
We're really developing
it back into a flat screen

00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:56.180
show from the dome
360 degree show,

00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:58.690
so that teachers that
don't have access

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:00.800
to a portable
planetarium, or even

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.290
could go to a planetarium,
and lots of people

00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:06.060
out in rural areas
or on reservations,

00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:09.770
so that they can show
it on a big flat screen.

00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:12.150
So it's almost like a step
backward in technology,

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:18.310
but we noticed that a lot of
the big developers of these dome

00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:20.440
shows are also stepping
back and starting

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:21.850
to make it more accessible.

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:27.760
We also have a project called
the Cosmic Serpent that we

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.190
had for about four years.

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:34.240
And we worked with about,
oh, maybe 43 museums, mostly

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:38.190
science centers, Exploratorium
was one here in this area.

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:43.440
And we worked with about 160,
70 different professionals.

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:48.572
It was professional development
for a week long workshop

00:56:48.572 --> 00:56:51.030
to talk about the kind of things
we're talking about today,

00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:54.810
what are native ways of knowing,
what are Western science ways?

00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:56.250
How can they come together?

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:58.130
How can they enhance each other?

00:56:58.130 --> 00:57:00.000
What are the
pitfalls, challenges,

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.530
and the great expectations that
can come out of some of this?

00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:06.980
So the fellow up there with
his hand up in the air, Kaimana

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:11.540
Barcarse, he's been one of
the key people on the Hawaiian

00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:15.970
around the world voyages, where
they're taking Hawaiian canoes,

00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:20.830
and they have rediscovered
how to navigate by the stars,

00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:22.720
and by the waves,
and by the birds,

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:26.300
and by the fish, and old,
traditional ways of navigation.

00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.670
And they're actually taking one
of the canoes around the world

00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:30.620
as we speak.

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:32.850
It's just a phenomenal thing.

00:57:32.850 --> 00:57:34.730
So he's talking
about the compass

00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:36.790
and how they do
their navigation.

00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:41.560
And so it all comes
back to observation

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:45.340
of what's around you,
and where you want go.

00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:47.340
DR. LAURA PETICOLAS: So
this is another project.

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:51.090
When we did Cosmic Serpent,
we had educators come together

00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:54.190
into week long workshops
away from their institutions.

00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:57.030
And many went back and were
successful in implementing

00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:59.860
programs built on the
relationships they had built

00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:02.010
at these museums,
at these workshops

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:05.400
with their native colleagues,
or with their science education

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:06.170
colleagues.

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:08.430
But some went back to their
institutions and said,

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:11.760
we have no support for this
work at our institution.

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.740
And we're so excited about it.

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.820
We understand what
you've taught us,

00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:19.560
but we really need some help
working with the culture

00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:21.810
within our institution itself.

00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:23.260
So this was NSF.

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:24.050
Is is.

00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:25.420
We still have it going.

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:28.660
It's a collaboration
between IEI and Multiverse,

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:34.040
but also the Imiloa
Astronomy Center over on Hilo

00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:37.040
on the big island of Hawaii.

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:41.350
And Ka'iu Kimura
is our other co-PI,

00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:44.350
so you can imagine
her sitting here.

00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:47.840
So what we did is we
chose three museums that

00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:48.910
were ready for this.

00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:50.750
So their CEOs were ready.

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:51.760
They said, yes, please.

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:55.361
We'd like to work with our
local native communities.

00:58:55.361 --> 00:58:57.860
So those were Oregan Museum of
Science and Industry, Arizona

00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:01.220
sonora Desert Museum, and
Durango Discovery Museum.

00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:03.160
And we worked with
those three museums

00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:04.810
to do a nine month residency.

00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:06.760
So our team went in
and worked with them

00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:09.400
very intensely for nine months.

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.900
Sometimes, at a
week at a time, we'd

00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:13.840
be there, and have
the whole museum

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:16.800
open to learning about
some of these ideas,

00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:20.800
and how can we talk about
environmental change, not only

00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:22.930
from the ecosystem
perspective but also

00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:26.792
from the indigenous perspective?

00:59:26.792 --> 00:59:30.170
And here we are in Mauna Kea.

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:33.240
All right, so our
last few minutes,

00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:37.280
we're going to show
a few impacts here.

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.650
all our programs are
evaluated externally.

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:42.260
So this is one of our external
evaluators, Jill Stein.

00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:43.900
She's fabulous.

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:47.229
And they show whether
or not we're successful.

00:59:47.229 --> 00:59:49.270
And for the most part,
we've been very successful

00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:52.490
meeting our goals
and objectives.

00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:55.130
Here's one of our teen
programs, Carmen Zheng,

00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:58.570
She's now an astrophysicist.

00:59:58.570 --> 01:00:00.460
She's back there.

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.980
She's not an astrophysicist yet.

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.440
She's an undergrad
at UC Berkeley.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.260
But when we first met, her she
was in 10th grade, I think.

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:08.950
10th grade.

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:11.880
And she's back here
by the computer.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:15.840
And she wrote a
testimony for us.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.370
And she said, with every
solar powered fountain

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:20.740
and other exhibit I
built, presentation about

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:23.700
auroras I made, and even riding
a train for the first time

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:26.580
to travel to another state
to see a solar eclipse,

01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:29.000
I knew my Multiverse
internship program had not only

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.020
rekindled a passion, but
it had reopened my window

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.180
to the stars.

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.930
I discovered my future.

01:00:34.930 --> 01:00:36.890
And sure enough, she
got into UC Berkeley,

01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:40.780
and she's now actually,
I think, a sophomore

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:43.780
in the astronomy
department at UC Berkeley.

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:46.440
We work with these
teachers as I showed you.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.780
I will use Eye on
the Sky majorly

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:54.240
in constructing a national, next
generation science standards

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.750
aligned unit on astronomy.

01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:56.610
Thank you.

01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:58.790
This was extraordinarily
high quality training.

01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:01.000
Truly fun activities
are easy to follow.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.750
So the other one was
my teen [INAUDIBLE],

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.940
this Ruth [? Paliorani ?]
was reading that.

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:09.420
I will wait to retire until
after funding for this NASA

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.190
magnetometer program has ended.

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:13.500
Vic [? Trautman, ?] he
has still not retired.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.950
He's like five years
past retirement,

01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:18.630
but he's still hanging
on strong, because we

01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:19.840
keep getting funding for it.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.048
And we'll talk a little bit
about funding and funding

01:01:22.048 --> 01:01:22.879
possibilities.

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:24.170
NANCY MARYBOY: End of our hour.

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:26.300
Yeah, we've had a
lot of good comments.

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:30.390
You might wonder how
the evaluation came out

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:34.520
with the native students
seeing it, the Navajo Sky Show.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.140
And they were very excited.

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:38.690
Most of them didn't know
they had an astronomy.

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:41.080
And we're very excited about it.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.670
Teachers are very
excited about it,

01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:45.030
because it gives them
another curriculum to teach.

01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:47.480
There's a protocol that
goes with it that you only

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:50.050
tell these kinds of star
stories in the winter.

01:01:50.050 --> 01:01:53.220
So what we have
done is to encourage

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:57.490
people that use our materials
to use them more in the winter.

01:01:57.490 --> 01:01:59.440
So we've gotten some
very encouraging,

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.290
wonderful evaluations.

01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:04.750
And we've gotten a lot of
support from the Navajo Nation

01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:06.230
on this too.

01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:08.140
DR. LAURA PETICOLAS:
But this is just one

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:11.820
of our participants in our
Cosmic Serpent workshop,

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:15.330
just talking about how it went.

01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:17.320
And then here, I think,
this is Larry Campbell.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.150
He's a tribal historic
preservation officer

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:23.460
in the Swinomish Indian tribe
that's up in Washington state.

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.230
I really like this last part.

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:27.290
It is, the work we're
doing is an important part

01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:30.410
of the overall strategy to
bring people together rather

01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:33.870
than divide us by leaving out
crucial voices in this effort.

01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:37.620
So you see, today, we
did this talk together,

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.170
because I can't speak
for David and Nancy.

01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:41.660
I learned so much from them.

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:46.170
I can speak from my own Western
European American culture.

01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:48.200
And I can speak for
my scientific culture,

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.774
but I can't speak from
the Navajo culture.

01:02:50.774 --> 01:02:51.440
I don't know it.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.606
I don't know that knowledge.

01:02:52.606 --> 01:02:56.412
And I know some things, but
still, it's not mine to share.

01:02:56.412 --> 01:02:58.120
NANCY MARYBOY: Let me
just say one thing.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.420
Larry Campbell's on our
board, and what I just

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.450
wanted to tell you is that
as a result of the Cosmic

01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:07.140
Serpent, he and a young
Ph.D. Student-- I mean,

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:13.100
she's got her Ph.D-- they're
doing about a research project

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:16.000
in a Swinomish reservation.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.220
And it's on toxins
in the shellfish

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:21.330
there that are part of
their traditional foods.

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:24.930
It's funded by NSF now,
and so this is all growing.

01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:27.990
And he's quitting his job as
tribal historic preservation

01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:32.390
officer and being a partner
with the Jamie Donatudo,

01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:33.830
the Ph.D. candidate.

01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:37.170
So it's really fun seeing
even on the native side

01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:38.750
and the non-native
side, how this

01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:41.680
is opening up and spreading,
and people are growing,

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:46.650
and going on to new projects
with this collaboration

01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:48.140
as their igniter.

01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:54.860
DR. LAURA PETICOLAS: OK, so
that's the end of our talk.

01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:57.298
Are there any questions?

01:03:57.298 --> 01:03:59.768
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:07.680
So as a science fiction
enthusiast, and I too

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.350
read so much science
fiction growing up,

01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:11.950
it really inspired me,
so the question, then,

01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:15.790
is there maybe an analogy
between our reading

01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:17.600
of science fiction
and being inspired

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:21.330
by science and storytelling
in the native communities

01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:23.220
and that inspiration
towards science?

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.095
Did I get that right?

01:04:24.095 --> 01:04:25.451
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:04:25.451 --> 01:04:28.300
NANCY MARYBOY: Well, we can
both try to answer that.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:33.250
For one thing, storytelling, the
story goes directly to a point.

01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:36.210
And so you can get a point
across through a story

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:38.090
that you might not
be able to get across

01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:40.150
with a long,
lengthy explanation.

01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:45.480
And that painting we have of the
coyote throwing up the stars,

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:48.810
Astec, which is the Association
of Science and Technology

01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:53.130
Centers, asked us to write an
article, our collaboration,

01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:55.630
about the value of
storytelling and science.

01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:59.640
And that was the focal
point of the whole issue.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.570
And they put that on the cover.

01:05:01.570 --> 01:05:04.560
And that one day I was
walking around the Astec area,

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.120
and they said, and I spotted
it, and the whole thing had

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.360
been translated into Chinese.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.570
We were trying to find a
picture of that for this,

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:15.060
but we couldn't find it in time.

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:17.060
So it was like the coyote
was throwing it up,

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.740
and everything in the
magazine, including the name,

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:21.710
was in Chinese.

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:23.900
But we do know that
Navajos themselves

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.080
are getting really excited.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.560
So they've done
I've they've done

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.190
several really cool little
films on Navajos going to Mars

01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:33.510
and including part
of the culture in it.

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:37.867
And when Laura said we're going
to be working with Mars now,

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:39.950
and I thought, geez, I
don't know much about Mars.

01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:41.960
So I started reading these
science fiction books

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.180
by Ben Bova.

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:46.610
And the hero is a
Navajo astronaut.

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:49.770
So there's a whole spin-off on
these kinds of things going on.

01:05:49.770 --> 01:05:53.730
And it's really fun and
engages Navajo students,

01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:56.740
and other cultures' students,
and just about anybody,

01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:00.010
because it shows
that everybody's

01:06:00.010 --> 01:06:01.190
fascinated by space.

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:04.070
That's why David
and I do this, what

01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:05.310
we do with Navajo astronomy.

01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:09.280
It's a way in for kids, because
they love space so much.

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.740
And we've all grown
up in generations

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:13.485
that are really
fascinated by space,

01:06:13.485 --> 01:06:15.030
and "Star Wars", and all that.

01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:16.725
So it really is a
great way to go in,

01:06:16.725 --> 01:06:18.120
and stories are a wonderful way.

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:22.020
And that's how the Navajo
stories, transmitted

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:25.850
in the winter, in the houses,
and they would act out

01:06:25.850 --> 01:06:31.430
the stories with song and
with animal songs that

01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:34.190
described the animal
voices, and all of this.

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:39.420
That was how, through story,
and they sing about these things

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:42.050
too, that was how this
knowledge was passed down.

01:06:42.050 --> 01:06:44.040
So it's pretty
natural that now it's

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:47.060
going into films and
all these other ways.

01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:54.910
DAVID BEGAY: Yeah, I think
that a lot of these stories

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:59.010
are very comical
at the same time.

01:06:59.010 --> 01:07:06.590
There's one story that people
refer to as in-law stories.

01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:09.820
The mother-in-law
and the son-in-law

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:11.080
shouldn't see each other.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:16.290
There's always conflicts and
complications that can happen.

01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:19.110
And anyway, it's a story.

01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:21.670
Everybody laughs,
and the teaching

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:24.100
that comes from this story
is that you will never

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:30.340
see Orion and Scorpius in
the sky at the same time,

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:34.730
because they're at different
places during the season.

01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:38.550
You will never see it in
the sky at the same time.

01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:40.280
And so that's the teaching.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:44.560
So on the one hand, it's a
story everybody laughs about.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:48.940
But out of that story
is these constellations,

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.350
you will never see it.

01:07:51.350 --> 01:07:55.856
That's real observational
information.

01:07:55.856 --> 01:07:59.470
NANCY MARYBOY: Yeah, and one
more thing about these stories.

01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:03.910
The Navajo constellations
were put up there

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:07.390
with stories and values
on how to live a really

01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:09.630
proper and orderly life.

01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:11.130
And then when you
start comparing

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:13.990
the Greeks' constellations,
which were about incest,

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:18.020
and violence, and murder,
they're really wild.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:21.000
So they used their astronomy
for different reasons,

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.680
and Navajos used theirs
for different reasons.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.990
But it's really about teaching.

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:28.290
All the stars, all the
constellations, the sun,

01:08:28.290 --> 01:08:31.270
and the moon have
great teaching values.

01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:34.200
And those kinds of things
are pretty known all

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.359
around reservations today.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:39.435
So it's just a different
use of stars and stories.

01:08:41.664 --> 01:08:43.080
DR. LAURA PETICOLAS:
It reminds me

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.479
when you were
saying that too, we

01:08:44.479 --> 01:08:48.930
work with some native youth,
who are either a high schooler

01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:50.450
or are in college.

01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:53.870
And one of them, Kyle
Swimmer, he was talking.

01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:57.220
So he was told these teaching,
some of his own teachings.

01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.600
He's a Laguna Pueblo.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:03.109
And he was taught some of
these teachings, some teachings

01:09:03.109 --> 01:09:07.029
and stories about the sun and
how it moves on the horizon.

01:09:07.029 --> 01:09:10.329
And he said once--
he was talking to us

01:09:10.329 --> 01:09:13.800
and he said, he would
spend part of our projects,

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.600
and we'd talk a lot about
the sun, because we're

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.500
solar scientists, and
aurora scientists,

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.080
and so we were
talking about the sun

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:24.590
and how it comes up in
different places every day

01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:26.430
around the seasons,
and where it does,

01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:30.140
and the distance between
the rising of the sun.

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:32.092
And he looked at
us and he said--

01:09:32.092 --> 01:09:33.270
[GASP]

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:36.490
I understand the story.

01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:41.270
So they had talked about how the
sun moves faster in the summer,

01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:47.074
I think, during the equinoxes
than in the solstices.

01:09:47.074 --> 01:09:48.740
And he realized now
that what they meant

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:53.220
is that when it's coming up, it
comes up closer to each other.

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:57.830
And so he could put this story
that had this knowledge in it

01:09:57.830 --> 01:10:01.170
to the physics and
the observation

01:10:01.170 --> 01:10:04.240
from the Western
teachings as well.

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.470
So he talks a lot about how
these two teachings help

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:10.350
him to understand the world.

01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:13.070
MALE SPEAKER: OK, so let's
thank our guests, Laura, David,

01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:14.520
and Mary.
