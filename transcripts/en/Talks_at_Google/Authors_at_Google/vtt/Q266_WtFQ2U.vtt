00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.370
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Okay.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.370
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.360
It's my pleasure to welcome you here today
to our Authors at Google series.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.009
Welcome to everyone here in person, and everyone
on webcast as well.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.700
I'm Bradley Horowitz, head of Product for
Google+.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.350
It's my pleasure to introduce David Weinberger.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.640
David has one of those resumes and CVs that
just goes on and on.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.630
I'm going to pluck out a few highlights so
you know-- to remind you why you're here.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.240
He's the co-author of the bestseller the Cluetrain
Manifesto, which Information Week called the

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.289
most important business book since Tom Peters'
In Search of Excellence.

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.829
He's also the author of Small Pieces Loosely
Joined: A Unified Theory of the Web, and the

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.100
author of Everything is Miscellaneous: The
Power of the New Digital Disorder.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.760
You have a knack, sir, for titling your books.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.829
I think these are wonderful and intriguing.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.230
He's also a senior researcher at Harvard's
Berkman Center for Law.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.609
He's the co-director of the Harvard Library
Innovation Lab at Harvard Law School and is

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.000
a Franklin fellow at the United States State
Department.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.210
He's a frequent advisor, commentator on NPR
and other news organizations.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.190
He wrote gags for Woody Allen's comic strip
for seven years.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.120
He notes that this raises expectations he
will not meet in the talk you're about to

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.120
hear.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.120
[laughs] He has a Ph.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.250
D. in philosophy from the University of Toronto
and taught philosophy for six years.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.310
And on and on.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.730
The way that I think about David's work is
to think about the parallel to athletics.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.920
There are some people who are just blessed.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.750
They're born six foot one and can throw a
100 mile an hour fastball.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.670
When you pair these people with someone who's
an expert in biomechanics and can actually

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.340
teach them about fast twitch muscle fibers
and air resistance and things like that, it

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.600
will take the already good and make them great.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.660
All of us here at Google, you're exceptional.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.490
You're here because you're the best at what
you do.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.930
We train each other and become steeped in
our Googley principles.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.360
Then great things happen.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.810
The way I think of David's work: he's part
sociologist, part anthropologist, part social

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.499
psychologist, economics-- what else?-- journalist.

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:25.760
All of this is mixed in.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.109
What he does is he holds up a mirror to the
work that we're doing.

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:31.250
He helps us better understand ourselves.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.000
He frames it in ways that are valuable in
understanding our own work.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.560
That's my experience, always, when I read
his books.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.519
I end up with a better appreciation for my
own work.

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.700
Things that I did and took for granted are
not reframed in ways that I can better understand

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.950
myself.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.330
I really encourage you all to read his works,
to pay attention today.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.930
Without further ado, I want to welcome to
the stage David Weinberger.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.430
[applause]

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.849
&gt;&gt;David Weinberger: What a great introduction,
which I can't live up to.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.629
Thank you very much.

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:16.079
It's especially delightful to me to have this
coming from you, Bradley, where we haven't

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.829
seen each other in a few years.

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.840
In the five minutes we had coming up here,
we already had a conversation that changed

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.549
my mind about a couple of things.

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.680
[laughs] Typical of Google and of Bradley.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:39.349
I do want to talk about the topics in this
book.

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:45.079
In particular, a question that I think has
become pretty pressing, which is this bizarre

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:52.469
phenomenon, unexpected phenomenon, that the
most important pillars of our culture, especially

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:57.519
when it comes to knowledge, have started to
just fall over, fall apart.

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:58.519
Whether it's encyclopedias--.

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.549
Encyclopedias, besides being an actual collection
of knowledge, were, for many years, the sign

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.579
of your home's commitment to knowledge, if
you had the encyclopedia in your house.

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.819
And suddenly, it's just gone!

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.450
They're not gone, but you know what I mean.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.090
As a cultural reference.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.739
Newspapers: obviously also getting aggregated
and getting reaggregated.

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.889
Libraries, which are very much--.

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.160
Every librarian is wondering, "What's going
to happen to libraries?"

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.360
And nobody knows.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.520
We just don't know.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.120
This core institution in our culture, of knowledge.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.610
We don't know what's going to happen.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.920
It's pretty amazing to be living in these
times.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.889
These changes have occurred because of what,
in some sense, is a really small technology:

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:43.920
because of hyperlinks.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.920
Little hyperlinks.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.520
This little bit of code, --granted, embedded
into much a bigger system, but nevertheless--

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.620
this little bit of technology just pings against
these mighty institutions of knowledge, and

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.189
the institutions fall over.

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:01.949
This is unexpected, and it's certainly worth
asking, "Why?"

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.490
I am not going to be able to answer that question,
but I want to talk about it in terms of--.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:13.610
In particular, knowledge as an institution,
which is a peculiarly important, it is a key

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.250
institution, knowledge is, in our culture.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.020
I'm only talking about the West and western
knowledge, by the way.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.099
In large part because--.

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:26.270
If you look at this quote from Senator Daniel
Moynihan, it's a quote that's coming up more

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.569
and more these days.

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:29.720
It makes a certain promise.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.590
This is the promise of knowledge in the West
for the past 2500 years: "Everyone is entitled

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.300
to his own opinion, not his own facts."

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.580
That's a very cool expression, really nicely
put.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.110
I think we respond to it, these days, because
it offers some comfort, some very traditional

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.680
comfort, that "Yes, we all disagree and there
are fights all over the place, but if we could

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.009
just sit down and focus on the facts, then
we can come to agreement.

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.530
We can live together in agreement."

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.909
That has been the promise of knowledge from
the beginning, from the Greek beginnings 2500

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:03.909
years ago.

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:11.379
That we will be able, that knowledge will
enable us, to live together across our differences.

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:14.020
Really quick trip through what knowledge was.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.830
You know all of this.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:23.270
We thought about knowledge as a picture of
the world that we build up point by point,

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.270
brick by brick.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.509
We do this across generations.

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.000
If you work hard, you might be able to contribute
a brick or two to this picture of the world

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.860
that we've been creating.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.199
This is a picture in which each piece is nailed
down.

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:36.389
We're nailing down stuff.

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:41.400
I know I'm mixing metaphors like crazy, but--.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.490
Finally, we're able to do this because in
the great rush of sensation or the great mix

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.770
of mere opinion, which is where the concept
of knowledge originally began with the Greeks:

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.710
so many opinions you have to figure out which
ones are worth holding on to, which ones are

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.830
true and worthy of belief.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.759
We're able to do this because we go through
these streams and we pan for gold.

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:05.569
Yes, four metaphors in under a minute.

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:09.680
That knowledge is relatively scarce, that
most of what we see is not knowledge.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.680
It's wrong.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.830
It's illusion, it's opinion, it's mere sensation.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.620
Knowledge is the real stuff that we are able
to filter out.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.789
That's been the project of knowledge in our
culture.

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:22.720
From the beginning, it has recognized and
tried to deal with the fact that the world

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.340
is obviously way, way, way, way bigger than
what can fit into anybody's skulls.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.560
The Greeks knew this.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.220
We know this all the way through our history.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.560
The world is much bigger.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.120
Our knowledge gets much bigger.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.710
Our skulls don't get much bigger.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.710
That's a real problem.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.040
How do we small creatures know the world?

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.979
We adopted, in the West, a particular strategy,
which is, to put this crudely, to reduce what

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:47.129
there is to know so that our brains can manage
it.

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:49.180
Our brains collectively can manage it.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:55.409
One of the more prominent techniques has been
to break off brain-sized chunks of the world

00:07:55.409 --> 00:08:02.770
and to allow somebody to master that chunk,
to dominate that chunk, and become an expert.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.699
Then we can go to the expert when we have
a question, or go to the expert's book, and

00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:08.139
we can ask the expert a question.

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:13.289
We can get an answer and we can move on because
it's been answered.

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:14.380
This is a hugely--.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:19.830
And if we were not sure if we trust the expert,
then we can look up her or his credentials

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.300
and move on.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.870
"Oh, I didn't know you have a degree from
wherever."

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:25.870
This works.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:26.870
This system absolutely works.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.840
It's made us the dominant species on the planet.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.639
It's incredibly efficient.

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:35.659
But it is primarily constructed as a system
of stopping points.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:39.159
You've asked the expert, and the efficiency
of the system is, assuming the credential

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.269
is acceptable, you don't have to ask any more.

00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:43.269
You got your answer.

00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:44.269
You can move on.

00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:45.269
You don't have to repeat the experiment.

00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:47.610
You don't have to go look at the primary research.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.610
The expert told you.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.600
You are right, generally, of course, to rely
upon genuine experts.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.730
But this is a system about creating a set
of stopping points so that we can manage in

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.050
a world that is just way, way too big otherwise.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.550
So it works.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.480
It's a fantastic system.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.010
It's an amazing system.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.510
But it's not what knowledge is.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.700
It's what knowledge is when its medium is
paper.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.910
This is--.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.660
[pause] Paper is itself a stopping point.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:17.930
It's just the way that it is.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.450
You can't click on the page and get to the
next source.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.370
It has footnotes, you're in a book and you're
reading and there's a footnote.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.450
So there are obviously connections out to
the world.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.250
We know books are written by people who are
deeply involved in social networks.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.250
All that's true.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:36.800
But the book itself, as the medium of knowledge,
is a hugely disconnected and disconnective

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.630
medium.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.250
There's the footnote.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.180
You don't pursue footnotes.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.980
It's very rare that anybody actually uses
the footnote as a link, because it means getting

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.070
on a bus and going to the local library and
hoping that they'll have the work.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.070
And they probably won't.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.680
If they do, it's probably out.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:00.540
Meanwhile, it's very expensive to get past
the disconnected nature of books.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.790
So our idea of knowledge is actually, unsurprisingly,
it's completely a McLuhan thing.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:10.500
It's unsurprisingly a reflection of the nature
of its medium.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.500
Disconnected medium.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.500
You have a book and you're an author.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.399
You've got to try to put everything into the
book that the reader needs, because you know

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:20.260
the reader's not easily going to be able to
hop out of the book and continue.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:28.120
We have a sense of knowledge that comes directly
from books, but it's not knowledge in itself.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.610
It's not knowledge's own nature.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.330
It's what knowledge looks like in books.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.120
But now, of course, we have this different
medium.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.889
It's hugely, hugely connected.

00:10:35.889 --> 00:10:38.829
You can think about links as being a new type
of punctuation.

00:10:38.829 --> 00:10:42.610
The old type tells you where to stop, links
tell you how to continue, and provide you

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.610
the means.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:48.100
The smallest possible click of the human finger,
and you've now done the thing that otherwise

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:53.900
requires books and old card catalogues in
the old days, and crawling through shelves.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.350
We have a hugely connected medium, which is
fantastic, obviously.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.980
But there are also issues.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:05.750
So my hypothesis is that knowledge is taking,
just as it took on the properties of its old

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.480
medium, it's now taking on properties of the
new medium.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:14.130
I want to look at four of those properties.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.100
The first is, obviously, it's too much.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:24.000
The old paper-based medium: very restricted
in how much could be output or stored.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.020
Now: no.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.470
It's way, way too much stuff.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:35.380
Clay Shirky said recently, and put it brilliantly,
as he tends to do-- oh, Clay-- that "There's

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.470
no such thing as information overload.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.490
There's only filter failure."

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.490
Brilliant way of putting it.

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:49.570
He's trying to provide us with some comfort,
historical comfort, some historical continuity.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:53.000
I think he's basically saying, "Don't freak
out.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.790
We've always, in our history, have at times
felt overloaded by information, and we know

00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:59.790
what to do about it.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.399
We fix our filters."

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:05.000
I think he's absolutely right to give us this
sense of continuity, but I want to point to

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.610
two discontinuities, which I think Clay will
probably be okay with, but I'll let him speak

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:10.610
for himself.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:18.070
I also want to-- Just a shout out to Ann Blair,
who makes the same point in a book that came

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.440
out six months before my book, which is Too
Big to Know.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.589
Hers is called Too Much to Know.

00:12:22.589 --> 00:12:24.430
Just one of those things.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:31.959
Hers is a very scholarly and interesting look
at what happened to information in the age

00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:32.959
of Gutenberg.

00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:36.410
It's actually a little broader than that,
but it's looking very carefully at what information

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:41.420
overload actually was, and what the filters
were.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.210
The term "information overload" itself came
to prominence through Alvin Toffler's book

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:47.610
Future Shock, 1970.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:57.370
Very good book in which he models the term
on the prior term, which was "sensory overload."

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.400
He did not come up with the term.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.699
Sensory overload is 1950s, the idea which
was that your senses get overwhelmed at a

00:13:04.699 --> 00:13:05.730
Grateful Dead concert.

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.649
There's too many lights and sounds and music
and people pushing in on you.

00:13:09.649 --> 00:13:14.009
That can cause your sensory circuits to blow
and you will fall down as a quivering mass

00:13:14.009 --> 00:13:15.490
with your eyes rolled back in your head.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:19.130
It was an individual psychological syndrome.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.759
Same thing once we decided for whatever reason,
which I don't understand but actually am quite

00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:27.750
interested in, that brains are information
processors, which let's not get started on.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.790
But once you decided that, then of course
there has to be the equivalent thing, which

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:35.320
is information overload, with the same sort
of effect: too much information and you will

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.700
fall down and be a quivering mass, irrational
mass.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:45.589
In fact, Toffler says that "Sanity itself
hangs upon avoiding information overload."

00:13:45.589 --> 00:13:47.899
It's very much an individual symptom.

00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:51.920
A problem that happens that strikes you as
an individual.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.060
What did information overload look like in
1974?

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:04.139
Some marketers did some research, investigating,
in which they gave 192 housewives 16 brands,

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:08.500
each of which had 16 different categories
of information.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:16.069
They discovered, these marketing researchers,
that with that much information, [pause] the

00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:19.199
quality of the housewives' decisions went
down.

00:14:19.199 --> 00:14:22.750
This was information overload: 16 brands,
16 categories.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:26.730
The poor housewives had to be protected from
this much information, which was the conclusion.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:33.050
"Therefore, we're doing the housewives a favor
by not taxing them with that much information."

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:36.860
But we look at this now, and this is like
a joke.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.430
This is laughable.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.440
That's what information overload is? 16 brands,
16 categories?

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:47.160
I mean-- Yes, that is what information overload
looked like.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:53.699
It has gone, in the past, since 1970 when
the term came to prominence, from an problem

00:14:53.699 --> 00:14:58.519
for an individual, that you will fall down
quivering, to simply being not only scaled

00:14:58.519 --> 00:15:00.680
up, but just a feature of the environment.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.959
It's not a complaint about an individual,
it's about our culture.

00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:05.769
There's information overload.

00:15:05.769 --> 00:15:09.610
When people complain about information overload,
they don't say, "Oh, I feel a seizure coming

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.610
on.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.269
Somebody put a piece of wood between my teeth
so I don't swallow--."

00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:17.410
They are, instead, really saying, "I want
more information.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:18.640
I want the right information.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.640
Get me more information.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.880
Hurry, stat.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.950
More information."

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:26.600
Our idea of information overload has shifted
very much.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.000
It is a different concept than we have had
in the past.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.899
[pause]
Second discontinuity in information overload

00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:39.149
is that the nature of filters themselves have
changed.

00:15:39.149 --> 00:15:40.870
You know, sure, there's filter failure.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.269
But filters have changed.

00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:48.829
In the physical world that we all are very
familiar with, when you filter something,

00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:52.940
you filter the other stuff out.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.819
If you are on the acquisitions committee of
your local library, you choose the new books.

00:15:56.819 --> 00:16:00.040
They get put up on the nice shelf in the library.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.040
New books.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.940
Everybody's very happy when they go in and
they see that.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.160
What people don't see is that a million books
are published every year.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:12.069
They don't see the million minus a thousand,
whatever it is, stacked in the sad and lonely

00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:16.829
trucks that are backing away, their hearts
broken, from the library loading bin.

00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:18.459
You do not see that.

00:16:18.459 --> 00:16:22.019
You only see what has been brought forward,
because that's how physical filters work.

00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:26.889
You get rid of, you hide, you dispose of,
or never make available, the stuff that doesn't

00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:28.850
make it through the filter.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.790
The articles that get sent into the-- the
manuscripts that get sent to book publishers

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:36.120
that get rejected, you never see those.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.389
They're filtered out.

00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:40.030
On the web, obviously, we filter differently.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:47.649
When I make my list of top ten science articles
of the week or whatever on my blog, all that

00:16:47.649 --> 00:16:53.190
I'm doing is choosing ten and reducing the
number of clicks that it takes to get to them.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:54.570
I'm not throwing anything out.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.730
I'm not making anything invisible or hiding
anything or rejecting anything.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.240
I'm just simply shortening the number of clicks.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:06.020
All that material that didn't make my top
ten list is still there and will show up in

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.030
the next search that somebody does on some
search engine, for example.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.650
Or it will get passed around in email.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:15.559
Or will be in somebody's social network software.

00:17:15.559 --> 00:17:16.600
Or whatever.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.600
All that stuff is still there.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.600
It's still available.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.790
It may show up.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.169
On the net, we don't filter out, we only filter
forward.

00:17:23.169 --> 00:17:29.390
And furthermore, the search engines are very,
very eager to show us exactly how much is

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.440
there that they aren't showing us on the first
page.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.370
We're now constantly aware of just how much
there is, something that was hidden from us

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:38.370
before.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.540
We filter forward, we're now much more aware
of the overload.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.920
And we seem absolutely fine with it.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:50.530
In part because we don't have to reduce the
world by filtering out, we can enhance it

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.270
by filtering forward.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:59.340
This leads to a new strategy that one sees
adopted all over the place, which is in general,

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.340
include everything.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.340
If you're going to try--.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:05.730
Rather than try to curate a collection, --and
there's tremendous value there, too, of course--

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:10.390
but rather than seeing this as the first alternative,
instead include everything.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:16.030
The economics of deletion obviously have shifted
so that it's often more, it's cheaper to include

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.820
than to exclude.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.490
The problem with building curated collections--
and as I work in a library, I do appreciate

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:27.020
the value of them-- but the problem with them,
with deciding what's going to be in, what's

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.210
going to be out, is that you can never do
that adequately.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:34.990
You cannot anticipate what people are going
to be interested in because we're a crazy,

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.880
squirrelly species and there's no telling
what we're going to be interested in.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.400
If you are curating a news collection and
you decided to keep out of it all the gossipy,

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.990
trashy stuff about celebrities, Lindsay Lohan
and all the rest of it, probably a good decision

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.160
in one sense.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.760
A reasonable decision, in any case.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.630
But you will have just deprived the set of
scholars of the primary materials, the source

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:58.950
materials they need in order to investigate
their topic, which, for example, is the effect

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.350
of media on women celebrities.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:06.960
You will have completely killed this academic
conference about the same topic.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.880
You don't know what's going to be interesting
or important to people.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.730
Furthermore, you can't predict history.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:21.000
Nobody could have predicted that the 1996
records of the library committee in Wasilla

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.110
was actually worth including in some curated
collection, because you could not predict

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.880
what was going to happen in 2008.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.880
Nobody did.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.320
So there are good reasons to try to include
everything where everything is an overstatement,

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.410
but you know what I mean.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:40.580
If you do that, you have to give users ways
of filtering on the way out, according to

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:46.409
what they're interested in and how they think
about how the world is organized.

00:19:46.409 --> 00:19:48.990
So much activity over the past 15 years.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:55.570
You can track the history of the web by watching
the history of how we are learning to filter

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:59.429
large collections for ourselves and for one
another.

00:19:59.429 --> 00:20:03.140
I'm at Google, I'm not going to-- You know
that.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:09.600
Okay, next characteristic of the net that
I think knowledge is picking up is messiness.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.370
We're really good at organizing things.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.810
We've gotten incredibly good at doing it.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.810
And not simply because we want to be able
to find things, though that would be enough.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:23.850
But for most of our history in the past 2500
years, we believe that we are organizing things

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.830
not simply for finding but in order to discover
what they are.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:33.770
To know what something was, in the West, has
been to know where it fits in the order.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:37.770
The order of the universe.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:42.610
If you're Aristotle, you're arranging things
by, --and in the West, we're basically all

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:48.730
Aristotle-- you're trying to figure out how
this is different from the other objects in

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:53.480
its class and how it's the same as--.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.050
And you do this nested hierarchy.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.809
To know what something is is to discover its
position in its hierarchy.

00:20:58.809 --> 00:21:01.809
The order that God established.

00:21:01.809 --> 00:21:06.270
That is our spiritual mission as well, at
least post-Greek.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:13.330
Or it's to see the one logical order, which
is also beautiful, by the way.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.789
The order, truth, and beauty, same thing.

00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:20.640
The order is a thing of magnificent beauty,
and it was our task to discover it.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.100
It wasn't simply a matter of finding.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.360
Well, there's a reason why we thought this
way.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:32.030
I believe it has a lot to do with the fact
that the physical world does work in that

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:33.030
way.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:38.059
That is, when you and your spouse are trying
to figure out how to organize the CDs in your

00:21:38.059 --> 00:21:42.580
collection, and you want to do it alphabetically
and your spouse wants to do it by genre or

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.010
whatever, only one of you can win.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:49.400
Because in the physical world, everything
does have to be in one and only one spot.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.779
You can't have two things in the same spot.

00:21:51.779 --> 00:21:52.890
Atoms.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:53.890
We've dealt with it.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:59.280
We've taken that limitation and we've imported
it into the world of ideas so that we have

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.380
the idea that the order of the universe--.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.280
Also everything has a single spot and there's
only one right order.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.871
In arranging our physical stuff, somebody
had to decide whether Philly Wacko here, who's

00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:17.539
playing cracked avant folk while ranting against
the-- can't read it-- oh, the Broads, who

00:22:17.539 --> 00:22:22.110
wronged him, whether that's actually under
British psych or whether that should be under

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:23.890
acid, visionaries, and weirdos.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.270
I'm sure there's a very intense argument about
this.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:27.510
But somebody had to win.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:31.790
Whereas obviously, digitally, it's a digital
collection: "Well, I'll just make playlists.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.590
We'll have as many as we want, overlaying
them.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.440
We don't have to argue about it anymore."

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.190
Each of these actually exposes some meaning.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:46.260
Now, to think that there is a single order
that says what a bird really is and that it's

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:53.110
worth our time to argue over that, to do that
in a hyperlinked world, a tabbed world, the

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.730
multiclassification and playlisted world?

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.440
It now seems ridiculous!

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.820
It's not an argument we're interested in having
anymore.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:07.280
It just seems [pause] pointless to think there's
got to be one order of the universe.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:12.409
We have this idea that dominated our culture
for millennia, has dropped away.

00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:16.580
If I say to you, "And there is a single order
of the universe, of course", this thing that

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.690
was not only taken for granted but was taken
as human destiny departs.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:24.770
It now seems to you like I'm a crazy guy.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:28.630
There is a very large change.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:33.779
It actually, I think, overall is a wonderful
change, because it turns out that messiness

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:36.070
is how you scale meaning.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:40.240
Multiple playlists, multiple tabs, all piled
up on top one another.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.610
Each one of them has some meaning.

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:46.490
It has some information to contribute.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.040
This is how you scale meaning.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.140
That's what we're doing now.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:53.250
Okay, unsettled.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.690
[pause] Back to Moynihan.

00:23:55.690 --> 00:24:01.990
Remember this idea that we'll all just focus
on the facts and agree and sit down, preferably

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.990
over coffee--.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:06.710
The coffee house ideal from the Enlightenment,
very powerful image.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.500
Sit down, we have a rational conversation.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.929
We can figure this out and we can agree because
there are facts.

00:24:11.929 --> 00:24:13.100
Of course there are facts.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:20.580
But then you go out on the web and every link
expresses some difference between the page

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.990
that you're on and the one that you're being
sent to.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:28.960
Here's a page that expands on what I said
or disagrees or it's funny.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.760
You say, "Why are you sending somebody to
that place?"

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.450
That's where the value of the web is.

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:38.190
Take absurd cases.

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:43.520
If every page was exactly the same, the web
would have negative value.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.280
It's only because it's this web of difference
that the web has value.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:55.410
It's not just difference, it's linked difference,
which is an amazing development that we not

00:24:55.410 --> 00:25:01.370
only have a moment in our history where we're
able to see all the ways we disagree and enhance

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:06.559
one another, the ways that our points of view
are different, those points of view are now

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:08.149
linked.

00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:15.809
Those of you who are fans of Hegel, this is
a wonderful Hegelian moment where [pause]

00:25:15.809 --> 00:25:18.610
it's-- yeah.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:24.140
Here we have these differences that are in
conversation.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.490
Sometimes quite literally in conversation.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:31.060
This is very different than the picture of
the world that Moynihan paints for us and

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.850
that we've had as part of our Enlightenment
ideal.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.280
It really bothers us.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.990
I think there's truth in each of these worries,
each of these fears.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.650
We should be taking them really seriously.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.179
There is truth in them.

00:25:44.179 --> 00:25:50.529
You go out on the web, and what you see is
all of this disagreement.

00:25:50.529 --> 00:25:54.320
Well, I think what's actually happening is
that the net is exposing a truth that we've

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.860
always known in our hearts, but we couldn't
quite acknowledge.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:03.029
We didn't have the environment which made
it possible to acknowledge it, which is, you

00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:05.150
know what, we actually don't agree about anything.

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.390
We don't agree about anything!

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:08.899
There's nothing on the web that is--.

00:26:08.899 --> 00:26:12.080
There's no fact uncontested on the web.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.080
There are facts.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.440
I like science, I like facts.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.620
So I want to be really clear: there are facts.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.990
Some statements are false, and there are people
who lie.

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.470
I totally believe that.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:26.289
My point is is we're not going to agree about
who those people are.

00:26:26.289 --> 00:26:27.289
We're just not.

00:26:27.289 --> 00:26:31.549
It doesn't matter how many facts you bring
to bear.

00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:32.929
Nope!

00:26:32.929 --> 00:26:37.169
There's going to be continuous disagreement,
and there always will be.

00:26:37.169 --> 00:26:43.190
My evidence for saying that is all of human
history, we've never agreed about anything.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.490
Now, we can see that we don't.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:51.419
It is evident before our faces.

00:26:51.419 --> 00:26:53.360
One of the more-- . This is a problem.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.240
One of the more hopeful things, though, is
that we have also been evolving rapidly ways

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:03.880
of dealing with difference and disagreement
that enable us to move forward and in fact

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:07.130
benefit from that disagreement.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:11.789
This is actually a terrible example, but it's
a real example from a couple of days ago.

00:27:11.789 --> 00:27:15.149
There's this YouTube site that famously has
long conversations.

00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:17.170
They're not particularly well threaded conversations.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:21.149
It doesn't seem to be what whoever-- Oh, I
see, sir, you seem have a YouTube sweatshirt

00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:22.149
on.

00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:24.120
You must have been to their offices at some
time.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.190
Those conversational threads at YouTube serve
a different purpose.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:30.220
They're not for long threaded conversations.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.480
Here's the new Batman trailer.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.940
4.5 million views.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:43.870
From about three days ago, there's a thread
of about 30 back and forths about circumcision.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:44.870
It's pretty learned.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:50.150
[laughter] It gets a little nasty, but it's
pretty learned.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:54.270
They're flinging facts back and forth and
so on.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:58.260
It's a little hard to understand exactly how
this got started, and it doesn't matter.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:04.350
The point is that in a different conversational
medium-- At YouTube, it doesn't matter because

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.049
it will just be pushed down, there's such
volume.

00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:10.090
But in a different conversational medium,
there would be a way of forking conversations.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:13.610
Forking is a really powerful tool that's hard
to do in the real world.

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:16.930
It's rude and disruptive to do it in the real
world.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:21.340
But it's usually helpful in the online world
where people are going down, in a very heated

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:24.740
fashion, down some thread that has nothing
to do with the original thread.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.799
A fork takes us somewhere--.

00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:27.799
Continue it.

00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:31.840
Anybody else who would like to continue arguing
about circumcision, please feel free to do

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.840
so.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.070
We're not ending the conversation by any means,
just maybe not on the Batman site.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:38.260
Because we want to talk about something else.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:44.480
Forking is a really powerful tool for enabling
difference to continue without telling people,

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:50.230
"Shut up!" [laughter] which is what we would
do in the real world if that conversation

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:51.230
broke out.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:57.950
The second technique that I think is amazingly
powerful for dealing, not only dealing with

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:01.270
difference but benefiting from it is namespaces.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:07.360
In the 19th century, we spent an awful lot
of time trying to figure out whether that

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.450
thing is--.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:10.450
First of all, is it really a mammal or what
is it?

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.630
And second of all, could it possibly even
exist?

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.970
Because it violated the classification schemes
that we had.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:16.419
It didn't fit into our taxonomy.

00:29:16.419 --> 00:29:19.480
There was very real thought that it must be
a hoax.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:27.300
Even when one was delivered with eggs in it,
it was assumed it must be a hoax because such

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.130
a thing could not exist.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:32.130
We spent a lot of time arguing about how to
classify this.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:39.490
Now, we don't so much because, and other species
and genes as well because, for example, because

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:40.880
we can just set up a namespace.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.870
Say, "Well, okay, I call it a platypus and
I think about it this way.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:45.970
You call it a water mole.

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:50.470
That's fine, so long as I know that what I
call platypus, you call water mole and you

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:51.990
call this thing."

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:58.289
Namespaces are a wonderful way of dealing
with differences.

00:29:58.289 --> 00:30:00.880
At Encyclopedia of Life, they in fact have
two servers.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.880
One--.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:08.440
If you're a scientist who wants some information,
you can use whatever nomenclature you want,

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.659
because they track them all, that they can
find.

00:30:10.659 --> 00:30:12.690
It doesn't matter what you call it.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:13.690
Call if what you want.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.380
That's the least interesting thing about it,
what name you use for it.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:20.929
You can put it within whatever taxonomy you
prefer.

00:30:20.929 --> 00:30:21.929
That's not--.

00:30:21.929 --> 00:30:25.710
And if two scientist want to talk about that
thing, even though they call them something

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.640
different and classify it differently, great.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.429
You can do that because it's namespaces.

00:30:30.429 --> 00:30:33.760
We can coordinate namespaces.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.560
Another way that we are evolving very rapidly
to deal with difference and to benefit from

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:43.840
it is the linked data, which I'm not going
to explain because I'm at Google.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:49.890
But it is, in fact, a way of letting people
release data very easily without having to

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:54.100
worry about getting it classified right in
the uniform way.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.049
No, you do it in some reasonable way.

00:30:56.049 --> 00:31:00.860
You point to disambiguating pages.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:04.850
If somebody does the mapping right, you're
pointing to Encyclopedia of Life, I'm pointing

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.720
to the Tasmanian Field Guide, which I've made
up.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.720
We want to know--.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.630
If we want to enable computers to know that
we're all talking about the same thing, we

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:16.460
can do a mapping and say, "That page in Encyclopedia
of Life, that's really referring to the same

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.669
thing as that page in the Tasmanian Field
Guide."

00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:24.909
It's a really good way of getting past differences
that don't matter so we can collaborate.

00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:26.140
"Yay for difference!

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.130
Difference is wonderful, difference is great."

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:31.250
It is, but.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:36.139
[pause]
This is what the net looks like a little bit.

00:31:36.139 --> 00:31:40.120
As it is, this is what the net looks like
in terms of how we experience it.

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.740
We do seem to tend to want to hang out with
people who are like us.

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:48.149
There's reason to think that this is a human
thing, maybe even a genetic thing, maybe a

00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:49.230
brain thing.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:50.230
But we do it.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:53.789
We like to be with people who are like us.

00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:56.940
This is the echo chamber argument that you're
all familiar with.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:03.539
I just want to spend one slide on the echo
chamber, because I think it's a real issue.

00:32:03.539 --> 00:32:11.440
I am not nearly as convinced, as many others
are, that it is the killer issue that some

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.440
have claimed.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.850
But I do think it's a real issue.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:16.019
The problems with understanding it are--.

00:32:16.019 --> 00:32:19.210
So I say one slide, but I've got lots of words
on this slide.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:20.390
Sorry.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:26.889
The problems are difficult and deep and, I
think, emblematic of a difference about how

00:32:26.889 --> 00:32:32.269
we think about knowledge and conversation,
how knowledge is developed.

00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:39.659
First of all, we don't have a lot of data
that tells us exactly how much, what the diversity

00:32:39.659 --> 00:32:43.399
of sources are that we engage with.

00:32:43.399 --> 00:32:45.600
That's more data.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.899
Part of the problem is, compared to what?

00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:50.510
We want to know if the net is making us more
open or not.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:55.000
The echo chamber argument says, "It's easier
to hang out with people that you like."

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Hanging out with--.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Excuse me.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.630
"People who are like you", which turns out
to be often the same thing.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:03.590
If you hang out with people who are like you
in their beliefs, then you end up reconfirming

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.679
your own beliefs and, in fact, becoming more
extreme in your beliefs.

00:33:06.679 --> 00:33:09.950
If that's the case, the internet is making
us less open.

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:12.910
But the question is: compared to what?

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:16.910
Compared to pre-net, when we had, when I grew
up, three television channels and you had

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.120
a couple of newspapers.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:22.399
The newspapers were this big and reported
a range of opinion that was actually even

00:33:22.399 --> 00:33:24.760
smaller than that?

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.760
Compared to what?

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.850
We don't have a baseline.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:30.730
And we have a romanticized view of what those
days were like.

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:33.870
"Back in the old days, we all read newspapers.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:34.870
Newspapers were full of news."

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:38.779
Well, first of all, A: we didn't, B: we're
reading tabloids, which are full of crap,

00:33:38.779 --> 00:33:42.710
and third of all, we don't know what people
were actually reading in a newspaper.

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:45.150
The New York Times is full of wonderful stories.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:48.450
Most of us read it like this, looking for
a headline that catches our eye.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:52.659
It's not like 15 years ago, we're all studiously
going through every article.

00:33:52.659 --> 00:33:56.669
So it's really not clear what we're comparing
it to.

00:33:56.669 --> 00:34:01.100
Clay Shirky points out that we may even have
the causality wrong.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.990
The echo chamber theorists.

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:05.149
[indistinct] in particular.

00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:06.390
That they may have the causality wrong.

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:11.610
That maybe, in fact, we are becoming more
polarized because we are in more contact with

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:13.250
people with whom we disagree.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:17.110
That causes us to harden our opinions.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:22.460
[pause] There are times in the day when I'm
totally an echo chamber guy.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:27.940
If I'm going onto a site of a politician,
a candidate who I support, I want an echo

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:28.940
chamber.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.260
I need an echo chamber, because that's how
political movements are formed.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.520
If I'm going to a sports site.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:35.750
I don't, but I can imagine.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:39.520
If I went to a sports site, I don't want to
particularly maybe want to hear from everybody

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.731
who hates my team.

00:34:40.731 --> 00:34:41.880
I'm from Boston, so I'll say the Yankees.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:46.400
I don't necessarily want to go to a site where
the Red Sox fans and the Yankees fans are

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.400
always mixing it up.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.200
I want to hang out with Red Sox fans.

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:53.100
It's baseball, right?

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:59.240
[laughter] It's not at all clear how this
varies by education level, if it's there at

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.240
all.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:05.760
By education level, by socioeconomic class,
by topic, by time of day, and the rest of

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.760
it.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.780
But for me, the two more important, when it
comes to knowledge, what's happening in knowledge,

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.040
the two more important points are the next.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:18.580
The first is that the echo chamber argument,
in at least some of its forms, assumes that

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:23.560
the role, the only good conversation is one
where two people who really disagree can sit

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:28.400
down in the Moynihan sense, over some coffee
and a big bowl of facts.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.610
They each say, "I disagree with you, my friend.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:33.270
I'm a Jew, you're a Nazi.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:34.310
I disagree with you.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:35.920
But hey, I respect you.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.130
I respect your opinions.

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.890
And I'm open.

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:40.890
Maybe you're right.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.070
I'm open to being converted.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.070
Let's sit down.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:45.790
Maybe I'll become a Nazi and maybe you'll
become a Jew."

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:46.790
That's a good conversation.

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:49.080
That's a conversation that never happens.

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.080
Never ever.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.080
Never happens.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.850
I'm going to tell you I'm never going to sit
down with a Nazi with an open mind and think,

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:56.850
"Yeah.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:57.860
That's a good point.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.710
You make a good point there, Adolf."

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:00.890
Not going to happen.

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:04.940
It's not how conversation works, nor should
it be how conversation works, except under

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.600
very special circumstances.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:12.560
And so to say, "Well, the web is not full
of these Jew meets Nazi conversations.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.000
That's a failure of the web."

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.190
No, it's not.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:19.751
It's a failure of expectation about humans
and conversation.

00:36:19.751 --> 00:36:21.170
The same thing for--.

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:26.950
It seems to me that the echo chamber argument,
the people who are most worried about it have

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:30.060
a different idea about what conversation is
for.

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.510
Excuse me, how it works.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:35.850
In order for two people to talk, diversity
is wonderful.

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:39.540
Keep in mind, the whole point of this little
subsection I'm trying to make is that knowledge,

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.420
now, can include diversity and difference.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.550
Disagreement within itself.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.840
This is a big change from knowledge, and it's
wonderful.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.510
It's really important.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:52.830
At the same time, in order for two people
to talk, there has to be so much agreement

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:54.750
and so much sameness.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:37:01.120
Same language, interested in at least one
topic they can talk about, enough common assumptions

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:08.090
about how that domain works and what the facts
in that domain are, some sense of the norms

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:12.930
of conversation: who gets to talk, how much,
when you interrupt, all that sort of very

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.660
subtle thing.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.840
Conversation, to be successful, needs to be
99% sameness.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:23.920
I made the number up, but it's overwhelming
sameness, and then very small iterations on

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.950
top of that of difference.

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:27.500
That's a requirement for conversation.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.500
It's also a requirement for the conversation
that you have with the people with whom you're

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.960
working and you want to move the ball forward.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.740
You need an enormous amount of sameness.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.990
The fact that there isn't an enormous amount
of difference in these conversations on the

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:45.580
web is again, not a failure of the conversations
on the web, it's a failure to recognize how

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.720
conversation works.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.590
Now, having said all that, I don't know how
real the echo chamber effect is.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:54.910
I suspect it is in at least some ways very
real.

00:37:54.910 --> 00:38:01.900
But it doesn't actually matter too much whether
we have an exact measure of how damaging it

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:02.900
is.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:09.070
We, I think, should have some confidence that
human beings do prefer to hang out with people

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:14.890
whose beliefs are the same as theirs, that
there is damage that can be done by doing

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:20.020
that, and that there is benefit to opening
ourselves up to more and further types of

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.100
belief.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:25.650
No matter how damaging the echo chamber effect
is, doesn't matter.

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:28.810
We still need to be doing everything we can
to counteract it.

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:32.450
Both personally and institutionally and as
a business.

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:36.150
I will just take the, I'm very happy to be
here.

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:40.040
Nevertheless, the including of--.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:44.750
Running Google's filters through my social
network pretty well ensures I'm going to get

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:48.350
more of the same, when in fact, I would rather--.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:53.040
Speaking as a member of a culture I'm trying
to live in, I would rather have you disturb

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.040
me more.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.570
I do appreciate that there's a button that
allows you to turn off the personalized, so

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.050
I can see.

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:02.280
I would also want you to--.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.730
This is very similar to the long tail argument,
by the way.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:08.530
You want to pull stuff out of the long tail,
and you want to disturb people like me so

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:14.300
I don't get too comfortable in my beliefs
that need challenging.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.760
Okay.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.970
And clearly, it's not simply a Google issue.

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:19.590
Bing does it, and the rest of it.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.250
It's an industry issue.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.320
So.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:28.220
[sighs] Here's Moynihan, here's the promise,
the comfort that we will all come together

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.620
and we will come to agreement and that's what
knowledge is for.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.750
No.

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:37.620
Knowledge is better off because, now, we recognize
that we don't agree and because we are linked

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.750
in those disagreements.

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:42.560
Knowledge is not the thing that is settled
anymore.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.960
It is where this disagreement happens.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.700
I should point out that this quotation, it's
unattributed.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:53.960
We don't know if Moynihan actually said it,
who said it, or what the exact quote is, because

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:59.090
irony remains the fundamental law of the universe.

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:05.120
The fourth and last point is the web's too,
the internet is so scattered, so knowledge

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.420
is getting to scattered.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.960
Well, no.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.720
Books, the opposite of scattered.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.940
They're literally bound together in sequence.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.360
You can not get less scattered than a book.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.200
This has been the medium of knowledge.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:21.520
And from this has come a way of thinking about
how ideas go together, how knowledge, and

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.710
thus how the world itself, because knowledge
is a picture of the world.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:29.570
Knowledge as it comes through books is a picture
of the world taken in short steps, each one

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:33.580
of which has been tied down with deductive
logic or with strong evidence.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.111
If you're writing a book, you're going to
start your readers at A, you're going to try

00:40:36.111 --> 00:40:40.090
to get them to Z by taking these short, measured
steps.

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:42.450
That is the ideal in our culture.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:43.910
That has been the ideal of knowledge.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:49.430
It's the person who's sitting there writing
the long-form work that proves her or his

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:51.500
point.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:58.340
But there are problems with this that go unnoticed
when all we have are books.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:03.870
For example, it means that we write in private,
which, if you're designing a knowledge ecology,

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.310
seems entirely backwards.

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:10.900
You want to be working on this in public,
so that when, for example, Darwin, who obviously

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:14.330
wrote one of the great long-form works.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:17.170
In The Origin of Species, the first five chapters
lay out the theory.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:23.960
The next six chapters is Darwin sitting alone,
by himself, thinking about all the awful things

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:28.450
that people will say who object to his theory
that he's worked on for decades.

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:29.820
Some of those objections were real.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:33.230
He was socially-- He was out among his colleagues
and his social network.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.940
But some were also him thinking, "One might
say.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.970
One might object."

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:42.620
It's a totally suboptimal way of doing this,
but it's what you had to do because you're

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:43.620
writing.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.490
That's how you wrote: in private.

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:47.710
Now we don't have to do that so much.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:54.430
Another problem with the long-form, book-based
long-form is that you're trying to get your

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:55.430
readers to Z.

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.050
You're trying to keep them on the tour bus.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:58.840
Books, in some ways, are too short.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.450
long-form is too short, or it's not wide enough.

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:05.370
You have to try to keep them focused, keep
them focused, even though there's a whole

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:09.870
landscape full of interesting ideas and diversions
and possibility.

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:10.870
"No!

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:11.870
Stay on the bus!

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:13.050
You're on a tour!

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:14.050
I'm in charge of the tour!

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:16.960
We're going to go like this, and we're going
to get here.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.930
And then later, you can go explore.

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:23.600
But it's my damn tour bus."

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.600
A third problem--.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:29.150
And now that's a lost opportunity, that's
a paring down of information and of knowledge.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:36.050
The third is, that even though we love and
adore long-form works of knowledge, they very

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:37.120
rarely work.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.770
It's very rare that you'll actually start
at A and get all the way to Z.

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:43.060
Origin of Species, yeah.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.750
At least for me, I think most people in this
room, you get to Z.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:46.990
That's a great work.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:48.360
And it happens occasionally.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:54.080
But it doesn't work nearly as often as we
think it does, which, I think, maybe should

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.530
make us think that this is a poor way of trying
to reconstitute the world.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:02.840
That the world maybe doesn't work as short
steps that lean in a long chain.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.780
That maybe God doesn't think in long-form
arguments.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.760
Because they don't work, generally.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.150
They often just feel like arbitrary constructions.

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:15.020
So I'm certainly not saying that books are
going away, going to be replaced by Twitter

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.550
or whatever.

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:21.890
[laughter] But it seems pretty clear to me
that books are losing their pride of place

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:24.700
as the epitome of knowledge.

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.320
The widest and where knowledge lives.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.610
Knowledge lives on networks now.

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:33.940
The opposite of long-form is not short-form,
it's in fact web-form.

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:34.940
It's the web.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:39.530
If Darwin were alive now, one assumes that
he would be tweeting from the Beagle as it

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:44.310
goes around the Galapagos, and writing his
blog, and posting into archive dot org, and

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:45.970
getting things wrong and right.

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:50.240
There would be a web of people, some of whom
he knew, most of whom he doesn't, who are

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:55.130
correcting him, arguing with him, bringing
in their own evidence to support or to deny,

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:59.730
to explain his works to people who otherwise
wouldn't understand them, to make money off

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:02.370
of him as travel agents on tours of the Galapagos.

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.360
"See the finches yourself!

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.040
Go on a wild finch hunt!"

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.300
A web would grow up.

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:12.600
Darwin would publish, perhaps, his work, his
long-form work.

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:17.850
But it would have more value embedded in the
web than alone on a bookcase.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:20.820
Knowledge actually, now, lives in this network.

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:25.990
It's at the level of a network, of people
corresponding, disagreeing, agreeing, enhancing,

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:27.440
differing in every possible way.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.460
That's where knowledge is.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:30.501
You can see this in action.

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:36.270
This is an example I'm borrowing from Michael
Nielsen, who's Reinventing Discovery--.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:37.760
It came out about a month ago.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.940
Really good book about network knowledge in
science.

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:50.370
He, in conversation, points so the faster
than light neutrinos, about which I know nothing.

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:56.200
But the original article was posted in archive
dot org, prepress, no peer review, no guarantee

00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:00.130
that it's been, just put it up there as is.

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:04.440
Within a couple months, there had been 80
other articles posted there, plus countless

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:09.210
other ways that people wade in all across
the web.

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:14.780
Expanding, expounding, proposing ideas, explaining
to people like me who couldn't otherwise understand

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:15.780
it.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.650
This web is where the knowledge was.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:19.930
It did not go through peer review.

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:23.210
If it went through peer review, it would be
two years before it got published.

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:25.200
Maybe a year and a half if they hurry.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.740
Then somebody would write a letter, and three
months later the letter would be published.

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:29.750
It's too slow.

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:31.940
You can't scale science this way.

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.560
We already know this, for example, from genetics.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.770
Very similar sort of thing.

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:40.830
Open access could not be more important.

00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:43.390
The knowledge lives in the web.

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:49.400
One of the reasons I think this is really
important is that previous media were other

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.860
people deciding what's interesting to us.

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:54.640
They'd be right or wrong, and frequently,
they'd be right.

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.380
But frequently, they'd be wrong.

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.670
The web consists--.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:02.200
It's not that it's a crowd that's deciding
what's interesting to us.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.110
It's that the web is a direct reflection of
what's interesting to us.

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:08.440
Every link is an expression of human interest.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.570
A direct expression of human interest.

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:15.700
The web overall is an expression of what we
as a species care about, at least, people

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:17.030
on the web.

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:21.260
It can be very distressing, because apparently
about 50% of what we care about is porn.

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.810
Nevertheless, that's what it is.

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:29.790
Each of these links is something human and
live.

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:33.810
It is a direct expression of what matters
to us.

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:36.840
This is a transformative of knowledge.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.350
Why did knowledge turn out to be so fragile,
to go back to that original question?

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:41.670
I promised you I can't answer it.

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:45.170
But I want to point to one, well actually,
two points.

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:49.370
The first is that if you go through the traditional
list of characteristics of knowledge, that

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:53.960
there's only one knowledge, it's singular,
it's settled, it's unchanging, neat and organized,

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:59.490
it's relatively scarce, it's impersonal in
that anybody, whatever is true is true for

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:00.960
everybody.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:05.180
You look at the characteristics of network
knowledge.

00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:10.160
These characteristics are characteristics,
I believe, not only of knowledge, but also

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.750
of the internet, because that's my hypothesis.

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:15.910
The new medium is giving knowledge its new
properties.

00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:18.970
These are also characteristics of the world
that we live in.

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:22.320
What it means to live in a world as a human
being.

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:27.210
It's overwhelming, it's unsettled, it's unresolved,
it's messy, it's deeply, endlessly connected,

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:28.670
but sometimes loosely connected.

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:32.720
It's held together by the fact that the world
matters to us, that it's interesting to us,

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.560
that we care about it.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:39.580
The first conclusion, --I should maybe put
conclusion in air quotes-- but the first conclusion

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:45.380
is that network knowledge may or may not be
better knowledge, truer knowledge.

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:50.720
I think that in general, this is the greatest
time in human history to be somebody who cares

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.820
about knowledge.

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:53.920
So I would say, "Yeah, generally, it is truer.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.450
But leave that aside, let's not have that
argument."

00:47:56.450 --> 00:48:00.520
Nevertheless, network knowledge, the knowledge
that we see emerging on the web, is truer

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.820
to the nature of knowledge.

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:07.860
That is, to knowledge as part of the human
condition, as truer to the world in which

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:09.910
we live.

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:14.280
As opposed to the old that said, "No, we can
settle things with certainty by passing them

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.250
through expert filters."

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:19.010
No.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:20.010
We couldn't do that.

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:25.480
The second conclusion, the last thing I want
to say, is that, despite Moynihan and the

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:28.800
Enlightenment, what we have in common is not
knowledge.

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:32.460
That's not what's going to enable us to live
together peacefully in the world.

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:34.720
We're not going to agree about things.

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:39.130
What we have in common is not knowledge about
which we agree, but what we have in common

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:43.150
is a shared world about which we disagree.

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:47.280
What makes me hopeful is that on the web and
with knowledge in particular on the web, I

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:53.520
do see us getting far better, more sophisticated,
and in some ways more tolerant of disagreement,

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:58.690
and in fact, enabling difference, using difference
to advance us.

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:04.860
If there's going to be peace through knowledge,
it's going to be a very, very noisy peace.

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:06.190
Thank you.

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:07.520
[applause]

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:14.600
&gt;&gt;Female #1: So, questions at the mike.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:18.320
&gt;&gt;Weinberger: Questions at the mike. [clears
throat] I'm sorry to have gone so long.

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:22.540
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Oh, it's still early.

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:25.730
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Thanks for your presentation.

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:31.040
But it made me curious: why did you decide
to write a book to express all of that?

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.060
&gt;&gt;Weinberger: Why did I write a book?

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.060
A couple reasons.

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.030
I'm old fashioned.

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:39.520
My parents would be proud if they were here.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.080
And the web doesn't yet pay advances.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.230
[laughter] I'm sorry, that's--.

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:45.910
Unfortunately, those are honest answers.

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:49.030
And they're not very good answers, which is
why it's unfortunate.

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:54.320
Maybe saying in my defense, I do a lot on
the web, too.

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:55.320
[pause]

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:59.410
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Even if the--.

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:09.850
Well, taking that what you're saying is right,
that the knowledge is across the web in the

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:12.830
network, how do you think about--.

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:17.410
There's still, presumably, even if people
have different opinions, relatively more valuable

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:20.910
information knowledge there and a lot of crap,
for lack of a better word.

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:26.210
Do you form any judgment about differentiating
stuff that may be valuable to different people

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:28.810
versus what's less valuable to everybody?

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:29.810
&gt;&gt;Weinberger: Yes.

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:31.330
I mean, we have to.

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:37.850
We have to, otherwise we [pause] we'll die,
and we'll kill others inadvertently.

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:41.130
So yeah, we have to do this.

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:46.040
It seems to me the only process is basically
a political one.

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.510
I don't meant through elected officials, though
that plays a part, but rather, it's what it

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:53.720
has, in fact, always been as the postmodernists--.

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:58.070
And all of this, by the way, postmodernists
say, everything I just said.

00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:00.260
Except that now, it's actually real on the
web.

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:03.490
They said that too, by the way.

00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:13.090
As they have long said and recognized, knowledge
has been imbued with struggles for power.

00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:20.070
That was hidden to us to some extent because
the victors were so absolute in their victory.

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:23.180
You couldn't hear all the disagreement.

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:27.000
All you could hear was what was coming through
the broadcast towers, and they're pretty much

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.660
in agreement.

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:30.660
So it was hidden from us.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:35.800
But it was there, because it was a solid victory
for those who gained control of the means

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.710
of knowledge.

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:42.810
We are, I think, destined forever to be in
a continuous negotiation and political struggle

00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:49.120
to try to get what we believe with good cause
is the truth to carry policy and to inform

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.510
people's minds.

00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:51.550
There's no--.

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:56.640
The old technique of establishing a canon
and basically removing access to everything

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.860
outside of that canon simply won't work anymore.

00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:05.020
There was an enormous price to that old technique
as well, so I don't think this is all bad.

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.860
This, to me, is a more realistic--.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:11.600
We now have a more realistic assessment of
how knowledge works.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:17.220
To put this more positively, I think this
is very close to how scientists actually think

00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:18.690
and work.

00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:21.010
They come to important conclusions.

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:23.780
They base important decisions on those conclusions.

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:30.830
But they always talk about hypotheses and
evidence, and are aware that it could be wrong.

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:37.170
That's a more adult view of knowledge than
the "It says it in the Encyclopedia on the

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:41.790
page, so it's got to be right" view, which
is only a bit of a caricature of our previous

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:43.970
paper-based approach.

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:45.400
[pause]

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:49.700
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Hi.

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:52.490
In another life, I'm a math and science teacher.

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:54.560
Much of our time is spent disseminating.

00:52:54.560 --> 00:53:01.060
The debate is around "What should we teach?"
as opposed to "Why?" or "How?"

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:06.960
Even when we use social media and web, it's
to disseminate or to help students to find

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:07.960
information.

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:15.830
Based on your research, what do you see as
helpful going forward for using the web, that

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:16.830
knowledge base?

00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:21.340
&gt;&gt;Weinberger: I would always defer to a teacher
who's actually teaching.

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:28.340
Having said that, I'm about to say things
that will be foolish, at best.

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:32.490
[pause] [sighs] I have nothing interesting
to say.

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:36.920
There are obviously levels of things that
we want taken as fact, and are fact.

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.190
No reason to dispute them.

00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:42.060
We want our students to know those, and not
to have serious doubts about them, always

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.060
to be slightly skeptical.

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:45.830
That's what we've always done as part of the
educational system.

00:53:45.830 --> 00:53:48.590
We clearly need to continue doing that.

00:53:48.590 --> 00:53:53.830
It's not, "Well, just go out, build a Wiki,
and whatever you believe is true", because

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:57.570
it's not true that whatever you believe is
true.

00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:00.411
The phrase "Well, that's true for you" actually
drives me insane.

00:54:00.411 --> 00:54:04.600
Because in that case, we're not talking about
truth.

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:08.870
And we do need to be talking about truth in
the educational system.

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:11.470
There are a couple things I think may be happening.

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:12.470
I think they're all obvious.

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:17.780
One is I think we're beginning to understand
through the web and somewhat through our children

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:23.820
that learning is not simply about enriching
the individual.

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:27.850
That's nice, that's important, but that's
a selfish act.

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:30.750
You get educated and you become a better person,
and that's grand.

00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:33.280
Maybe you become a better citizen and you
help others.

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.310
But so much--.

00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:38.320
You look at the software development community,
the environment that they, or perhaps I should

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:41.780
say you, have built for themselves.

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:47.480
It is so generous and so amazingly productive.

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:53.450
It's reasonable to argue that the software
developers have built the best environment

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:56.500
for rapid learning we've ever had in our history.

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.090
You have a question, you'll get it answered.

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:00.430
You need a code fragment, it's there.

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:01.430
It's there for free.

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:05.010
When you do your own, you'll improve that
one or do another, you'll make it free.

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:12.010
This culture of learning in public as an act
that is not only bettering you, but is bettering

00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:16.990
the public, that is an amazing thing within
the software world.

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:21.710
I hope that it will become an amazing thing
within the educational system overall.

00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:25.350
It's not simply about me making you smarter,
my student.

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:32.000
It's about us learning together, A, of course,
and B, doing this in public as a way of improving

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.120
the world in which we all live.

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:39.980
Helping students to be literate about the
web, that would also be really, really helpful

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:40.980
as well.

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:41.980
That's beginning to happen.

00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:46.890
But it seems a little slower than I would
have expected.

00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:49.840
[pause] I told you I had nothing.

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:50.840
[laughter]

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:55.050
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Part of the value of pursuing a
one definitive truth is that, at least in

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:58.180
theory, it should have a correspondence with
an objective reality.

00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:02.000
If you understand gravity, you understand
the motions of the planets.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.740
If we lessen our focus on the one truth, does
it lessen our ability to be able to optimize

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.180
our reality?

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:15.400
For example, coming up with economic policies
that actually grow economies or safety policies

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.400
that keep us safe.

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:21.250
&gt;&gt;Weinberger: First of all, we absolutely
should be trying to head towards the one truth.

00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:23.080
We just call it "the truth."

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:27.400
The world is one way, and it is not another.

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.640
I firmly believe that.

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:35.750
And we should be, of course, heading as far
as, doing our best with that.

00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:40.490
I'm going to reject your metaphysics, but
accept your conclusion.

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:47.550
I have-- Maybe the shorthand for this is that
I'm basically a Heideggerian, and take a more

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:50.190
phenomenological approach, so I don't--.

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:53.690
The correspondence idea of truth, that it's
a set of statements that corresponds to how

00:56:53.690 --> 00:57:01.420
the real world is, for me, leads out the way
in which truth is an aspect of how we engage

00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:06.430
with the world, not an independent picture
of it.

00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:07.700
We can leave that argument aside.

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:10.480
I'm not sure that it actually makes a difference.

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:15.790
And still think that yes, we absolutely have
to be trying to figure out what's true about

00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:19.920
the world so that we can make good policies
that will then affect the world.

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.750
That's crucial.

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:25.330
I want to be clear about what I was saying
before, because we need scientists, we need

00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:29.750
mathematicians, we need sociologists, we need
everybody to be working on this.

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:35.990
What I was saying before is we should give
up on the hope that we're all going to agree

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:37.220
about the facts.

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:41.190
But there are still facts, and we still need
to be pursuing them for precisely the reason

00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:47.430
you say, because the real world, reality,
our fates, depend upon them.

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:53.070
I've compressed the metaphysics and accept
the beginning and end of your statement.

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:54.070
[laughs]

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:56.270
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I want to thank you for coming
to Google today.

00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:58.170
&gt;&gt;Weinberger: Thank you for having me.

00:57:58.170 --> 00:57:59.920
Oh,
&gt;&gt;Female #2: and that's it!

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.810
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Weinberger: Thank you very much.

00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:02.130
[applause]
