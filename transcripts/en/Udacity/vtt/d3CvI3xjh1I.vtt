00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.630
Great editing environments,
safety nets in place?

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.350
&gt;&gt; Check and check.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.960
What else could we need?

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.890
&gt;&gt; Well, we've optimized your
development workflow but

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.320
that's about it.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.940
Now think about all
the things that you do or

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.470
should do after you finishing coding and
planning a release.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.710
Things like unifying and

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.950
concatenating your source files and
optimizing your images.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.110
In today's mobile world, you see
hundreds of different device, browser,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.200
and screen combinations
that use your app or site.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.113
In some cases, it's simply
impossible to optimize by hand.

00:00:28.113 --> 00:00:30.530
&gt;&gt; This is where your
build process steps in.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.350
We'll use it to optimize things
that you can't fix by hand, or

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.910
simply take too long.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.320
And doing so
will make your build more powerful,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.050
so that it takes a raw source code and
polishes it for production.
