00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.607
- Did you make this sign?

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:10.110
- Yeah, I designed it.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.178 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You shouldn't
have used this seal.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.480
Okay, is this everyone?

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.515
- Yeah, this is the gang.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.050
- So, as you know,
the reason I'm here,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.952
is because one of
you was mugged.

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.420
I don't know who it
was, but I'm gonna

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.823
go ahead and guess, it was you.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:25.792 align:start size:81% position:19%
- He's pointing
at you, obviously.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.727
- I was mugged.

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:29.796
- I'm here to make you more
aware of your surroundings

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.197 align:start size:81% position:19%
on the outside,
and by doing that,

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.232 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm gonna give each
of you your own

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.601
individual can of pepper spray,

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:38.138 align:start size:97% position:3%
which I will give you at
the end of the presentation,

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:39.205
which is now.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:41.608
So, there any questions?

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:42.442
Yes.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.744
(mumbles)

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.046
What?

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.114
- He said, "Are you a
real police officer?"

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:50.050
- Not anymore.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.551
I was,

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.452
many years.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.455
Ran over a teenager.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:56.356
Now I do safety

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:57.690 align:start size:75% position:25%
demonstrations.
- Jesus.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.025
- Is he alive?

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.528
- Yes, he's just, (gurgles)

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.029
- Are you okay?

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.764
- It's not about me, come up
and get your sprays, come on.

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:05.698
- It's not about him.

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.333
After the sprays, back to work.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.802 align:start size:84% position:16%
(coughs)
- Can we leave now?

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.804
- He killed someone don't--
- I did not kill anyone.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.906 align:start position:0%
- Well, that was the ninth time
I've been mugged this year.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:13.873 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Oof.
- Oh my God.

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:14.941
What did the guy look like?

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:15.775
- Big.

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.277
Huge, like The Rock.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.545 align:start size:97% position:3%
And not the cute, sweet little
Escape from Witch Mountain,

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.113
The Rock either, I'm
talkin' 'roided out,

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:22.315
balls the size of
raisins, The Rock.

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:23.483
- It's stupid that
we all had to be

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:24.617
at this presentation though.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:25.485
I mean, I do MMA.

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:26.619
I shouldn't be here.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.254
- You do MMA?

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.122
- Yeah.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.623
I do it a lot actually.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.158 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Oh, I'm sorry, I just
didn't know that MMA dudes

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:33.726
could be so...

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:35.261
- So what?

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.362
- Doughy?

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.630 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Aww...
- I'm not doughy,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.598
I'm jacked bro.

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:39.866
- Down here.
- Stop it.

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:40.700
I didn't think I was
talkin' to frickin'

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.768
Joe Rogan over here.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:42.635
- You the drivers?

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:43.470
- Yes.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.904
- Yep.
- Mmhmm.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:45.905 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Police Officer] Alright,
I got pepper sprays

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.373
for you.
- Oh good.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.876 align:start position:0%
- My hands are my pepper spray,
but I'll take one anyway.

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:51.644
- Alright, you guys know
how to use these things?

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:52.679
- Yeah.
- Yes.

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:53.680 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Where's the safety?
- Yep.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.380
Oh my God!
- Oh my God.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.348
- My eyeball!

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:56.716 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Oh my God.
- Oh no!

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:57.684 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm sorry dude, I'm sorry.

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:59.519
- You guys are morons.

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:01.988
- Thank you, officer.

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:03.590 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I'm losin'
peripheral vision here.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.657
- [Rob] Can't see
that well anyway.

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:05.725
- You guys want a hit?

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:08.061
- Dude, a cop just walked away.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.296
- Well, if we're gonna go
get this punk-ass bitch,

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.464
I'm gonna need to
get high first.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:12.966
- What? Get who?

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.200
- The guy who mugged you.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.802
Look, a cop just
issued us weapons.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:16.936
We're depu-ties.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:17.937
This is like Tombstone.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.172
- No, that's not
a good idea man.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:21.441
This guy had tear-drop
tattoos on his face,

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.143
and he knocked my
hat off my head.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.377
- Aww.

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:25.044
- There's three of
us, and one of him.

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:25.778
Tombstone.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:29.015
- I'm gonna surprise you guys,

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:29.849
and say I'm in.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.050
(grunts)

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.218 align:start size:84% position:16%
I want to be Kurt
Russell in Tombstone.

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:33.786 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Well, you can't,
'cause I'm Kurt Russell.

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:34.954
- Oy...
- No,

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:35.922 align:start size:88% position:13%
you'd be more Val
Kilmer, because you guys

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.357
have the same type of body.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:38.324
- Stop talking about my body.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.659
- Well, you have a fatter body.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.261
- I don't have, just
don't use the word fat,

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.563
just okay, it's bulky.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:44.497
Just blood in, blood out.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:45.498
Let's do this.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:46.633
- Wait, who am I in Tombstone?

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:47.700
- Billy Zane.
- Billy Zane.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.102
- Yes.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.069
- What is that?

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.037 align:start size:75% position:25%
Don't kiss.
- I'm in shock,

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:52.539
'cause it's getting worse now.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.108
(techno music)

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:01.981
- This is dope.

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:03.483
My first real stakeout.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.818
- I think we have to be in the
car for it to be a stakeout.

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:07.353 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, this is
more like stalking.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:08.855
- It's not stalking.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.323
Why is everyone so quick
to say that I stalk them?

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.925
- Who calls you a stalker?

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:12.759
- [Jon] You guys.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:13.927
- Who else?

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:16.062
- I don't know, that girl Katie,

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:18.097
from the french fry truck
that I hooked up with,

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.333
who's apparently engaged
now, to the worst guy ever,

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.668 align:start size:72% position:28%
by the way.
(gasps)

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:22.502
- There he is.

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:23.570
- Let's get outta here.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.771 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Yep.
- No, no, no, no.

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:25.572 align:start size:88% position:13%
Get out of the car,
this is the whole point.

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:26.506
Where is he, Mort?

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:27.941
- He's wearing my Pie Guys hat.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:30.610 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Rob] Dude, that
kid is like 15, maybe.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.878
- I don't care how old he is,

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.346
he's 'bout to learn
not to fuck with us.

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:34.380
Let's go.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.548
- This is bad.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:36.749 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Mort] I can't
believe you hooked up

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:37.984 align:start size:84% position:16%
with that girl from
the food truck.

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.419
- [Jon] Well, I kissed
her, but then she cried.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.353
Pay back, bitch.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:41.955
(yells)

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:42.889
- [Mort] That's my same eye!

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:43.957
- [Jon] Mort, get your wallet.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:45.158
Rob, kick him!

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:46.192 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm not gonna kick
him, he's a kid!

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:47.393
- [Mort] I can't see anything!

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:48.361 align:start size:81% position:19%
- [Jon] Fine, I'll
do everything!

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:49.862 align:start size:69% position:31%
- Ah!
- Mort...

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:51.431
- [Jon] He doesn't have
a wallet, just some pogs.

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.498
- Oh, thank God, my pogs!

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:53.333
- Come on!

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:54.601
Come on!

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:55.969
- Aight, back to
the car, success!

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.737 align:start size:84% position:16%
(yells)
- Go, go, go, go, go!

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:58.638
- [Mort] Pie guys!

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:00.306 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Dude, come on!
- Okay.

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:02.875
(moans)

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:04.277
- [Mugger] I'm okay.

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:06.179 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Jon] Fuck my keys,
my fuckin' keys.

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.013
- [Mort] What?

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:07.847
- [Jon] Shit!

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:08.681
- [Ron] Mort, come on!

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:10.283
- [Mort] I'm stuck.

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:13.753 align:start position:0%
- [Rob] Jon, what are you
doing, they're in the ignition!

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:14.988
- My keys!

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.190
- [Rob] They're in
the ignition, idiot!

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.391
Come on!

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:21.060 align:start size:88% position:13%
We just assaulted a
child in broad daylight!

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.462
Don't look at us!

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.567
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:31.104
Mort, get your head
in the goddamn car.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.339
- [Mort] Can we, I wanna...

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:35.808 align:start size:88% position:13%
(sighs)
- We gotta go this way.

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:37.076
- No, there's an

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:38.244 align:start size:94% position:6%
ice coffee place this way.
- Come on!

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:39.612 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- My God, go!

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:40.947
- To us!

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.782
- I think we're bad people.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.484
- Look, it's war, okay?

00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:45.685
- How is it war?

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.086 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The important thing
is that we taught

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:48.421
a little scumbag a
lesson, and we're

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:49.989
never gonna have to
deal with him again.

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:51.324
- Hey, you little pussies!

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:52.558
- Oh fuck.

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:54.093
- You think it's funny
to pepper spray my son?

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:55.628
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.864
Slow your roll, Jane Kazmerack.

00:04:57.864 --> 00:04:58.898
- [Mort] I think it's Kaczmarek.

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:00.433
- Just, A,

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.468
it's not my fault that you
raised Joffrey Lannister.

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:03.469
- Technically, he's a Barath--

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:04.304
- Just, B,

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:06.939 align:start size:84% position:16%
don't step unless
you're ready to dance,

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.741
'cause I have no problem--
- Is this your pepper spray?

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:09.575
- Yeah.

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:11.277
(yells)

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:13.012
- How does that feel?

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:14.080
(groans)
- You two,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.315
take out your pepper spray.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.549
- Let me be the first

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:19.719 align:start size:97% position:3%
to apolog--
- Take out your pepper spray!

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.554 align:start size:72% position:28%
(groans)
I want you to

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:23.089
spray each other in the face.

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.223 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Okay, lady, I'm
gonna level with you.

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:25.458 align:start size:88% position:13%
This is the third time--
- Do it now,

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:29.595 align:start size:94% position:6%
before I fuck your asses!
(groans)

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:35.935 align:start size:72% position:28%
(both scream)
(groans)

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:38.838
- [Mort] We've been milf-hunted.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.840
- [Jon] That's not
what that means!

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.509
(techno music)
