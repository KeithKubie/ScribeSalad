00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.140
Saving Basketball

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:08.210
On a cold, late November Wednesday in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, a crowd of 7,021 arrived to the

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.360
Minneapolis Auditorium to watch an NBA game
between the Fort Wayne Pistons and the Minneapolis

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.370
Lakers.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.320
This was a new experience for many of the
fans in the stands.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.340
The NBA had formed due to a merger between
rival leagues, the Basketball Association

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.279
of America (BAA) and the National Basketball
League (NBL), less than 16 months before.

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.570
The new league was still trying to find its
footing.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.920
Each game represented a chance to win – and
lose – fans.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.820
This matchup boasted some of the brightest
basketball stars of the day – most prominent

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.870
of all, the great George Mikan.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.570
A basketball prodigy since his college days
at DePaul in Chicago, he joined the Lakers

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.039
in 1947 and dominated games right from the
start.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.629
At six foot ten, Mikan’s rebounding, shot
blocking, and killer hook shoot elevated him

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.559
to becoming the signature player of the new
NBA.

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.999
Along with Mikan, six foot seven future Hall
of Famer Vern Mikkelsen and former Stanford

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:03.450
All-American Jim Pollard made the Minneapolis
Lakers one of the most feared teams in the

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.450
league.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.090
The Fort Wayne Pistons did not match up in
talent to the Lakers and they knew it.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.670
But the coach of the Pistons, and Indiana
Basketball Hall of Famer, Murray Mendenhall

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.110
had a plan.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.660
The buzzer sounded, the clock began ticking,
and the opening tip went to the Fort Wayne

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.660
Pistons.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.170
As Ralph Johnson, the Pistons’ point guard,
dribbled down court staring at the intimidating

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.869
behemoth defensive front court of Mikan and
friends, he was under direct orders from his

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:28.869
coach.

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.950
Those orders were to hold the ball.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.140
Mendenhall’s philosophy for the game was
quite simple: If the Lakers never got the

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.770
ball, they could never score.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.180
If they could never score, they could never
win the game.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.570
As the seconds ticked by and the Pistons did
nothing but pass the ball back and forth between

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.549
one another, everyone not on the Pistons became
frustrated.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.340
The Lakers players stood around, not knowing
what to do.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.550
Occasionally they would foul simply to have
a chance to get the ball back.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.630
The referees yelled at the Pistons players
and at coach Mendenhall to play ball.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.659
Worst of all, the fans in the stands began
to boo and stomp their feet in anger.

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.620
At half-time, the score was 13 to 11 in favor
of the Lakers with Mikan scoring 12 of the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.649
Lakers’ points.

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.399
This was the new league’s worst nightmare.

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.040
The second half was even worse.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.560
The Lakers, despite being annoyed at the Pistons’
strategy, began to subscribe to the old adage

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.709
“if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.”

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.840
Each team holding the ball for minutes at
a time; the two teams only scored 13 points

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.319
combined in the second half.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.300
As the clock mercifully ticked down to zero
in the fourth quarter, the Pistons held a

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.811
one point lead, 19 to 18.

00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:35.590
A missed Lakers’ shot at the buzzer gave
the Pistons the win, and upset, in the lowest

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.480
scoring game in NBA history.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.480
Mikan was “held” to a game high 15 points.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.420
Lakers coach John Kundla, disgusted, said
after the game, ““If that’s basketball,

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.490
I don’t want any part of it.”

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.319
Maurice Podoloff knew something had to be
done to make sure a game of this nature never

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.380
happened again.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.629
He was the man who had been put in charge
to ensure the survival of the NBA and professional

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:56.680
basketball.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.800
Podoloff was the former president of the BAA
and had negotiated the merger between the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.599
BAA and the NBL to form the NBA.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.760
He was the logical choice to become the NBA
president in 1949.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.170
Podoloff knew the only way this league was
going to flourish was by making sure the game

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.950
was fun and exciting to the people who paid
his and the players’ salary – the fans.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.970
“It seems to me that the teams showed complete
disregard for the interest of the fans by

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.210
the type of game they played,” said Podoloff
the next day.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.099
On that Friday (two days after the game),
he summoned all league officials and the two

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.010
referees from the infamous game to figure
out ways to make the NBA game more fan-friendly.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.239
They came up with several rule changes that
would be instituted in the coming year, including

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.120
the widening of the key from six feet to twelve
feet.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.840
They thought these changes would increase
scoring and the blunt the impact of one dominant

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.730
player (in this case, George Mikan).

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.299
It didn’t work.

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.230
Scoring was still low, fewer fans came out
to the games, and teams began to fold.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.050
By the end of the 1953-1954 season, the NBA
was down to nine teams.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.610
Professional basketball was very much in trouble.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.700
The owner of the Syracuse Nationals, Daniel
Biasone, may have not been the first person

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.420
to suggest a “shot clock,” but he was
the man who convinced the NBA to use it.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.140
In 1946, Biasone paid five thousand dollars
to the NBL for his Syracuse Nationals to have

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.420
the right to play in the new professional
basketball league.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.920
After some initial struggles, Biasone had
enough of losing and paid a young player by

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.470
the name of Dolph Schayes to come play in
Syracuse.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.390
Schayes was considered by many to be the best
player in college while at NYU and surprised

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.330
many when he choose to play in upstate New
York instead of the Big Apple and the New

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.500
York Knicks.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.690
Money was definitely a factor in Schayes’s
decision; Biasone had offered Schayes fifty

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.140
percent more than the Knicks.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.810
Schayes also liked the smallness of Syracuse,
having been quoted as saying he liked the

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.890
“camaraderie of small town fans.”

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.320
Schayes was a hit in Syracuse and immediately
legitimized the fledgling team.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.450
The Nationals were absorbed as part of the
merger and became an original NBA franchise

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.470
in 1949.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.960
By 1954, the “Nats” were flat out good
with Schayes leading the way, finishing with

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.240
a 42-30 record and making it all the way to
the NBA Finals before losing to the Lakers

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.410
four games to three.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:16.950
As the NBA and the Nationals entered the 1954-1955
season, there was fear that this may be professional

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.820
basketball’s last hurrah, exemplified by
The New York Times writing that “professional

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.660
basketball’s existence was in jeopardy.”

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.380
None of the rule changes meant to increase
scoring and make the game more fan-friendly

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.380
had worked.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.440
But Biasone had an idea.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.840
He had watched and studied hundreds of basketball
games since his Nats joined the league over

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.850
eight years ago.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.820
After much thought, he determined that a “well-balanced”
game meant that each team took 60 shots a

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.060
game, or 120 total shots in a game.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.540
Each game was 48 minutes, or 2880 seconds,
long.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:57.270
Using basic math, Biasone divided 2880 seconds
by 120 shots and got a magic number – 24.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.700
According to this formula, a well-balanced
game required a shot every 24 seconds.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.840
Therefore, a clock counting down from 24 seconds
would force teams to shoot in this amount

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.960
of time or less, creating a much more exciting
and fun game.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.970
Now, Biasone needed to convince Podoloff and
the rest of the NBA that his 24 second shot

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.230
clock would be solution to their scoring problem.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.210
He experimented with it during National’s
exhibition games and it had the necessary

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.860
impact on scoring that the NBA adopted for
the 1954-1955 regular season.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.211
On October 30th, 1954, in a game between the
Rochester Royals and the Boston Celtics, the

00:06:34.211 --> 00:06:35.830
shot clock officially debuted.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.810
It was a rousing success with the Royals defeating
the Celtics 98 to 95.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:46.280
Daniel Biasone and his 24 second shot clock
had saved professional basketball.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:52.440
The 1954-1955 season saw scoring jump by over
13 points a game from the previous season.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.700
Along with scoring, fan excitement soared.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.380
The Boston Celtics became the first NBA team
to average more than 100 points.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.740
By 1959, every team was averaging more than
100 points per game.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.440
NBA president Maurice Podoloff admitted that
this innovation rescued basketball,

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.860
The twenty-four-second rule has worked so
well that I firmly believe it has proved the

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.770
salvation of professional basketball.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.740
So far this year attendance receipts at our
games have increased 57 percent…

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.730
The adoption of the clock (has been) most
important event in the NBA.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:30.110
Today, a monument, an actual shot clock that
counts down from 24, stands in downtown Syracuse,

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:35.000
New York commemorating the impact Daniel Biasone
and his shot clock had in saving the game

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.690
of basketball.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.541
Bonus Facts:
 George Mikan is considered to be the first

00:07:39.541 --> 00:07:41.120
superstar of the NBA.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.780
Nicknamed “Mr. Basketball,” he led his
teams to seven championships, won three scoring

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.380
titles, and was so dominant rules were named
after him, including the widening of the lane

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.110
from six to twelve feet — “the Mikan Rule.”

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.480
Always wearing his trademark thick round glasses,
he played eleven seasons and was voted in

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.320
1950 “The Greatest Basketball Player of
the First Half Century.”

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.560
He had a huge impact on the game even after
his retirement in 1956.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.510
He was the first commissioner of the revolutionary
ABA in the late 1960s, helped bring professional

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:15.690
basketball back to Minnesota in 1990, and
fought the NBA to increase pensions for retired

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.500
players who played during the league’s early
years.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.511
George Mikan passed away in 2005 at the age
of 80.

00:08:21.511 --> 00:08:28.510
 The NCAA did not introduce a shot clock
into the men’s college game until 1985.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.890
Women’s college games had been using a 30
second shot clock since 1970, but there was

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.039
a fear in men’s games that smaller college
teams would not be able to run and keep up

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.400
with the bigger schools.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.670
Because of this, “killing the ball” was
a huge problem in men’s college basketball

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:42.850
for many years.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:48.410
In 1973, a game between Tennessee and Temple
ended in an 11 to 6 score with fans throwing

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:49.950
ice onto the court in disgust.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:54.850
Dean Smith, the legendary North Carolina coach
who coached Michael Jordan, James Worthy,

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.530
and many other greats, had a stall offense
he called the “four corners.”

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:04.820
Only 30 years later, in 1985, did they rectify
this by installing a 45 second shot clock.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:09.940
In 1993, they reduced the shot clock to 35
seconds.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:15.280
 In 1955, the same year Biasone brought
the 24 second shot clock to the NBA, the Syracuse

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.880
Nationals, coincidentally, won their first
and only NBA championship.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.220
With Dolph Schayes leading the way, they defeated
the Fort Wayne Pistons four games to three.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.360
Over the next eight seasons, the Syracuse
Nationals remained respectable and out lasted

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.310
many of the other smaller town teams in the
NBA.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.970
By 1960, the Nats were the last remaining
old NBL team still playing in their original

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:36.970
city.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:42.230
On March 26th, 1963, the Nats lost in overtime
to the Cincinnati Royals (formerly the Rochester

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.990
Royals) by the score of 131 to 127, knocking
them out of the playoffs.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.930
That was the last professional basketball
game to be played in Syracuse.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.110
That year, Biasone sold the team to an investment
group who promptly moved them to Philadelphia

00:09:55.110 --> 00:10:11.260
before the start of the next season, renaming
the team the 76ers.
