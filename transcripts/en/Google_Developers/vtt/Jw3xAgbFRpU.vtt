RICH HYNDMAN: The thing that
really always kind of hooks

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:07.843
me back into it is every
time you write an application

00:00:07.843 --> 00:00:10.450
and it runs for the first time
and you see it on that device,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.075
you can carry it around with you
and you can show it to people,

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:15.620
it's that little contained
computer in your pocket

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.810
that you can program.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.960
And that's what drives
me more to mobile app

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.890
development than server-side
or anything else.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.980
It's just the presence of having
that application with you.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.100
It's just glorious every
time it runs and it's there.
