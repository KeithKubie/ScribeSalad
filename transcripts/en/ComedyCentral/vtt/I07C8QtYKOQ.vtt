00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.669
So, Monday is Independence Day.

00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:05.838
Now, a lot of people
are gonna be celebrating--

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:07.840
fireworks, drinking.

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:09.709
Drinking fireworks.

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:12.078
Don't do that, by the way.

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:13.446
It's only a joke.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.348
But, you know, it's funny,
every year I like to share

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:17.517
my reflections on the holiday
and country, and...

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.552
it's funny, I've been doing it
since the '70s, uh,

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:22.388
when I had my first show on UHF.
Did I ever mention that show?

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:24.357
In fact, you know,
I think we have some footage

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.759
from the big bicentennial
episode I did in '76.

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:29.195
Uh, Drake, can you run that?

Hey, welcome back to my

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.574 line:0%
<i> Can You Dig It?</i> celebration.

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:44.710
So, Isaac from<i> The Love Boat's </i>
hanging with us today.

00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:47.547
Uh, actually, um,
my name is Ted Lange.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.016
-Mm-hmm. -Isaac is
just a character that I play.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.552
Isaac, do that thing you do
on<i> The Love Boat</i> opening.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.153
You know, with the fingers.
Do that.

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:56.055
That's some...
that's some cool (bleep).

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:57.924
Uh...

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.792
(laughs)

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:02.829
Yeah. All right, Isaac,
mix me up a mai tai.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:06.265
Best Fourth of July I ever had,

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:09.702
I was butt-naked
on the George Washington Bridge.

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:12.004
-(chuckles)
-Um... that's where I woke up.

00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:14.440
I don't know what hap...
That was the fifth of July.

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:16.342
What other holiday
can you do that? Arbor Day?

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:17.643
Go (bleep) yourself, Arbor Day.

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:20.179
You got to time your drugs
accordingly.

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:22.715
Nothing beats
some elephant tranquilizers

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:25.451
right before
the big fireworks display.

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:28.187
It adds three additional colors
not on the rainbow.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.956
(chuckles):
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.424
And let me tell you
something, (bleep),

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:34.060
you never heard tuba music
till you've heard tuba music

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:36.262
on elephant tranquilizers.
That's some (bleep).

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:38.097
Nothing says Independence Day

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.266
like stepping away
from your marriage vows

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.335
and getting freaky
with the neighbor ladies.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:45.271
You know what I mean. That's
independence, mother (bleep).

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:47.273
I'm talkin' wife-swappin'.

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:49.809
(chuckles):
Right? And free rides to the top

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:52.145
of Mount Washington Monument.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:54.780
Why'd they call that thing
the Love Boat anyway?

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:57.083
Love is some
hippy-dippy (bleep), man.

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:58.718
People just want to bone.

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.921
They sh...they ought
to call that just the Bone Boat.

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:04.824
It is perfectly fine
to use your hibachi indoors.

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:06.826
A lot of mother (bleep)
don't know that.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.961
Also, they just put
a fresh coat of-- uh...

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:11.998
what's that (bleep) called?--
asbestos in here last week.

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.734
Oh, this (bleep) is safe, man.
Safe as can be.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.036
We're gonna do some
bicentennial predictions.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.105
-(quietly): All right!
-You know, um...

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.107
this is just the way
I see (bleep)

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.508
for the next 200 years.

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:24.644
The Russians will be
the first ones on Venus.

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.045
That's my prediction.

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:27.980
What do you think? Mars?

00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:31.250
-Uh...
-(bleep) Mars, man.

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:33.419
Future leader, right?

00:02:33.452 --> 00:02:36.422
O.J. Simpson.

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:39.592
Man will evolve
to having a third hand.

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.994
I don't know where
that hand's gonna come from.

00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:46.299
Strangulation will be the way
most people will die.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.568
-Yeah.
-Mm. Tell me it's not more fun

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.703
to strangle a (bleep)
than to shoot 'em.

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:52.071
Am I right?

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:54.273
Remember?
You strangled Carl last year.

00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:55.841
No, I never told...

00:02:55.874 --> 00:02:58.311
(bleep) nobody's watching this
that's gonna arrest you!

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:02.148
He strangled Carl, man.
That was some (bleep).

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:03.516
(Lange laughs)

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.651
Man, you just knocked over
my mustard, mother (bleep).

00:03:05.684 --> 00:03:07.486
Let me tell you,
let me tell you,

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.423
that Liberty Bell, that was
an out-of-sight idea, man.

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:13.159
Nobody cares about no bell,
but you put a crack in it,

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:16.062
all of a sudden everybody wants
to go to Philly and see it.

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:17.830
Right? Like some kind
of tourist attraction.

00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:19.332
That's-that's
some genius (bleep).

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.367
They ought to put a crack
in everything.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.202
Crack.

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:25.738
Hmm. Hmm.

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:28.771
Have a happy and safe
Fourth of July, America!
