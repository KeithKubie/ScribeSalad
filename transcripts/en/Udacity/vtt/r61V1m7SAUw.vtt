00:00:00.445 --> 00:00:02.190
Okay, we just signed up for a lot.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.930
We have so many things to teach them.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.128
What should we cover?

00:00:06.128 --> 00:00:08.180
&gt;&gt; Hold that thought, I need something.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.060
&gt;&gt; Where are you going?

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.580
&gt;&gt; Here, this is for you.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.150
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.059
&gt;&gt; Let's just pour out some beans.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.190
&gt;&gt; What are you doing?

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.940
&gt;&gt; Well these are not our bean but
let's imagine they are for a second.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.570
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.190
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.420
I just want to create a little
coffee trail which is going to

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.320
be a symbol of the journey our
students will take with us.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.900
&gt;&gt; Okay, I like that.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.015
&gt;&gt; So let's just say this is our student
and this is where we are beginning.

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:34.370
&gt;&gt; Oh, and this can be where they end.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.020
&gt;&gt; Right, which is where they
are an Android developer, right?

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.480
And we're focusing on just this
part of our course right now, so

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.120
this is where we are.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.230
So I'm just going to clean it out and

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.780
zoom in into the main
part of the course.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.240
Okay, well, let's say there are three
big lessons in this course.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.103
&gt;&gt; Only three?

00:00:49.103 --> 00:00:50.763
&gt;&gt; Let's say there are three for
now, yeah?

00:00:50.763 --> 00:00:51.960
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.460
&gt;&gt; So, this is lesson one,
two, and three.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.650
Let's talk about lesson one.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.589
I'm just going to zoom in there and
clean up the dust,yeah.

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:03.916
Well, I'm going to split this
further into three sections, and

00:01:03.916 --> 00:01:07.280
you might guess what my favorite
number is at this point.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.815
Which is?

00:01:07.815 --> 00:01:08.590
&gt;&gt; Two.
&gt;&gt; Three.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.868
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.

00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:13.440
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What is the first
thing we should do in lesson one?

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.620
&gt;&gt; I think they should
learn about views.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.890
&gt;&gt; Oh, views, things that you see
on the phone, so like a check box,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.480
a radio button, an image,
a text of some sort.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.325
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.
&gt;&gt; So we introduce them to that here.

00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:27.770
In the second part of lesson one-
&gt;&gt; Then they can learn to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.270
customize those views.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.450
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay, so you're changing
the color of a font or size on an image.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.960
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.180
Then this part three, we should teach
them how to position views on a screen.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.750
&gt;&gt; So it's like bottom left or top right
or where is it going on the font screen.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Good, so

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.479
let's begin at the beginning.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.893
&gt;&gt; The first thing in Android you need
to know is something called views.

00:01:49.893 --> 00:01:51.230
&gt;&gt; Views.
