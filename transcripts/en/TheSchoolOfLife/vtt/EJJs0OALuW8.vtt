00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.870
There are people we are friends with for one
major but often maligned or overlooked reason:

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.970
because we were friends with them some time
ago. At one stage, it might be decades ago

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.450
now, we had a lot in common: we were both
good at maths but bad at French at school

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.460
and had a shared liking for table tennis;
or we had adjacent rooms at college and used

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.540
to help each other with assignments and commiserate
in the bar about failed dates or maddening

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.329
parents; or maybe we were interns in the same
big firm with the same (as we thought at the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.309
time) bizarre and intemperate boss. But life
has taken us on radically different courses.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.999
Now they’ve got three young children; they
moved to the Orkneys where they are managing

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:48.559
a fish farm; they’ve gone into politics
and have become a junior minister or they’re

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.030
working as a ski teacher in the Rocky Mountains.
The daily realities of our lives may be miles

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.929
apart; we may know little of their world and
they of ours. If we were introduced today,

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:06.789
we’d think each other pleasant enough but
would never get close. Yet it can be hugely

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:12.229
helpful and very redemptive to catch up with
these people, with a one-on-one dinner, a

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.430
walk in the woods or the occasional email.
These friends function as conduits to earlier

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.469
versions of ourselves that are inaccessible
day-to-day but that contain hugely important

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:31.159
insights. In the company of the old friend,
we take stock of the journey we have travelled.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.679
We get to see how we have evolved, what was
once painful, what mattered or what we have

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:42.000
wholly forgotten we deeply enjoyed. The old
friend is a guardian of memories on which

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.670
we might otherwise have a damagingly tenuous
hold. We need old friends because of a crucial

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.369
complexity in human nature. We pass through
stages of development and as we do so, discard

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:02.261
previous concerns and develop a lack of empathy
around past perspectives. At fourteen, we

00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:07.700
knew a lot about resenting our parents. Twenty
years later, the whole idea sounds absurd

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.070
and ungrateful. Yet the old friend reconnects
us with a particular atmosphere and, like

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.390
a novelist, makes us at home with a character
– ourselves – who might otherwise have

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.781
seemed impossibly alien to us. At twenty-two,
we found single life extremely painful. We

00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:30.250
hung out a lot with a particular friend and
shared a litany of wistful, alienated thoughts.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.250
At forty-five, with a young family around
us, we may find ourselves increasingly curious

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.190
about being single again and fantasise about
the joys of casual hook-ups. The old friend

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.730
has crucial news to impart. We experience
life from a succession of very different vantage

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.440
points over the decades, but tend – understandably
– to be preoccupied only with the present

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.590
vista, forgetting the particular, incomplete
but still crucial wisdom contained in earlier

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.290
phases. Every age possesses a superior kind
of knowledge in some area or other – which

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.180
it then, usually, forgets to hand on to succeeding
selves. Remembering what it was like not to

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.030
be who we are now is vital to our growth and
integrity. The best professors remain friends

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.330
with their past. They remember what it was
like not to know about their special topic

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.640
– and so don’t talk over the heads of
their students. The best bosses are in touch

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.730
with their own experience of starting out
as a lowly employee; the best politicians

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.970
clearly recall periods in their lives when
they held very different views to the ones

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.900
they have now formulated, which allows them
to persuade, and empathise with, hostile constituencies.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.540
Good parents keep emotionally in touch with
the feelings of injustice and sensitivity

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.230
they had in early childhood. Kindly wealthy
people remember what it was like not to dare

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.900
to walk into a fancy food shop for fear of
being patronised. We are always better long-term

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.820
lovers if we have an avenue of loyalty back
to who we were when we first met our beloved

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:17.780
and were at an apogee of gratitude and modesty.
Old friends are key activators of fascinating

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.840
and valuable parts of the self that we need,
but are always at risk of forgetting we need,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.600
in the blinkered present.
