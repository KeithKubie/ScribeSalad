we've been in what is called the modern

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220
we've been in what is called the modern
 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.790
we've been in what is called the modern
age since the Scientific Revolution and

age since the Scientific Revolution and
 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.100
age since the Scientific Revolution and
the secret to the modern age or the

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110
the secret to the modern age or the
 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.810
the secret to the modern age or the
magic of the modern age was the

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820
magic of the modern age was the
 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.790
magic of the modern age was the
scientific method and reducing what's

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800
scientific method and reducing what's
 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.160
scientific method and reducing what's
complicated in two buckets that can be

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170
complicated in two buckets that can be
 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.740
complicated in two buckets that can be
understood and that reductionist method

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750
understood and that reductionist method
 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.650
understood and that reductionist method
is been the driver of great progress in

only problem with a reductionist method
 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.089
only problem with a reductionist method
is that it's not the way the universe

one have seen that problem so now we're

one have seen that problem so now we're

either burn up the planet or on the

either burn up the planet or on the
social side we will increase inequality

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389
social side we will increase inequality

to the point that we have civil strife
 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:14.969
to the point that we have civil strife
and civil wars and so my search was

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979
and civil wars and so my search was
 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:17.579

really for you know how could one design
