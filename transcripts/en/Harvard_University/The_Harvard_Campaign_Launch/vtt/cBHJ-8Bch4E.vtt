[APPLAUSE]

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.380
So Bill, thank you very
much for doing this.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.350
You are very famous
for, among other things,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.474
not having graduated
from Harvard.

00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:40.390
Have you ever thought
what you could have made

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.430
of yourself had you actually--

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.850
actually stayed and
got your degree?

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.990
Well, two times ago, when
I was last in this hall,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.320
I was giving a speech and Mark
Zuckerberg was in the audience.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.390
So I-- I got him to drop out.

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:02.430
The true thing--
you know, I ended up

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.080
going a total of three years,
and I took a lot of courses.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.060
So I'm not really a
drop out in the sense

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.100
that I fled the university.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.810
I was having so much fun.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.330
It was just that it seemed
like, unless we got in

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.990
on the ground floor, we were
going to miss the opportunity.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.430
Well, when you
applied to college,

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.740
you applied to Harvard,
Yale, and Princeton.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.050
And suppose you hadn't
gotten into Harvard,

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.100
and you'd only gotten
into Yale and Princeton.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.580
Do you think the value of
being a drop out of Yale

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.720
or a drop out at Princeton
would have been as valuable?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.430
Well, there's the prestige of
turning Harvard down, which--

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.340
I don't have that.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.264
So you've got--
famously, you got--

00:01:42.264 --> 00:01:43.930
you did very well on
standardized tests.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.330
You got 1590 out of 1600.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.160
Have you ever thought
what that question

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.820
was that you got wrong?

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.510
Well, the truth is, I went--

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.590
that was the verbal SAT.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.450
I got 790 the first time.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.200
I told my parents their
vocabulary wasn't large enough.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.110
And I was criticizing them.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.080
So I did go back and take it,
and do better the next time.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.680
OK.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.720
So when you were at
Harvard, you did enjoy it,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.840
but you were famous for
playing a lot of poker.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.660
You were famous for
auditing a lot of courses.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.850
And famous for not attending
the courses that you

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.230
were supposed to be taking.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.690
So what would you say was
the great experience you had,

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.632
and what you learned
the most out of Harvard?

00:02:25.632 --> 00:02:27.340
Well, you know, when
you come to Harvard,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.410
there are so many
brilliant people.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.920
And for a lot of people in
your high school realm--

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.200
and you probably have
fairly key positioning.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.930
You're one of the more studious,
one of the better at math

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.430
or science--

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.180
you have something that people
understand your positioning.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.550
Well, when I came to Harvard,
in my freshman class,

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.880
we had 80 people in
one class, all of whom

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.970
personal positioning was,
I am the best math person.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.940
And so we had 79 frauds.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.460
And so I thought, well,
I'm probably not going

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.960
to be the best at this.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.260
In fact, a great
guy, Andy Braiterman,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.790
who's a lawyer in New York,
was first in that class.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.310
So I decided I would be
the guy who never attended

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.930
any class he was signed up for.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.830
So within my first
month, I figured out

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.650
that was my unique positioning.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.840
And I hoped that 80
other people wouldn't

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.200
steal that positioning.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.800
But it turned out no
one else imitated me.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.450
But you started out, you were
going to be a math major,

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.010
and you finally
realized there might

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.760
be somebody better in
math, so you decided

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.980
to be an applied math major.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.785
Is that true?

00:03:36.785 --> 00:03:39.160
Well, there were certainly
people better than me at math.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.370
I mean, I took the
Putnam and scored well,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.470
but not at the top.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.660
The main reason I
switched to applied math

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.170
was that Harvard had this
strange rule, that you--

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.210
if you were trying
to get into a class,

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.670
like some movie class, or
political science class that

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.120
was very crowded, if you
were in applied math,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.210
you could pretend to be
applying math to that domain,

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.880
and be treated as though
you were a student majoring

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.499
in that field.

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:06.790
But they never pinned you down.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.790
So you could use it as
a kind of wild card.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.610
And there were a bunch
of economics courses

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.400
I wanted to get into,
including Mike Spence's

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.500
micro-economic course,
that I would not

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.870
have been able to
get into unless I

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.750
could say I was applying
applied math to economics.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.360
So it was a great choice.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.200
OK.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.460
So when you gave your--

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.890
you received an honorary
degree from Duke-- from, uh,

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.210
from Harvard a few years ago--

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.130
[AUDIENCE GROANS]

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.050
--his wife-- his
wife went to Duke.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.170
She has a real degree.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.156
Actually, she has two.

00:04:40.156 --> 00:04:40.780
Both from Duke.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.090
His wife got the honorary
degree from Duke this year,

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.970
and you got an honorary degree
a few years ago from Harvard.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.760
And in that, you said that you
wanted to be in the Radcliffe--

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.860
the dorms, because you
concluded that there

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.510
were more women than
men there, and you

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.810
had a better chance of scoring
a date if you were in Radcliffe.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.800
Well, it's still a
very, very low chance.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.459
So it didn't work out.

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:05.500
They had hamburgers, too.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.940
You could get
hamburgers for lunch,

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.315
no matter what
they were serving.

00:05:08.315 --> 00:05:11.230
That was exciting.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.770
Obviously, you
famously left Harvard.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.270
Your parents-- when you called
your parents up and said,

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.530
look, I'm going to drop out
of Harvard, what did they say?

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.292
Well, you never say that
you're dropping out of Harvard.

00:05:23.292 --> 00:05:26.230
You know, I went on
leave from Harvard.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.520
And so if things hadn't
worked out for my company,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.090
for Microsoft, I could
have always come back.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.870
Now, eventually they changed the
course catalog and requirements

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.280
enough, nobody would
know what it would mean.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.980
And I was so close
to graduating.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.510
So, you know, my parents
probably thought within a year

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.210
or so the thing would collapse
and I'd be, like, a year off.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.950
Like studying
abroad or something.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.937
But had-- the truth is, had
you graduated and stayed,

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:55.270
would it have made a difference?

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.620
In other words, would
the world be different

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.994
because you couldn't
have started

00:05:57.994 --> 00:06:00.610
your company by graduated,
having not dropped out, or not?

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.570
No, it turns out that
the urgency we felt--

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.160
that if we hadn't
started in 1979--

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.600
if we'd waited and started
in 1980, or even 1981?

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.720
Because of the way we
thought about the problem,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.680
because we were so
software-oriented,

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.750
and thought it--

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.240
and most companies weren't
focused on software.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.762
People did software as sort of
a side deal because they had to.

00:06:28.762 --> 00:06:30.970
But the hardware was what
you paid all the money for.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.620
The software just came free.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.650
So the idea of
software companies

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.540
wasn't around all that much.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.670
So we-- in fact,
although we felt

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.780
like we had to do it
that day, an extra year

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.390
would have-- would have been OK.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.100
It wouldn't have changed
the course of history

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.940
to hang out another year.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:50.440
OK.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.750
So when you started
your company,

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.510
you were the chief software
engineer, in effect--

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.170
architect.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.450
And you were also the CEO.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.820
When you started it, to
be realistic about it,

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.830
did you actually ever
think it could take off

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.790
to the extent it did?

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.930
Or what did you think
the realistic goal was?

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.370
Well, I had what you might call
an inconsistent view, which

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.630
worked out very well.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.590
One view was that there'll
be a computer on every desk

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.950
and in every home
running our software.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.230
And so that would be billions
of copies of our software.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.420
And that our-- we should
do everything for that.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:32.400
But then when it came to
spending money, renting things,

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.700
I had a view that, OK, maybe
we could triple in size.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.730
And I ought to do enough in
terms of how I structured

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.820
things, to triple in size.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.290
So that was kind of my man--

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.310
there was my vision,
which was grand.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.610
My management view,
which was to triple.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.040
And then there was my,
OK, do we have enough cash

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.990
if nobody pays us?

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.190
So I always liked to have--

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.957
because we had a few
customers go bankrupt,

00:07:55.957 --> 00:07:58.290
because being in the personal
computer hardware business

00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.712
was pretty chaotic.

00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:01.170
I always wanted to
have enough cash

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.090
to pay everybody for a year.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.650
And still, to this
day, Microsoft

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.194
has enough cash to pay
everybody for a year.

00:08:08.194 --> 00:08:09.360
More than a year, I'd think.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.000
Yeah, more than a year.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.850
So when you started,
how did you avoid

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.710
what so many other entrepreneurs
are unable to avoid,

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.136
which is taking venture capital
money and diluting themselves?

00:08:21.136 --> 00:08:23.010
You didn't really take
venture capital money.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.010
How did you avoid that?

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:24.510
Yeah.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:30.080
We got-- software, if you
can sell it in volume,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.419
has extremely
favorable economics.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:36.919
Because the costs
are quite finite,

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:40.400
and you can scale the
volume, in our case,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.330
to sell millions of copies.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.630
You know, every
Apple II computer,

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:49.110
Commodore Pad, IBM PC, had
copies of our software.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.860
So our income went up a lot.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.590
So we didn't have to
build any factories.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.290
We were cash positive.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.525
And we didn't have a
year where we lost money.

00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:01.400
You know, the first few
years, OK, Paul and I

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.450
worked for free--

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.400
Paul Allen, who
was my co-founder.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.550
But after that, we were
just generating cash.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.250
We eventually gave away--

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:14.330
or sold-- 5% of the
company for a $1,000,000--

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.040
so a $20 million valuation--

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.300
just to get a venture capital
company to join our board,

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.890
and give us some adult
advice about various things.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.410
Which actually was--
was quite helpful.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.637
We picked one in the Valley--

00:09:28.637 --> 00:09:30.470
a guy named Dave Marquardt
came on our board

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.150
and did a fantastic job.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.350
That money sat in the bank.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.240
It's still in the bank today.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.420
So it was not for anything
to do with capital,

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.224
but rather just
to join the team.

00:09:40.224 --> 00:09:41.390
And he's still on the board.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:41.630
Yep.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.340
He's still on the
board [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:48.241
and is still extremely helpful
as a lot of important decisions

00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:48.740
get made.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.810
So when you were
starting, Steve Jobs

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.910
was also starting his
company, not long after.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:54.410
Yeah.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.030
He was in India when we started.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.572
A year later.

00:09:56.572 --> 00:09:57.071
Yeah.

00:09:57.071 --> 00:09:57.690
OK.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:01.100
So when his software was
developed at one point,

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.780
it was thought to be
very good software,

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.760
but he didn't want
to license it.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.050
Was that helpful to you?

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.770
Because his software was so
good at that time that your--

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.830
if he had licensed it, there
would have been no need for IBM

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.180
or others to license
your software?

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:15.680
Yeah.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.763
It's a little complicated.

00:10:16.763 --> 00:10:18.160
So there's three phase of Apple.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.534
There's the Apple II
era, where Wozniak did--

00:10:22.534 --> 00:10:24.200
Steve Wozniak, who
is a great engineer--

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.940
did the Apple I software.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.510
Then he got kind of lazy,
or wasn't focused on it.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.870
So I got to do the
Apple II Basic,

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.210
and licensed that to Apple.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:39.950
Then there's the Mac era, where
they did all their own system

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.710
software, and we were
the big application

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.150
provider for the Mac.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.880
And because we were doing so
well with our Mac application

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.190
software, we kept telling
Apple they should license

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.750
their software to other people.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.750
Because it would have
been better for Microsoft.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.100
Although ironically, that
would have had competed

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.900
with MS-DOS and Windows.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.120
They, for a while,
thought about doing it,

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.380
and then chose not to do that.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.670
And then-- then comes
the era of, sort of,

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:09.440
post-Mac, where they do
all the different things,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.080
and still keep it
proprietary to them.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.546
So truthfully, if they had
done it in the Mac era,

00:11:14.546 --> 00:11:15.920
that would have
been good for us,

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.620
because our applications
share was so--

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.370
so strong.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.290
And we totally believed
in the licensing model.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:22.790
You know.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:27.830
Today, Windows and Android
follow the licensing model,

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.120
and have a very high share.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.170
Although Apple's managed,
on a reasonably modest share

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.240
by our standards, to make an
incredible amount of money.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.130
Now, IBM decided to build a PC,
and they wanted to get somebody

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.210
to provide the software.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.668
They thought, I guess, that
hardware was the most important

00:11:43.668 --> 00:11:46.820
thing, and they'll have some
software provided by somebody.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.950
How did you manage
to get that contract,

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.080
and do you think IBM
made a mistake by not

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.030
buying the software
from you, as opposed

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.100
to licensing it from you?

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:55.600
Yeah.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.849
They certainly made a mistake.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:03.600
But they-- you know, IBM is a
great company that's done many,

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.760
many great things.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.750
The actual project
that did the IBM PC

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.490
was started by the IBM
management committee,

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.880
more to prove that they
could do products quickly.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.290
They were seeing
four year cycles

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:16.998
between when they
decided to do something

00:12:16.998 --> 00:12:18.050
and something shipped.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.610
So they had a
facility in Florida,

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.310
Boca Raton, that had
done a product systems,

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.600
hadn't done well.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.900
So they told them, you guys,
do a personal computer,

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.370
and try and do it in 18 months.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.100
And your strategy is going
to be to use third parties.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.805
So they went to Intel for the
chip, UPS for the software,

00:12:34.805 --> 00:12:37.520
a group called Computerland
for the distribution,

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.144
and the goal was just
to do it really quickly.

00:12:41.144 --> 00:12:42.560
So we wrote the
software for that.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.643
The volume protections
they had for it were, like,

00:12:44.643 --> 00:12:48.120
200,000 or 300,000 units
over a three year period.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.000
So they didn't view
it as important.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.150
Ironically then, that
thing was hyper successful.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.500
And so the divisions--

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.320
the dedicated word processor,
the small business machine--

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.160
they got completely taken over
by this tiny little group.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.900
And so the fact that
they didn't know

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.240
it was going to be
such high volume

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.890
meant that the way they
negotiated with us--

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.890
we thought it was going
to be super high volume,

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.270
and they didn't.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.720
And, you know, then
that can lead to them

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.370
thinking they got a good deal.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.516
Which they didn't.

00:13:17.516 --> 00:13:18.230
OK.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:22.190
So in those days, you were
a rival, a bit, for Apple,

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.570
to some extent, with Steve Jobs.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.670
But at one point,
he needed money,

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.710
and you put up some
money to bail out Apple.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:31.260
What was that like, when he had
to come to you to get money?

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.110
Well, yeah.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:36.680
So in the Apple II era,
we did software for them,

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.470
and we were kind of
friendly competitors.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.230
Then when they started
the Mac, Steve came to us.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:44.905
And we actually put more people
on the Mac than Apple had,

00:13:44.905 --> 00:13:47.030
because we wanted to do
all this application stuff.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.040
So we were really
very much partners.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.900
Then Steve gets kicked
out of the company.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.950
He's not the CEO during
that period at all,

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.280
but he is the head
of the Mac project.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.050
And so we're working closely.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.330
Then Sculley comes
in, he's gone.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:03.200
Then there's this management
that wasn't doing so well.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.650
That was negotiating with
us on a bunch of things.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.160
And it was taking forever.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.550
I think it'd been a
year of negotiation.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:14.210
And so when Steve comes
and takes over the company,

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.476
he sort of said, hey, of the--

00:14:16.476 --> 00:14:18.350
I want it this, this,
and this, and I'm going

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.558
to give this, this, and this.

00:14:19.558 --> 00:14:21.870
So we did the deal
in three days.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.620
Including putting
money into the company.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.480
We bought, I think,
6% of Apple, which

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.430
our lawyers thought,
for anti-trust reasons,

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.930
we shouldn't hold on to.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.870
It would've been nice if we had.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.210
But we mostly,
besides the cash, we

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:37.919
committed to do our Mac
application software,

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.210
and really support the company.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.657
And then Steve, through
great management,

00:14:41.657 --> 00:14:42.740
turned the company around.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.830
First on the Mac, and then
did a bunch of new products

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.249
that made it extremely valuable.

00:14:48.249 --> 00:14:50.540
Before all that happened,
you took your company public,

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.580
I think, in 1986, or so.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.360
Exactly.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.280
And you were 31.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.440
More or less.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:56.960
Right?

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.810
So you're 31 years old, and
you're very, very wealthy,

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.060
at least on paper.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.760
Did you think at the time that
the company could actually get

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.110
much bigger than it had been?

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.610
And did you realize
how wealthy you were?

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:08.510
Did it change your life?

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.301
Or you just kept working
as hard as before.

00:15:10.301 --> 00:15:12.300
You didn't really pursue
any outside activities

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.370
after you realized how
wealthy you'd become at 31?

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:21.170
Well, I was very
fanatical about the job.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.742
And so there wasn't
any spare time.

00:15:22.742 --> 00:15:24.200
I mean, in my 20s,
I didn't believe

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.080
in vacation or weekends.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.734
In my 30s, I started
believing in weekends.

00:15:29.734 --> 00:15:31.400
And then it wasn't
until I met Melinda I

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.250
started believing in vacations.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.410
Now, I believe in
multiple vacations.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.670
I mean, I've completely
given up fanaticism.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.980
But fanaticism is for
people in their 20s and 30s,

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:43.645
by and large.

00:15:43.645 --> 00:15:45.770
It has its virtues.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:50.930
And so it's very abstract
that there was that value.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.390
I did start to read
up about foundations.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.320
Because the idea that
someday, maybe in my 60s,

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.740
I thought at the time, I'd have
some resources to give away,

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.290
and how would you do that?

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.270
I remember seeing the
"Fortune Magazine" cover

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.800
where Warren talked about--

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.780
Warren Buffett talked
about that it's not

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.990
necessarily a favor to your kids
to leave huge sums of wealth

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.754
to them, and I--

00:16:12.754 --> 00:16:15.170
I read that thing-- you know,
this might be relevant to me

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.820
some day.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.014
That was before I'd
met and become--

00:16:19.014 --> 00:16:20.930
later got to be very
good friends with Warren.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.263
I thought, oh, this pretty wise.

00:16:22.263 --> 00:16:26.930
I hadn't considered the
distortionary effects of this.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:32.150
So it didn't change my
life at the time, but--

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.651
Oh, OK.

00:16:32.651 --> 00:16:34.233
So you take the
company public, you're

00:16:34.233 --> 00:16:36.000
still running your
tunnel visions over it.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.770
But one thing I
wanted to ask you

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.375
about with respect to the
software that you created.

00:16:39.375 --> 00:16:41.720
Which I've used for many
years, and many people

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.820
here have as well.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.530
Why, when I want to turn on
my software and computer,

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:46.940
do I need to have three fingers?

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.269
Control, Alt, Delete.

00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.810
What is that?

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.810
Where is that from?

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:51.935
Whose idea was that?

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:59.620
Basically, because when
you turn your computer on.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.380
you're going to see some
screens and eventually type

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.200
your password in, you
want to have something

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.950
you do with the keyboard
that is signaling

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.410
to a very low level
of the software,

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.720
actually hard coded
in the hardware,

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.760
that it really is
bringing in the operating

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.542
system you expect.

00:17:16.542 --> 00:17:18.250
Instead of just a
funny piece of software

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.710
that puts up a screen that
looks like a login screen,

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.450
and then it listens
to your password,

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.130
and then it's able to do that.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.579
So we could have
had a single button

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:30.610
that the guy who did
the IBM keyboard design

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:33.280
didn't want to give
us our single button.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.050
And so we had--

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.550
we programmed a little level
that you had to-- it's-- it was

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:37.480
a mistake.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.899
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.380
We did some very clever things.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.310
The IBM PC character set.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.680
Usually, you have 128
characters-- like the lower

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.850
case and upper case.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.300
But we took the upper ones, and
we put, like, suit symbols in,

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:57.970
and--

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.340
we were able to experiment
with a lot of stuff.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.340
But more on the software
side than the hardware.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.030
OK.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.710
So you're running
the company, and it's

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.617
becoming very, very big,
and bigger and bigger,

00:18:07.617 --> 00:18:09.450
and you're becoming
wealthier and wealthier.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.326
At what point did you say,
look, I got so much money,

00:18:12.326 --> 00:18:13.700
I've got to do
something with it.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.090
Was it your father
who came to you

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.506
and said, Bill, you've got to
do something with this money

00:18:17.506 --> 00:18:18.660
and create a foundation?

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.420
What created your
first foundation?

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.560
What was the impetus behind it?

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.470
Yeah, so I get married
in January, 1994.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.680
My mom passes away that year.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.570
And then my dad is sort
of saying to me, hey,

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.720
you're getting all
these requests.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.670
Why don't you just
send them to me,

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.910
and I'll sort of sort through
them and show them to you,

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:49.560
and you can decide if you
want to fund some of them.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.280
So he's looking at any
general requests that came in.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.820
Then another really capable
Microsoft executive,

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.460
Patty Stonesifer,
decided to retire,

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.660
and I wanted to put computers
in libraries all over the world.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:09.330
And so she created an
entity that was doing that.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.452
And so we went from,
like, '94 to '97

00:19:12.452 --> 00:19:14.160
where we have those
two different things.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.810
And it was a total of,
maybe, $150 million a year

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:20.310
being given away.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:25.110
Then, because there were--
they had complementary skills,

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.440
we put it together into
one foundation for Patty

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.910
to be the CEO of in 1997.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:35.612
So it built up from my dad sort
of saying, saying at night--

00:19:35.612 --> 00:19:37.320
you know, I told my
dad, look, this money

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.969
is still increasing in
value and I'm pretty busy.

00:19:40.969 --> 00:19:42.760
But he said, no, I'll
make it easy for you.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.180
And it was nice, because
then I got down the learning

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.130
curve a little bit.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.520
So you-- you're obviously a
very smart, very driven person,

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.090
very focused.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.090
Did you ever think it
would be difficult to find

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:57.570
a spouse that would be
able to keep up with you?

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:58.590
Yeah, I suppose so.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.030
I mean, not keep up.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.390
But, you know, I think
everybody worries about

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.570
whether there's some match for--

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.481
So how did you happen
to meet your wife?

00:20:09.481 --> 00:20:10.980
She was working
at-- she graduated--

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.320
Well, there's an
element of luck.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.209
She graduated from Duke, and
she went to work for Microsoft,

00:20:16.209 --> 00:20:17.000
as I understand it.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.370
And then how did you happen
to actually meet her?

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.660
And was that complicated,
dating somebody who

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.470
is working in your own company?

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:24.330
Yeah.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.570
I mean, there's--

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.120
She didn't work very
directly for me.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.030
And at first, we
weren't serious at all.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:37.830
I mean, I was
serious about work,

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.469
and she was serious
about work, and then

00:20:40.469 --> 00:20:42.510
it kind of surprised both
of us, that, like, wow,

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.990
I actually might like to spend
a lot of time with this--

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.620
this person.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.830
So it kind of snuck
up on us, I'd say.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:50.530
In a good way.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:51.030
OK.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:55.200
So now your foundation is now
the Bill and Melinda Gates

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.880
Foundation, and you decided, you
know, I think at the age of 50,

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.760
more or less, to
retire from Microsoft,

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.190
and to devote the rest of
your life, more or less,

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.900
to philanthropic things.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.120
So why did you decide to
do it at, let's say, 50,

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.620
and was it difficult to withdraw
from running a company you had

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.744
built, and to really devote
the rest of your life

00:21:15.744 --> 00:21:17.910
to something different than
what you have been doing

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.100
for 20 or 30 years?

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.871
Well, certainly in my 20s,
Microsoft was everything.

00:21:22.871 --> 00:21:23.370
You know.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:28.975
Every minute, every sense of
hey, am I doing good work?

00:21:28.975 --> 00:21:31.530
You know, I knew
everybody's license plate.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.910
I could tell you when they
drove into the parking lot,

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.110
when they left.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:37.980
You know, so it's
kind of extreme.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:44.850
And so you're-- you're going
from that to having a wife,

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.670
having kids, having vacations.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.700
And you know, that
felt really good.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.280
It felt like it was appropriate.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.170
There comes a point
where you feel like, OK,

00:21:55.170 --> 00:22:01.410
what I'm doing at the Foundation
has more of a unique ability

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:02.370
to take pieces--

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.940
take science, take economics,
take systems, change,

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.460
delivery-- and put
those pieces together,

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.180
and get the story to the
people who need to hear it.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.430
It felt like it really was
a ground floor opportunity.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.680
And it was great
that the Foundation,

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.690
you know, by the
time I switched,

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:22.300
which is 5 and 1/2 years
ago, it had, by then,

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:26.730
250 employees and was
running quite well.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.860
So I wasn't doing
it from scratch.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.320
It just was beginning
to grab my attention.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:38.310
And so I decided, OK, I'll make
that my full time endeavor.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.860
And that it used
the things that I

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.810
enjoy about meeting
with scientists,

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:46.360
and trying to do things that
are high risk, but if they work,

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.830
might have a big impact.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.980
And you know, at
some point you've

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.430
got to flip from
your primary thing is

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.600
your business to your primary
thing being the philanthropy.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.189
And so I--

00:22:59.189 --> 00:22:59.980
I made that change.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.450
Which was a big change for me.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:05.350
So you have famously
decided that two major areas

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.910
of the Foundation-- one is K
to 12 education in the United

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.880
States, another is health
care in emerging markets,

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.190
particularly in Africa--

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.680
how did you come
to those two areas

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.480
as the one you
wanted to focus on,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.150
and was it difficult for you to
actually come to an agreement

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:20.930
among yourself
and, say, Melinda,

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.800
about what you
wanted to focus on?

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.990
Yeah, the global health thing
was pretty straightforward.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:32.980
It's easy not to be aware
of the number of children

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.695
who die in ill health.

00:23:34.695 --> 00:23:36.070
You know, if you're
a poor child,

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:41.710
you have 50 times more chance
of dying before the age of five

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:43.620
than a person in the rich world.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.250
And that's partly
because you're not

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.708
getting the right
medicines, partly

00:23:46.708 --> 00:23:49.180
because if you live
in equatorial areas,

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:53.260
things like malaria are
threatening you and not

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.950
threatening the rich countries.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.820
So the idea that that's the
greatest inequity in the world,

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.610
you know, jumped out at us.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:04.660
Both from a visiting
Africa and parts of Asia,

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.640
and a numeric point of view.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.490
You know, many people think
that, OK, Syria is terrible.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.490
Yes, it's incredibly terrible.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.850
But a few hundred thousand
over several years

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:19.780
is less than 6 million per year.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.420
Now that's the number of
children under five who die.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:27.430
When the Foundation got
started, it was 12 million.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.550
So over a period
of about a decade,

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:32.800
it's gone from 12 million
a year to about 6--

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.290
a little more than
6 million a year.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:39.370
And we'll get it down in our
lifetime to under a million

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:40.460
a year.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.030
So the equity between
the poor and the--

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.140
the rich will largely
be eliminated.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.480
So that one was clear.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:50.020
Then the question was, OK,
given that we live in the United

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:56.380
States, the framework of
business, law, education,

00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:01.299
Lakeside Harvard, that allowed
the fortune to be created

00:25:01.299 --> 00:25:02.090
was here in the US.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:05.290
And so what do you
do to give back?

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.200
And there, we picked education.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:13.360
Because in terms of equity, or
economic growth, in our view,

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.120
that's the big missing
piece, because it's not

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.150
operating very well.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.850
And if it can operate well, it--

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.010
it has this monstrous effect.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:24.550
And that was pretty
easy to agree on.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:26.920
Because we had a lot
of chats about it.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.720
Neither of us really
varied from that at all.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.931
So the Foundation is called
the Bill and Melinda Gates

00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:33.430
Foundation.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:35.350
Suppose you disagree
on what to do?

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.400
How do you decide what to do?

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.530
It's like raising kids.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.070
I mean, you talk, and talk--

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.870
And work it out.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:41.730
OK.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:42.610
There's quid pro quo.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.960
Somehow it always works out.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.840
It's never been that
difficult. Because we're

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.890
talking about what
people should we pick,

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:50.770
and what organization
structure--

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:52.270
we're going off on
different trips.

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.190
And it's a lot of
fun to talk about it.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:57.340
You know, in Microsoft,
I had that relationship

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.010
with Paul Allen for the
first 10 years or so.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.200
Then I had it with Steve,
where, even though I

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.210
was CEO for most
of it and he was--

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:05.020
we ran it together.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.670
Now, the Foundation--

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.965
Melinda is amazing
at playing that role.

00:26:08.965 --> 00:26:09.680
OK.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.880
So today, let's talk
about Warren Buffett.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.930
You mentioned him.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:16.930
How did you actually get to
meet Warren Buffett initially?

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:20.290
And how did you develop such
a close relationship with him?

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.630
Well, it was a
very strange thing.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:27.820
My mom said that she was having
Kay Graham and Warren Buffett

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:32.260
and a bunch of people
to a party on July 4th,

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.690
and I needed to come.

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.480
And I said, I'm working, Mom.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.970
And she said, no,
no, you have to come.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.760
So I said OK, I'll take a
helicopter out to this place,

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.640
stay two hours, and
then I'll go back.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.460
And that-- that
seemed to satisfy her.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.882
So I went out and I met Warren.

00:26:51.882 --> 00:26:54.340
And I thought, hey, what do I
have in common with this guy?

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.850
This guy buys and sells stocks.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:57.660
You know, what does
that do to the world?

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.190
It's just paper.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:03.640
And, you know, the fact that
people look at, like, trends,

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.365
and volumes, and they
see things going on

00:27:05.365 --> 00:27:08.800
in those wiggling things,
it's not that big value added,

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.750
really.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:15.700
And so he started
to ask me questions

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.590
that no one had asked me about.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:19.750
The computer business,
the software business,

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.640
why IBM hadn't been
able to do this,

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.910
what we are good at, why other
companies hadn't come along,

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.150
what we were doing
about growth, pricing--

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:33.140
just all the questions that, you
know, I sat and thought about.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.110
And so then I thought,
well, hey, this guy

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.080
asked good questions.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.370
I was asking about
banking, and loans, and why

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.320
he invested in certain things.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.670
But not in terms of the
prices of the stock,

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.550
but the dynamics
of the businesses.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.190
The people, the
products, the pricing.

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:52.060
And basically, so I say I fell
in love with Warren that day.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.580
He was so interesting.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.520
And we've been super
close friends ever since.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.046
So you play bridge
a lot with him.

00:27:59.046 --> 00:28:01.420
And what is it like to have
two of the smartest and maybe

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.220
the two wealthiest people
in the United States,

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:04.945
and you're playing
bridge and you lose,

00:28:04.945 --> 00:28:06.500
is that very humiliating?

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.260
I mean, you're very wealthy
guys, you're very smart,

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.620
and you play bridge
and you don't win?

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:16.780
Well, we put-- Warren and
I love to play bridge.

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.060
It's very relaxing.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.230
You know, great game--
you can play it online.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:24.490
There are thousands of
truly great bridge players

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.420
that are way better than we are.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.530
For amateurs, we're pretty good.

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.450
But it's relaxation.

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.510
And so we play with people who
are way better, who point out

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:37.450
to us mistakes that we make.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:40.360
You know, it's a fun endeavor.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.160
We don't ever bet or anything.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.270
So what did you--

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:46.790
well, I guess you don't need
to make any more money, so--

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:51.610
So what did you think when
he called you up one day

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:52.807
and said, guess what?

00:28:52.807 --> 00:28:54.640
I'm going to give you
the bulk of my fortune

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.540
to your foundation.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:56.350
Were you shocked?

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:58.710
And how do you think
he came to that?

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:07.870
Most of the time I knew
Warren, from 1994 on,

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:10.450
he was in the mode I'd
been in for a while, which

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:13.900
is that he felt his
wealth was accumulating,

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:19.390
and so it was probably best
that it be given away later.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:23.530
Or he just liked having
the capital to accumulate.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:27.220
He assumed that he would
die before his wife Susie,

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.430
and she was given
the responsibility

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.610
to run a foundation
and give it all away.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:36.730
Tragically, she
died before he did.

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:41.260
And this is about 7
and 1/2 years ago now.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.350
And it was kind of unusual.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.650
A few months after that,
he said to me, you know,

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:50.440
the logical thing
would be for me

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.770
to give money to
your foundation.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:54.910
And that's all he said.

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:56.576
He said that would
be the logical thing.

00:29:56.576 --> 00:29:58.800
And I thought about it, and
I thought, well, we are--

00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.660
we are a large--

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.910
OK, I guess that'd be logical.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.590
But it wasn't like he was
going to do it or anything.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.890
Then the next time I saw
him, he said, you know,

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:07.570
it really would be logical.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.390
And I thought, he may
be serious about this.

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.132
I said to Melinda,
he might actually

00:30:12.132 --> 00:30:13.090
be thinking about this.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:16.150
And it was completely
out of the blue.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:19.480
And then a month after
that he talked to his kids,

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:25.210
made very generous gifts for
them to create foundations.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.890
Actually, they'd had
their smaller foundations,

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:31.270
but made them quite substantial.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:34.720
And there was another foundation
focused on reproductive health

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.220
things.

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:39.400
So a total of five
foundations got resources,

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.130
but a large, large
percentage came to us.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:44.080
So it was a fantastic thing.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.890
And we were able to take
our mission in health,

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:48.950
and add agriculture.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:50.950
We were able to take our
mission in K through 12

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:54.820
and add some
college level stuff.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.400
So it's really
enabled us to scale up

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.120
what we do very dramatically.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.970
So what are the assets
now of the foundation?

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.790
Yeah, the assets
are $36 billion.

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:08.910
But the gift-- but Warren
gives, on a yearly basis,

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:14.600
stock that's now worth
$2.3 billion a year

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.490
to the Foundation.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:18.590
Berkshire's had a
particularly good year.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:21.460
And so the corpus
that I'm saying,

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.860
that's the money I put in.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.050
So you actually have
to almost double it

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.510
in terms of the yearly payout.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:30.530
How much are you giving
away a year, annually?

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.110
We're just over
$4 billion a year.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.820
$4 billion?

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:33.430
Yeah.

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:37.139
And how do you measure
the success of the money

00:31:37.139 --> 00:31:37.930
that you give away?

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.179
Do you have very good metrics?

00:31:39.179 --> 00:31:41.290
Or you just don't really
have perfect metrics--

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:42.520
I guess there are
no perfect metrics--

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.520
but how do you follow up
and make sure that it's

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.360
being used the way you want?

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.935
Well, some things are pretty
straightforward to measure.

00:31:48.935 --> 00:31:51.670
You know, the number of
children who die every year,

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:53.170
the way that number's
measured, it's

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:57.590
accurate to within,
certainly, plus or minus 5%.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:00.610
And so if your goal is to
drive that number, you know,

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:03.190
from 12 million to 6 million,
which is where we are now,

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:06.070
and from 6 million to 1
million, you either succeed

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.402
or you don't succeed.

00:32:07.402 --> 00:32:08.860
That one requires
tons of partners.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:09.740
That's not just us.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:13.000
That's development aid budgets,
and delivery organizations,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.870
but we're part of that
movement, and, you know,

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:19.370
really pushed a
lot of new science,

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:21.666
including new vaccines, into it.

00:32:21.666 --> 00:32:23.290
So then you have more
near-term things,

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.690
like have you discovered a
malaria vaccine, or an AIDS

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.790
vaccine, or a TB
vaccine, and you

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:30.370
look at the scientific
progress there.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:33.570
And that is a little
softer, but you--

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:34.990
you can tell.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.752
In education, if you're
giving scholarships,

00:32:37.752 --> 00:32:38.710
that's straightforward.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.501
If you're putting
computers into libraries,

00:32:40.501 --> 00:32:41.470
that's straightforward.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.960
If you're trying to help improve
the K through 12 personnel

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.110
system so that the average
quality of teaching is much

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:50.840
better-- that is, the
really good teachers share

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.810
their secrets and certain
incentives and professional

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:59.360
development are put in, so that
the average moves up to the top

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:04.220
quartile, from today's average
to the top quartile today,

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.700
that, because it's subject
to so many uncertainties,

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.600
including school boards,
political processes,

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:16.100
union negotiations, desire
to maintain the status quo--

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.060
if you said to me, are we making
progress on that one or not,

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.450
I could talk for a long
time, but I wouldn't

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:25.850
be able to give you a number.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.520
And so, you know,
the very risk of it,

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.120
and the complexity of the
system change that's necessary,

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.370
makes that tougher to measure.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:38.420
I'm a total fan of measurement,
you know, where it can be done.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:42.470
But to the degree that would
drive you to low risk things

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:47.030
and steer you away from trying
to improve K through 12 US

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:50.990
education, then the
fetish towards measurement

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:52.490
can be taken too far.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:56.100
So your foundation is not to
be a perpetual foundation.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.749
As I understand it, 50 years
after the last spouse dies,

00:33:59.749 --> 00:34:01.040
it's supposed to be terminated.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:01.910
Is that more or less right?

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:02.410
Yeah.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:03.695
We lowered it from 50 to 20.

00:34:03.695 --> 00:34:04.195
20.

00:34:04.195 --> 00:34:04.850
OK, sorry.

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:05.720
So 20.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.949
So what is the theory behind
doing it after just 20 years?

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:12.790
Why not have it like the Ford
or Rockefeller Foundation,

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:13.969
go on forever?

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:16.429
Well, those in perpetuity
foundations are amazing,

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:19.639
and we partner
with a lot of them.

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:23.469
For us, the theory is
that we pick some causes--

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:26.030
education, you know,
global health--

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:30.440
and we can actually
see childhood death

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.010
in our lifetime getting
to be pretty small.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:36.310
And so we have this very
specialized organization.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:38.120
And we have malaria experts.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.429
We have vaccine
manufacturing experts.

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:41.941
We are an institution.

00:34:41.941 --> 00:34:43.690
It's not just the
amount of money we give.

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:45.739
We are about global health.

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:47.449
We have people who
think-- you know,

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:51.889
have done 20,000 of hours of
videotaping of good teachers,

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:54.259
mediocre teachers,
looked at what that is,

00:34:54.259 --> 00:34:55.550
thought about teacher training.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:58.580
So it's a purpose-built
organization.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:03.290
And we think that whatever
our ideas are about change

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:06.610
in our lifetime
plus 20, you know,

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:08.360
they'll either work or not work.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.980
And then it's up
to rich people who

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.310
are alive, who are looking
at the current problems,

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:18.380
and politics, and technology,
and understanding of learning,

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.680
to decide to give
their money, as opposed

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:28.530
to picking some weird board who,
God knows what they would do.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:33.150
And there will be
plenty of money,

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:36.980
but that's just our choice
not to perpetuate some name,

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.890
because these missions
don't-- they're not--

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:41.690
they will be solved by someone--

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:45.780
hopefully us, but by somebody
within the next 40 or 50 years.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:46.280
OK.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.696
So today, you have
a large number

00:35:47.696 --> 00:35:49.195
of people working
at the Foundation.

00:35:49.195 --> 00:35:51.810
There's 800 people, or
something like that.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:53.870
So it's a bit of a bureaucracy.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:55.130
800 people is a lot.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:57.720
So if you decide you
want to do something,

00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.784
do they do what you want?

00:35:58.784 --> 00:36:00.700
Or do they kind of come
back to you and argue,

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.240
and you have a hard
time getting things done

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.406
through your own foundation?

00:36:03.406 --> 00:36:05.420
Or that's not a problem?

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.349
Well, we get them to
argue with each other.

00:36:08.349 --> 00:36:09.890
If you only have
one person who works

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:16.600
for you, that can be very
difficult. No, seriously,

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.370
it's like Microsoft was,
with about 1,000 people,

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:23.480
where the understanding
of the analytics, the bias

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.400
towards action,
the understanding

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:29.420
the different mixes of skill
sets that are required.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.340
It's pretty exciting to go in.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.965
I spent this morning discussing
our pneumonia strategy,

00:36:33.965 --> 00:36:36.660
because there are some
partners here in Boston

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.910
who are part of that strategy.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:42.920
It's really fun to go through
the discussion about which

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.300
paths we ought to take.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.930
So it's-- sure, there's debate.

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:52.470
But you have a lot of knowledge.

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:56.210
You know, many of the
problems we work on,

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:59.930
it's amazing how little
has been put in to them.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:03.110
Like malaria, or
pneumonia, or diarrhea,

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:05.360
or designing new toilets.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.370
It's amazing how
little has been done.

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:09.470
So you spend a lot of
time traveling the world,

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:11.827
as does Melinda, meeting
with government officials.

00:37:11.827 --> 00:37:13.910
Is it ever hard to get a
meeting with a government

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:14.680
official for you?

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.013
Or are they always welcome
you because they think you're

00:37:17.013 --> 00:37:18.660
going to bring a lot of money?

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.926
They've been very nice.

00:37:19.926 --> 00:37:21.202
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:27.380
No, it's great.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.250
The ability to take things
like their childhood death rate

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:33.760
and get that higher
on their priority,

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.210
you know, to have
them understand

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.280
how they compare to
other countries, what

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.280
it is about the way they
organize primary health

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.050
care that's not working.

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:43.820
The way they normally
pick a cabinet,

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.640
and the way democracy
normally works.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.540
The great injustice of
ill health, and the fact

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:53.120
that that actually,
paradoxically,

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.090
means they have very
high population growth,

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:58.400
and therefore feeding people
and maintaining stability,

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:02.600
is going to be very difficult.
That's not part of their--

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.090
people aren't coming in and
educating them that on a day

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:05.589
to day.

00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:10.510
But yeah, the access
has been super good.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:14.632
Once I wanted to go see Gaddafi,
and Melinda made me hesitate,

00:38:14.632 --> 00:38:15.590
and then he got killed.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.390
So I never got to see him.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:19.550
So, how do you deal
with the problem

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:20.840
of wealth and your children?

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.840
You have three children.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.980
So obviously, growing up as the
children of Bill and Melinda

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:30.569
Gates obviously has some pluses
and some nonplusses, let's say.

00:38:30.569 --> 00:38:32.360
How do you deal with
wealth, and how do you

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:35.420
get them interested in
philanthropy as well?

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.390
Well, it's certainly
distortionary to have

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:40.760
parents who are well
off, or just have

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.060
parents who are well known.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.940
And you know, we've
said to the kids

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:51.390
that the money's going to
the Foundation, not to them.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:53.610
And so they won't be--

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:54.390
except if--

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:56.280
What was their reaction to that?

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.580
Well, every year they're
thinking about that,

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:03.300
and get to ask about it.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:07.800
You know, I don't
think kids want that--

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.360
I mean, partly
because they've been

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.520
told that all along-- but
I don't think a kid ever

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.590
comes in and says, yeah, I
should have $500 million.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:17.280
I should be able to sit around.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.900
I should be able to
buy a sports team.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.313
I mean, what the heck?

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:26.190
In terms of your own
contribution to society,

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:28.285
what you learn, you know,
go off, be a doctor.

00:39:28.285 --> 00:39:30.090
Go off, be a scientist.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:32.010
Go off, be a social worker.

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:36.330
If you have this pile whose,
you know, sort of leverage

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:39.300
of it being used
well kind of exceeds

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.520
any individual
contribution, I think

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.340
that would be a
very strange thing.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.140
And it's not just
you who sees that.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.510
It's your friends,
everybody around you.

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:51.240
And, you know, you
kind of stick out.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:55.290
You're not going to have to
ever worry about certain things.

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:57.870
So we've said that to them.

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:00.790
And, you know, they know
we're quite sincere.

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:03.660
They've had a chance to travel
the world and see these things.

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.669
But we're not saying
to them that they'll

00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:07.460
have any role at the
Foundation, or they'll

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.610
have their own foundations.

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:09.739
Nothing like that at all.

00:40:09.739 --> 00:40:11.280
But, now you've
decided to leave them

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.020
some money, but a modest amount.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.180
Yeah, there's this thing
about, you know, enough

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.060
so they'll never need
anything, but enough so they'll

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:18.960
have to work.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.800
That number probably
doesn't exist.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.430
So you know, we're
probably leaving them

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:25.490
a little too much for
one of those goals,

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:27.300
and too little
for the other one.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.700
So how do you compare the
emotional and intellectual

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.970
excitement of building Microsoft
with the intellectual and

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:35.272
emotional excitement of
solving the problems you're

00:40:35.272 --> 00:40:35.980
dealing with now?

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:36.771
Are they different?

00:40:36.771 --> 00:40:39.660
And what is more rewarding
for you, or has been?

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:43.710
I think when you're young,
the very hands-on stuff, where

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:46.080
you're writing
the code yourself,

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.250
and you've just got to prove,
you know, do I understand this?

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:51.750
Can I get this done?

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:55.290
I think that's just phenomenal.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:58.290
So I was very lucky to
have that experience.

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.780
Then as Microsoft
got larger, my role

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:06.000
was more indirect, in terms of
picking teams, backing teams,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.620
picking general directions.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:11.680
And so my role, when I left my
full time work at Microsoft,

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.460
and what I'm doing now at the
Foundation is very similar.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:16.170
Now, the domains--
I have to understand

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:21.220
vaccines, and northern
Nigeria dysfunction.

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:24.610
So the problems-- the specifics
on the problems are different.

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:28.660
And that's let me broaden
the kind of science exposure

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:30.690
that I get, which I've enjoyed.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:35.250
But it's pretty darn similar
to what I was doing in my 40s

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:38.340
at Microsoft, what I'm
doing in the Foundation now.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.850
So you meet a lot of very
smart scientists now.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:44.700
Have you met some who you
say, these people are so smart

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:46.920
that even I can't
keep up with them?

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.014
Oh, absolutely.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.280
The world is very specialized.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.321
You know, it's like these
people who play bridge.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:59.910
I don't care how
much general extra

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:03.150
IQ you bring to the problem.

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:06.700
You are not going
to catch up to that.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.330
And likewise, in all these
areas that the Foundation works.

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:10.830
And, you know, there
are some people

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:12.620
who just, when it
comes to the sciences,

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:13.620
are really unbelievable.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.410
Now, it's very fun to
have those people around.

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:18.300
And part of the reason
I'm willing to learn

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.600
a lot of science is, I know
if I ever get confused,

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.040
there are people like Nathan
Myhrvold, [INAUDIBLE],

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.790
I can just send mail
to them and say,

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:27.570
hm, I'm a little
confused about this.

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:28.320
Straighten me out.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.840
So you don't ever feel like
you're going to hit a dead end,

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.229
in terms of your understanding.

00:42:33.229 --> 00:42:34.770
So do people come
to you all the time

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:36.960
and say I'd like your
advice about something,

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.650
but they really want your money?

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:39.760
Have you ever had that?

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.260
Yeah.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.130
You've probably done
that to someone.

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:44.670
Not to me, you haven't.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:45.480
Seriously.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.190
But yeah, sure.

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:51.450
So how do you deal
with requests that

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:53.460
are not in your core
areas of your foundation?

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.585
People come to you, they
might be friends of yours,

00:42:55.585 --> 00:42:57.222
or they might be
other things that you

00:42:57.222 --> 00:42:59.430
might be interested in, but
just not your core areas.

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:01.500
You just basically--
how do you learn to say

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.670
no to all these requests?

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.800
You must get an
incessant amount of them.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.500
Well, if it's coming
from a stranger

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:11.470
and it's not in an area
the Foundation works,

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:13.270
then it's very easy to say no.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:16.170
You know, we don't do cancer.

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:17.830
It's great that people do.

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:19.860
It's very, very important work.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.270
But we don't.

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:24.300
And, you know, so that's easy.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.801
If it fits into the Foundation,
then because of our scale,

00:43:27.801 --> 00:43:30.300
we have a staff that can look
at things and really evaluate.

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.020
You know, if anybody has
ideas about malaria, great.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:39.750
We look at every idea about
malaria in great depth.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.570
The tough thing is
when it's people who

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:44.220
you have relationships with.

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.640
Friends, or people that
you've asked money for.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.660
Then you have to consider
it, and, you know,

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:53.300
it's probably wise to
set aside, you know, 10%,

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:59.420
15% of your philanthropy
for socially-related--

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.356
and they're not terrible things.

00:44:01.356 --> 00:44:03.480
Some of them are going to
be things you kind of go,

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.110
oh, jeez.

00:44:06.391 --> 00:44:06.890
All right.

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:09.077
So sometimes you do
make some exceptions.

00:44:09.077 --> 00:44:09.910
But let me ask you--

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:12.486
Yeah, I'm not pure.

00:44:12.486 --> 00:44:14.360
What would you say is
the most exciting thing

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.460
you have done with your money,
in terms of giving it away?

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.440
What was-- is there some
achievement that you're really

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.310
particularly proud of?

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:20.630
I know it's ongoing,
but is there

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:22.060
one or two things
you would cite,

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.140
and one or two things you
would say is a regret?

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.305
That you wish you hadn't
done with your money?

00:44:26.305 --> 00:44:34.460
Oh, what we're doing
to eradicate polio,

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.800
which, if we're
lucky, by 2018 it

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.365
will become the second
disease after smallpox

00:44:39.365 --> 00:44:41.540
to be completely eradicated.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:44.030
That is really exciting.

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:46.490
And, you know, it's
down to three countries.

00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:48.860
Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan.

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.560
And, you know, it's complicated.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.350
I'll meet on Monday with
the president of Nigeria,

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:57.320
the president of Pakistan-- you
know, we're still very hopeful.

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:58.400
That is pretty exciting.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.940
Because we've had to bring,
you know, satellite mapping,

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:04.730
using cell phones,
better vaccines,

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:07.790
and reaching out to
religious leaders--

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:10.280
a lot of different
things come together.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.410
I'd say in terms of
what's measurably

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:17.020
been done, the work on
childhood death and childhood

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:19.490
sickness, that's what
we're most proud of.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:23.360
And that's largely been
done through vaccines.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:27.210
It would be great if our
education stuff worked.

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:31.220
But that we won't know
for probably a decade.

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:35.750
If polio succeeds, then we'll
take on malaria and measles

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:36.470
in the same way.

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:40.350
Try to go, in our lifetime,
for the eradication of those.

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.190
So what would you like
to see as, ultimately,

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:45.875
your business legacy and
your philanthropic legacy?

00:45:45.875 --> 00:45:47.500
Obviously, you've
got a long way to go.

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:50.477
But if, today, you were to say
this is what I accomplished

00:45:50.477 --> 00:45:52.102
in business I'm most
proud of, and this

00:45:52.102 --> 00:45:54.830
is what I've accomplished today
in philanthropy, what would

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:55.940
you say they are?

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.760
Well, business is hard,
because, you know,

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:03.170
Microsoft was a significant part
of the creation of the software

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:08.090
industry, the personal computer,
which led to the internet.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:10.830
And, you know, there were many
other companies, some of them,

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:12.290
you know--

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:14.000
yes, Steve Jobs
did important work.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.610
But there's, like, a lot
of other people, too.

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:18.770
He and I were the
most prominent.

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:21.680
But history always
kind of oversimplifies.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.290
You know, there were people
who did things that completely

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:28.450
failed, but were very suggestive
of the right answer to fix,

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:33.424
so-- the competitive
dynamics leads to these--

00:46:33.424 --> 00:46:34.340
some of these markets.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:38.190
Winner take all, you
know, type results.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:41.580
You know, where today you're
seeing Google, Facebook,

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.930
and certain elements
benefit from those dynamics.

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:47.350
So I can't really characterize--

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:50.120
you know, personal
computing, internet software,

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.950
happened a little bit
better, a little bit faster.

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:56.390
But you can't really pull
out one individual's thing.

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:59.720
You know, even if you took a
company, if you said Microsoft,

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.470
then there's a much
bigger contribution.

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:04.610
But even so, you know,
saying that trying

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:07.430
to do some counter-factual
on that is very hard.

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:10.842
So I don't think you can
ever sum up a contribution.

00:47:10.842 --> 00:47:12.800
Why wouldn't you say,
take a look at your life.

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.700
You have a life that
most people would envy.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.964
A lot of money, a wonderful
family, very well respected.

00:47:18.964 --> 00:47:20.630
Successful in everything
you've touched.

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:22.088
Are there any
regrets in your life?

00:47:22.088 --> 00:47:25.591
Can you make the rest of us
feel OK that something isn't

00:47:25.591 --> 00:47:27.590
perfect in your life, and
you have some regrets,

00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:32.570
so we can just feel we're more
simpatico with you in that way?

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:35.770
No, I'm super, super lucky,
and I wouldn't trade places

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:39.930
with anyone close to my age.

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:43.120
It's been a lot of fun.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.510
You know, there's tons of
things that I'm not good at.

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:49.870
And so the question is always,
can I get somebody involved,

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:51.280
you know--

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.650
you know, certain day to
day management things,

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:55.900
negotiating things,
political things.

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.120
Scientific experts who
really do have the time

00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:02.380
to focus in on one thing,
like I did in my 20s,

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:06.640
and just really, really
see all the possibilities.

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:13.960
And, you know, I'm known for
being fairly tough sometimes.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:14.890
I think I'm mellowing.

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:17.530
I'm more-- trying to be more
generative in these things.

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:21.310
So I have work to
do on those things.

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:25.210
My wife always gives me good
feedback on those things.

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:26.980
If you had not--

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:30.160
if Microsoft hadn't really
taken off, let's suppose,

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.500
have you ever thought what
you would be doing today,

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.030
or what you would have
done with your life?

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:35.740
In other words, suppose
Microsoft just turned out to be

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:37.715
another software company
that didn't make it--

00:48:37.715 --> 00:48:40.210
of which there were
thousands in those days--

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:42.460
what do you think
you'd be doing now?

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.480
Well, software is
pretty magical stuff.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:48.940
So even if I'd been consigned
to a pretty modest role

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:56.380
in the software game-- software
in the 1980 to even now--

00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:00.760
and we're just at the beginning,
because speech, vision--

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.640
you know, software's
getting really good.

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:07.990
And some great Holy
Grails of that industry

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:12.730
that I sat and dreamed about
as a freshman here at Harvard,

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:18.140
we're finally making great
progress on those things.

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:21.721
So even if I had had to
do a fairly small company,

00:49:21.721 --> 00:49:23.470
I don't think I would
have ever felt like,

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:25.630
oh, I should go be a lawyer--

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:26.780
which my dad was.

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:29.230
And when I was very
young, I originally

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:30.640
thought that's what I would do.

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.580
Or a mathematician, which
has certain prestige,

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:37.090
but very few people get
to contribute to it.

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:39.720
So software-- either
software research,

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.400
or even having a modest
software company--

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.510
I think that that--

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:46.630
there are eras where
certain kinds of endeavors

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:48.377
are having more impact.

00:49:48.377 --> 00:49:49.960
You know, it's not
like I think, oh, I

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.831
wish I'd been doing auto
engineering in the 1980s.

00:49:52.831 --> 00:49:54.580
I'm not trying to
denigrate the people who

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:55.705
are doing auto engineering.

00:49:55.705 --> 00:49:57.550
But it wasn't in a--

00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:01.530
an exponential, change
the world type mode.

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:04.540
You know, today there are
certain things in biology,

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:08.530
hopefully in energy, still
in the software IT space.

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:12.170
So there's more domains now
that are changing the world.

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:15.490
So you know, young people have
more choices where they could--

00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:17.710
they could-- and I'm
not saying economics--

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:21.280
just in terms of their
IQ, having huge impact--

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.140
there's more choices today
than when I was young.

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:27.190
So given the financial
success you have,

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:28.630
and all the things
you have today,

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:31.337
would you give them up for 10
additional years of your life?

00:50:31.337 --> 00:50:33.170
Let's suppose you could
be 10 years younger,

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:34.410
but you had to give
away all your money,

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:36.760
but you know you're going
to live 10 years longer

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.327
and have good health in that.

00:50:38.327 --> 00:50:40.035
Or would you be happy
with where you are?

00:50:40.035 --> 00:50:40.942
I'd prefer 20.

00:50:40.942 --> 00:50:41.442
20.

00:50:41.442 --> 00:50:41.942
OK.

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:46.410
We can negotiate for 15.

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:46.910
Yeah.

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:51.340
Now, you're obviously the
world's largest philanthropist.

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:53.230
But you've also
tried to proselytize

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:55.630
a little bit on philanthropy
by starting The Giving

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:57.790
Pledge with Warren
Buffett and Melinda.

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:01.180
Can you explain what The Giving
Pledge is supposed to do?

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:04.180
Well, it grew out
of a dinner that--

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:06.445
Warren said, hey,
let's go talk to people

00:51:06.445 --> 00:51:09.182
who are doing philanthropy,
and see how they got into it,

00:51:09.182 --> 00:51:11.140
what they like about it,
you know, what do they

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:14.920
think about staff, or causes.

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.065
And so we had,
actually, four dinners.

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:21.940
And it was wonderful to
hear people's passion,

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:23.856
and the different things
they were working on.

00:51:23.856 --> 00:51:26.745
We weren't trying to convince
them to give to our causes,

00:51:26.745 --> 00:51:28.990
and except for very
few cases, they

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:31.100
were trying to convince
us to give to theirs.

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:33.774
It really was just
sharing about giving.

00:51:33.774 --> 00:51:35.440
And at the end of
each of those dinners,

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.210
people said, hey,
what should we do

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:41.580
to maybe get other
people to start younger,

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:43.990
or to feel less
isolated, that they

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:46.390
could learn from each
other about this thing,

00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:49.090
and draw out a bit
more people in,

00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:52.300
because we think they'll
feel good about it.

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:54.580
And we talked about
a few constructs.

00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:57.210
So this idea of a pledge
to give more than half--

00:51:57.210 --> 00:52:01.150
that the very most successful
could come together

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:03.220
in a group that had
done that, and learn

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:04.930
from each other,
share experiences,

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:06.750
positive and negative,
with each other--

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:09.400
that sort of came into being.

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:12.920
And amazingly, when we
first called around,

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:18.760
I think we got about 35
people fairly quickly into it.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.310
You know, you join
fairly early on.

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:23.740
And now it has been-- it's
a yearly get together,

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:26.470
although there's more
special learning sessions

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:29.090
that people go to-- about
three or four of those a year.

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:30.730
I've met a lot of
interesting people.

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:32.470
I've learned a lot.

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:35.570
And, you know, I think
people are a little smarter,

00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:37.220
and starting a little earlier.

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:40.760
So you now have a long
time to probably continue

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.240
doing what you're doing.

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.870
But do you think you'll
ever slow down and really,

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:46.850
let's say, relax in
a traditional sense?

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:49.320
Or are you going to be driven
like this for another 10, 20,

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.630
30 years?

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:57.170
Hopefully, I can stay at a high
level of intensity into my 80s.

00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:58.160
I'd like to.

00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:01.652
I don't-- you know, I'm
not very good at golf.

00:53:01.652 --> 00:53:03.680
But you did take up golf, right?

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.640
Not really.

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.920
I mean, I--

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.690
I was out there
hitting the ball,

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:11.587
but I never got
that good at that.

00:53:11.587 --> 00:53:13.670
You should try what I do,
which is miniature golf.

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:15.860
It's a lot easier.

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.630
So have you ever
thought, when you

00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:20.780
do slow down, if you ever do
slow down, maybe in your 80s,

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:24.890
you might come back to Harvard
to complete your degree?

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:27.410
A couple of credits left.

00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:29.080
Well, I don't know.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.120
I take a lot of college courses.

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:39.070
The online free stuff has gotten
very good in these new moves

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:42.830
where Harvard's doing edX,
and there's Coursera Udacity.

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:45.420
But The Learning Company DVDs--

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:47.630
now they have
streaming, finally.

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:51.950
But, you know, Meteorology,
Biology, Geology, I highly

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:56.160
recommend-- you know, I just
took Oceanography last month.

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:59.030
These are really,
really good courses.

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:00.860
So it's kind of ironic
that I'm a drop out,

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:03.770
because I love college
courses probably

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:05.720
as much as anyone around.

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.220
Well, you've had
a remarkable life,

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.560
and you're obviously
a very famous person

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:10.580
who's attended Harvard.

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:12.440
And Harvard is
very proud of you.

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:15.194
And we very much appreciate
your giving us this time today.

00:54:15.194 --> 00:54:15.860
Thank you, Bill.

00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:17.670
Well, thanks.
