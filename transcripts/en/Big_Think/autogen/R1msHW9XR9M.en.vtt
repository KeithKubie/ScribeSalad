states to to do this I think a third

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300
states to to do this I think a third
 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.599
states to to do this I think a third
thing for the president to do is to

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609
thing for the president to do is to
 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.760
thing for the president to do is to
again use the bully pulpit and I say

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770
again use the bully pulpit and I say
 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.020
again use the bully pulpit and I say
that because you know the federal

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030
that because you know the federal
 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.279
that because you know the federal
government has very little to do with

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289
government has very little to do with
 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.680
government has very little to do with
with education and all he can do is

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690
with education and all he can do is
 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.389
with education and all he can do is
encourage you can't really do very much

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399
encourage you can't really do very much
 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.790
encourage you can't really do very much
more than that but I think a third thing

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800
more than that but I think a third thing
 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.900
more than that but I think a third thing
would be to try to encourage more

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910
would be to try to encourage more
 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.520

talented people to go into teaching and

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530
talented people to go into teaching and
 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.609
talented people to go into teaching and
to go into education because we need

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619
to go into education because we need
 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.190
to go into education because we need
good teachers if we're going to deal

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000
what he can actually do except maybe by
 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.669
what he can actually do except maybe by
setting an example and i think it's i

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679
setting an example and i think it's i
 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.559
setting an example and i think it's i
