01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:54.460
case and I know I'm address that briefly
yesterday in the discussion I think that

01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:54.470
yesterday in the discussion I think that
 

01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:59.140
yesterday in the discussion I think that
the whole concept of of settling a

01:50:59.140 --> 01:50:59.150
the whole concept of of settling a
 

01:50:59.150 --> 01:51:01.600
the whole concept of of settling a
frontier has biblical connections

01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:01.610
frontier has biblical connections
 

01:51:01.610 --> 01:51:07.300
frontier has biblical connections
because when Jews come to settle Israel

01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:07.310
because when Jews come to settle Israel
 

01:51:07.310 --> 01:51:09.910
because when Jews come to settle Israel
they perceive it as a resettlement and a

01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:09.920
they perceive it as a resettlement and a
 

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:14.530
they perceive it as a resettlement and a
continuation of the biblical era and and

01:51:14.530 --> 01:51:14.540
continuation of the biblical era and and
 

01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:17.970
continuation of the biblical era and and
the the the text that they refer to when

01:51:17.970 --> 01:51:17.980
the the the text that they refer to when
 

01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:22.300
the the the text that they refer to when
constructing this this narrative our

01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:22.310
constructing this this narrative our
 

01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:27.120
constructing this this narrative our
text that really keep configuring

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:27.130
text that really keep configuring
 

01:51:27.130 --> 01:51:30.700
text that really keep configuring
borders and the notion of frontier so as

01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:30.710
borders and the notion of frontier so as
 

01:51:30.710 --> 01:51:34.050
borders and the notion of frontier so as
to you know settling the desert and

01:51:34.050 --> 01:51:34.060
to you know settling the desert and
 

01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:40.480
to you know settling the desert and
going to promised land etc so i think

01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:40.490
going to promised land etc so i think
 

01:51:40.490 --> 01:51:43.840
going to promised land etc so i think
that here especially the the question

01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:43.850
that here especially the the question
 

01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:45.190
that here especially the the question
that you raised is

01:51:45.190 --> 01:51:45.200
that you raised is
 

01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:47.630
that you raised is
because it's sort of based on a very

01:51:47.630 --> 01:51:47.640
because it's sort of based on a very
 

01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:50.000
because it's sort of based on a very
ancient narrative that in itself i think

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:50.010
ancient narrative that in itself i think
 

01:51:50.010 --> 01:51:54.640
ancient narrative that in itself i think
really stressed this whole concept of

01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:54.650
really stressed this whole concept of
 

01:51:54.650 --> 01:51:57.650
really stressed this whole concept of
geography as as something that really

01:51:57.650 --> 01:51:57.660
geography as as something that really
 

01:51:57.660 --> 01:52:01.640
geography as as something that really
defines a nation I was actually if we

01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:01.650
defines a nation I was actually if we
 

01:52:01.650 --> 01:52:03.470
defines a nation I was actually if we
talked about your case very it's very

01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:03.480
talked about your case very it's very
 

01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:06.920
talked about your case very it's very
obvious that i'm referring to them to

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:06.930

01:52:06.930 --> 01:52:09.970
obvious that i'm referring to them to

within the contours of the modern
 

01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:17.240
within the contours of the modern
nation-state yes then the puzzling

01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:17.250
nation-state yes then the puzzling
 

01:52:17.250 --> 01:52:19.460
nation-state yes then the puzzling
question of how to incorporate them

01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:19.470
question of how to incorporate them
 

01:52:19.470 --> 01:52:21.640
question of how to incorporate them
accommodating them and at the same time

01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:21.650
accommodating them and at the same time
 

01:52:21.650 --> 01:52:24.950
accommodating them and at the same time
modernize them and the question this

01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960
modernize them and the question this
 

01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:28.460
modernize them and the question this
also came out from no arms paper was how

01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:28.470
also came out from no arms paper was how
 

01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:31.370
also came out from no arms paper was how
actually the State of Israel has changed

01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:31.380
actually the State of Israel has changed
 

01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:33.800
actually the State of Israel has changed
through this absorption and the ideas

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:33.810
through this absorption and the ideas
 

01:52:33.810 --> 01:52:37.210
through this absorption and the ideas
and the ideals of the state or it's a

01:52:37.210 --> 01:52:37.220
and the ideals of the state or it's a
 

01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:42.280
and the ideals of the state or it's a
European homogenic base has completely

01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:42.290
European homogenic base has completely
 

01:52:42.290 --> 01:52:45.920
European homogenic base has completely
lost its ground yes well I think even in

01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:45.930
lost its ground yes well I think even in
 

01:52:45.930 --> 01:52:49.850
lost its ground yes well I think even in
this I think some some of the narratives

01:52:49.850 --> 01:52:49.860
this I think some some of the narratives
 

01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:52.160
this I think some some of the narratives
that we see still make make this

01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:52.170
that we see still make make this
 

01:52:52.170 --> 01:52:57.080
that we see still make make this
connection of of Jews coming from Muslim

01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:57.090
connection of of Jews coming from Muslim
 

01:52:57.090 --> 01:53:01.490
connection of of Jews coming from Muslim
countries as something that just just as

01:53:01.490 --> 01:53:01.500
countries as something that just just as
 

01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:03.800
countries as something that just just as
the Muslims and the Palestinians were

01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:03.810
the Muslims and the Palestinians were
 

01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:06.460
the Muslims and the Palestinians were
conceived especially in the beginning as

01:53:06.460 --> 01:53:06.470
conceived especially in the beginning as
 

01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:10.550
conceived especially in the beginning as
something that Rafe eyes the Bible and

01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560
something that Rafe eyes the Bible and
 

01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:12.920
something that Rafe eyes the Bible and
any ancient traditions but but there's

01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:12.930
any ancient traditions but but there's
 

01:53:12.930 --> 01:53:15.050
any ancient traditions but but there's
one more point which which I think needs

01:53:15.050 --> 01:53:15.060
one more point which which I think needs
 

01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:17.750
one more point which which I think needs
to be said regarding how it affects the

01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760
to be said regarding how it affects the
 

01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:22.750
to be said regarding how it affects the
state and this is the political point

01:53:22.750 --> 01:53:22.760
state and this is the political point
 

01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:26.720
state and this is the political point
which which which I think we need to

01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:26.730
which which which I think we need to
 

01:53:26.730 --> 01:53:29.150
which which which I think we need to
remember that there are even in this

01:53:29.150 --> 01:53:29.160
remember that there are even in this
 

01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:30.830
remember that there are even in this
situation where new immigrants are

01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840
situation where new immigrants are
 

01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:33.940
situation where new immigrants are
coming there are multiple sort of

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:33.950
coming there are multiple sort of
 

01:53:33.950 --> 01:53:37.730
coming there are multiple sort of
contestations regarding how to deal with

01:53:37.730 --> 01:53:37.740
contestations regarding how to deal with
 

01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:41.870
contestations regarding how to deal with
this whole concept of absorption and I

01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:41.880
this whole concept of absorption and I
 

01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:47.060
this whole concept of absorption and I
think that that there's one narrative

01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:47.070
think that that there's one narrative
 

01:53:47.070 --> 01:53:48.680
think that that there's one narrative
which is the government's

01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:48.690
which is the government's
 

01:53:48.690 --> 01:53:50.660
which is the government's
and I think they wanted to appropriate

01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:50.670
and I think they wanted to appropriate
 

01:53:50.670 --> 01:53:53.990
and I think they wanted to appropriate
them just you know for the sake of of

01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000
them just you know for the sake of of
 

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.630
them just you know for the sake of of
their own political ends and then there

01:53:56.630 --> 01:53:56.640
their own political ends and then there
 

01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:59.780
their own political ends and then there
are the voices that that stress

01:53:59.780 --> 01:53:59.790
are the voices that that stress
 

01:53:59.790 --> 01:54:02.780
are the voices that that stress
different opinions because again as we

01:54:02.780 --> 01:54:02.790
different opinions because again as we
 

01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:05.720
different opinions because again as we
stated earlier the frontier is something

01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:05.730
stated earlier the frontier is something
 

01:54:05.730 --> 01:54:10.220
stated earlier the frontier is something
which is constantly being revised and

01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:10.230
which is constantly being revised and
 

01:54:10.230 --> 01:54:13.670
which is constantly being revised and
constantly being negotiated and so

01:54:13.670 --> 01:54:13.680
constantly being negotiated and so
 

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:18.490
constantly being negotiated and so
obviously from this whole process the

01:54:18.490 --> 01:54:18.500
obviously from this whole process the
 

01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:20.959
obviously from this whole process the
since the immigrants themselves i mean

01:54:20.959 --> 01:54:20.969
since the immigrants themselves i mean
 

01:54:20.969 --> 01:54:22.910
since the immigrants themselves i mean
the eastern immigrants and mozilla the

01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:22.920
the eastern immigrants and mozilla the
 

01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:24.729
the eastern immigrants and mozilla the
immigrants from Muslim countries

01:54:24.729 --> 01:54:24.739
immigrants from Muslim countries
 

01:54:24.739 --> 01:54:28.580
immigrants from Muslim countries
eventually contested this whole this

01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:28.590
eventually contested this whole this
 

01:54:28.590 --> 01:54:30.439
eventually contested this whole this
whole project it of course eventually

01:54:30.439 --> 01:54:30.449
whole project it of course eventually
 

01:54:30.449 --> 01:54:33.830
whole project it of course eventually
had very big influences on the nation

01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840
had very big influences on the nation
 

01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:35.600
had very big influences on the nation
and the concept of nation and this is

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:35.610
and the concept of nation and this is
 

01:54:35.610 --> 01:54:39.080
and the concept of nation and this is
what I was referring to at the very end

01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:39.090
what I was referring to at the very end
 

01:54:39.090 --> 01:54:41.000
what I was referring to at the very end
end of my talk that these actually

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:41.010
end of my talk that these actually
 

01:54:41.010 --> 01:54:43.700
end of my talk that these actually
became the sites of multiculturalism and

01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:43.710
became the sites of multiculturalism and
 

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:48.110
became the sites of multiculturalism and
diversity as a total opposition I think

01:54:48.110 --> 01:54:48.120
diversity as a total opposition I think
 

01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:50.660
diversity as a total opposition I think
to what the original idea was when there

01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:50.670
to what the original idea was when there
 

01:54:50.670 --> 01:54:52.880
to what the original idea was when there
was this division of everyone becoming

01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:52.890
was this division of everyone becoming
 

01:54:52.890 --> 01:54:56.030
was this division of everyone becoming
sort of one homogeneous society and a

01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:56.040
sort of one homogeneous society and a
 

01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:59.060
sort of one homogeneous society and a
small question was the carpet model

01:54:59.060 --> 01:54:59.070
small question was the carpet model
 

01:54:59.070 --> 01:55:01.400
small question was the carpet model
incorporated in other places in Israel

01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:01.410
incorporated in other places in Israel
 

01:55:01.410 --> 01:55:04.610
incorporated in other places in Israel

karmiel and a-rod and in various other

01:55:06.970 --> 01:55:06.980
karmiel and a-rod and in various other
 

01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:10.220
karmiel and a-rod and in various other
places without connection to climb it at

01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:10.230
places without connection to climb it at
 

01:55:10.230 --> 01:55:13.160
places without connection to climb it at
all oh yeah yeah sure I mean a-rod's is

01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:13.170

certainly had its vogue in places which
 

01:55:20.190 --> 01:55:29.000
certainly had its vogue in places which

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:29.010
are not necessarily a turd okay so then
 

01:55:29.010 --> 01:55:32.330

I talked about national frontier in

01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:32.340
I talked about national frontier in
 

01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:35.620

of the state in itself the project of

02:03:26.170 --> 02:03:26.180
of the state in itself the project of
 

02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:29.350
of the state in itself the project of
the military regime is in itself make a

02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360
the military regime is in itself make a

which is which was a violent project
 

02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:38.200
which is which was a violent project
right so and if you look for example

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:38.210
right so and if you look for example

is a little bit more complicated and has
other reasons for that and this one

02:04:34.450 --> 02:04:34.460
other reasons for that and this one

papers that we have earth today I
couldn't come yesterday but I guess it's

02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:46.670
couldn't come yesterday but I guess it's
 

02:04:46.670 --> 02:04:51.550
couldn't come yesterday but I guess it's
more or less the same or better no I

02:04:51.550 --> 02:04:51.560
more or less the same or better no I
 

02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:55.060

always this question I asked my students

02:04:57.129 --> 02:04:57.139
always this question I asked my students
 

02:04:57.139 --> 02:04:59.200
always this question I asked my students
and it's a question it's not a rhetoric

02:04:59.200 --> 02:04:59.210
and it's a question it's not a rhetoric
 

02:04:59.210 --> 02:05:00.910
and it's a question it's not a rhetoric
question because I don't really know the

02:05:00.910 --> 02:05:00.920
question because I don't really know the
 

02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:03.339
question because I don't really know the
answer and it is what can we learn from

02:05:03.339 --> 02:05:03.349
answer and it is what can we learn from
 

02:05:03.349 --> 02:05:07.180
answer and it is what can we learn from
history and more how can we learn from

02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:07.190
history and more how can we learn from
 

02:05:07.190 --> 02:05:12.490
history and more how can we learn from
history and then this is a very interest

02:05:12.490 --> 02:05:12.500
history and then this is a very interest
 

02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:18.250
history and then this is a very interest
in symposium for that question mainly

02:05:18.250 --> 02:05:18.260
in symposium for that question mainly
 

02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:21.520
in symposium for that question mainly
for architects now I think this

02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:21.530
for architects now I think this
 

02:05:21.530 --> 02:05:23.379
for architects now I think this
situation is very different from done of

02:05:23.379 --> 02:05:23.389
situation is very different from done of
 

02:05:23.389 --> 02:05:26.470
situation is very different from done of

02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:28.030
the 1940s 270 not only because of this
state but because of the architect as

02:05:28.030 --> 02:05:28.040
state but because of the architect as
