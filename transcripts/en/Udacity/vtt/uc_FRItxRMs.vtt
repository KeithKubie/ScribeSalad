00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.350
Categorical data represents characteristics, such as a

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.920
player's position, team, hometown or even, handedness. Categorical

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.050
data can take on numerical values. For example,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.380
maybe we'd use 1 for first baseman and

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.940
2 for second baseman. But these numbers

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.850
don't have a mathematical meaning. That is, we

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.700
can't add them together or take the average.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.520
There's also something called ordinal data, which in

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.290
some sense is a mix of numerical and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.120
categorical data. In ordinal data, the data still falls

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.210
into categories, but those categories have some order or

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.425
ranking. For example, a scout might rank a baseball

00:00:37.425 --> 00:00:39.770
player's power on a scale from very low to

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.350
very high. Another example is that you might give

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.470
a movie anywhere between 1 star and 5 stars

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.250
and these might be ordinal categories. For plotting purposes,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.320
ordinal data is treated much in the same way as categorical data. But the

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.100
groups are usually ordered from lowest to

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.360
highest, so that we can preserve this ordering.
