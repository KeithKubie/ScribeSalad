00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.980
WOW!

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.500
OH WOW!

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.140
Whew...

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.720
Oh, that is the greatest high I've ever been on in my life!

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.960
Sorry, I just combined two of the greatest elements ever, crystal meth and ecstasy.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.980
I call it "crystal methstasy".

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.500
And I have been on THE GREATEST HIGH EVER!

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.220
OH MY GOD, THE WHOLE SUMMER I WAS OUT, MAN!

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.040
Did I miss anything?

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.920
Oh, really? Some of the...highest grossing movies of all time? Huh. Well...

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.240
That sucks!

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.440
I guess, uh, we should probably do a more underground, independent project.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.740
LET'S TALK ABOUT HUNGER GAMES FIVE!

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.060
Oh, sorry, I'm still coming off of that high.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.240
There's this girl named Katniss!

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.500
And she's upset because her boyfriend is crazy!

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.920
Meh, that's most celebrity couples...

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.840
But that won't stop her from taking on an unfair world that doesn't treat her properly!

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.180
And she's using the power of her celebrity to change our unfair ways!

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.220
Oh, wait, I'm sorry. I'm confusing her for Jennifer Lawrence.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.600
Katniss is taking on an unfair world!

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.960
And she's using the power of her celebrity to change our unfair ways!

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.220
Seriously though, I'm a bum, but if we were on the same set, I'd get paid more than her!

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.140
Hey, we should feel lucky she has her own action figure.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.980
So they tell Katniss that they have to rally all the people together...

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.700
So they get all the winners of the other Hunger Games together...

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.100
...like...in every other movie...

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.440
...and they send them out to destroy the Capital!

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.400
And Katniss is like:

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.040
"Hey, aren't you that person that just got married?"

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.500
"Yes, I am and we're gonna spend our honeymoon in the Capital after we take it over!"

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.420
"You are so dead."

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.960
"I know."

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.280
But it turns out the city is littered with booby traps from Raiders of the Lost Ark!

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.840
But it's okay because her crazy boyfriend is there!

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.500
Wait, what?

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.660
"I'm a total liability and I'm gonna kill you all."

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.120
"If you get out of line, I'm gonna kill you."

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.960
"I am promising you, I'm gonna get out of line. You should kill me."

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.600
"Don't tempt me!"

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.760
"I am tempting you. Kill me."

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.300
"I am emotionally compromised by this!"

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.800
"Which is why you should totally kill me."

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.300
"Hah, I just figured out that you are here to sabotage me!"

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.980
"Again why the 'killing me' thing is a good idea."

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.140
"Well, I won't be had in this way! I'll be had in a completely different way!"

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.980
"I have a gun now and I'm gonna try and kill you." *gunshot*

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.480
"WHOA!"

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.400
"Now, do you believe me?"

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.400
"You watch it, mister! I'm only gonna give you five more chances!"

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.940
"I'm starting to wonder who's more crazy here."

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.620
But the soldiers convince Snow that Katniss is dead!

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.440
...again...

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.200
...and again...

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.000
...and again...

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.740
...and anyone realize she dies about as well as a Lord of the Rings character?

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.340
So they go underground in the sewer so they're not seen...

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.960
But what horrifying creation comes after them?!

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.500
Well, in the first film, it was giant dogs.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.000
The second film, giant baboons.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.880
What other computer-generated, really-not-scary thing can we throw at them?

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.140
Giant CG-eyeless people!

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.340
Who Katniss defeats just by putting her hand on one of their faces...?

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.340
(gibberish)

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.140
"I really can't believe this is working."

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.800
"It's okay, I'll break his neck!" *snap*

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.100
"We can break their necks, really?"

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.480
"Ha, it's nowhere near as frightening as that giant bunch of black goo!"

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.560
"Yeah, what did the black goo do again?"

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.200
"It's black goo! I don't know, it's...black goo! It does black gooey stuff!"

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.700
"Oh, by the way, the guy that got married died."

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.860
"Well, duh, he was dead the minute he said 'I do'."

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.580
So Snow offers all the refugees a place to be safe!

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.740
But it's okay because BOMBS come and BLOW 'EM ALL UP!

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.200
WOW.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.800
No, really, whatever your political leaning is, just, the time this is coming out and everything, just...wow!

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.260
I, uh...I need to go into the Uncomfortable Cornerâ„¢.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.780
And so the giant battle, the giant climax, the big moment that ALL these movies have been building up to...

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.400
...TOTALLY doesn't happen.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.560
Yeah, it turns out Maude from The Big Lebowski, she was the bad guy.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.640
In fact, Katniss actually kills her instead of Snow.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.580
Really?

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.900
Really??

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.560
"No, you don't understand! Story-wise, this makes a lot more sense!"

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.400
I-I know, it's just, uh...

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.020
"She had to choose between her own revenge and what's best for the world!"

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.900
I mean, yeah, yeah, it's just...

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.420
"It's proof that all the heroic propaganda they've been pushing in the movie rarely has the ending you'd expect!"

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.500
Yeah, but...all the advertising, all the movies,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.320
"I'm gonna kill Snow! I'm gonna kill Snow!"

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.800
...really??

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.220
She goes after the chick nobody remembers in Lost World?

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.340
"Do you want reality or not?!"

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.420
Obviously not, I was high most of the summer.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.040
"Well, it's okay because we give the unbelievably realistic ending that"

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.400
"nothing happens to her, she goes home, has a family, nobody ever comes after her, and her crazy boyfriend is just suddenly not crazy."

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.100
Oh, you did the fanfiction, last-chapter-of-Harry-Potter route.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.060
"She has nightmares! That's not totally happy!"

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.120
I think this is a very clear example of not having your cake, but eating it too.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.600
"That's Hollywood, baby!"

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.320
The end!

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.320
And so ends the Orwellian young adult book series that gave birth to every other Orwellian young adult book series!

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.200
Seriously, you can combine them all together and have The Divergent Hunger Maze Runner.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.940
But at least it had the future coolest character from The Force Awakens!

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.100
...for about five seconds--

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.960
Yeah, why was she in there?

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.620
Those twin girls made more sense!

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.100
You know, because every book series for young people now have to have twins for some reason!

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.800
...or maybe I was just seeing double, that WAS an awfully long high...

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.460
This is Chester A. Bum saying...

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.240
CHANGE!! YOU GOT CHANGE?! OH C'MON, HELP A GUY OUT, WILL YA?! C'MON, CHANGE!!

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.540
C'MON, I'M LIVING THE HUNGER GAMES EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE!

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.560
Though I am learning how to do my own photosynthethisis!
