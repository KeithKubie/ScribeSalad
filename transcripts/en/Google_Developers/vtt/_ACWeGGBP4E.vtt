00:00:02.814 --> 00:00:04.230
DEENIUS: You never
know in advance

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.854
when you have the
next idea for a song,

00:00:05.854 --> 00:00:08.900
or when you have an idea
you don't know if it's

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.520
going to make it into the song.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.920
So that's why an
app like Topline

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.590
is such an important helper.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.950
We can use it to record and
organize our ideas at anytime

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.740
from anywhere.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.860
DOM DRONSKA: We've been
innovating music recording

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.340
process ever since the
studio has been built.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.260
Perhaps we're most
known for the Beatles,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.330
but, naturally, we
shouldn't forget

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.300
all the other great artists,
starting from Pink Floyd going

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.770
to the latest and the greatest.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.670
So for the last few years,
we've been specifically looking

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.010
at the music writing process.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.020
And we can see how we change.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.120
And we noticed that
people are coming up

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.670
with their ideas,
musical song ideas,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.370
at the worst possible moments.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.080
So we wanted to
develop something

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.610
to make that
initial spark easily

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.095
captured, to make sure that
they don't lose their ideas.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:03.330
IZA KIERZEK: Having
all that in mind,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.710
we created a user friendly, very
minimalistic looking IOS app.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.930
Artists can use it to
record ideas and use

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.712
stacks to organize them
very cleanly in the app.

00:01:12.712 --> 00:01:14.670
DOM DRONSKA: People were
asking for two things.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.000
They're asking for a
version in their country,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.130
and then they were
asking for Android.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.810
There were so many
of those requests

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.970
all over our Facebook,
all over our Instagram,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.120
all over our Twitter.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.270
We just had to develop
it very, very quickly.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.630
IZA KIERZEK: And we have
Miquido said that, well, OK,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.550
we can do it.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.230
But it wasn't as
easy as we expected.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.330
While the app
itself looks simple,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.450
it actually has a very
complicated structure inside.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.730
So we had to look into
innovative solutions

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.450
to make sure that we can get
top line Android quickly.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.390
After some research,
we found Flutter.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.790
MARTIN AGUINIS: Flutter is
a free and open-source SDK

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.510
created by Google.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.240
It features a single
code base, which

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.270
allows you to craft native
apps on both IOS and Android

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.770
at the same time.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.800
One of its key features
is stateful hot reload.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.600
This allows developers
to make changes

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.390
while the app is running in
real time, which speeds up

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.820
the troubleshooting
process immensely.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.550
Flutter also has plenty
of customizable widgets

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.160
to help you build beautiful
interfaces in minutes.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.034
IZA KIERZEK: And we used
one of those widgets

00:02:16.034 --> 00:02:17.910
to create a pretty
neat swipe menu.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.820
Overall, the implementation
of Flutter's SDK and plug-ins

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.680
was very, very simple.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.540
Thanks to Flutter, we
were able to finish

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.180
developing the Android
version in just 10 weeks

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.830
with a small team
consisting only

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.610
of three people, one Android
and two front end developers.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.010
DOM DRONSKA: As we wanted
to democratize music making,

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.230
it was very important
for us to have

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.360
the full versions of the app
available as soon as possible.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.780
So we are super excited
that our app is now

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.435
available on both
IOS and Android.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.790
J FRANCIS: Topline has made
making songs so much easier.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.560
It has become a vital part
in our creative process,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.710
and we're looking forward
to making much more songs

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.550
with it the future.
