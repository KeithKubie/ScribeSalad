00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.058
- LearnStormers, my
name is Josh Sundquist.

00:00:02.058 --> 00:00:03.961
I am a YouTuber, best-selling author,

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:05.988
and a paralympic ski racer.

00:00:05.988 --> 00:00:08.994
I first started ski racing
when I was a teenager.

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:13.247
I went to my first race
thinking I was the best skier

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.853
of all time, and it was
gonna be amazing, right?

00:00:15.853 --> 00:00:18.500
I was super excited about
it, and I'm sure that's kinda

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.431
how you feel when you start
anything in life, right?

00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:23.264
Maybe even when you started this class.

00:00:23.264 --> 00:00:26.198
I went through the course,
and I actually fell

00:00:26.198 --> 00:00:29.049
on the third turn in the course.

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:31.238
That was really disappointing.

00:00:31.238 --> 00:00:34.831
I expected I was gonna ski
really well, and I fell.

00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:37.040
I think that is an
inevitable part of anything,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.203
including this course, right?

00:00:38.203 --> 00:00:40.625
You're really excited at first,
and then something happens,

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:43.863
a problem, you fall, you get
discouraged, and it's in that

00:00:43.863 --> 00:00:47.372
moment I think you have choice
about do you want to quit.

00:00:47.372 --> 00:00:49.642
Do you just want to be
like, "eh, it's not for me

00:00:49.642 --> 00:00:52.616
because I fell" or do
you want to say, "no,

00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:54.003
falling is just part of the process."

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:56.423
It's just something that
happens along the way.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:59.740
If you wanna cross the finish
line at the end race course,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.770
as if you wanna finish the
class, you have to get back up.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.470
I got back up, and I fell down again,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.491
and got back up and fell down.

00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:10.662
I actually fell down five
times in this race course.

00:01:10.662 --> 00:01:13.377
It was not very good, as it turns out.

00:01:13.377 --> 00:01:16.422
But I kept getting back
up, and for that reason,

00:01:16.422 --> 00:01:18.763
I eventually crossed the finish line.

00:01:18.763 --> 00:01:21.455
What I want to say to you
is that when you fall,

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:23.830
when something doesn't work
out quite the way that you

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.490
wanted, when you get discouraged,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.269
and that's not a reason to quit,

00:01:27.269 --> 00:01:30.768
that's just part of the process.

00:01:30.768 --> 00:01:32.444
It's in those moments that
you have to look at the finish

00:01:32.444 --> 00:01:35.022
line that you're trying to reach and say,

00:01:35.022 --> 00:01:36.673
"all right, I'm gonna get back up

00:01:36.673 --> 00:01:39.099
and I'm gonna keep getting
back up as many times

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.766
as it takes until I
cross that finish line."

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:46.750
So, keep up the good work,
keep getting back up,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.038
and good luck in the rest of your class.
