00:00:00.415 --> 00:00:02.103
- [Voiceover] When a major
league baseball player throws

00:00:02.103 --> 00:00:05.637
a fast ball, that ball's
definitely got kinetic energy.

00:00:05.637 --> 00:00:07.581
We know that cause if you get in the way,

00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:09.429
it could do work on
you, that's gonna hurt.

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:10.583
You gotta watch out.

00:00:10.583 --> 00:00:14.212
But here's my question: does
the fact that most pitches,

00:00:14.212 --> 00:00:15.855
unless you're throwing a knuckle ball,

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:19.157
does the fact that most
pitches head toward home plate

00:00:19.157 --> 00:00:21.805
with the baseball spinning
mean that that ball

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:24.197
has extra kinetic energy?

00:00:24.197 --> 00:00:26.571
Well it does, and how
do we figure that out,

00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:28.986
that's the goal for this video.

00:00:28.986 --> 00:00:31.267
How do we determine what the rotational

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:33.647
kinetic energy is of an object?

00:00:33.647 --> 00:00:35.770
Well if I was coming at
this for the first time,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.803
my first guest I'd say okay,

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:40.561
I'd say I know what regular
kinetic energy looks like.

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:42.875
The formula for regular kinetic energy is

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.954
just one half m v squared.

00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:48.567
So let's say alright, I want
rotational kinetic energy.

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:50.963
Let me just call that k rotational

00:00:50.963 --> 00:00:52.497
and what is that gonna be?

00:00:52.497 --> 00:00:54.964
Well I know for objects that are rotating,

00:00:54.964 --> 00:00:58.764
the rotational equivalent of
mass is moment of inertia.

00:00:58.764 --> 00:01:01.461
So I might guess alright instead of mass,

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:04.354
I'd have moment of inertia
cause in Newton's second law

00:01:04.354 --> 00:01:06.813
for rotation I know that
instead of mass there's

00:01:06.813 --> 00:01:09.091
moment of inertia so maybe I replace that.

00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:12.188
And instead of speed
squared, maybe since I have

00:01:12.188 --> 00:01:15.284
something rotating I'd
have angular speed squared.

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:16.898
It turns out this works.

00:01:16.898 --> 00:01:20.014
You can often derive, it's
not really a derivation,

00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:22.516
you're just kind of guessing
educatedly but you could

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:25.797
often get a formula for the
rotational analog of some

00:01:25.797 --> 00:01:29.780
linear formula by just
substituting the rotational analog

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.415
for each of the variables,
so if I replaced mass with

00:01:32.415 --> 00:01:35.247
rotational mass, I get
the moment of inertia.

00:01:35.247 --> 00:01:37.721
If I replace speed with rotational speed,

00:01:37.721 --> 00:01:40.743
I get the angular speed and
this is the correct formula.

00:01:40.743 --> 00:01:43.303
So in this video we needed
to ride this cause that

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:44.913
is not really a derivation,
we didn't really

00:01:44.913 --> 00:01:47.720
prove this, we just showed
that it's plausible.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.111
How do we prove that
this is the rotational

00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:52.991
kinetic energy of an
object that's rotating

00:01:52.991 --> 00:01:54.349
like a baseball.

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:56.997
The first thing to recognize
is that this rotational

00:01:56.997 --> 00:01:59.684
kinetic energy isn't really a new kind of

00:01:59.684 --> 00:02:02.301
kinetic energy, it's
still just the same old

00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:05.721
regular kinetic energy for
something that's rotating.

00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:07.051
What I mean by that is this.

00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:09.820
Imagine this baseball
is rotating in a circle.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.320
Every point on the baseball
is moving with some speed,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.462
so what I mean by that is
this, so this point at the top

00:02:15.462 --> 00:02:18.613
here imagine the little
piece of leather right here,

00:02:18.613 --> 00:02:20.367
it's gonna have some speed forward.

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:23.485
I'm gonna call this mass
M one, that little piece

00:02:23.485 --> 00:02:27.188
of mass right now and I'll
call the speed of it V one.

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:29.744
Similarly, this point on
the leather right there,

00:02:29.744 --> 00:02:32.288
I'm gonna call that M two,
it's gonna be moving down

00:02:32.288 --> 00:02:35.713
cause it's a rotating circle,
so I'll call that V two

00:02:35.713 --> 00:02:38.370
and points closer to the
axis are gonna be moving

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.027
with smaller speed so
this point right here,

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:43.779
we'll call it M three, moving
down with a speed V three,

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:46.771
that is not as big as V two or V one.

00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:48.082
You can't see that very well,

00:02:48.082 --> 00:02:51.587
I'll use a darker green
so this M three right here

00:02:51.587 --> 00:02:54.921
closer to the axis, axis
being right at this point

00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:58.781
in the center, closer to the
axis so it's speed is smaller

00:02:58.781 --> 00:03:01.411
than points that are
farther away from this axis,

00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:03.373
so you can see this is kinda complicated.

00:03:03.373 --> 00:03:05.539
All points on this baseball
are gonna be moving with

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.126
different speeds so points
over here that are really

00:03:08.126 --> 00:03:10.796
close to the axis, barely moving at all.

00:03:10.796 --> 00:03:12.946
I'll call this M four and it would be

00:03:12.946 --> 00:03:15.093
moving at speed V four.

00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:17.676
What we mean by the
rotational kinetic energy is

00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:19.892
really just all the regular
kinetic energy these

00:03:19.892 --> 00:03:23.846
masses have about the center
of mass of the baseball.

00:03:23.846 --> 00:03:26.681
So in other words, what
we mean by K rotational,

00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:29.455
is you just add up all of these energies.

00:03:29.455 --> 00:03:32.021
You have one half, this
little piece of leather

00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:33.737
up here would have some kinetic energy

00:03:33.737 --> 00:03:37.487
so you do one half M
one, V one squared plus.

00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:41.050
And this M two has some kinetic energy,

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.152
don't worry that it points downward,

00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:45.954
downward doesn't matter for
things that aren't vectors,

00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:49.258
this V gets squared so
kinetic energy's not a vector

00:03:49.258 --> 00:03:51.779
so it doesn't matter that
one velocity points down

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:54.443
cause this is just the
speed and similarly,

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:58.950
you'd add up one half M
three, V three squared,

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.517
but you might be like this is impossible,

00:04:00.517 --> 00:04:02.926
there's infinitely many
points in this baseball,

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:05.388
how am I ever going to do this.

00:04:05.388 --> 00:04:07.379
Well something magical is about to happen,

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.526
this is one of my favorite
little derivations,

00:04:09.526 --> 00:04:12.133
short and sweet, watch what happens.

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:15.067
K E rotational is really just the sum,

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:17.661
if I add all these up
I can write is as a sum

00:04:17.661 --> 00:04:21.494
of all the one half M V
squares of every point

00:04:22.457 --> 00:04:25.416
on this baseball so imagine
breaking this baseball

00:04:25.416 --> 00:04:27.756
up into very, very small pieces.

00:04:27.756 --> 00:04:30.072
Don't do it physically but
just think about it mentally,

00:04:30.072 --> 00:04:33.039
just visualize considering
very small pieces,

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.919
particles of this baseball
and how fast they're going.

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.938
What I'm saying is that
if you add all of that up,

00:04:38.938 --> 00:04:41.359
you get the total
rotational kinetic energy,

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:42.967
this looks impossible to do.

00:04:42.967 --> 00:04:44.552
But something magical is about to happen,

00:04:44.552 --> 00:04:45.766
here's what we can do.

00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:48.352
We can rewrite, see the problem here is V.

00:04:48.352 --> 00:04:50.755
All these points have a different speed V,

00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:52.711
but we can use a trick,
a trick that we love

00:04:52.711 --> 00:04:55.125
to use in physics, instead
of writing this as V,

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.773
we're gonna write V as, so
remember that for things

00:04:57.773 --> 00:05:01.564
that are rotating, V
is just R times omega.

00:05:01.564 --> 00:05:04.133
The radius, how far from the axis you are,

00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:06.885
times the angular velocity,
or the angular speed

00:05:06.885 --> 00:05:09.358
gives you the regular speed.

00:05:09.358 --> 00:05:12.145
This formula is really
handy, so we're gonna replace

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:16.185
V with R omega, and this
is gonna give us R omega

00:05:16.185 --> 00:05:18.352
and you still have to
square it and at this point

00:05:18.352 --> 00:05:19.993
you're probably thinking
like this is even worse,

00:05:19.993 --> 00:05:21.079
what do we do this for.

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:24.023
Well watch, if we add this
is up I'll have one half M.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:26.848
I'm gonna get an R squared
and an omega squared,

00:05:26.848 --> 00:05:28.958
and the reason this is
better is that even though

00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.626
every point on this baseball
has a different speed V,

00:05:32.626 --> 00:05:35.491
they all have the same
angular speed omega,

00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:38.315
that was what was good about
these angular quantities

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:41.618
is that they're the same for
every point on the baseball

00:05:41.618 --> 00:05:43.870
no matter how far away
you are from the axis,

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.042
and since they're the
same for every point I can

00:05:46.042 --> 00:05:48.634
bring that out of the
summation so I can rewrite

00:05:48.634 --> 00:05:51.609
this summation and bring
everything that's constant

00:05:51.609 --> 00:05:54.818
for all of the masses out
of the summation so I can

00:05:54.818 --> 00:05:58.220
write this as one half times the summation

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.803
of M times R squared
and end that quantity,

00:06:02.782 --> 00:06:06.597
end that summation and just
pull the omega squared out

00:06:06.597 --> 00:06:08.565
because it's the same for each term.

00:06:08.565 --> 00:06:11.444
I'm basically factoring
this out of all of these

00:06:11.444 --> 00:06:13.857
terms in the summation, it's like up here,

00:06:13.857 --> 00:06:15.548
all of these have a one half.

00:06:15.548 --> 00:06:17.487
You could imagine factoring out a one half

00:06:17.487 --> 00:06:18.985
and just writing this whole quantity as

00:06:18.985 --> 00:06:22.135
one half times M one V one squared plus

00:06:22.135 --> 00:06:24.167
M two V two squared and so on.

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:26.055
That's what I'm doing
down here for the one half

00:06:26.055 --> 00:06:28.615
and for the omega squared,
so that's what was good

00:06:28.615 --> 00:06:31.077
about replacing V with R omega.

00:06:31.077 --> 00:06:32.540
The omega's the same for all of them,

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.816
you can bring that out.

00:06:33.816 --> 00:06:35.514
You might still be
concerned, you might be like,

00:06:35.514 --> 00:06:37.993
we're still stuck with
the M in here cause you've

00:06:37.993 --> 00:06:39.990
got different Ms at different points.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.160
We're stuck with all
these R squareds in here,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.628
all these points at the
baseball are different Rs,

00:06:44.628 --> 00:06:46.328
they're all different
points from the axis,

00:06:46.328 --> 00:06:48.558
different distances from
the axis, we can't bring

00:06:48.558 --> 00:06:51.449
those out so now what do we
do, well if you're clever

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:53.792
you recognize this term.

00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:56.615
This summation term is
nothing but the total moment

00:06:56.615 --> 00:06:59.296
of inertia of the object.

00:06:59.296 --> 00:07:01.628
Remember that the moment
of inertia of an object,

00:07:01.628 --> 00:07:04.394
we learned previously,
is just M R squared,

00:07:04.394 --> 00:07:06.410
so the moment of inertia of a point mass

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.122
is M R squared and the moment of inertia

00:07:09.122 --> 00:07:12.483
of a bunch of point
masses is the sum of all

00:07:12.483 --> 00:07:15.402
the M R squareds and that's
what we've got right here,

00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:19.514
this is just the moment of
inertia of this baseball

00:07:19.514 --> 00:07:22.115
or whatever the object is,
it doesn't even have to be

00:07:22.115 --> 00:07:24.287
of a particular shape, we're gonna add all

00:07:24.287 --> 00:07:26.998
the M R squareds, that's
always going to be

00:07:26.998 --> 00:07:28.637
the total moment of inertia.

00:07:28.637 --> 00:07:30.925
So what we've found is
that the K rotational

00:07:30.925 --> 00:07:34.066
is equal to one half times this quantity,

00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:35.947
which is I, the moment of inertia,

00:07:35.947 --> 00:07:38.284
times omega squared and that's the formula

00:07:38.284 --> 00:07:40.004
we got up here just by guessing.

00:07:40.004 --> 00:07:41.850
But it actually works
and this is why it works,

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.859
because you always get
this quantity down here,

00:07:43.859 --> 00:07:46.204
which is one half I omega
squared, no matter what

00:07:46.204 --> 00:07:47.676
the shape of the object is.

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.420
So what this is telling
you, what this quantity

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.346
gives us is the total
rotational kinetic energy

00:07:52.346 --> 00:07:55.666
of all the points on that
mass about the center

00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:58.591
of the mass but here's
what it doesn't give you.

00:07:58.591 --> 00:08:01.036
This term right here does not include

00:08:01.036 --> 00:08:03.451
the translational kinetic
energy so the fact that

00:08:03.451 --> 00:08:06.292
this baseball was flying
through the air does not

00:08:06.292 --> 00:08:08.142
get incorporated by this formula.

00:08:08.142 --> 00:08:10.264
We didn't take into account the fact that

00:08:10.264 --> 00:08:12.391
the baseball was moving through the air,

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:13.976
in other words, we
didn't take into account

00:08:13.976 --> 00:08:16.791
that the actual center
of mass in this baseball

00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:19.200
was translating through the air.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.365
But we can do that easily
with this formula here.

00:08:21.365 --> 00:08:24.279
This is the translational kinetic energy.

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:26.930
Sometimes instead of writing
regular kinetic energy,

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.841
now that we've got two we
should specify this is really

00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:31.791
translational kinetic energy.

00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:34.361
We've got a formula for
translational kinetic energy,

00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:37.701
the energy something has due
to the fact that the center

00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:40.522
of mass of that object is
moving and we have a formula

00:08:40.522 --> 00:08:42.972
that takes into account the
fact that something can have

00:08:42.972 --> 00:08:45.494
kinetic energy due to its rotation.

00:08:45.494 --> 00:08:48.316
That's this K rotational,
so if an object's rotating,

00:08:48.316 --> 00:08:50.483
it has rotational kinetic energy.

00:08:50.483 --> 00:08:52.718
If an object is translating it has

00:08:52.718 --> 00:08:54.500
translational kinetic energy,

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.515
i.e. if the center of mass is moving,

00:08:56.515 --> 00:08:59.986
and if the object is
translating and it's rotating

00:08:59.986 --> 00:09:02.435
then it would have those both
of these kinetic energies,

00:09:02.435 --> 00:09:04.948
both at the same time and
this is the beautiful thing.

00:09:04.948 --> 00:09:08.430
If an object is translating
and rotating and you want

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.390
to find the total kinetic
energy of the entire thing,

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.004
you can just add these two terms up.

00:09:14.004 --> 00:09:17.147
If I just take the translational
one half M V squared,

00:09:17.147 --> 00:09:20.573
and this would then be the
velocity of the center of mass.

00:09:20.573 --> 00:09:22.157
So you have to be careful.

00:09:22.157 --> 00:09:23.749
Let me make some room
here, so let me get rid

00:09:23.749 --> 00:09:25.130
of all this stuff here.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.741
If you take one half M,
times the speed of the center

00:09:28.741 --> 00:09:31.655
of mass squared, you'll
get the total translational

00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:33.239
kinetic energy of the baseball.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:36.386
And if we add to that the
one half I omega squared,

00:09:36.386 --> 00:09:39.184
so the omega about the
center of mass you'll get

00:09:39.184 --> 00:09:43.688
the total kinetic energy, both
translational and rotational,

00:09:43.688 --> 00:09:46.624
so this is great, we can
determine the total kinetic energy

00:09:46.624 --> 00:09:49.889
altogether, rotational
motion, translational motion,

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:52.580
from just taking these two terms added up.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.049
So what would an example of this be,

00:09:54.049 --> 00:09:55.796
let's just get rid of all this.

00:09:55.796 --> 00:09:59.180
Let's say this baseball,
someone pitched this thing,

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.582
and the radar gun shows that
this baseball was hurled

00:10:02.582 --> 00:10:04.799
through the air at 40 meters per second.

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:07.452
So it's heading toward home
plate at 40 meters per second.

00:10:07.452 --> 00:10:09.858
The center of mass of
this baseball is going

00:10:09.858 --> 00:10:12.551
40 meters per second toward home plate.

00:10:12.551 --> 00:10:15.094
Let's say it's also, someone
really threw the fastball.

00:10:15.094 --> 00:10:18.107
This thing's rotating
with an angular velocity

00:10:18.107 --> 00:10:20.190
of 50 radians per second.

00:10:22.264 --> 00:10:24.376
We know the mass of a
baseball, I've looked it up.

00:10:24.376 --> 00:10:28.781
The mass of a baseball
is about 0.145 kilograms

00:10:28.781 --> 00:10:31.795
and the radius of the baseball,
so a radius of a baseball

00:10:31.795 --> 00:10:35.388
is around seven centimeters,
so in terms of meters that

00:10:35.388 --> 00:10:38.865
would be 0.07 meters, so
we can figure out what's

00:10:38.865 --> 00:10:41.240
the total kinetic energy,
well there's gonna be

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.202
a rotational kinetic
energy and there's gonna be

00:10:43.202 --> 00:10:45.048
a translational kinetic energy.

00:10:45.048 --> 00:10:47.875
The translational kinetic
energy, gonna be one half

00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:50.835
the mass of the baseball
times the center of mass speed

00:10:50.835 --> 00:10:53.993
of the baseball squared which
is gonna give us one half.

00:10:53.993 --> 00:10:57.626
The mass of the baseball was
0.145 and the center of mass

00:10:57.626 --> 00:11:00.650
speed of the baseball is 40,
that's how fast the center

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.712
of mass of this baseball is traveling.

00:11:02.712 --> 00:11:06.712
If we add all that up we
get 116 Jules of regular

00:11:06.712 --> 00:11:08.894
translational kinetic energy.

00:11:08.894 --> 00:11:11.246
How much rotational
kinetic energy is there,

00:11:11.246 --> 00:11:13.281
so we're gonna have
rotational kinetic energy

00:11:13.281 --> 00:11:16.088
due to the fact that the
baseball is also rotating.

00:11:16.088 --> 00:11:19.587
How much, well we're gonna
use one half I omega squared.

00:11:19.587 --> 00:11:22.484
I'm gonna have one half, what's
the I, well the baseball is

00:11:22.484 --> 00:11:26.328
a sphere, if you look up the
moment of inertia of a sphere

00:11:26.328 --> 00:11:29.665
cause I don't wanna have
to do summation of all

00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:32.999
the M R squareds, if you
do that using calculus,

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:34.873
you get this formula.

00:11:34.873 --> 00:11:36.995
That means in an algebra
based physics class

00:11:36.995 --> 00:11:38.900
you just have to look this
up, it's either in your book

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.635
in a chart or a table or you
could always look it up online.

00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:45.763
For a sphere the moment of
inertia is two fifths M R squared

00:11:45.763 --> 00:11:48.619
in other words two fifths
the mass of a baseball

00:11:48.619 --> 00:11:50.459
times the raise of the baseball squared.

00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:53.627
That's just I, that's the
moment of inertia of a sphere.

00:11:53.627 --> 00:11:56.235
So we're assuming this
baseball is a perfect sphere.

00:11:56.235 --> 00:11:59.358
It's got uniform density,
that's not completely true.

00:11:59.358 --> 00:12:00.954
But it's a pretty good approximation.

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:03.019
Then we multiply by this omega squared,

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:04.754
the angular speed squared.

00:12:04.754 --> 00:12:07.137
So what do we get, we're
gonna get one half times

00:12:07.137 --> 00:12:11.222
two fifths, the mass of
a baseball was 0.145.

00:12:11.222 --> 00:12:13.284
The radius of the baseball
was about, what did we say,

00:12:13.284 --> 00:12:18.027
.07 meters so that's .07
meters squared and then finally

00:12:18.027 --> 00:12:20.494
we multiply by omega squared
and this would make it

00:12:20.494 --> 00:12:23.238
50 radians per second and we square

00:12:23.238 --> 00:12:25.821
it which adds up to 0.355 Jules

00:12:28.705 --> 00:12:31.416
so hardly any of the
energy of this baseball

00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:33.034
is in its rotation.

00:12:33.034 --> 00:12:36.449
Almost all of the energy is
in the form of translational

00:12:36.449 --> 00:12:38.521
energy, that kinda makes sense.

00:12:38.521 --> 00:12:40.895
It's the fact that this
baseball is hurling toward

00:12:40.895 --> 00:12:43.901
home plate that's gonna
make it hurt if it hits you

00:12:43.901 --> 00:12:46.049
as opposed to the fact
that it was spinning when

00:12:46.049 --> 00:12:48.545
it hits you, that doesn't
actually cause as much damage

00:12:48.545 --> 00:12:50.705
as the fact that this
baseball's kinetic energy

00:12:50.705 --> 00:12:54.466
is mostly in the form of
translational kinetic energy.

00:12:54.466 --> 00:12:57.154
But if you wanted the total
kinetic energy of the baseball,

00:12:57.154 --> 00:12:59.135
you would add both of these terms up.

00:12:59.135 --> 00:13:02.641
K total would be the
translational kinetic energy

00:13:02.641 --> 00:13:04.937
plus the rotational kinetic energy.

00:13:04.937 --> 00:13:09.104
That means the total kinetic
energy which is the 116 Jules

00:13:10.046 --> 00:13:12.546
plus 0.355 Jules which give us

00:13:14.425 --> 00:13:15.592
116.355 Jules.

00:13:18.343 --> 00:13:20.590
So recapping if an object is both rotating

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.156
and translating you can
find the translational

00:13:23.156 --> 00:13:26.787
kinetic energy using one
half M the speed of the

00:13:26.787 --> 00:13:29.564
center of mass of that
object squared and you can

00:13:29.564 --> 00:13:32.071
find the rotational
kinetic energy by using

00:13:32.071 --> 00:13:34.552
one half I, the moment of inertia.

00:13:34.552 --> 00:13:36.161
We'll infer whatever shape it is,

00:13:36.161 --> 00:13:38.640
if it's a point mass
going in a huge circle

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.035
you could use M R
squared, if it's a sphere

00:13:41.035 --> 00:13:43.635
rotating about its center
you could use two fifths

00:13:43.635 --> 00:13:46.209
M R squared, cylinders
are one half M R squared,

00:13:46.209 --> 00:13:49.007
you can look these up
in tables to figure out

00:13:49.007 --> 00:13:52.032
whatever the I is that
you need times the angular

00:13:52.032 --> 00:13:56.319
speed squared of the object
about that center of mass.

00:13:56.319 --> 00:13:58.423
And if you add these
two terms up you get the

00:13:58.423 --> 00:14:01.423
total kinetic energy of that object.
