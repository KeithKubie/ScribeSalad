to be here and today we're gonna be
 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.940
to be here and today we're gonna be
talking about constraint layout with a

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950
talking about constraint layout with a
 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.039
talking about constraint layout with a
focus heavily on the visual editor how

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049
focus heavily on the visual editor how
 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.840
focus heavily on the visual editor how
to use the visual editor to effectively

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850
to use the visual editor to effectively
 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.720
to use the visual editor to effectively
make constraints in Android studio so

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730
make constraints in Android studio so
 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.070
make constraints in Android studio so
I'm gonna start out by talking about the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080
I'm gonna start out by talking about the
 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.580
I'm gonna start out by talking about the
basics and then oh I'm Chris UX designer

on Android studio and I'll be talking

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
on Android studio and I'll be talking
 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.790
on Android studio and I'll be talking
about some of the new features we've

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800
about some of the new features we've
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.410
about some of the new features we've
added to Android studio for constraint

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420
added to Android studio for constraint
 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.569
added to Android studio for constraint

after we talk about the basics the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
after we talk about the basics the
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.220
after we talk about the basics the
features that shifting constraint Liat

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230
features that shifting constraint Liat
 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.470
features that shifting constraint Liat
1.0 1.1 we're gonna talk about some of

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
1.0 1.1 we're gonna talk about some of
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.209
1.0 1.1 we're gonna talk about some of
the new features that are coming out and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219
the new features that are coming out and
 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.240
the new features that are coming out and
constraint layout 2.0 so let's dive in

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250
constraint layout 2.0 so let's dive in
 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.880
constraint layout 2.0 so let's dive in
what are constraints so when I add a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
what are constraints so when I add a
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.590
what are constraints so when I add a
view to a constraint layout in the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600
view to a constraint layout in the
 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.060
view to a constraint layout in the
visual editor I'm gonna get these four

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070
visual editor I'm gonna get these four
 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.250
visual editor I'm gonna get these four
new handles one on the Left top right

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260
new handles one on the Left top right
 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.529
new handles one on the Left top right
and bottom if I click one of those or if

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539
and bottom if I click one of those or if
 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.910
and bottom if I click one of those or if
I go over to the view inspector over

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
I go over to the view inspector over
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.610
I go over to the view inspector over
here and I click that I'm gonna go ahead

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
here and I click that I'm gonna go ahead
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.310
here and I click that I'm gonna go ahead
and add a constraint to this view so I

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
and add a constraint to this view so I
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.689
and add a constraint to this view so I
want to pause for a second here and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699
want to pause for a second here and
 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.399
want to pause for a second here and
mentioned the in constraint layout

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409
mentioned the in constraint layout
 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.350
mentioned the in constraint layout
before I added this constraint

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360
before I added this constraint
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.640
before I added this constraint
constraint it's gonna add that view to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650
constraint it's gonna add that view to
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.260
constraint it's gonna add that view to
the view hierarchy but it's just gonna

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270
the view hierarchy but it's just gonna
 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.570
the view hierarchy but it's just gonna
lay it out somewhere on the screen so

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
lay it out somewhere on the screen so
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.859
lay it out somewhere on the screen so
I'm gonna have that constraint it's 30

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869
I'm gonna have that constraint it's 30
 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.870
I'm gonna have that constraint it's 30
DP off the top and if I had another one

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
DP off the top and if I had another one
 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.649
DP off the top and if I had another one
to the left

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
to the left
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.050
to the left
I've now fully constrained this view now

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060
I've now fully constrained this view now
 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.580
I've now fully constrained this view now
constraint layout knows how to solve

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
constraint layout knows how to solve
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.590
constraint layout knows how to solve
where this view goes we're gonna see

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600
where this view goes we're gonna see
 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.480
where this view goes we're gonna see
starting with this very simple example

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
starting with this very simple example
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.969
starting with this very simple example
how to kind of build up more complex

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979
how to kind of build up more complex
 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.609
how to kind of build up more complex
examples of constraints and of course I

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
examples of constraints and of course I
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.010
examples of constraints and of course I
could change this 30 DP margin to be 50

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
could change this 30 DP margin to be 50
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.649
could change this 30 DP margin to be 50
DP or it could set both of them to 0 DP

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
DP or it could set both of them to 0 DP
 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.050
DP or it could set both of them to 0 DP
and then add a constraint over on the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
and then add a constraint over on the
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.569
and then add a constraint over on the
right side if I do that I'm actually

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
right side if I do that I'm actually
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.460
right side if I do that I'm actually
going to Center this view if I add

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
going to Center this view if I add
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.990
going to Center this view if I add
another constraints on the bottom I'm

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
another constraints on the bottom I'm
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.960
another constraints on the bottom I'm
gonna Center this view on the entire

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970
gonna Center this view on the entire
 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.999
gonna Center this view on the entire
constraint layout and this trick of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009
constraint layout and this trick of
 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.350
constraint layout and this trick of
constraining equally on the right on the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
constraining equally on the right on the
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.940
constraining equally on the right on the
left is going to work everywhere and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
left is going to work everywhere and
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.200
left is going to work everywhere and
constrain it this is how you Center a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
constrain it this is how you Center a
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.190
constrain it this is how you Center a
view inside or on top of another view so

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
view inside or on top of another view so
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.319
view inside or on top of another view so
let's take a look at one more thing I

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329
let's take a look at one more thing I
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.270
let's take a look at one more thing I
can do with just a single element using

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280
can do with just a single element using
 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.819
can do with just a single element using
constraint layout so if I look at this

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
constraint layout so if I look at this
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.560
constraint layout so if I look at this
slider that's over on the left it starts

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
slider that's over on the left it starts
 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.539
slider that's over on the left it starts
at 51 I've constrained the top and the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549
at 51 I've constrained the top and the
 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.670
at 51 I've constrained the top and the
bottom like this and I can change that I

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680
bottom like this and I can change that I
 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.440
bottom like this and I can change that I
can change it up to 25 and when I do

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450
can change it up to 25 and when I do
 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.479
can change it up to 25 and when I do
that instead of centering it exactly

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489
that instead of centering it exactly
 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.610
that instead of centering it exactly
it's going to introduce a bias it's the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
it's going to introduce a bias it's the
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.890
it's going to introduce a bias it's the
later its going to introduce a bias to

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900
later its going to introduce a bias to
 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.420
later its going to introduce a bias to
the layout now it's gonna lay that out

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430
the layout now it's gonna lay that out
 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.949
the layout now it's gonna lay that out
25% along the way

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959
25% along the way
 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.710
25% along the way
75% along the way and of course there's

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720
75% along the way and of course there's
 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.800
75% along the way and of course there's
of course a horizontal slider as well so

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810
of course a horizontal slider as well so
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.330
of course a horizontal slider as well so
let's dive even further into this view

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
let's dive even further into this view
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.830
let's dive even further into this view
inspector and taking a look at what's

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840
inspector and taking a look at what's
 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.960
inspector and taking a look at what's
available in the visual editor so

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
available in the visual editor so
 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.690
available in the visual editor so
there's this triple chef going on here

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700
there's this triple chef going on here
 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.880
there's this triple chef going on here
inside of this view inspector and I

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890
inside of this view inspector and I
 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.530
inside of this view inspector and I
asked John Hufford about this and he

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540
asked John Hufford about this and he
 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.330
asked John Hufford about this and he
said that's because it's wrapped content

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340
said that's because it's wrapped content
 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.309
said that's because it's wrapped content
so it's like trying to pull in as hard

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319
so it's like trying to pull in as hard
 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.229
so it's like trying to pull in as hard
as it can from both sides so this is

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239
as it can from both sides so this is
 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.000
as it can from both sides so this is
what it's going to show for rap content

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010
what it's going to show for rap content
 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.949
what it's going to show for rap content
I can change that of course to fix width

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959
I can change that of course to fix width
 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.500
I can change that of course to fix width
that's 100 DP that's not too exciting I

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510
that's 100 DP that's not too exciting I
 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.180
that's 100 DP that's not too exciting I
can also change that to match

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190
can also change that to match
 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.940
can also change that to match
constraints so match constraints is a

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950
constraints so match constraints is a
 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.710
constraints so match constraints is a
new feature for constraint let it's a

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720
new feature for constraint let it's a
 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.360
new feature for constraint let it's a
new way to layout views and what it says

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370
new way to layout views and what it says
 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.430
new way to layout views and what it says
is take up all of the views all of the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440
is take up all of the views all of the
 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.530
is take up all of the views all of the
space available by the constraints given

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540
space available by the constraints given
 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.420
space available by the constraints given
so in this case I'm constrained off the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430
so in this case I'm constrained off the
 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.039
so in this case I'm constrained off the
right on the left so it's basically the

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049
right on the left so it's basically the
 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.899
right on the left so it's basically the
same thing as full parent and this is

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909
same thing as full parent and this is
 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.059
same thing as full parent and this is
how you would take up the full screen in

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069
how you would take up the full screen in
 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.199
how you would take up the full screen in
constraint layout you wouldn't want to

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209
constraint layout you wouldn't want to
 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.759
constraint layout you wouldn't want to
use fill parent and constraint layout

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769
use fill parent and constraint layout
 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.789
use fill parent and constraint layout
and when I'm in match constraints I get

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799
and when I'm in match constraints I get
 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.039
and when I'm in match constraints I get
this really interesting icon here and I

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049
this really interesting icon here and I
 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.509
this really interesting icon here and I
originally thought this was a heartbeat

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519
originally thought this was a heartbeat
 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.009
originally thought this was a heartbeat
for the longest time I thought this was

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019
for the longest time I thought this was
 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.059
for the longest time I thought this was
like a heartbeat icon

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069
like a heartbeat icon
 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.620
like a heartbeat icon
I asked John about this it turns out

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630
I asked John about this it turns out
 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.900
I asked John about this it turns out
that's actually a spring and on some

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910
that's actually a spring and on some
 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.400
that's actually a spring and on some
versions of Android studios you get two

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410
versions of Android studios you get two
 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.620
versions of Android studios you get two
Springs on some versions you get one so

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630
Springs on some versions you get one so
 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.970
Springs on some versions you get one so
I guess it's more springy for some of us

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980
I guess it's more springy for some of us
 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.220
I guess it's more springy for some of us
than others

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230
than others
 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.809
than others
so let's switches back over to wrap

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819
so let's switches back over to wrap
 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.539
so let's switches back over to wrap
content and let's add another view so we

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549
content and let's add another view so we
 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.069
content and let's add another view so we
can start building more complex layouts

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079
can start building more complex layouts
 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.930
can start building more complex layouts
so I'm just gonna add an image view then

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940
so I'm just gonna add an image view then
 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.240
so I'm just gonna add an image view then
I'm gonna constrain it so it's you know

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250
I'm gonna constrain it so it's you know
 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.229
I'm gonna constrain it so it's you know
20 DP

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239
20 DP
 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.150
20 DP
off of this text view then I'm gonna

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160
off of this text view then I'm gonna
 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.439
off of this text view then I'm gonna
constrain it on the right and it does

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449
constrain it on the right and it does
 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:46.729
constrain it on the right and it does
you know what we'd expect right it's

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739
you know what we'd expect right it's
 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.080
you know what we'd expect right it's
gonna go ahead and move that image view

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090
gonna go ahead and move that image view
 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.599
gonna go ahead and move that image view
so it's 20 DP off the left and the ends

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609
so it's 20 DP off the left and the ends
 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.729
so it's 20 DP off the left and the ends
are aligned now I'm going to add another

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739
are aligned now I'm going to add another
 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.949
are aligned now I'm going to add another
constraint over on the right and we'll

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959
constraint over on the right and we'll
 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.930
constraint over on the right and we'll
see that this image view is gonna Center

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940
see that this image view is gonna Center
 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.849
see that this image view is gonna Center
itself as here we can see the centering

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859
itself as here we can see the centering
 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.199
itself as here we can see the centering
trick that we did for the whole screen

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209
trick that we did for the whole screen
 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.750
trick that we did for the whole screen
we can do this on another view as well

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760
 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.869
now I want to change the width of this

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879
now I want to change the width of this
 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.460
now I want to change the width of this
view from wrap content to match

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470
view from wrap content to match
 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.439
view from wrap content to match
constraints and this time instead of

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449
constraints and this time instead of
 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:14.150
constraints and this time instead of
match constraints meaning it's going to

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160
match constraints meaning it's going to
 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.860
match constraints meaning it's going to
take the whole screen it's gonna take

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870
take the whole screen it's gonna take
 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.539
take the whole screen it's gonna take
the width of this text view whatever

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549
the width of this text view whatever
 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.699
the width of this text view whatever
size that text view is this image user

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709
size that text view is this image user
 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.379
size that text view is this image user
I'm gonna try to match that constraints

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389
I'm gonna try to match that constraints
 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.450
I'm gonna try to match that constraints
as well and when I do that this new

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460
as well and when I do that this new
 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.240
as well and when I do that this new
control shows up in the visual editor so

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250
control shows up in the visual editor so
 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.530
control shows up in the visual editor so
this little Y

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540
this little Y
 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.180
this little Y
it creates a little triangle I'm gonna

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190
it creates a little triangle I'm gonna
 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.790
it creates a little triangle I'm gonna
click it actually enable an aspect ratio

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800
click it actually enable an aspect ratio
 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.010
click it actually enable an aspect ratio
on this image view and this is this is a

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020
on this image view and this is this is a
 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.720
on this image view and this is this is a
really nice feature if you want to

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730
really nice feature if you want to
 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.130
really nice feature if you want to
display an image with an aspect ratio

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140
display an image with an aspect ratio
 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.320
display an image with an aspect ratio
images you know when we get them from

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330

two by one or sixteen by nine you're
 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.490
two by one or sixteen by nine you're
laughing because you're a designer and

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500
laughing because you're a designer and
 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.810
laughing because you're a designer and
it's my fault sorry and so we can set up

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820
it's my fault sorry and so we can set up
 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.640
it's my fault sorry and so we can set up
exactly what our designers asked for

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650
exactly what our designers asked for
 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.960
exactly what our designers asked for
we'd have to write a lot of code to do

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970
we'd have to write a lot of code to do
 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.880
we'd have to write a lot of code to do
the resizing or to fix this aspect ratio

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890
the resizing or to fix this aspect ratio
 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.520
the resizing or to fix this aspect ratio
and also resize this view as that text

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530
and also resize this view as that text
 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.840
and also resize this view as that text
view changes at the same time

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850
view changes at the same time
 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.020
view changes at the same time
well maintaining this aspect ratio now

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030
well maintaining this aspect ratio now
 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.940
well maintaining this aspect ratio now
if I set this aspect ratio to 3 to 1 I

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950
if I set this aspect ratio to 3 to 1 I
 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.740
if I set this aspect ratio to 3 to 1 I
kind of introduce these conflicting

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750
kind of introduce these conflicting
 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.960
kind of introduce these conflicting
constraints here I've set 1 aspect ratio

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970
constraints here I've set 1 aspect ratio
 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.450
constraints here I've set 1 aspect ratio
that says I'd like this to be 3 to 1

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460
that says I'd like this to be 3 to 1
 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.250
that says I'd like this to be 3 to 1
aspect ratio or 1 constraint 3 to 1

aspect ratio or 1 constraint 3 to 1
 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.170
aspect ratio or 1 constraint 3 to 1
aspect ratio and then another constraint

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180
aspect ratio and then another constraint
 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.730

has to solve both of these at the same

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070
has to solve both of these at the same
 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.010
has to solve both of these at the same
time and it's gonna choose to use the

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020
time and it's gonna choose to use the
 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.660
time and it's gonna choose to use the
constraints from the text box above the

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670
constraints from the text box above the
 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.480
constraints from the text box above the
aspect ratio I can free up another

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490
aspect ratio I can free up another
 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.700

dimension for constraint layout to solve
 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.070
dimension for constraint layout to solve
so if I change the height to be matched

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080
so if I change the height to be matched
 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.440
so if I change the height to be matched
constraints it's capable of resizing

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450
constraints it's capable of resizing
 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.530
constraints it's capable of resizing
both dimensions so now it can set the 3

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540
both dimensions so now it can set the 3
 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.870
both dimensions so now it can set the 3
to one aspect ratio by making this image

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880
to one aspect ratio by making this image
 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.620

with just a single you know element or

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970
with just a single you know element or
 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.490
with just a single you know element or
two elements let's add a little bit more

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500
two elements let's add a little bit more
 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.220
two elements let's add a little bit more
of a complex view and talk about how to

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230
of a complex view and talk about how to
 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.140
of a complex view and talk about how to
lay things out with more features from

so my designer just sent me this lovely

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620
so my designer just sent me this lovely
 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.140
so my designer just sent me this lovely
email form thank you

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150
email form thank you
 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.420

and so I want to pause for a second I

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430
and so I want to pause for a second I
 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.440
and so I want to pause for a second I
mentioned this is a talk about

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450
mentioned this is a talk about
 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.760
mentioned this is a talk about
constraint layout this is not a talk

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770

about how to design login forms I did

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210
about how to design login forms I did
 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.760
about how to design login forms I did
one of those earlier today please don't

we're gonna try to do all of those

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820
we're gonna try to do all of those
 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.960
we're gonna try to do all of those
things in constraint layout so before we

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970
things in constraint layout so before we
 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.060
things in constraint layout so before we
do that how are we gonna lay out those

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070
do that how are we gonna lay out those
 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.040
do that how are we gonna lay out those
you know text views right we have the

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050

actually be incorrect if we take a look

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360
actually be incorrect if we take a look
 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.240

at how fonts work just dive into fonts

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250
at how fonts work just dive into fonts
 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.340
at how fonts work just dive into fonts
for a second and look at font metrics we

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350
for a second and look at font metrics we
 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.570
for a second and look at font metrics we
have a bunch of them we have this base

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580
have a bunch of them we have this base
 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.730
have a bunch of them we have this base
line at the bottom which in English in

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740
line at the bottom which in English in
 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.920
line at the bottom which in English in
most languages almost everything sits on

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930
most languages almost everything sits on
 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.390
most languages almost everything sits on
then at the very top we have the

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400
then at the very top we have the
 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.070
then at the very top we have the
ascender line which nothing goes above

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080
ascender line which nothing goes above
 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.570
ascender line which nothing goes above
and then out at the bottom that dashed

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580
and then out at the bottom that dashed
 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.730
and then out at the bottom that dashed
line is the descender line and it turns

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740
line is the descender line and it turns
 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.530
line is the descender line and it turns
out that the metric that really matters

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540
out that the metric that really matters
 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.510
out that the metric that really matters
is this base line and if we land out two

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520
is this base line and if we land out two
 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.250
is this base line and if we land out two
texts that have completely different

line that creates a single line of text
for our eyes and it allows us to read it

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.430
for our eyes and it allows us to read it
 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.090
for our eyes and it allows us to read it
as a coherent unit so we want to do that

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.100
as a coherent unit so we want to do that
 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.070
as a coherent unit so we want to do that
in constraint layout so if I select this

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080
in constraint layout so if I select this
 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.840

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:28.330
like this I've been enlarged it
 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.180

constraint saying these text views
 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.950
constraint saying these text views
should have the same baseline and we'll

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960
should have the same baseline and we'll
 

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.420
should have the same baseline and we'll
do that for all of the other text views

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:54.430
do that for all of the other text views
 

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.300
do that for all of the other text views
on the screen here in order to set up

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:57.310
on the screen here in order to set up
 

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.800
on the screen here in order to set up
all the baseline alignments and when you

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:58.810
all the baseline alignments and when you
 

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.110
all the baseline alignments and when you
line up text next to text you almost

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120
line up text next to text you almost
 

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.730

always want to use the baseline that's

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:02.740
always want to use the baseline that's
 

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.650
always want to use the baseline that's
the correct way to do it all the time

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:04.660
the correct way to do it all the time
 

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.620
the correct way to do it all the time
especially in constraints layout so now

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:07.630
especially in constraints layout so now
 

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.210
especially in constraints layout so now
let's go ahead and put that login button

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:09.220
let's go ahead and put that login button
 

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.710
let's go ahead and put that login button
on the screen as well so the login

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720
on the screen as well so the login
 

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.510
on the screen as well so the login
button has to be constrained off this

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:12.520
button has to be constrained off this
 

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.920
button has to be constrained off this
edit text and then it's also going to

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:13.930
edit text and then it's also going to
 

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.020
edit text and then it's also going to
get constrained on the right side this

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:16.030
get constrained on the right side this
 

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.760
get constrained on the right side this
figure out how to do this centering

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:17.770
figure out how to do this centering
 

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.200
figure out how to do this centering
write the email and password is

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:19.210
write the email and password is
 

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.670
write the email and password is
vertically centered on the screen how am

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:20.680
vertically centered on the screen how am
 

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.450
vertically centered on the screen how am
I gonna do that

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:21.460
I gonna do that
 

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.760
I gonna do that
so we've been doing this thing where we

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:23.770
so we've been doing this thing where we
 

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.530
so we've been doing this thing where we
put a constraint on both sides of a view

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:25.540
put a constraint on both sides of a view
 

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.090
put a constraint on both sides of a view
and it's Center so let's try to do that

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:27.100
and it's Center so let's try to do that
 

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.680
and it's Center so let's try to do that
so I'm gonna put them straight from

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:28.690
so I'm gonna put them straight from
 

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.390
so I'm gonna put them straight from
email up to the top of the screen it's

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400
email up to the top of the screen it's
 

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.250
email up to the top of the screen it's
gonna pull stuff up to the top from

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:32.260
gonna pull stuff up to the top from
 

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.510
gonna pull stuff up to the top from
password down to the bottom of the

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:33.520
password down to the bottom of the
 

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.250
password down to the bottom of the
screen and it's gonna pull stuff down to

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:35.260
screen and it's gonna pull stuff down to
 

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.839
screen and it's gonna pull stuff down to
the bottom and so far this makes sense

00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:36.849
the bottom and so far this makes sense
 

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:38.850
the bottom and so far this makes sense
now I guess I'm gonna have to add a

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:38.860
now I guess I'm gonna have to add a
 

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.070
now I guess I'm gonna have to add a
constraint from password to email right

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.080
constraint from password to email right
 

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.360
constraint from password to email right
because I want these things to go back

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:42.370
because I want these things to go back
 

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.970
because I want these things to go back
together so I'm gonna do that and this

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:44.980
together so I'm gonna do that and this
 

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.620
together so I'm gonna do that and this
is actually gonna Center password

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:46.630
is actually gonna Center password
 

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.030
is actually gonna Center password
between email on the bottom of the

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.040
between email on the bottom of the
 

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.740
between email on the bottom of the
screen which is not quite what I wanted

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:49.750

let's pull email back down with another

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:51.790
let's pull email back down with another
 

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.700
let's pull email back down with another
constraint and when I do that I'm

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:53.710
constraint and when I do that I'm
 

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.090
constraint and when I do that I'm
actually going to

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:55.100
actually going to
 

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.499
actually going to
solve this problem like a little bit

00:08:56.499 --> 00:08:56.509
solve this problem like a little bit
 

00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:58.150
solve this problem like a little bit

introduces what's called a chain and

00:08:59.889 --> 00:08:59.899
introduces what's called a chain and
 

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:01.240
introduces what's called a chain and
constraint lad and it's gonna solve it

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:01.250
constraint lad and it's gonna solve it
 

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.579
constraint lad and it's gonna solve it
with the chain solver

00:09:02.579 --> 00:09:02.589
with the chain solver
 

00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:04.749
with the chain solver
now of course setting up all of those

00:09:04.749 --> 00:09:04.759
now of course setting up all of those
 

00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:06.400
now of course setting up all of those
constraints by hand individual editor is

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:06.410
constraints by hand individual editor is
 

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.710
constraints by hand individual editor is
kind of tedious so there's a helper for

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720
kind of tedious so there's a helper for
 

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.129
kind of tedious so there's a helper for
this you can go into right click on

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:11.139
this you can go into right click on
 

00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:13.930
this you can go into right click on
center and choose vertically when I have

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:13.940
center and choose vertically when I have
 

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.759
center and choose vertically when I have
email and password selected and when I

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:15.769
email and password selected and when I
 

00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:18.009
email and password selected and when I
do that it's going to set up all of the

00:09:18.009 --> 00:09:18.019
do that it's going to set up all of the
 

00:09:18.019 --> 00:09:20.850
do that it's going to set up all of the
constraints that I just talked about so

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:20.860
constraints that I just talked about so
 

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.499
constraints that I just talked about so
inside of a chain there's actually three

00:09:23.499 --> 00:09:23.509
inside of a chain there's actually three
 

00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:25.360
inside of a chain there's actually three
different ways that can get laid out for

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:25.370
different ways that can get laid out for
 

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.620
different ways that can get laid out for
technically the three that I use all the

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:26.630
technically the three that I use all the
 

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.870
technically the three that I use all the
time so we have spread which means

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880
time so we have spread which means
 

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.460
time so we have spread which means
evenly distribute everything so this

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:30.470
evenly distribute everything so this
 

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.840
evenly distribute everything so this
looks similar to what we did with linear

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:31.850
looks similar to what we did with linear
 

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.150
looks similar to what we did with linear
layout we have spread inside which is

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160
layout we have spread inside which is
 

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.590
layout we have spread inside which is
basically the same thing except the

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600
basically the same thing except the
 

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.059
basically the same thing except the
first and the last elements get pushed

00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:37.069
first and the last elements get pushed
 

00:09:37.069 --> 00:09:39.040
first and the last elements get pushed
to the edges and then the one I used

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.050
to the edges and then the one I used
 

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.230
to the edges and then the one I used
most of the time is packed so this says

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.240
most of the time is packed so this says
 

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.430
most of the time is packed so this says
push everything towards the center of

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:42.440
push everything towards the center of
 

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.139
push everything towards the center of
the screen and center it as a group and

00:09:44.139 --> 00:09:44.149
the screen and center it as a group and
 

00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:45.699
the screen and center it as a group and
so that's what we're going to use here

00:09:45.699 --> 00:09:45.709
so that's what we're going to use here
 

00:09:45.709 --> 00:09:47.949
so that's what we're going to use here
right we're going to use a packed chain

00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:47.959
right we're going to use a packed chain
 

00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:49.780
right we're going to use a packed chain
in order to Center both of these views

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:49.790
in order to Center both of these views
 

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.720
in order to Center both of these views
together so there's one more thing we

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:52.730
together so there's one more thing we
 

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.100
together so there's one more thing we
need to do right we need to put this

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:54.110
need to do right we need to put this
 

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.420
need to do right we need to put this
invisible line in the middle of the

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:55.430
invisible line in the middle of the
 

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.129
invisible line in the middle of the
screen but everything's kind of based

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:57.139
screen but everything's kind of based
 

00:09:57.139 --> 00:09:59.110
screen but everything's kind of based
around so to do that I'm gonna go to

00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120
around so to do that I'm gonna go to
 

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.970
around so to do that I'm gonna go to
helpers I'm gonna add a vertical

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:00.980
helpers I'm gonna add a vertical
 

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.819
helpers I'm gonna add a vertical
guideline so a vertical guideline is

00:10:03.819 --> 00:10:03.829
guideline so a vertical guideline is
 

00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:05.980
guideline so a vertical guideline is
basically you can think of it as a new

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:05.990
basically you can think of it as a new
 

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.199
basically you can think of it as a new
edge of the screen so it's like I have

00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:08.209
edge of the screen so it's like I have
 

00:10:08.209 --> 00:10:09.400
edge of the screen so it's like I have
one on the left of the screen I have one

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:09.410
one on the left of the screen I have one
 

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:10.809
one on the left of the screen I have one
on the right screen and now I've put an

00:10:10.809 --> 00:10:10.819
on the right screen and now I've put an
 

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:12.009
on the right screen and now I've put an
edge of the screen in the middle of the

00:10:12.009 --> 00:10:12.019
edge of the screen in the middle of the
 

00:10:12.019 --> 00:10:13.420
edge of the screen in the middle of the
screen that I can use as an anchor for

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:13.430
screen that I can use as an anchor for
 

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.970
screen that I can use as an anchor for
constraints I'm gonna head and move that

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:15.980
constraints I'm gonna head and move that
 

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.740
constraints I'm gonna head and move that
to where I'd like it in my design and

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:17.750
to where I'd like it in my design and
 

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.870
to where I'd like it in my design and
now I could just take those text views

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880
now I could just take those text views
 

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.300
now I could just take those text views
and create constraints from those two

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:22.310
and create constraints from those two
 

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.610
and create constraints from those two
this guideline and the kind of visualize

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:24.620
this guideline and the kind of visualize
 

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.280
this guideline and the kind of visualize
what this is doing underneath if I move

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:27.290
what this is doing underneath if I move
 

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:28.870
what this is doing underneath if I move
the guideline it's actually gonna move

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880
the guideline it's actually gonna move
 

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.230
the guideline it's actually gonna move
the entire layout now so let's move that

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240
the entire layout now so let's move that
 

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.600
the entire layout now so let's move that
back and then let's get another design

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:34.610
back and then let's get another design
 

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:35.920
back and then let's get another design
because it turned out that design was

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:35.930
because it turned out that design was
 

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.829
because it turned out that design was
not performing very well so after many

00:10:38.829 --> 00:10:38.839
not performing very well so after many
 

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:40.449
not performing very well so after many
user studies we've discovered the

00:10:40.449 --> 00:10:40.459
user studies we've discovered the
 

00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:42.519
user studies we've discovered the
solution to our login form is left

00:10:42.519 --> 00:10:42.529
solution to our login form is left
 

00:10:42.529 --> 00:10:44.590
solution to our login form is left
aligning the labels so my job is now at

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:44.600
aligning the labels so my job is now at
 

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.150
aligning the labels so my job is now at
implement this so let's try to do that

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160
implement this so let's try to do that
 

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.040
implement this so let's try to do that
well I did it and I translated its

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.050
well I did it and I translated its
 

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.990
well I did it and I translated its
German and this is what happened this is

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.000
German and this is what happened this is
 

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.069
German and this is what happened this is
not not great so what happened here so

00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079
not not great so what happened here so
 

00:10:57.079 --> 00:10:59.620
not not great so what happened here so
it turns out if I lay this out similar

00:10:59.620 --> 00:10:59.630
it turns out if I lay this out similar
 

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.240
it turns out if I lay this out similar
to the way I just did right so passwords

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:01.250
to the way I just did right so passwords
 

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.549
to the way I just did right so passwords
the longest field in this in these

00:11:03.549 --> 00:11:03.559
the longest field in this in these
 

00:11:03.559 --> 00:11:05.650
the longest field in this in these
labels so if I set up a constraint from

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:05.660
labels so if I set up a constraint from
 

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.540
labels so if I set up a constraint from
the edit text over to password and then

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:07.550
the edit text over to password and then
 

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.800
the edit text over to password and then
another constraint from the

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:08.810
another constraint from the
 

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.750
another constraint from the
it takes down to the password edit text

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:10.760
it takes down to the password edit text
 

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.180
it takes down to the password edit text
this is gonna work great in English but

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:13.190
this is gonna work great in English but
 

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.100
this is gonna work great in English but
then when I translate it to German these

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:15.110
then when I translate it to German these
 

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.750
then when I translate it to German these
constraints this invariant I had that

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:16.760
constraints this invariant I had that
 

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.370
constraints this invariant I had that
password is the longest field isn't no

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:18.380
password is the longest field isn't no
 

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.470
password is the longest field isn't no
longer correct so what I'm gonna need is

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480
longer correct so what I'm gonna need is
 

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.420
longer correct so what I'm gonna need is
something that's dynamic that's based on

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:22.430
something that's dynamic that's based on
 

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.160
something that's dynamic that's based on
all of these things it's kind of like a

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:24.170
all of these things it's kind of like a
 

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.380
all of these things it's kind of like a
view group you know basically I might

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:26.390
view group you know basically I might
 

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.910
view group you know basically I might
want like a linear layout to hold these

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920
want like a linear layout to hold these
 

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.260
want like a linear layout to hold these
things but actually I'm in constraint

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:29.270
things but actually I'm in constraint
 

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.550
things but actually I'm in constraint
layout so how do I do that in constraint

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560
layout so how do I do that in constraint
 

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.800
layout so how do I do that in constraint
layout well it turns out there's another

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:32.810
layout well it turns out there's another
 

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.660
layout well it turns out there's another
helper and we're gonna use that now so

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:34.670
helper and we're gonna use that now so
 

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.720
helper and we're gonna use that now so
we've to go into helpers and we use add

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:36.730
we've to go into helpers and we use add
 

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.400
we've to go into helpers and we use add
vertical barrier this allows you to add

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:39.410
vertical barrier this allows you to add
 

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.290
vertical barrier this allows you to add
a barrier to the screen what a barrier

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:41.300
a barrier to the screen what a barrier
 

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.720
a barrier to the screen what a barrier
is is it's kind of like a view proof in

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:43.730
is is it's kind of like a view proof in
 

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.040
is is it's kind of like a view proof in
text it's actually called a grouping

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:45.050
text it's actually called a grouping
 

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.710
text it's actually called a grouping
code so we can open up the component

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:47.720
code so we can open up the component
 

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.360
code so we can open up the component
tree select our email and password and

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:49.370
tree select our email and password and
 

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.910
tree select our email and password and
drag that down to be inside of our

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920
drag that down to be inside of our
 

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.100
drag that down to be inside of our
barrier now it's not actually a view

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.110
barrier now it's not actually a view
 

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:55.540
barrier now it's not actually a view
group it's just a view that's added to

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:55.550
group it's just a view that's added to
 

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.610
group it's just a view that's added to
the screen it's positioned on one side

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:57.620
the screen it's positioned on one side
 

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.860
the screen it's positioned on one side
or the other of all of the views that

00:11:59.860 --> 00:11:59.870
or the other of all of the views that
 

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.800
or the other of all of the views that
are inside of it right by default it's

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:02.810
are inside of it right by default it's
 

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.360
are inside of it right by default it's
on the left but if I open up the

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:04.370
on the left but if I open up the
 

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.310
on the left but if I open up the
attributes pain and scroll down to the

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320
attributes pain and scroll down to the
 

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.600
attributes pain and scroll down to the
bottom I'm going to find a barrier

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:07.610
bottom I'm going to find a barrier
 

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.860
bottom I'm going to find a barrier
direction which I can set to the end and

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:10.870
direction which I can set to the end and
 

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.390
direction which I can set to the end and
now that I've done that I'm going to set

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:13.400
now that I've done that I'm going to set
 

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.430
now that I've done that I'm going to set
up my constraints and then translate my

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440
up my constraints and then translate my
 

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.829
up my constraints and then translate my
English over to German and everything's

00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839
English over to German and everything's
 

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:19.570
English over to German and everything's
gonna relay out and do exactly what I

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:19.580
gonna relay out and do exactly what I
 

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.350
gonna relay out and do exactly what I
expected so that's really it that's all

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360
expected so that's really it that's all
 

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.579
expected so that's really it that's all
of the features and constraint lay out

00:12:24.579 --> 00:12:24.589
of the features and constraint lay out
 

00:12:24.589 --> 00:12:27.400
of the features and constraint lay out
1.0 and constraint lay out 1.1 so now

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:27.410
1.0 and constraint lay out 1.1 so now
 

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.110
1.0 and constraint lay out 1.1 so now
I'm gonna pass it over to Chris who's

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120
I'm gonna pass it over to Chris who's
 

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.660
I'm gonna pass it over to Chris who's
going to talk more about more tricks

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:31.670
going to talk more about more tricks
 

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.540
going to talk more about more tricks
that can be used to use the visual

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:34.550
that can be used to use the visual
 

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:39.940
that can be used to use the visual
editor to build constraints cool thanks

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:39.950
editor to build constraints cool thanks
 

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:43.930
editor to build constraints cool thanks
Sean so with constraint layout we've you

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:43.940
Sean so with constraint layout we've you
 

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.210
Sean so with constraint layout we've you
know over time introduced many concepts

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:46.220
know over time introduced many concepts
 

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.220
know over time introduced many concepts
and so you know we started with the

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:48.230
and so you know we started with the
 

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.590
and so you know we started with the
basics which is just constraints margins

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:50.600
basics which is just constraints margins
 

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.920
basics which is just constraints margins
baselines and chains but over 1.1 and

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:53.930
baselines and chains but over 1.1 and
 

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.870
baselines and chains but over 1.1 and
2.0 alpha we've introduced things like

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880
2.0 alpha we've introduced things like
 

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.390
2.0 alpha we've introduced things like
guidelines and barriers and groups and

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:58.400
guidelines and barriers and groups and
 

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.770
guidelines and barriers and groups and
then there's many more helpers to come

00:12:59.770 --> 00:12:59.780
then there's many more helpers to come
 

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.380
then there's many more helpers to come
and then of course there's motion layout

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:01.390
and then of course there's motion layout
 

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.699
and then of course there's motion layout
but one thing that we've heard

00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:03.709
but one thing that we've heard
 

00:13:03.709 --> 00:13:05.560
but one thing that we've heard
consistently is that as we've added more

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:05.570
consistently is that as we've added more
 

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.720
consistently is that as we've added more
concepts and the layouts have become

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:07.730
concepts and the layouts have become
 

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:08.440
concepts and the layouts have become
more complex

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:08.450
more complex
 

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.360
more complex
it's actually become increasingly harder

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:10.370
it's actually become increasingly harder
 

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.220
it's actually become increasingly harder
to manage all of these with constraint

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:12.230
to manage all of these with constraint
 

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.610
to manage all of these with constraint
layout and so what I'm here to tell you

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:15.620
layout and so what I'm here to tell you
 

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:16.810
layout and so what I'm here to tell you
today is that we've actually been

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:16.820
today is that we've actually been
 

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.730
today is that we've actually been
improving a lot of this in the visual

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:18.740
improving a lot of this in the visual
 

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.640
improving a lot of this in the visual
editor in the Android studio and so the

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:21.650
editor in the Android studio and so the
 

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:22.690
editor in the Android studio and so the
four areas I'll talk about

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:22.700
four areas I'll talk about
 

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.190
four areas I'll talk about
are creating constraints and how we

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:24.200
are creating constraints and how we
 

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.590
are creating constraints and how we
improve that also some new view options

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600
improve that also some new view options
 

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.840
improve that also some new view options
we added to the design surface and then

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:28.850
we added to the design surface and then
 

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.370
we added to the design surface and then
some tricks around zooming and panning

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:30.380
some tricks around zooming and panning
 

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.200
some tricks around zooming and panning
which are super useful when you're

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:32.210
which are super useful when you're
 

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.850
which are super useful when you're
dealing with constraint layout and then

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:33.860
dealing with constraint layout and then
 

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.380
dealing with constraint layout and then
of course using sample data which we

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:35.390
of course using sample data which we
 

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.070
of course using sample data which we
introduced back in the 3/2

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:38.080
introduced back in the 3/2
 

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.750
introduced back in the 3/2
so creating constraints so you know in

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:40.760
so creating constraints so you know in
 

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.700
so creating constraints so you know in
this case we have two components it's

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:42.710
this case we have two components it's
 

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.020
this case we have two components it's
pretty simple we have an image view in a

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.030
pretty simple we have an image view in a
 

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.000
pretty simple we have an image view in a
text view and so if we want to Center

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.010
text view and so if we want to Center
 

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.070
text view and so if we want to Center
the image view then we just put one

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:48.080
the image view then we just put one
 

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.540
the image view then we just put one
constraint on the top and one on the

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:49.550
constraint on the top and one on the
 

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:54.160
constraint on the top and one on the
bottom but let's take that lovely login

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:54.170
bottom but let's take that lovely login
 

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:57.040
bottom but let's take that lovely login
form from before so from a UI

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:57.050
form from before so from a UI
 

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.930
form from before so from a UI
perspective this is actually not too

00:13:58.930 --> 00:13:58.940
perspective this is actually not too
 

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.940
perspective this is actually not too
complicated we just have some labels we

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:00.950
complicated we just have some labels we
 

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.110
complicated we just have some labels we
have some inputs and we have some

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120
have some inputs and we have some
 

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.390
have some inputs and we have some
buttons but from the constraint point of

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:04.400
buttons but from the constraint point of
 

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.250
buttons but from the constraint point of
view there's actually a lot going on so

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:06.260
view there's actually a lot going on so
 

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.660
view there's actually a lot going on so
you know we have this guideline in the

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:07.670
you know we have this guideline in the
 

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.610
you know we have this guideline in the
middle we have the login button

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:09.620
middle we have the login button
 

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.140
middle we have the login button
constrained at the bottom and the right

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:11.150
constrained at the bottom and the right
 

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.480
constrained at the bottom and the right
of the input we have the inputs

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:13.490
of the input we have the inputs
 

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.950
of the input we have the inputs
themselves constrain to the guideline

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:14.960
themselves constrain to the guideline
 

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.310
themselves constrain to the guideline
and so because all these components are

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320
and so because all these components are
 

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.380
and so because all these components are
pretty close to each other you know when

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:20.390
pretty close to each other you know when
 

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.850
pretty close to each other you know when
you're dragging these constraints around

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:21.860
you're dragging these constraints around
 

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.350
you're dragging these constraints around
in the layout editor it can actually be

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360
in the layout editor it can actually be
 

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.690
in the layout editor it can actually be
pretty challenging to get that get it

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:25.700
pretty challenging to get that get it
 

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.090
pretty challenging to get that get it
right even when I made that slide I hid

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:28.100
right even when I made that slide I hid
 

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.590
right even when I made that slide I hid
half the constraints because it was too

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600
half the constraints because it was too
 

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.940
half the constraints because it was too
busy yeah that was very simplified so

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:33.950
busy yeah that was very simplified so
 

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.860
busy yeah that was very simplified so
one thing we've done is actually is

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:35.870
one thing we've done is actually is
 

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.300
one thing we've done is actually is
we've added the ability to add

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:37.310
we've added the ability to add
 

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.100
we've added the ability to add
constraints directly with the context

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.110
constraints directly with the context
 

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.620
constraints directly with the context
menu so in this case you know if you

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:41.630
menu so in this case you know if you
 

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.330
menu so in this case you know if you
have components that are really close to

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:43.340
have components that are really close to
 

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.650
have components that are really close to
each other this makes it a lot more

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:44.660
each other this makes it a lot more
 

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.870
each other this makes it a lot more
precise and more direct to actually set

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880
precise and more direct to actually set
 

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.600
precise and more direct to actually set
those constraints so in this case and

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:49.610
those constraints so in this case and
 

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.260
those constraints so in this case and
this is available in 3 3 beta as well so

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:53.270
this is available in 3 3 beta as well so
 

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.510
this is available in 3 3 beta as well so
you can try it out today and so in this

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:55.520
you can try it out today and so in this
 

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.310
you can try it out today and so in this
case if we select one component which we

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.320
case if we select one component which we
 

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.420
case if we select one component which we
have this a lovely cat picture you can

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:01.430
have this a lovely cat picture you can
 

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.660
have this a lovely cat picture you can
just simply constrain it to the parent

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:03.670
just simply constrain it to the parent
 

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.950
just simply constrain it to the parent
so what does it look like if you have

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:05.960
so what does it look like if you have
 

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.950
so what does it look like if you have
multiple multiple components so in this

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:08.960
multiple multiple components so in this
 

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.410
multiple multiple components so in this
case we have these two text views that

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:11.420
case we have these two text views that
 

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.390
case we have these two text views that
are really close to each other and so

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:13.400
are really close to each other and so
 

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.460
are really close to each other and so
I'm not sure if people have tried to

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:15.470
I'm not sure if people have tried to
 

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.080
I'm not sure if people have tried to
create constraints between two text

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.090
create constraints between two text
 

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.850
create constraints between two text
views that almost overlap it becomes a

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:18.860
views that almost overlap it becomes a
 

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.080
views that almost overlap it becomes a
little painful when you're going from

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.090
little painful when you're going from
 

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.730
little painful when you're going from
the bottom of one to the top of the

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:21.740
the bottom of one to the top of the
 

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.910
the bottom of one to the top of the
other and so with this new context menu

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:24.920
other and so with this new context menu
 

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.140
other and so with this new context menu
you can actually just keep the two

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:26.150
you can actually just keep the two
 

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.750
you can actually just keep the two
selected and then when you open them the

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:28.760
selected and then when you open them the
 

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.830
selected and then when you open them the
context menu there's now this

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:29.840
context menu there's now this
 

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.660
context menu there's now this
constrained menu and so you can actually

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:31.670
constrained menu and so you can actually
 

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.520
constrained menu and so you can actually
just see that the two elements that you

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:33.530
just see that the two elements that you
 

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.470
just see that the two elements that you
want to use are there and then you can

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:35.480
want to use are there and then you can
 

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.450
want to use are there and then you can
easily cascade

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:36.460
easily cascade
 

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.180
easily cascade
to the right constraint that you want

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:38.190
to the right constraint that you want
 

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.280
to the right constraint that you want
and in this case you know we only have

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:40.290
and in this case you know we only have
 

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.620
and in this case you know we only have
we're only showing the start and end and

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:43.630
we're only showing the start and end and
 

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.840
we're only showing the start and end and
that's because in this case the top and

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:45.850
that's because in this case the top and
 

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.190
that's because in this case the top and
bottom constraints have already been set

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:47.200
bottom constraints have already been set
 

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.520
bottom constraints have already been set
so we don't show them so we can look at

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:50.530
so we don't show them so we can look at
 

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:52.830
so we don't show them so we can look at
another example so here we want to

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:52.840
another example so here we want to
 

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.320
another example so here we want to
constrain the location icon to this

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:55.330
constrain the location icon to this
 

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.700
constrain the location icon to this
vertical guideline that's all the way on

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:56.710
vertical guideline that's all the way on
 

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:59.400
vertical guideline that's all the way on
the left so if you use the drag-and-drop

00:15:59.400 --> 00:15:59.410
the left so if you use the drag-and-drop
 

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.010
the left so if you use the drag-and-drop
method what you'll notice is that as you

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:02.020
method what you'll notice is that as you
 

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.050
method what you'll notice is that as you
drag from the left or sorry from the

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:04.060
drag from the left or sorry from the
 

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.790
drag from the left or sorry from the
right all the way to the left you get

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800
right all the way to the left you get
 

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.600
right all the way to the left you get
all these

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:06.610
all these
 

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.670
all these
I guess Sean's favorite little green

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:08.680
I guess Sean's favorite little green
 

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.520
I guess Sean's favorite little green
flashing stuff a lot of these targets

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:11.530
flashing stuff a lot of these targets
 

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.200
flashing stuff a lot of these targets
that all show up when you try to create

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:13.210
that all show up when you try to create
 

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.300
that all show up when you try to create
the constraint and so if you're trying

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:15.310
the constraint and so if you're trying
 

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:16.590
the constraint and so if you're trying
to target some of these smaller things

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:16.600
to target some of these smaller things
 

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.900
to target some of these smaller things
like the following text or the numbers

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:18.910
like the following text or the numbers
 

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.640
like the following text or the numbers
it actually gets pretty hard when you're

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:20.650
it actually gets pretty hard when you're
 

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:21.750
it actually gets pretty hard when you're
trying to do drag and drop with

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:21.760
trying to do drag and drop with
 

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.260
trying to do drag and drop with
constraint layout and so again this

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:25.270
constraint layout and so again this
 

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.610
constraint layout and so again this
makes it a lot more direct so you can

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:26.620
makes it a lot more direct so you can
 

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.980
makes it a lot more direct so you can
select the guideline and the icon and

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:28.990
select the guideline and the icon and
 

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.790
select the guideline and the icon and
just use the context menu and if you

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800
just use the context menu and if you
 

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.050
just use the context menu and if you
really don't want to select these things

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:34.060
really don't want to select these things
 

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.000
really don't want to select these things
on the design service you can totally

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.010
on the design service you can totally
 

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.370
on the design service you can totally
use the component tree this is becomes

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:38.380
use the component tree this is becomes
 

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.990
use the component tree this is becomes
even more useful depending on how deep

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000
even more useful depending on how deep
 

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.200
even more useful depending on how deep
or how complex your hierarchies get and

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:43.210
or how complex your hierarchies get and
 

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.670
or how complex your hierarchies get and
does the exact same thing but if you do

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680
does the exact same thing but if you do
 

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.220
does the exact same thing but if you do
like drag and drop you know you can

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:50.230
like drag and drop you know you can
 

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.720
like drag and drop you know you can
still do it and one thing that we've

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:51.730
still do it and one thing that we've
 

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.760
still do it and one thing that we've
tried to make easier is actually when

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:53.770
tried to make easier is actually when
 

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.460
tried to make easier is actually when
you drag it and so in this case we have

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:56.470
you drag it and so in this case we have
 

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.100
you drag it and so in this case we have
this new gesture which pending is called

00:16:59.100 --> 00:16:59.110
this new gesture which pending is called
 

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.010
this new gesture which pending is called
drag to Center and so I think as I

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:02.020
drag to Center and so I think as I
 

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.810
drag to Center and so I think as I
mentioned before as you drag you now see

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:03.820
mentioned before as you drag you now see
 

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.820
mentioned before as you drag you now see
all these like little targets and so

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:05.830
all these like little targets and so
 

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.829
all these like little targets and so
instead of trying to actually target

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839
instead of trying to actually target
 

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.840
instead of trying to actually target
those specific green dots you can just

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:09.850
those specific green dots you can just
 

00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:11.670
those specific green dots you can just
simply drag to the middle of the thing

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:11.680
simply drag to the middle of the thing
 

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.650
simply drag to the middle of the thing
that you want actually constrain to and

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:13.660
that you want actually constrain to and
 

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.690
that you want actually constrain to and
so in this case this is just some

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:15.700
so in this case this is just some
 

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.880
so in this case this is just some
screenshots if I drag from the mountain

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:17.890
screenshots if I drag from the mountain
 

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.400
screenshots if I drag from the mountain
view text view I can just drag all the

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:20.410
view text view I can just drag all the
 

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.720
view text view I can just drag all the
way to the middle of the cat picture

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:21.730
way to the middle of the cat picture
 

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.670
way to the middle of the cat picture
release the mouse and then I get this

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:23.680
release the mouse and then I get this
 

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.890
release the mouse and then I get this
nice pop-up menu that just shows me the

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:25.900
nice pop-up menu that just shows me the
 

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.140
nice pop-up menu that just shows me the
two constraints that I can set and so in

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:28.150
two constraints that I can set and so in
 

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.520
two constraints that I can set and so in
this case because the mountain view

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:29.530
this case because the mountain view
 

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.110
this case because the mountain view
we're going from the left of the

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120
we're going from the left of the
 

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.000
we're going from the left of the
mountain view text view to the cat

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.010
mountain view text view to the cat
 

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.980
mountain view text view to the cat
picture the two constraints that make

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:34.990
picture the two constraints that make
 

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:36.120
picture the two constraints that make
sense are actually the left and the

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:36.130
sense are actually the left and the
 

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:40.560
sense are actually the left and the
right or start and end and we actually

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:40.570
right or start and end and we actually
 

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.450
right or start and end and we actually
have this as well which comes in handy

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:42.460
have this as well which comes in handy
 

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.360
have this as well which comes in handy
when you have overlapping views and so

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:45.370
when you have overlapping views and so
 

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.430
when you have overlapping views and so
this one's pretty simple but sometimes

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440
this one's pretty simple but sometimes
 

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.870
this one's pretty simple but sometimes
you know you have views that you want to

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880
you know you have views that you want to
 

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.799
you know you have views that you want to
hide and show it run

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:49.809
hide and show it run
 

00:17:49.809 --> 00:17:52.859
hide and show it run
and so all you have to do is drag to

00:17:52.859 --> 00:17:52.869
and so all you have to do is drag to
 

00:17:52.869 --> 00:17:55.440
and so all you have to do is drag to
wherever you to the target and what

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:55.450
wherever you to the target and what
 

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:56.879
wherever you to the target and what
we'll do is actually figure out what

00:17:56.879 --> 00:17:56.889
we'll do is actually figure out what
 

00:17:56.889 --> 00:17:59.310
we'll do is actually figure out what
fuse are under that pixel that you

00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320
fuse are under that pixel that you
 

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.499
fuse are under that pixel that you
released the mouse and then show you a

00:18:01.499 --> 00:18:01.509
released the mouse and then show you a
 

00:18:01.509 --> 00:18:06.779
released the mouse and then show you a
context menu accordingly so if we move

00:18:06.779 --> 00:18:06.789
context menu accordingly so if we move
 

00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:09.330
context menu accordingly so if we move
on to view options so the design surface

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:09.340
on to view options so the design surface
 

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.009
on to view options so the design surface
has always had a bunch of view options

00:18:11.009 --> 00:18:11.019
has always had a bunch of view options
 

00:18:11.019 --> 00:18:12.719
has always had a bunch of view options
to meet to take advantage of when you're

00:18:12.719 --> 00:18:12.729
to meet to take advantage of when you're
 

00:18:12.729 --> 00:18:15.149
to meet to take advantage of when you're
working with your layouts so the two

00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:15.159
working with your layouts so the two
 

00:18:15.159 --> 00:18:17.310
working with your layouts so the two
I'll talk about specifically are which

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:17.320
I'll talk about specifically are which
 

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.169
I'll talk about specifically are which
we added is show all constraints and

00:18:19.169 --> 00:18:19.179
we added is show all constraints and
 

00:18:19.179 --> 00:18:23.249
we added is show all constraints and
live rendering so if we go back to our

00:18:23.249 --> 00:18:23.259
live rendering so if we go back to our
 

00:18:23.259 --> 00:18:26.810
live rendering so if we go back to our
login form gonna reuse this a lot you

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820
login form gonna reuse this a lot you
 

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.119
login form gonna reuse this a lot you
know the constraints are set here but

00:18:30.119 --> 00:18:30.129
know the constraints are set here but
 

00:18:30.129 --> 00:18:31.769
know the constraints are set here but
the thing is you know when you're trying

00:18:31.769 --> 00:18:31.779
the thing is you know when you're trying
 

00:18:31.779 --> 00:18:33.419
the thing is you know when you're trying
to like let's say you're new to this

00:18:33.419 --> 00:18:33.429
to like let's say you're new to this
 

00:18:33.429 --> 00:18:34.560
to like let's say you're new to this
layout and you're trying to actually

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:34.570
layout and you're trying to actually
 

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:35.879
layout and you're trying to actually
edit constraints on one of these

00:18:35.879 --> 00:18:35.889
edit constraints on one of these
 

00:18:35.889 --> 00:18:37.769
edit constraints on one of these
controls there's actually a lot going on

00:18:37.769 --> 00:18:37.779
controls there's actually a lot going on
 

00:18:37.779 --> 00:18:39.659
controls there's actually a lot going on
and actually again this is pretty

00:18:39.659 --> 00:18:39.669
and actually again this is pretty
 

00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:42.749
and actually again this is pretty
simplified compared to the normal design

00:18:42.749 --> 00:18:42.759
simplified compared to the normal design
 

00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:46.499
simplified compared to the normal design
surface and so what we've done in

00:18:46.499 --> 00:18:46.509
surface and so what we've done in
 

00:18:46.509 --> 00:18:49.289
surface and so what we've done in
Android studio 3.3 is we've added this

00:18:49.289 --> 00:18:49.299
Android studio 3.3 is we've added this
 

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:51.419
Android studio 3.3 is we've added this
option to show all constraints but it's

00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:51.429
option to show all constraints but it's
 

00:18:51.429 --> 00:18:53.209
option to show all constraints but it's
actually turned off by default and so

00:18:53.209 --> 00:18:53.219
actually turned off by default and so
 

00:18:53.219 --> 00:18:55.529
actually turned off by default and so
here's a quick video to show you what

00:18:55.529 --> 00:18:55.539
here's a quick video to show you what
 

00:18:55.539 --> 00:18:57.539
here's a quick video to show you what
that looks like and so what we'll do

00:18:57.539 --> 00:18:57.549
that looks like and so what we'll do
 

00:18:57.549 --> 00:19:00.239
that looks like and so what we'll do
instead is we only show the constraints

00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:00.249
instead is we only show the constraints
 

00:19:00.249 --> 00:19:02.759
instead is we only show the constraints
on the actively selected component so

00:19:02.759 --> 00:19:02.769
on the actively selected component so
 

00:19:02.769 --> 00:19:04.529
on the actively selected component so
this makes it easier to just you know

00:19:04.529 --> 00:19:04.539
this makes it easier to just you know
 

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:06.269
this makes it easier to just you know
work with the component that you're

00:19:06.269 --> 00:19:06.279
work with the component that you're
 

00:19:06.279 --> 00:19:07.440
work with the component that you're
actually working with and not be

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:07.450
actually working with and not be
 

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:09.239
actually working with and not be
distracted by all the arrows and margins

00:19:09.239 --> 00:19:09.249
distracted by all the arrows and margins
 

00:19:09.249 --> 00:19:11.899
distracted by all the arrows and margins
that usually come with the layout of

00:19:11.899 --> 00:19:11.909
that usually come with the layout of
 

00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:14.249
that usually come with the layout of
course you can easily turn this back on

00:19:14.249 --> 00:19:14.259
course you can easily turn this back on
 

00:19:14.259 --> 00:19:15.450
course you can easily turn this back on
if you do want to see all the

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:15.460
if you do want to see all the
 

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.019
if you do want to see all the
constraints at the same time and so this

00:19:19.019 --> 00:19:19.029
constraints at the same time and so this
 

00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:20.099
constraints at the same time and so this
is kind of showing you a side-by-side

00:19:20.099 --> 00:19:20.109
is kind of showing you a side-by-side
 

00:19:20.109 --> 00:19:22.739
is kind of showing you a side-by-side
and so on the left we have it turned off

00:19:22.739 --> 00:19:22.749
and so on the left we have it turned off
 

00:19:22.749 --> 00:19:24.269
and so on the left we have it turned off
and on the right we have it turned on

00:19:24.269 --> 00:19:24.279
and on the right we have it turned on
 

00:19:24.279 --> 00:19:26.789
and on the right we have it turned on
and so especially in the design surface

00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799
and so especially in the design surface
 

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:29.070
and so especially in the design surface
or design mode it actually cleans it up

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080
or design mode it actually cleans it up
 

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.299
or design mode it actually cleans it up
a lot because you don't have all these

00:19:30.299 --> 00:19:30.309
a lot because you don't have all these
 

00:19:30.309 --> 00:19:32.399
a lot because you don't have all these
little arrows and margins especially for

00:19:32.399 --> 00:19:32.409
little arrows and margins especially for
 

00:19:32.409 --> 00:19:34.229
little arrows and margins especially for
elements that are really close to each

00:19:34.229 --> 00:19:34.239
elements that are really close to each
 

00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:36.779
elements that are really close to each
other like the 3:22 and following and

00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:36.789
other like the 3:22 and following and
 

00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:39.989
other like the 3:22 and following and
the 20 followers and then in blueprint

00:19:39.989 --> 00:19:39.999
the 20 followers and then in blueprint
 

00:19:39.999 --> 00:19:41.509
the 20 followers and then in blueprint
mode it's the same thing

00:19:41.509 --> 00:19:41.519
mode it's the same thing
 

00:19:41.519 --> 00:19:43.799
mode it's the same thing
even though blueprint mode is heavily

00:19:43.799 --> 00:19:43.809
even though blueprint mode is heavily
 

00:19:43.809 --> 00:19:45.539
even though blueprint mode is heavily
simplified because we don't render the

00:19:45.539 --> 00:19:45.549
simplified because we don't render the
 

00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:47.700
simplified because we don't render the
components it still gets a little hairy

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:47.710
components it still gets a little hairy
 

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.339
components it still gets a little hairy
to look at and so we think this is a

00:19:50.339 --> 00:19:50.349
to look at and so we think this is a
 

00:19:50.349 --> 00:19:53.849
to look at and so we think this is a
good option as well here the other view

00:19:53.849 --> 00:19:53.859
good option as well here the other view
 

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:55.589
good option as well here the other view
option we have is live rendering so

00:19:55.589 --> 00:19:55.599
option we have is live rendering so
 

00:19:55.599 --> 00:19:57.479
option we have is live rendering so
we've actually done live rendering by

00:19:57.479 --> 00:19:57.489
we've actually done live rendering by
 

00:19:57.489 --> 00:19:59.369
we've actually done live rendering by
default in constraint layout for quite

00:19:59.369 --> 00:19:59.379
default in constraint layout for quite
 

00:19:59.379 --> 00:20:02.010
default in constraint layout for quite
some time

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:02.020
 

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:10.260
go back can I go back and so it's on by

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:10.270
go back can I go back and so it's on by
 

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.690
go back can I go back and so it's on by
default but depending on the specs of

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:12.700
default but depending on the specs of
 

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.310
default but depending on the specs of
your machine in AK it can actually be a

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320
your machine in AK it can actually be a
 

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.770
your machine in AK it can actually be a
little slow so as you drag around you

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:16.780
little slow so as you drag around you
 

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.440
little slow so as you drag around you
might you know make a mistake or

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:18.450
might you know make a mistake or
 

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.190
might you know make a mistake or
oftentimes when I've tried to use it

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200
oftentimes when I've tried to use it
 

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.810
oftentimes when I've tried to use it
it's I'll try to create a constraint and

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:21.820
it's I'll try to create a constraint and
 

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.760
it's I'll try to create a constraint and
then the button will move way after I

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:23.770
then the button will move way after I
 

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:25.950
then the button will move way after I
drag it and so that actually causes me

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:25.960
drag it and so that actually causes me
 

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:33.180
drag it and so that actually causes me
to make more mistakes and so and so if

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:33.190
to make more mistakes and so and so if
 

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.260
to make more mistakes and so and so if
you turn it off it's actually much

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:34.270
you turn it off it's actually much
 

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.510
you turn it off it's actually much
faster as you drag and move things

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.520
faster as you drag and move things
 

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.430
faster as you drag and move things
around you can still see the bounding

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:38.440
around you can still see the bounding
 

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.290
around you can still see the bounding
boxes when you're dragging around and so

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:40.300
boxes when you're dragging around and so
 

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.330
boxes when you're dragging around and so
you'll know where things end up the only

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:42.340
you'll know where things end up the only
 

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.950
you'll know where things end up the only
downside is that it just doesn't render

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:43.960
downside is that it just doesn't render
 

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.700
downside is that it just doesn't render
as you drag and alternatively you can

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:47.710
as you drag and alternatively you can
 

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.440
as you drag and alternatively you can
use blueprint mode so here we don't do

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:49.450
use blueprint mode so here we don't do
 

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.480
use blueprint mode so here we don't do
any live rendering we usually recommend

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:51.490
any live rendering we usually recommend
 

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.070
any live rendering we usually recommend
this is the best way to work with

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.080
this is the best way to work with
 

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.690
this is the best way to work with
constraint layout because you can just

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:54.700
constraint layout because you can just
 

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.520
constraint layout because you can just
focus on the constraints and so you know

00:20:59.520 --> 00:20:59.530
focus on the constraints and so you know
 

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.380
focus on the constraints and so you know
as a refresher to set these options

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:01.390
as a refresher to set these options
 

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.120
as a refresher to set these options
there in the top left corner under the

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.130
there in the top left corner under the
 

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.100
there in the top left corner under the
eyeball and if you want to switch

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:05.110
eyeball and if you want to switch
 

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.450
eyeball and if you want to switch
between design and blueprint mode that's

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:06.460
between design and blueprint mode that's
 

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.650
between design and blueprint mode that's
using the blue layers icon as well so

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:10.660
using the blue layers icon as well so
 

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.090
using the blue layers icon as well so
the other thing I'll talk about zooming

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:12.100
the other thing I'll talk about zooming
 

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.020
the other thing I'll talk about zooming
and panning so you've actually been able

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:16.030
and panning so you've actually been able
 

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.150
and panning so you've actually been able
to zoom in pan in the layout editor for

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:18.160
to zoom in pan in the layout editor for
 

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.820
to zoom in pan in the layout editor for
a while now and it comes really in handy

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:20.830
a while now and it comes really in handy
 

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:21.810
a while now and it comes really in handy
when you're dealing with constraint

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:21.820
when you're dealing with constraint
 

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.550
when you're dealing with constraint
layouts especially when again when

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:23.560
layouts especially when again when
 

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.200
layouts especially when again when
things are really small or when they're

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:25.210
things are really small or when they're
 

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.630
things are really small or when they're
really close to each other overlapping

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640
really close to each other overlapping
 

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.040
really close to each other overlapping
well what we've done in 3/3 is we've

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:29.050
well what we've done in 3/3 is we've
 

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:30.690
well what we've done in 3/3 is we've
actually changed the keyboard shortcuts

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:30.700
actually changed the keyboard shortcuts
 

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.390
actually changed the keyboard shortcuts
to match more of what we expect from the

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.400
to match more of what we expect from the
 

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.160
to match more of what we expect from the
design tools like Photoshop and sketch

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:35.170
design tools like Photoshop and sketch
 

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:39.060
design tools like Photoshop and sketch
and so to zoom in you can use commander

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:39.070
and so to zoom in you can use commander
 

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.860
and so to zoom in you can use commander
control depending on what OS you're on

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:40.870
control depending on what OS you're on
 

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.650
control depending on what OS you're on
and then the equals sign so you don't

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:43.660
and then the equals sign so you don't
 

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.360
and then the equals sign so you don't
have to actually hit shift and then the

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:45.370
have to actually hit shift and then the
 

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.040
have to actually hit shift and then the
equals sign to get the plus just hit

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:47.050
equals sign to get the plus just hit
 

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:49.230
equals sign to get the plus just hit
equals but if you really want to shift

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:49.240
equals but if you really want to shift
 

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.740
equals but if you really want to shift
it actually still works and then with

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:52.750
it actually still works and then with
 

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.090
it actually still works and then with
the mouse wheel you can use you can hold

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:54.100
the mouse wheel you can use you can hold
 

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.250
the mouse wheel you can use you can hold
commander control and scroll up and then

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:56.260
commander control and scroll up and then
 

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.600
commander control and scroll up and then
if you have a trackpad you can just

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:57.610
if you have a trackpad you can just
 

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.870
if you have a trackpad you can just
pinch in to zoom then the opposite is

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880
pinch in to zoom then the opposite is
 

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.060
pinch in to zoom then the opposite is
for zoom out so it's command control -

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:03.070
for zoom out so it's command control -
 

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.890
for zoom out so it's command control -
and then command and control with the

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:04.900
and then command and control with the
 

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.990
and then command and control with the
mouse wheel scroll down and then pinch

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.000
mouse wheel scroll down and then pinch
 

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.730
mouse wheel scroll down and then pinch
in the opposite direction and then zoom

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:11.740
in the opposite direction and then zoom
 

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.530
in the opposite direction and then zoom
to fit so if you're zoomed in and you

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:13.540
to fit so if you're zoomed in and you
 

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.910
to fit so if you're zoomed in and you
want to get back to that layout where

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:14.920
want to get back to that layout where
 

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.890
want to get back to that layout where
you can see the whole thing you

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:15.900
you can see the whole thing you
 

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.660
you can see the whole thing you
just use command and control plus zero

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:17.670
just use command and control plus zero
 

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:23.540
just use command and control plus zero
and so then if you're zoomed in and you

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:23.550
and so then if you're zoomed in and you
 

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.160
and so then if you're zoomed in and you
don't actually want to zoom out but you

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:25.170
don't actually want to zoom out but you
 

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.260
don't actually want to zoom out but you
want to pan around you can actually do

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:27.270
want to pan around you can actually do
 

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.240
want to pan around you can actually do
so by holding space and then using the

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:29.250
so by holding space and then using the
 

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.340
so by holding space and then using the
mouse to kind of click and drag and this

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:31.350
mouse to kind of click and drag and this
 

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.810
mouse to kind of click and drag and this
is kind of a familiar gesture if you've

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:32.820
is kind of a familiar gesture if you've
 

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.980
is kind of a familiar gesture if you've
used Photoshop or other design tools and

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:36.990
used Photoshop or other design tools and
 

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:38.570
used Photoshop or other design tools and
so the last tip I'll talk about is using

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:38.580
so the last tip I'll talk about is using
 

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.840
so the last tip I'll talk about is using
sample data and so a sample data in

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:41.850
sample data and so a sample data in
 

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:43.880
sample data and so a sample data in
constraint layout it's actually easier

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:43.890
constraint layout it's actually easier
 

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.740
constraint layout it's actually easier
to preview how your layouts will respond

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:45.750
to preview how your layouts will respond
 

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.420
to preview how your layouts will respond
to different content types at runtime

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:47.430
to different content types at runtime
 

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.120
to different content types at runtime
and so we actually introduced sample

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:50.130
and so we actually introduced sample
 

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:52.130
and so we actually introduced sample
data helpers in the Android studio 3 to

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.140
data helpers in the Android studio 3 to
 

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.870
data helpers in the Android studio 3 to
to make it easier to work with in the

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880
to make it easier to work with in the
 

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.840
to make it easier to work with in the
design surface specifically for image

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:56.850
design surface specifically for image
 

00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.080
design surface specifically for image
views text views and recycler views but

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.090
views text views and recycler views but
 

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.340
views text views and recycler views but
before that you could use tools

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:01.350
before that you could use tools
 

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.740
before that you could use tools
attributes in XML which are still useful

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:03.750
attributes in XML which are still useful
 

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:04.940
attributes in XML which are still useful
but we just didn't find where as

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:04.950
but we just didn't find where as
 

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.330
but we just didn't find where as
discoverable on the design surface and

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:07.340
discoverable on the design surface and
 

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.800
discoverable on the design surface and
so with the image view we have two

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:09.810
so with the image view we have two
 

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.960
so with the image view we have two
sample sets we have avatars and we have

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:11.970
sample sets we have avatars and we have
 

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:15.200
sample sets we have avatars and we have
scenic backgrounds and so if you and if

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:15.210
scenic backgrounds and so if you and if
 

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.390
scenic backgrounds and so if you and if
you want to add your own images to the

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400
you want to add your own images to the
 

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.740
you want to add your own images to the
sample data you can do so you just

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:18.750
sample data you can do so you just
 

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.810
sample data you can do so you just
create a sample data directory at the

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:20.820
create a sample data directory at the
 

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.170
create a sample data directory at the
root of your project and so with sample

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:24.180
root of your project and so with sample
 

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.550
root of your project and so with sample
data and with your image views

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:25.560
data and with your image views
 

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.800
data and with your image views
constrained you can actually just you

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:27.810
constrained you can actually just you
 

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:29.570
constrained you can actually just you
know quickly switch between different

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580
know quickly switch between different
 

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.220
know quickly switch between different
types of images and then also set

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:31.230
types of images and then also set
 

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:32.900
types of images and then also set
different aspect ratios and constraints

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:32.910
different aspect ratios and constraints
 

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.690
different aspect ratios and constraints
so you can quickly see how your layout

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:35.700
so you can quickly see how your layout
 

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.490
so you can quickly see how your layout
responds without actually having to run

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.500
responds without actually having to run
 

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.790
responds without actually having to run
your app and the same goes the text view

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:40.800
your app and the same goes the text view
 

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.530
your app and the same goes the text view
so a text view we have a bunch of sample

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:42.540
so a text view we have a bunch of sample
 

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.320
so a text view we have a bunch of sample
data so we have cities we have lorem

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:45.330
data so we have cities we have lorem
 

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.900
data so we have cities we have lorem
ipsum we have dates full name and again

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:47.910
ipsum we have dates full name and again
 

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.240
ipsum we have dates full name and again
if you want your own sample data you can

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:50.250
if you want your own sample data you can
 

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.340
if you want your own sample data you can
create it at the sample data directory

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:52.350
create it at the sample data directory
 

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:54.260
create it at the sample data directory
at the root of your project and I think

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:54.270
at the root of your project and I think
 

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:57.610
at the root of your project and I think
we support flat text files and JSON and

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:57.620
we support flat text files and JSON and
 

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.780
we support flat text files and JSON and
actually with text views I think this is

00:23:59.780 --> 00:23:59.790
actually with text views I think this is
 

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.070
actually with text views I think this is
even more important because oftentimes

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080
even more important because oftentimes
 

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.230
even more important because oftentimes
you know you'll have text views that are

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240
you know you'll have text views that are
 

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.330
you know you'll have text views that are
meant for more open-ended content such

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340
meant for more open-ended content such
 

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.550
meant for more open-ended content such
as profile descriptions so in this case

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:07.560
as profile descriptions so in this case
 

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.170
as profile descriptions so in this case
we have you know domestic shorthair is a

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:09.180
we have you know domestic shorthair is a
 

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.060
we have you know domestic shorthair is a
very short description but then on the

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:11.070
very short description but then on the
 

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.620
very short description but then on the
right this one's just you know a bunch

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:12.630
right this one's just you know a bunch
 

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:16.220
right this one's just you know a bunch
of text plopped in there and so you know

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:16.230
of text plopped in there and so you know
 

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.660
of text plopped in there and so you know
without having to run out your app you

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:17.670
without having to run out your app you
 

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.760
without having to run out your app you
can see just with sample data how your

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:19.770
can see just with sample data how your
 

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.620
can see just with sample data how your
layout responds so I don't need to copy

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:21.630
layout responds so I don't need to copy
 

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.240
layout responds so I don't need to copy
lorem ipsum off the internet every time

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:23.250
lorem ipsum off the internet every time
 

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:27.880
lorem ipsum off the internet every time
now yeah just

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:27.890
 

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.040
and I think as the you mentioned in the

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:30.050
and I think as the you mentioned in the
 

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:31.840
and I think as the you mentioned in the
previous example this is great for

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:31.850
previous example this is great for
 

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:34.500
previous example this is great for
testing out across different languages

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:34.510
testing out across different languages
 

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.520
testing out across different languages
and so with that I'll hand it back to

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:36.530
and so with that I'll hand it back to
 

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:37.990
and so with that I'll hand it back to
Sean to talk about some new features

features in the design service coming

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:45.410
features in the design service coming
 

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.800
features in the design service coming
out in 3.3 they should hopefully help

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:47.810
out in 3.3 they should hopefully help
 

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.330
out in 3.3 they should hopefully help
you use that to build constrained layout

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:49.340
you use that to build constrained layout
 

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.620
you use that to build constrained layout
and now I want to move on to new

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:50.630
and now I want to move on to new
 

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:51.910
and now I want to move on to new
features coming out at constraint layout

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:51.920
features coming out at constraint layout
 

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.360
features coming out at constraint layout
2.0 and by that I mean motion editor the

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:55.370
2.0 and by that I mean motion editor the
 

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:56.710
2.0 and by that I mean motion editor the
thing we're all very very excited about

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720
thing we're all very very excited about
 

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.080
thing we're all very very excited about
so I want to show of hands like who has

00:24:59.080 --> 00:24:59.090
so I want to show of hands like who has
 

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.400
so I want to show of hands like who has
tried playing with motion editor already

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:00.410
tried playing with motion editor already
 

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:04.750
tried playing with motion editor already
so I see five people so hopefully we can

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:04.760
so I see five people so hopefully we can
 

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.490
so I see five people so hopefully we can
give like a nice introduction here to

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:06.500
give like a nice introduction here to
 

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.530
give like a nice introduction here to
the basic concepts of motion editor and

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:08.540
the basic concepts of motion editor and
 

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.150
the basic concepts of motion editor and
then Chris is gonna go back onstage and

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:10.160
then Chris is gonna go back onstage and
 

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.190
then Chris is gonna go back onstage and
talk again about the design surface so

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:12.200
talk again about the design surface so
 

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.260
talk again about the design surface so
motion editor is their motion layout

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:14.270
motion editor is their motion layout
 

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.960
motion editor is their motion layout
allows you to build dynamic layouts

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:16.970
allows you to build dynamic layouts
 

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:18.760
allows you to build dynamic layouts
using all of the features of constraint

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:18.770
using all of the features of constraint
 

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:20.890
using all of the features of constraint
layout we talked about earlier but then

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:20.900
layout we talked about earlier but then
 

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.720
layout we talked about earlier but then
just changing the constraints over time

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:22.730
just changing the constraints over time
 

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.520
just changing the constraints over time
so here we can see an example of

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:24.530
so here we can see an example of
 

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:25.990
so here we can see an example of
building a collapsible header that Chris

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000
building a collapsible header that Chris
 

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.030
building a collapsible header that Chris
Bane's put together that does a pretty

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:28.040
Bane's put together that does a pretty
 

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.070
Bane's put together that does a pretty
dramatic animation that would be pretty

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080
dramatic animation that would be pretty
 

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.840
dramatic animation that would be pretty
hard to build with a collapsible header

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:31.850
hard to build with a collapsible header
 

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.450
hard to build with a collapsible header
itself so you see that that title image

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:34.460
itself so you see that that title image
 

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.600
itself so you see that that title image
actually hides itself behind the view as

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:37.610
actually hides itself behind the view as
 

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:38.740
actually hides itself behind the view as
it Scrolls up it's a pretty dramatic

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:38.750
it Scrolls up it's a pretty dramatic
 

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:41.860
it Scrolls up it's a pretty dramatic
animation so before we get to something

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:41.870
animation so before we get to something
 

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.300
animation so before we get to something
like that let's talk a little bit about

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:43.310
like that let's talk a little bit about
 

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:44.880
like that let's talk a little bit about
what we can build with motion layout

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:44.890
what we can build with motion layout
 

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:46.900
what we can build with motion layout
motion layout can be used to build

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:46.910
motion layout can be used to build
 

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:49.300
motion layout can be used to build
collapsible headers you can build state

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:49.310
collapsible headers you can build state
 

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:51.580
collapsible headers you can build state
feedback or transitions maybe the open

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:51.590
feedback or transitions maybe the open
 

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.280
feedback or transitions maybe the open
and closed state of a drawer and you

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:54.290
and closed state of a drawer and you
 

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.260
and closed state of a drawer and you
could also make most of the animations

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:56.270
could also make most of the animations
 

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.590
could also make most of the animations
that are in this presentation as well to

00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600
that are in this presentation as well to
 

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.240
that are in this presentation as well to
understand motion to understand

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:01.250
understand motion to understand
 

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.820
understand motion to understand
animation in general it's really

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:03.830
animation in general it's really
 

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.560
animation in general it's really
important to take a step back and think

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:05.570
important to take a step back and think
 

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.150
important to take a step back and think
about like what actually defines an

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:07.160
about like what actually defines an
 

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.740
about like what actually defines an
animation not not just on Android but

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:08.750
animation not not just on Android but
 

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.600
animation not not just on Android but
like even if a Disney movie what how do

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:10.610
like even if a Disney movie what how do
 

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.880
like even if a Disney movie what how do
they make an animation all animations

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:12.890
they make an animation all animations
 

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:16.300
they make an animation all animations
are defined by a start and an end so I

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:16.310
are defined by a start and an end so I
 

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.430
are defined by a start and an end so I
start over here I'm here and then I'm

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440
start over here I'm here and then I'm
 

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.800
start over here I'm here and then I'm
ending over here and in between over

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:20.810
ending over here and in between over
 

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.840
ending over here and in between over
time I created an animation by doing

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:22.850
time I created an animation by doing
 

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.910
time I created an animation by doing
that walking so that's a very complex

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:24.920
that walking so that's a very complex
 

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.800
that walking so that's a very complex
motion let's talk about a very simple

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:26.810
motion let's talk about a very simple
 

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.170
motion let's talk about a very simple
one and talk about the same concept I'm

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:29.180
one and talk about the same concept I'm
 

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.970
one and talk about the same concept I'm
gonna put a blue dot on the screen and

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:30.980
gonna put a blue dot on the screen and
 

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.520
gonna put a blue dot on the screen and
I'd like to build an animation in order

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:33.530
I'd like to build an animation in order
 

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.500
I'd like to build an animation in order
to do that I have to define a start I'm

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:35.510
to do that I have to define a start I'm
 

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.850
to do that I have to define a start I'm
gonna put it in the top left corner with

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:36.860
gonna put it in the top left corner with
 

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.610
gonna put it in the top left corner with
constraints I have to define an end I'm

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:39.620
constraints I have to define an end I'm
 

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.260
constraints I have to define an end I'm
gonna put that in the bottom right

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:41.270
gonna put that in the bottom right
 

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.080
gonna put that in the bottom right
corner with constraints and now in order

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:44.090
corner with constraints and now in order
 

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:45.640
corner with constraints and now in order
to build an animation all I do is

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:45.650
to build an animation all I do is
 

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.740
to build an animation all I do is
transition from one from the start to

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:47.750
transition from one from the start to
 

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.020
transition from one from the start to
the end over time and that's what motion

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:50.030
the end over time and that's what motion
 

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:51.640
the end over time and that's what motion
layout will do for you it'll figure out

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:51.650
layout will do for you it'll figure out
 

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:53.710
layout will do for you it'll figure out
how to transition that blue dot from the

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:53.720
how to transition that blue dot from the
 

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.870
how to transition that blue dot from the
start down to the end to build a motion

00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880
start down to the end to build a motion
 

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.270
start down to the end to build a motion
layout you have to start with emotion

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:01.280
layout you have to start with emotion
 

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.550
layout you have to start with emotion
layout in your XML so motion layout is a

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:03.560
layout in your XML so motion layout is a
 

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.160
layout in your XML so motion layout is a
subclass of constraint layout so we did

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:06.170
subclass of constraint layout so we did
 

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:07.660
subclass of constraint layout so we did
that so that it would have all of the

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:07.670
that so that it would have all of the
 

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:08.830
that so that it would have all of the
features of constraint layout while

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840
features of constraint layout while
 

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.510
features of constraint layout while
adding all of the new features in order

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520
adding all of the new features in order
 

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.390
adding all of the new features in order
to support animations a motion layout

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:13.400
to support animations a motion layout
 

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.820
to support animations a motion layout
then points to a motion scene which is a

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:15.830
then points to a motion scene which is a
 

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.220
then points to a motion scene which is a
separate XML file from your main layout

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:18.230
separate XML file from your main layout
 

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.440
separate XML file from your main layout
and the motion scene is where you encode

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:20.450
and the motion scene is where you encode
 

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:22.540
and the motion scene is where you encode
that start and end information that

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:22.550
that start and end information that
 

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:27.100
that start and end information that
defines your animation the start and end

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:27.110
defines your animation the start and end
 

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:30.310
defines your animation the start and end
are defined in terms of constraints sets

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320
are defined in terms of constraints sets
 

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.170
are defined in terms of constraints sets
and what are constraints us you may be

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:32.180
and what are constraints us you may be
 

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:33.520
and what are constraints us you may be
familiar with this already but if not

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:33.530
familiar with this already but if not
 

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:35.230
familiar with this already but if not
what we've been talking about so far

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240
what we've been talking about so far
 

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.270
what we've been talking about so far
looks like this right so this is what I

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:37.280
looks like this right so this is what I
 

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.860
looks like this right so this is what I
would call a constraint layout it's the

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:38.870
would call a constraint layout it's the
 

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.710
would call a constraint layout it's the
views the actual labels plus all of the

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:41.720
views the actual labels plus all of the
 

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.060
views the actual labels plus all of the
constraints and all the sizing

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:43.070
constraints and all the sizing
 

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.460
constraints and all the sizing
information a constraint set is just

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:45.470
information a constraint set is just
 

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.010
information a constraint set is just
this part it's just the constraints and

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:48.020
this part it's just the constraints and
 

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.290
this part it's just the constraints and
just the sizing information it points to

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:50.300
just the sizing information it points to
 

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.540
just the sizing information it points to
IDs of actual views but it doesn't

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:52.550
IDs of actual views but it doesn't
 

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.360
IDs of actual views but it doesn't
actually contain the views themselves

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:54.370
actually contain the views themselves
 

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:56.950
actually contain the views themselves
and if I animate a constraint set it

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960
and if I animate a constraint set it
 

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.840
and if I animate a constraint set it
would look like that and if I apply that

00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:58.850
would look like that and if I apply that
 

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:00.550
would look like that and if I apply that
to a real view and did that same

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:00.560
to a real view and did that same
 

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.850
to a real view and did that same
animation it would look like that so

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:02.860
animation it would look like that so
 

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:07.030
animation it would look like that so
let's build a a fairly you know easy to

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:07.040
let's build a a fairly you know easy to
 

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.220
let's build a a fairly you know easy to
follow along animation in constraint

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:09.230
follow along animation in constraint
 

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.950
follow along animation in constraint
layout with motion layout so here we

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:11.960
layout with motion layout so here we
 

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.930
layout with motion layout so here we
have a pretty dramatic reveal animation

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:13.940
have a pretty dramatic reveal animation
 

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.250
have a pretty dramatic reveal animation
where the title comes down to the top

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:15.260
where the title comes down to the top
 

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.830
where the title comes down to the top
the subtitle expands down below and then

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840
the subtitle expands down below and then
 

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.870
the subtitle expands down below and then
the description comes in from the bottom

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:19.880
the description comes in from the bottom
 

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.340
the description comes in from the bottom
and at the same time the image in the

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:21.350
and at the same time the image in the
 

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.770
and at the same time the image in the
background is also resizing itself so

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:23.780
background is also resizing itself so
 

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:24.790
background is also resizing itself so
there's a lot of things going on here

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:24.800
there's a lot of things going on here
 

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.950
there's a lot of things going on here
this might be actually hard to write in

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960
this might be actually hard to write in
 

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.990
this might be actually hard to write in
code but it's fairly easy to write using

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.000
code but it's fairly easy to write using
 

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.600
code but it's fairly easy to write using
motion layout so let's take a look at

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:31.610
motion layout so let's take a look at
 

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.690
motion layout so let's take a look at
how we're gonna do that so to make a

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:34.700
how we're gonna do that so to make a
 

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.630
how we're gonna do that so to make a
motion layout I'm just going to add I'm

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640
motion layout I'm just going to add I'm
 

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.610
motion layout I'm just going to add I'm
going to define the start in the end so

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:39.620
going to define the start in the end so
 

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.890
going to define the start in the end so
the start I'm gonna move that title off

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:41.900
the start I'm gonna move that title off
 

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.630
the start I'm gonna move that title off
the screen and I'm gonna do that by

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:43.640
the screen and I'm gonna do that by
 

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.310
the screen and I'm gonna do that by
making a constraint from the end of the

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:45.320
making a constraint from the end of the
 

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.160
making a constraint from the end of the
title to the start of the the viewport

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:48.170
title to the start of the the viewport
 

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:49.660

to the constraint layout and constraint

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:49.670
to the constraint layout and constraint
 

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.310
to the constraint layout and constraint
layouts very happy to lay your views out

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:51.320
layouts very happy to lay your views out
 

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.230
layouts very happy to lay your views out
off the screen if you asked it to

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.240
off the screen if you asked it to
 

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.540
off the screen if you asked it to
so please intend to do that if you ask

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:55.550
so please intend to do that if you ask
 

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:57.730
so please intend to do that if you ask
it to then we are also going to do the

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:57.740
it to then we are also going to do the
 

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.050
it to then we are also going to do the
same thing on the bottom where we're

00:28:59.050 --> 00:28:59.060
same thing on the bottom where we're
 

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.220
same thing on the bottom where we're
gonna put a constraint from that

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:00.230
gonna put a constraint from that
 

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.230
gonna put a constraint from that
description text to the bottom of the

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240
description text to the bottom of the
 

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.090
description text to the bottom of the
screen to push that description start

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:04.100
screen to push that description start
 

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:08.170
screen to push that description start
description text off the screen then to

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:08.180
description text off the screen then to
 

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.730
description text off the screen then to
actually build that we're gonna go ahead

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:09.740
actually build that we're gonna go ahead
 

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.130
actually build that we're gonna go ahead
and make a motion layout so again this

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:12.140
and make a motion layout so again this
 

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:13.870
and make a motion layout so again this
is a subclass of constraint layout and

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:13.880
is a subclass of constraint layout and
 

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.940
is a subclass of constraint layout and
it has one new tag it has this layout

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:15.950
it has one new tag it has this layout
 

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.800
it has one new tag it has this layout
description tag which is going to point

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:17.810
description tag which is going to point
 

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:19.870
description tag which is going to point
over to that motion scene file here I'm

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:19.880
over to that motion scene file here I'm
 

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.480
over to that motion scene file here I'm
gonna call it space scene then I have to

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:22.490
gonna call it space scene then I have to
 

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:25.480
gonna call it space scene then I have to
define my layout which is just the views

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:25.490
define my layout which is just the views
 

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:27.610
define my layout which is just the views
I don't give it widths and Heights I

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:27.620
I don't give it widths and Heights I
 

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.560
I don't give it widths and Heights I
don't constrain anything I'm literally

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:29.570
don't constrain anything I'm literally
 

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:31.270
don't constrain anything I'm literally
just gonna make a list of three text

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:31.280
just gonna make a list of three text
 

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.330
just gonna make a list of three text
views in an image view now I'm gonna go

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:34.340
views in an image view now I'm gonna go
 

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.860
views in an image view now I'm gonna go
over to that space scene file I was

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:35.870
over to that space scene file I was
 

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.280
over to that space scene file I was
talking about earlier this is the motion

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:39.290
talking about earlier this is the motion
 

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.710
talking about earlier this is the motion
scene file so it has a motion scene tag

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:41.720
scene file so it has a motion scene tag
 

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.840
scene file so it has a motion scene tag
and inside that it defines a transition

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:43.850
and inside that it defines a transition
 

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.690
and inside that it defines a transition
and a transition has a start and an end

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:46.700
and a transition has a start and an end
 

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.310
and a transition has a start and an end
and again that's the thing that defines

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320
and again that's the thing that defines
 

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.140
and again that's the thing that defines
an animation animation always has a

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:50.150
an animation animation always has a
 

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:54.100
an animation animation always has a
beginning and it always has an end to

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:54.110
beginning and it always has an end to
 

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.440
beginning and it always has an end to
define start I'm gonna make a constraint

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:56.450
define start I'm gonna make a constraint
 

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.890
define start I'm gonna make a constraint
set and a constraint set is just a tag

00:29:59.890 --> 00:29:59.900
set and a constraint set is just a tag
 

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.800
set and a constraint set is just a tag
it has an ID and then it defines a list

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:02.810
it has an ID and then it defines a list
 

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:04.540
it has an ID and then it defines a list
of constraints and it's gonna have to

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:04.550
of constraints and it's gonna have to
 

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:06.220
of constraints and it's gonna have to
define a constraint for every single

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:06.230
define a constraint for every single
 

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:08.680
define a constraint for every single
view that its constraining here I'm just

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:08.690
view that its constraining here I'm just
 

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.150
view that its constraining here I'm just
gonna show one of the views and leave

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:10.160
gonna show one of the views and leave
 

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.800
gonna show one of the views and leave
the others off the slide deck because I

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:11.810
the others off the slide deck because I
 

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.410
the others off the slide deck because I
got a little long but will give will say

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:14.420
got a little long but will give will say
 

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:15.820
got a little long but will give will say
which idea I'm constraining I'm gonna

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:15.830
which idea I'm constraining I'm gonna
 

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.740
which idea I'm constraining I'm gonna
constrain the title I'm gonna set its

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:17.750
constrain the title I'm gonna set its
 

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.270
constrain the title I'm gonna set its
height width and I'm going to set its

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:19.280
height width and I'm going to set its
 

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.250
height width and I'm going to set its
padding and then I'm also going to

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:21.260
padding and then I'm also going to
 

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.050
padding and then I'm also going to
constrain to push it off the screen I'm

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:23.060
constrain to push it off the screen I'm
 

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.180
constrain to push it off the screen I'm
gonna constrain the end to the start of

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:25.190
gonna constrain the end to the start of
 

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:28.360
gonna constrain the end to the start of
parent let me do the same thing for the

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:28.370
parent let me do the same thing for the
 

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:30.850
parent let me do the same thing for the
constraints that end I'm going to just

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:30.860
constraints that end I'm going to just
 

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.490
constraints that end I'm going to just
go ahead and make the title view

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:33.500
go ahead and make the title view
 

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.770
go ahead and make the title view
constrain the start to the start of

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:35.780
constrain the start to the start of
 

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.690
constrain the start to the start of
parent and this brings that title onto

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:37.700
parent and this brings that title onto
 

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.130
parent and this brings that title onto
the screen I'm gonna do the same thing

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:39.140
the screen I'm gonna do the same thing
 

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.300
the screen I'm gonna do the same thing
for all of the other views in this

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:40.310
for all of the other views in this
 

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:42.490
for all of the other views in this
layout as well and that's all I have to

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:42.500
layout as well and that's all I have to
 

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.440
layout as well and that's all I have to
do it's just a little bit of declarative

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:44.450
do it's just a little bit of declarative
 

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:50.320
do it's just a little bit of declarative
XML and I've built this animation so now

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:50.330
XML and I've built this animation so now
 

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:51.880
XML and I've built this animation so now
I'm gonna pass it back to Chris he's

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:51.890
I'm gonna pass it back to Chris he's
 

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:55.080
I'm gonna pass it back to Chris he's
going to talk a little bit more about

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:55.090
going to talk a little bit more about
 

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:59.220
going to talk a little bit more about
the motion editor

00:30:59.220 --> 00:30:59.230
 

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:02.140
so at i/o this year we gave you a sneak

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:02.150
so at i/o this year we gave you a sneak
 

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:04.030
so at i/o this year we gave you a sneak
preview of the motion editor when we had

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:04.040
preview of the motion editor when we had
 

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.460
preview of the motion editor when we had
announced motion layout since then we've

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:06.470
announced motion layout since then we've
 

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:09.400
announced motion layout since then we've
been working pretty hard on it but it's

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:09.410
been working pretty hard on it but it's
 

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:12.070
been working pretty hard on it but it's
not quite ready yet sorry to say but

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080
not quite ready yet sorry to say but
 

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.690
not quite ready yet sorry to say but
we're still very excited about it

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:13.700
we're still very excited about it
 

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.940
we're still very excited about it
but we also wanted to make sure that we

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:15.950
but we also wanted to make sure that we
 

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:17.500
but we also wanted to make sure that we
focus on getting some foundational

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:17.510
focus on getting some foundational
 

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:20.410
focus on getting some foundational
pieces in place before we release it we

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:20.420
pieces in place before we release it we
 

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.390
pieces in place before we release it we
also don't want to be too impatient and

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:22.400
also don't want to be too impatient and
 

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.800
also don't want to be too impatient and
really make sure we get it right

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:23.810
really make sure we get it right
 

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:25.660
really make sure we get it right
unlike some things we've released too

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:25.670
unlike some things we've released too
 

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:31.320
unlike some things we've released too
early in the past like instant run

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:31.330
 

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:33.760
so the first foundational piece is

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:33.770
so the first foundational piece is
 

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:35.350
so the first foundational piece is
really the motion layout library itself

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360
really the motion layout library itself
 

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.090
really the motion layout library itself
so we just talked about that and it's

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:37.100
so we just talked about that and it's
 

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.490
so we just talked about that and it's
been out for a while and so before we

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:39.500
been out for a while and so before we
 

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.170
been out for a while and so before we
got too far in building the tool we

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:41.180
got too far in building the tool we
 

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:42.340
got too far in building the tool we
wanted to make sure that we actually

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:42.350
wanted to make sure that we actually
 

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:44.380
wanted to make sure that we actually
nailed the right animation concepts and

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:44.390
nailed the right animation concepts and
 

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:46.240
nailed the right animation concepts and
controls that are required to make these

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:46.250
controls that are required to make these
 

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.640
controls that are required to make these
simple and beautiful animations on top

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:48.650
simple and beautiful animations on top
 

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.260
simple and beautiful animations on top
of that the library also needs to be

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:50.270
of that the library also needs to be
 

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.360
of that the library also needs to be
performant and integrate well with your

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:52.370
performant and integrate well with your
 

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.670
performant and integrate well with your
existing views and so John Hufford and

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:54.680
existing views and so John Hufford and
 

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.680
existing views and so John Hufford and
Nicolas have been really working hard on

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:56.690
Nicolas have been really working hard on
 

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:58.810
Nicolas have been really working hard on
the library and so they love all your

00:31:58.810 --> 00:31:58.820
the library and so they love all your
 

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.160
the library and so they love all your
feedback and all the really cool demos

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:00.170
feedback and all the really cool demos
 

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:02.230
feedback and all the really cool demos
that have been coming out so please keep

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240
that have been coming out so please keep
 

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.230
that have been coming out so please keep
it coming and thank you but the other

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.240
it coming and thank you but the other
 

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.610
it coming and thank you but the other
thing is actually the quality of Android

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:06.620
thing is actually the quality of Android
 

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.950
thing is actually the quality of Android
studio and so this is the second

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960
studio and so this is the second
 

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.600
studio and so this is the second
foundational piece and it's been the

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:10.610
foundational piece and it's been the
 

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:12.520
foundational piece and it's been the
primary focus for us in three three and

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:12.530
primary focus for us in three three and
 

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:15.220
primary focus for us in three three and
the upcoming three four release and so

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:15.230
the upcoming three four release and so
 

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:16.690
the upcoming three four release and so
in this case we've made a lot of

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:16.700
in this case we've made a lot of
 

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.820
in this case we've made a lot of
performance dinner sorry performance and

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:18.830
performance dinner sorry performance and
 

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:20.830
performance dinner sorry performance and
interaction improvements to the design

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:20.840
interaction improvements to the design
 

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.360
interaction improvements to the design
surface because it actually has to be

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:22.370
surface because it actually has to be
 

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.700
surface because it actually has to be
able to render animations at 60 frames

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:24.710
able to render animations at 60 frames
 

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.790
able to render animations at 60 frames
per second and also making it easier to

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:27.800
per second and also making it easier to
 

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.830
per second and also making it easier to
work with constraints because one of the

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840
work with constraints because one of the
 

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.660
work with constraints because one of the
biggest prerequisites of motion layout

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:31.670
biggest prerequisites of motion layout
 

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:32.770
biggest prerequisites of motion layout
is you have to know how to use

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:32.780
is you have to know how to use
 

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.750
is you have to know how to use
constraint layout and so we think that

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:34.760
constraint layout and so we think that
 

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.640
constraint layout and so we think that
if we invest in the quality now in the

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:36.650
if we invest in the quality now in the
 

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:38.380
if we invest in the quality now in the
tool it will actually make the motion

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:38.390
tool it will actually make the motion
 

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.030
tool it will actually make the motion
editor experience much better in the

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:40.040
editor experience much better in the
 

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.510
editor experience much better in the
future and so with that I'm here to show

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:43.520
future and so with that I'm here to show
 

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.120
future and so with that I'm here to show
you some very early explorations of the

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:46.130
you some very early explorations of the
 

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.890
you some very early explorations of the
motion editor these are just mock-ups

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:47.900
motion editor these are just mock-ups
 

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.100
motion editor these are just mock-ups
this is not the build I'm the designer

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:51.110
this is not the build I'm the designer
 

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.350
this is not the build I'm the designer
remember so this is all made in

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360
remember so this is all made in
 

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.870
remember so this is all made in
Photoshop yeah this is all four of

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880
Photoshop yeah this is all four of
 

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.890

think John is here as well I will be at

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:01.730
think John is here as well I will be at
 

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.500
think John is here as well I will be at
the speaker QA to talk more about it

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:04.510
the speaker QA to talk more about it
 

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:07.270
the speaker QA to talk more about it
so if we take the example from before

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:07.280
so if we take the example from before
 

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.640
so if we take the example from before
where we have the space picture and we

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:09.650
where we have the space picture and we
 

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.830
where we have the space picture and we
have some text views animating in let's

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840
have some text views animating in let's
 

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.070
have some text views animating in let's
just

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080
just
 

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.630
just
use that as kind of the context of what

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:13.640
use that as kind of the context of what
 

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.789
use that as kind of the context of what
we'll see in the motion editor so what

00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799
we'll see in the motion editor so what
 

00:33:15.799 --> 00:33:20.440
we'll see in the motion editor so what
does that actually look like so here we

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:20.450
does that actually look like so here we
 

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.120
does that actually look like so here we
have a new perspective on the

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:22.130
have a new perspective on the
 

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.279
have a new perspective on the
componentry which for now we're just

00:33:24.279 --> 00:33:24.289
componentry which for now we're just
 

00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:27.070
componentry which for now we're just
calling the transitions view and so for

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.080
calling the transitions view and so for
 

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.330
calling the transitions view and so for
the purpose of the talk I'm just going

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:28.340
the purpose of the talk I'm just going
 

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.090
the purpose of the talk I'm just going
to talk about this new view because we

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:31.100
to talk about this new view because we
 

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.740
to talk about this new view because we
think this is the most significant

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:32.750
think this is the most significant
 

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.799
think this is the most significant
animation part of the new UI of course

00:33:35.799 --> 00:33:35.809
animation part of the new UI of course
 

00:33:35.809 --> 00:33:37.120
animation part of the new UI of course
you know later on you'll actually have

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:37.130
you know later on you'll actually have
 

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:38.710
you know later on you'll actually have
the other views like the property panel

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720
the other views like the property panel
 

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.620
the other views like the property panel
and the palette but we we haven't quite

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:41.630
and the palette but we we haven't quite
 

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:42.820
and the palette but we we haven't quite
figured out the details of how that

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:42.830
figured out the details of how that
 

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:45.220
figured out the details of how that
integrates with this timeline or this

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:45.230
integrates with this timeline or this
 

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:48.629
integrates with this timeline or this
transition view so stay tuned for that

00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:48.639
transition view so stay tuned for that
 

00:33:48.639 --> 00:33:50.860
transition view so stay tuned for that
so in this case we have the start of the

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:50.870
so in this case we have the start of the
 

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:53.440
so in this case we have the start of the
transition and so you can see that the

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:53.450
transition and so you can see that the
 

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.060
transition and so you can see that the
text views are actually off the viewport

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:55.070
text views are actually off the viewport
 

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:56.740
text views are actually off the viewport
but you can see that there's a motion

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:56.750
but you can see that there's a motion
 

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.990
but you can see that there's a motion
path that goes from without side and

00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.000
path that goes from without side and
 

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.750
path that goes from without side and
then in we don't actually render the

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760
then in we don't actually render the
 

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.730
then in we don't actually render the
text views outside the viewport today

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:03.740
text views outside the viewport today
 

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.350
text views outside the viewport today
but that's definitely something that we

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360
but that's definitely something that we
 

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.940
but that's definitely something that we
will need to have for animation because

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:06.950
will need to have for animation because
 

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:09.099
will need to have for animation because
we know that's a very typical animation

00:34:09.099 --> 00:34:09.109
we know that's a very typical animation
 

00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:13.480
we know that's a very typical animation
example to have things fly-in and so if

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:13.490
example to have things fly-in and so if
 

00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:15.220
example to have things fly-in and so if
we kind of fast-forward through halfway

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:15.230
we kind of fast-forward through halfway
 

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:17.290
we kind of fast-forward through halfway
through the transition so now you can

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:17.300
through the transition so now you can
 

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.000
through the transition so now you can
see that the text views have moved about

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:19.010
see that the text views have moved about
 

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:22.119
see that the text views have moved about
half way in and in this case we have the

00:34:22.119 --> 00:34:22.129
half way in and in this case we have the
 

00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:24.909
half way in and in this case we have the
space image zoom back out and that's

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:24.919
space image zoom back out and that's
 

00:34:24.919 --> 00:34:28.899
space image zoom back out and that's
kind of what we intended here so free if

00:34:28.899 --> 00:34:28.909
kind of what we intended here so free if
 

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:31.359
kind of what we intended here so free if
we were wined let's go deeper on what

00:34:31.359 --> 00:34:31.369
we were wined let's go deeper on what
 

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:35.230
we were wined let's go deeper on what
this transition view actually does so

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:35.240
this transition view actually does so
 

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.419
this transition view actually does so
we're only showing one transition right

00:34:37.419 --> 00:34:37.429
we're only showing one transition right
 

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:40.480
we're only showing one transition right
now and it's uniquely named by its start

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:40.490
now and it's uniquely named by its start
 

00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:42.700
now and it's uniquely named by its start
and end constraint set which simply is

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:42.710
and end constraint set which simply is
 

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:44.859
and end constraint set which simply is
just start and end in this case you can

00:34:44.859 --> 00:34:44.869
just start and end in this case you can
 

00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:46.869
just start and end in this case you can
have multiple transitions per motion

00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879
have multiple transitions per motion
 

00:34:46.879 --> 00:34:48.849
have multiple transitions per motion
layout and so with this drop down you'll

00:34:48.849 --> 00:34:48.859
layout and so with this drop down you'll
 

00:34:48.859 --> 00:34:50.649
layout and so with this drop down you'll
be able to switch between the different

00:34:50.649 --> 00:34:50.659
be able to switch between the different
 

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:52.810
be able to switch between the different
transitions and of course we'll load the

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:52.820
transitions and of course we'll load the
 

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.240
transitions and of course we'll load the
corresponding constraint sets and change

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:55.250
corresponding constraint sets and change
 

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:56.470
corresponding constraint sets and change
the timelines so you can see how the

00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480
the timelines so you can see how the
 

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.320
the timelines so you can see how the
components change and so each transition

00:34:59.320 --> 00:34:59.330
components change and so each transition
 

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.390
components change and so each transition
has its own properties which is of

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:01.400
has its own properties which is of
 

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.190
has its own properties which is of
course the start and the end constraint

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200
course the start and the end constraint
 

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.470
course the start and the end constraint
set it has the duration which is

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480
set it has the duration which is
 

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.930
set it has the duration which is
expressed in milliseconds and the

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:07.940
expressed in milliseconds and the
 

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.670
expressed in milliseconds and the
stagger property which allows you to

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680
stagger property which allows you to
 

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.190
stagger property which allows you to
actually stagger the the animation

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200
actually stagger the the animation
 

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:16.180
actually stagger the the animation
itself so if we move down we have the

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:16.190
itself so if we move down we have the
 

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.579
itself so if we move down we have the
timeline and so you have starting from

00:35:18.579 --> 00:35:18.589
timeline and so you have starting from
 

00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:20.410
timeline and so you have starting from
the left you have the playback bar so

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:20.420
the left you have the playback bar so
 

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.150
the left you have the playback bar so
you can loop the animation as many times

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160
you can loop the animation as many times
 

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.620
you can loop the animation as many times
as you want just to get the animation

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:23.630
as you want just to get the animation
 

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:26.030
as you want just to get the animation
right you can quickly jump to the start

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040
right you can quickly jump to the start
 

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.220
right you can quickly jump to the start
or the end and if you want to speed down

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:28.230
or the end and if you want to speed down
 

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:30.500
or the end and if you want to speed down
or sorry to speed up or slow down the

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:30.510
or sorry to speed up or slow down the
 

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:32.240
or sorry to speed up or slow down the
animation we also allow that as well

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:32.250
animation we also allow that as well
 

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:34.370
animation we also allow that as well
again just to like tune the animation

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.380
again just to like tune the animation
 

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:37.850
again just to like tune the animation
perfectly and we have this time control

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:37.860
perfectly and we have this time control
 

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.820
perfectly and we have this time control
here so you can actually step through

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:39.830
here so you can actually step through
 

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.810
here so you can actually step through
millisecond by millisecond just to see

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:41.820
millisecond by millisecond just to see
 

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.420
millisecond by millisecond just to see
how the animation plays out and then for

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:44.430
how the animation plays out and then for
 

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.190
how the animation plays out and then for
the timeline itself you know we show

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200
the timeline itself you know we show
 

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.310
the timeline itself you know we show
from 0 to 100 100 being the end and so

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.320
from 0 to 100 100 being the end and so
 

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.320
from 0 to 100 100 being the end and so
you can use this slider here to actually

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:51.330
you can use this slider here to actually
 

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:52.700
you can use this slider here to actually
make the timeline bigger or smaller

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:52.710
make the timeline bigger or smaller
 

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:54.380
make the timeline bigger or smaller
depending on which part of the

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:54.390
depending on which part of the
 

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:58.220
depending on which part of the
transition you want to focus on and so

00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:58.230
transition you want to focus on and so
 

00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:59.780
transition you want to focus on and so
if we move down we can actually see all

00:35:59.780 --> 00:35:59.790
if we move down we can actually see all
 

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.340
if we move down we can actually see all
the components that you can animate in

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:01.350
the components that you can animate in
 

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.410
the components that you can animate in
the motion layout and so in this case

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420
the motion layout and so in this case
 

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.910
the motion layout and so in this case
each component will show that they have

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920
each component will show that they have
 

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.040
each component will show that they have
a start and an end constraint set which

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:07.050
a start and an end constraint set which
 

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.840
a start and an end constraint set which
are required in order to actually

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:08.850
are required in order to actually
 

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:12.020
are required in order to actually
animate anything and so if we look

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:12.030
animate anything and so if we look
 

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.060
animate anything and so if we look
specifically at the space flash image it

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:14.070
specifically at the space flash image it
 

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.880
specifically at the space flash image it
has a key attribute in the middle or a

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:16.890
has a key attribute in the middle or a
 

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:18.410
has a key attribute in the middle or a
keyframe which we're actually going to

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.420
keyframe which we're actually going to
 

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.060
keyframe which we're actually going to
change the scale type halfway through

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:20.070
change the scale type halfway through
 

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.810
change the scale type halfway through
the animation and so if we zoom out

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:23.820
the animation and so if we zoom out
 

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.300
the animation and so if we zoom out
those icons on the timeline actually

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:26.310
those icons on the timeline actually
 

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:28.190
those icons on the timeline actually
correspond to the same icons on the

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200
correspond to the same icons on the
 

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.930
correspond to the same icons on the
design surface that way you can actually

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:29.940
design surface that way you can actually
 

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.290
design surface that way you can actually
kind of correlate okay here's my

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:32.300
kind of correlate okay here's my
 

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.550
kind of correlate okay here's my
components that I'm animating and where

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560
components that I'm animating and where
 

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.230
components that I'm animating and where
they're starting and ending and what are

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240
they're starting and ending and what are
 

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:41.840
they're starting and ending and what are
the actual motion paths and so that's

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:41.850
the actual motion paths and so that's
 

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:43.070
the actual motion paths and so that's
kind of where we are with the motion

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:43.080
kind of where we are with the motion
 

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.940
kind of where we are with the motion
editor we hope to get it out soon but I

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:46.950
editor we hope to get it out soon but I
 

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:50.120
editor we hope to get it out soon but I
can't promise anything and so your next

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:50.130
can't promise anything and so your next
 

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:56.380
can't promise anything and so your next
year yeah sometime in 2019 and that's it

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:56.390
year yeah sometime in 2019 and that's it
 

00:36:56.390 --> 00:37:00.190
year yeah sometime in 2019 and that's it
[Applause]

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:00.200
[Applause]
 

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:15.219
[Applause]
