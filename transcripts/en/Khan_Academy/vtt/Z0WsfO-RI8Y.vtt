00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:02.540
We've already seen that
if we take a whole,

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.360
and in this example, the whole
is this entire green circle.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.151
And if we were to split it into
5 equal sections-- 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:10.650
5.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.220
So we've split it into
5 equal sections--

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.160
and if we were to select 1
of those 5 equal sections.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.450
So let's say we select this
section right over here,

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.120
that we have selected
1/5 of the whole, 1 out

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.840
of the 5 equal sections.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.482
We could do the exact same
thing on a number line.

00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:31.940
Everything we've been doing so
far has to deal with shapes,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.890
but we could do the exact
same idea on a number line.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.460
So let me draw a
number line here.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.875
So let me draw it pretty big
so we get a sense of things.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.240
So it will go all
the way to there.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:54.144
And let's say that this is
0, this is 1, and this is 2.

00:00:54.144 --> 00:00:55.560
And of course, we
could keep going

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.320
if we had more space to 3,
4, and on and on and on.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.480
And what I want to do,
instead of taking a circle

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.700
and dividing it into
5 equal sections,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.550
I want to take the section of
our number line between 0 and 1

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.969
and divide it into
5 equal sections.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.260
So let me see if I can do this.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.940
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.180
That looks pretty good.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.820
I'm drawing it as exact
as I can with my hand.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.540
But let's just assume
these are 5 equal sections.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.360
So what would you think would
be a good label for this number

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.070
right over here?

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.430
Well, it's the exact same idea.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.360
Between 0 and 1,
I've traveled 1 out

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.752
of the 5 equal
sections towards 1.

00:01:37.752 --> 00:01:40.210
And actually, let me make it
a little bit neater than that.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.626
We could make the equal sections
look a little bit better.

00:01:42.626 --> 00:01:46.647
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:46.647 --> 00:01:48.230
And what we're
thinking about is this.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.260
What should we call
this number here?

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.980
This number is clearly
between 0 and 1.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.790
It's clearly closer to 0.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.810
And we've gone 1 out of the
5 equal sections towards 1.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.880
Well, it makes complete
sense that, look,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.250
we had 5 equal sections here.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.990
And we've traveled
1 of them towards 1.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.740
So we should call this
number right over here 1/5.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.360
So when we're talking
about a fraction, 1/5,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.390
it's not just talking about,
hey, what part of a pizza pie

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.400
have I eaten or
something like that.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.430
This is actually a number.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.260
This is a number.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.895
And we can actually plot
it on the number line.

00:02:27.895 --> 00:02:30.020
Now you might say, OK,
well, that's fair about 1/5.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.645
But what about all
these other slashes?

00:02:31.645 --> 00:02:33.250
What numbers would we call that?

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.940
Well, we can make
the exact same idea.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.810
If up here, instead of
shading in 1 out of the 5

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.970
equal sections, if I shaded in
2 of the 5 equal sections, then

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.620
I wouldn't say this
is 1/5 any more.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.260
I would say that this 2/5.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.860
And so if I go 2 of the
equal sections towards 1,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.670
then I should call this
number right over here 2/5.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.240
And I could keep going.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.796
This right over here
should be 3, 3/5.

00:03:05.796 --> 00:03:09.230
This right over here,
I've gone 1, 2, 3, 4

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.680
out of the 5 sections towards 1.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.202
So I could call this 4/5.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.070
And I could keep going.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.528
I could call this
right over here--

00:03:18.528 --> 00:03:22.020
I've traveled 5 out of the
5 equal sections towards 5,

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.110
so I could call this
right over here 5.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.850
Let me do it in that red color.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.360
I could call this
right over here 5/5.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.160
You might say, wait, but
5/5, we've gotten to 1.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.600
And that's exactly right.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.070
If I were to shade in
5 things over here--

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.820
let me do that
little bit cleaner.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.310
That's not the
color I want to use.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.170
If I were to shade in
5 things over here,

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.040
we've already seen that
shading in 5 things--

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.770
let me make this a
little bit neater--

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.110
if this is now 5
over 5 or 5/5, we've

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.830
already seen that
this is a whole.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.130
And over here, if we've traveled
5/5 of the way towards 1,

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.170
we've gotten to the whole 1.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.760
5/5 is the exact
same thing as 1.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.942
It is equal to a whole.
