00:08:53.854 --> 00:08:57.707
- Hello, and welcome to
Khan Academy Live SAT.

00:08:57.707 --> 00:09:00.187
I'm Eric, I'm an SAT tutor and one of the

00:09:00.187 --> 00:09:02.708
SAT experts here at Khan Academy,

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.771
and I'm so excited to be with you today,

00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:06.596
and over the course of the next few weeks,

00:09:06.596 --> 00:09:09.737
as we cover SAT math, reading and writing

00:09:09.737 --> 00:09:11.103
with one class a week.

00:09:11.103 --> 00:09:12.550
Now before we get into SAT math,

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.252
which is our topic for today,

00:09:14.252 --> 00:09:16.486
I want to give you a quick
overview of what's coming up,

00:09:16.486 --> 00:09:19.130
for each of the next few weeks.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.700
Let's take a look.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.654
So like I mentioned,

00:09:21.654 --> 00:09:23.472
today's class is going to cover SAT math,

00:09:23.472 --> 00:09:26.055
next week on Tuesday, May 23rd,

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.382
at 7:00 pm Eastern, 4:00 pm Pacific,

00:09:29.382 --> 00:09:31.032
I'm going to cover SAT writing,

00:09:31.032 --> 00:09:33.642
followed by SAT reading, rather,

00:09:33.642 --> 00:09:35.503
followed by SAT writing.

00:09:35.503 --> 00:09:37.040
And you'll see that all of these classes

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.773
will happen at Tuesdays,
at the exact same time,

00:09:39.773 --> 00:09:41.228
so if you were able to make it today,

00:09:41.228 --> 00:09:42.266
you'll also be able to make it

00:09:42.266 --> 00:09:44.165
for the following classes.

00:09:44.165 --> 00:09:46.975
And you know, if you can't
make any of these classes,

00:09:46.975 --> 00:09:50.092
don't worry, we'll record
all of the classes,

00:09:50.092 --> 00:09:51.254
and send out the recordings,

00:09:51.254 --> 00:09:53.080
so that you can watch each of the classes,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.551
whenever is most convenient for you.

00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:58.656
And so that's sneak
peak at what's coming up

00:09:58.656 --> 00:10:00.313
for the next few weeks,

00:10:00.313 --> 00:10:02.463
and for today, let's take a look at what

00:10:02.463 --> 00:10:04.796
we'll cover within SAT math.

00:10:06.637 --> 00:10:09.175
So for today, the first
thing I'm going to cover

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:11.326
is how to avoid careless mistakes,

00:10:11.326 --> 00:10:12.860
and the reason I want
to cover this is that,

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.776
you know, careless
mistakes are a possibility

00:10:15.776 --> 00:10:19.165
for anyone and on any
topic within SAT math.

00:10:19.165 --> 00:10:23.332
And so it's great to start
out with, as a foundation.

00:10:24.265 --> 00:10:26.468
Next thing I want to cover
is function notation,

00:10:26.468 --> 00:10:28.825
and this is another one of
those really common concepts,

00:10:28.825 --> 00:10:32.174
that can show up in a
variety of ways in the SAT.

00:10:32.174 --> 00:10:35.520
And third, I'll cover graph problems,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.296
graphing table problems on the SAT,

00:10:37.296 --> 00:10:39.575
and I'm covering this because not only

00:10:39.575 --> 00:10:42.190
do graphs and tables
show up within SAT math,

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:46.000
but in the evidence based
reading and writing sections,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.781
you'll often come across graphs and tables

00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:50.385
that you'll be asked to interpret

00:10:50.385 --> 00:10:53.080
and relate back to the author's point.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.485
And then last, but not least,

00:10:54.485 --> 00:10:56.892
I'll wrap up with a Khan Academy badge,

00:10:56.892 --> 00:10:58.585
for attending this class,

00:10:58.585 --> 00:11:01.615
and answer any questions at the end,

00:11:01.615 --> 00:11:05.091
on anything that I covered for the day.

00:11:05.091 --> 00:11:09.174
And so, we've got a lot
of topics to cover today,

00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:12.391
so let's dive straight
in, start doing some math,

00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:15.141
and doing some practice problems.

00:11:16.564 --> 00:11:19.682
So first, how should you
avoid careless mistakes

00:11:19.682 --> 00:11:20.922
on the SAT math?

00:11:20.922 --> 00:11:23.775
So what I'll share today is one approach

00:11:23.775 --> 00:11:26.917
that has really helped me be
more organized and methodical,

00:11:26.917 --> 00:11:29.566
and cut down on the number of error,

00:11:29.566 --> 00:11:31.018
careless mistakes that I make,

00:11:31.018 --> 00:11:32.645
and I've found that a
lot of other students

00:11:32.645 --> 00:11:34.507
also find it helpful.

00:11:34.507 --> 00:11:36.579
And so the first step I
encourage you to take is,

00:11:36.579 --> 00:11:39.292
to read and understand the
question one part at a time.

00:11:39.292 --> 00:11:41.937
So when you break things up and annotate,

00:11:41.937 --> 00:11:43.416
and underline as you go,

00:11:43.416 --> 00:11:46.469
it will help you process
all of the information,

00:11:46.469 --> 00:11:48.453
and keep you focused on the question.

00:11:48.453 --> 00:11:50.151
Next I encourage you to write out

00:11:50.151 --> 00:11:53.157
the steps you need to
take to solve the problem,

00:11:53.157 --> 00:11:55.102
so this will prevent you from going

00:11:55.102 --> 00:11:57.685
one step too far, or too short.

00:11:59.978 --> 00:12:01.960
And so this is really helpful,

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.059
and it's almost like a roadmap
for what you want to do

00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:07.892
first, second, third and so forth.

00:12:08.946 --> 00:12:11.341
Next, you really want
to do the math on paper,

00:12:11.341 --> 00:12:14.397
or on the calculator and,
now matter how confident

00:12:14.397 --> 00:12:16.674
you might be feeling,
I really discourage you

00:12:16.674 --> 00:12:20.138
from doing, from doing this in your head,

00:12:20.138 --> 00:12:22.264
as it really ups the chances

00:12:22.264 --> 00:12:23.986
that you make a careless mistake.

00:12:23.986 --> 00:12:27.211
And so, put it on paper, type
it out on your calculator.

00:12:27.211 --> 00:12:28.626
And then last but not least,

00:12:28.626 --> 00:12:31.261
mark down the answer in your test booklet,

00:12:31.261 --> 00:12:34.984
and so, if you have A, B, C, D like this,

00:12:34.984 --> 00:12:38.827
you can circle A, or you can
write out A and block it,

00:12:38.827 --> 00:12:40.504
and this is all about making sure that

00:12:40.504 --> 00:12:42.018
once you have the right answer,

00:12:42.018 --> 00:12:45.601
that answer gets to
your, the bubble sheet.

00:12:47.236 --> 00:12:50.541
And so, four steps that I like to follow,

00:12:50.541 --> 00:12:52.336
read and understand the question,

00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:54.671
second, write out the
steps you need to take,

00:12:54.671 --> 00:12:57.132
third, do the math on
paper or on the calculator,

00:12:57.132 --> 00:13:01.195
and then finally, mark down
the answer in your testbook.

00:13:01.195 --> 00:13:04.814
And so, this process is
one that I try and use,

00:13:04.814 --> 00:13:06.235
regardless of what I'm working on,

00:13:06.235 --> 00:13:08.145
whether it's quadratic formula,

00:13:08.145 --> 00:13:09.980
or right triangle questions,

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.442
or function notation problems.

00:13:11.442 --> 00:13:14.618
And so, give this process a try,

00:13:14.618 --> 00:13:16.036
and what we'll do now is,

00:13:16.036 --> 00:13:18.422
instead of just walking
through the concept,

00:13:18.422 --> 00:13:21.647
apply this in the context
of real SAT math questions.

00:13:21.647 --> 00:13:25.147
And so let's take a look at our first one.

00:13:27.505 --> 00:13:28.718
And I'm going to zoom in here,

00:13:28.718 --> 00:13:31.106
just to make sure everyone can read it.

00:13:31.106 --> 00:13:32.407
So in this first question,

00:13:32.407 --> 00:13:34.195
I'm going to read the question first,

00:13:34.195 --> 00:13:35.902
so which of the following expressions

00:13:35.902 --> 00:13:39.458
is equivalent to the above expression?

00:13:39.458 --> 00:13:43.801
And so, it's a pretty
straightforward question,

00:13:43.801 --> 00:13:45.387
and so I understand that,

00:13:45.387 --> 00:13:47.849
and then I want to figure
out the steps I want to take,

00:13:47.849 --> 00:13:49.775
and so this is, you've got,

00:13:49.775 --> 00:13:51.450
notice you've got some multiplication,

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.987
and you've got some subtraction,

00:13:52.987 --> 00:13:56.589
and so I want to do multiply first,

00:13:56.589 --> 00:13:59.095
and then I want to do the subtraction.

00:13:59.095 --> 00:14:01.775
And so this is some good
Order of Operations,

00:14:01.775 --> 00:14:04.124
and if you want a quick refresher on

00:14:04.124 --> 00:14:05.947
the Order of Operations,
head on over to Khan Academy,

00:14:05.947 --> 00:14:08.085
and do a quick search, but for now,

00:14:08.085 --> 00:14:10.089
I'll just rewrite this here,

00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:12.641
and start doing some of the math.

00:14:12.641 --> 00:14:15.558
Negative five z minus two, minus z,

00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:19.835
times three minus z,

00:14:19.835 --> 00:14:21.619
and before I go any further,

00:14:21.619 --> 00:14:23.003
I want to note that, you know,

00:14:23.003 --> 00:14:24.672
it's important for questions like this

00:14:24.672 --> 00:14:28.590
to really differentiate
your two and your zs,

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.855
so that you don't get them confused.

00:14:30.855 --> 00:14:33.263
Because if you do, it really
does change the answer

00:14:33.263 --> 00:14:34.472
that you might get.

00:14:34.472 --> 00:14:36.904
So if I go ahead and
continue with this problem,

00:14:36.904 --> 00:14:39.234
negative five z, minus,

00:14:39.234 --> 00:14:40.667
and then what I'm going to do here is,

00:14:40.667 --> 00:14:41.615
I'm going to FOIL,

00:14:41.615 --> 00:14:45.116
so do some FOIL polynomial multiplication,

00:14:45.116 --> 00:14:48.216
and so that stands for
First, Out, Inner, Last.

00:14:48.216 --> 00:14:51.123
And so this is FOIL, and so
if I multiply the first terms,

00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:54.194
the two times the three
is going to be six.

00:14:54.194 --> 00:14:57.141
The outer terms, the
two times the negative z

00:14:57.141 --> 00:14:59.774
is going to be minus two z.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:03.585
The inner terms are going
to be minus three z,

00:15:03.585 --> 00:15:05.384
so the negative three times z,

00:15:05.384 --> 00:15:07.227
and then I've got the
negative z times negative z,

00:15:07.227 --> 00:15:10.781
so that's going to be
a positive z squared.

00:15:10.781 --> 00:15:13.961
And so, I still have this negative sign,

00:15:13.961 --> 00:15:16.139
but I have done this multiplication,

00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:19.706
and now I'm just going to
combine some like terms,

00:15:19.706 --> 00:15:22.089
still leave that negative sign out there.

00:15:22.089 --> 00:15:24.506
So I've got six minus five z,

00:15:25.657 --> 00:15:26.907
plus z squared.

00:15:28.148 --> 00:15:30.863
And now I can distribute
this negative sign,

00:15:30.863 --> 00:15:34.068
and so if I have this negative five z,

00:15:34.068 --> 00:15:36.817
negative times six is just
going to be minus six,

00:15:36.817 --> 00:15:39.186
and this negative one
times this negative five z,

00:15:39.186 --> 00:15:42.153
is going to be plus five z.

00:15:42.153 --> 00:15:44.944
And then this negative
times this plus z squared

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.742
is going to lead to negative z squared,

00:15:47.742 --> 00:15:48.995
and now again,

00:15:48.995 --> 00:15:52.056
I can continue with this
second step of subtraction,

00:15:52.056 --> 00:15:53.682
and I've got this negative five z,

00:15:53.682 --> 00:15:56.356
and this positive five z,
so these will cancel out,

00:15:56.356 --> 00:15:57.189
leaving me with negative
six minus z squared,

00:15:57.189 --> 00:16:01.356
which is also the same as
negative z squared minus six.

00:16:05.287 --> 00:16:07.202
And so then, I look over here,

00:16:07.202 --> 00:16:10.299
and I've got negative z squared minus six,

00:16:10.299 --> 00:16:11.722
and so my answer choice is C,

00:16:11.722 --> 00:16:13.228
and the last step I do is,

00:16:13.228 --> 00:16:16.733
I will mark down C,
and make it very clear,

00:16:16.733 --> 00:16:18.803
so there's no chance of making a mistake,

00:16:18.803 --> 00:16:21.865
when I carry it over to the bubble sheet.

00:16:21.865 --> 00:16:24.097
So that is an example, one example,

00:16:24.097 --> 00:16:27.563
of how you can apply this
more organized process

00:16:27.563 --> 00:16:31.319
within a question that has a few steps,

00:16:31.319 --> 00:16:33.062
and where order matters.

00:16:33.062 --> 00:16:33.895
Now, that,

00:16:35.819 --> 00:16:38.382
that question, it may have
been straightforward for you,

00:16:38.382 --> 00:16:40.010
it might have been more challenging,

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:41.688
but go ahead and do some practice,

00:16:41.688 --> 00:16:43.276
and what we'll do next,

00:16:43.276 --> 00:16:45.860
is a slightly different problem

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.371
with a little bit more information,

00:16:47.371 --> 00:16:50.478
where using more organized
process is even more helpful.

00:16:50.478 --> 00:16:52.228
So let's take a look.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.492
Okay, so I'm going to zoom
out just a little bit here.

00:16:59.492 --> 00:17:02.791
So let's give this question a read.

00:17:02.791 --> 00:17:06.475
A distributor ships
DVDs to several stores,

00:17:06.475 --> 00:17:08.688
the shipping boxes contain several DVDs,

00:17:08.688 --> 00:17:11.022
and their cases, plus a layer of padding

00:17:11.022 --> 00:17:13.471
at each end of the boxes.

00:17:13.471 --> 00:17:16.062
Okay, the DVD cases and layers of padding

00:17:16.062 --> 00:17:18.639
can be arranged neatly inside each box.

00:17:18.639 --> 00:17:22.347
Each DVD case is 14 millimeters thick,

00:17:22.347 --> 00:17:25.683
and each layer of padding
is 10 millimeters thick.

00:17:25.683 --> 00:17:27.470
And the length of the interior

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.970
of the box is 132 millimeters.

00:17:31.695 --> 00:17:34.695
If d represents the number of DVDs

00:17:34.695 --> 00:17:38.294
that the distributor can fit into one box,

00:17:38.294 --> 00:17:39.926
with two layers of padding,

00:17:39.926 --> 00:17:41.220
which of the following inequalities

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.470
best models this situation?

00:17:44.308 --> 00:17:45.566
So I don't know about you,

00:17:45.566 --> 00:17:47.114
but that was a good bit of information,

00:17:47.114 --> 00:17:49.444
and a lot of sentences.

00:17:49.444 --> 00:17:52.746
And so what's helpful at this point,

00:17:52.746 --> 00:17:55.926
is to break down the
question one part at a time,

00:17:55.926 --> 00:17:58.638
and to pull out the relevant information.

00:17:58.638 --> 00:18:02.805
And so we have DVDs that
are 14 millimeters thick,

00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:08.134
and then we have padding,

00:18:09.518 --> 00:18:11.729
so I'm just going to abbreviate pad,

00:18:11.729 --> 00:18:14.512
is 10 millimeters thick.

00:18:14.512 --> 00:18:17.771
And then we have the length
of the interior of the box,

00:18:17.771 --> 00:18:21.771
so the box is going to
be 132 millimeters thick.

00:18:23.892 --> 00:18:27.642
And then d, is the number
of DVDs in one box,

00:18:32.082 --> 00:18:36.100
and then, one box with
two layers of padding,

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.977
and so that's important.

00:18:37.977 --> 00:18:40.227
With two layers of padding.

00:18:43.684 --> 00:18:46.821
And so now I have all of
the information I need

00:18:46.821 --> 00:18:50.988
from the paragraph, and I
can start to process it.

00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:56.347
And what's even more helpful
here is to draw a diagram,

00:18:56.347 --> 00:18:58.734
so this goes back to figuring out

00:18:58.734 --> 00:19:00.113
what steps you need to take,

00:19:00.113 --> 00:19:01.947
and also doing a lot on paper.

00:19:01.947 --> 00:19:04.362
And so if I start with this,

00:19:04.362 --> 00:19:08.691
I know that this box is
132 millimeters thick,

00:19:08.691 --> 00:19:10.024
and then I've got two layers of padding,

00:19:10.024 --> 00:19:13.332
and we've got padding
at each end of the box,

00:19:13.332 --> 00:19:14.342
as you see here.

00:19:14.342 --> 00:19:16.942
And so I've got this padding here,

00:19:16.942 --> 00:19:18.875
and I've got this padding here,

00:19:18.875 --> 00:19:22.315
and that's going to be 10
millimeters and 10 millimeters,

00:19:22.315 --> 00:19:23.520
so that makes sense.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.140
And then within this,
I've got a number of DVDs

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:29.839
being put inside, and so
these are all, you know, DVDs,

00:19:29.839 --> 00:19:31.672
DVDs, so on, so forth.

00:19:32.851 --> 00:19:36.622
And each of these is 14 millimeters,

00:19:36.622 --> 00:19:39.427
based on what I have here.

00:19:39.427 --> 00:19:41.687
And so now with this
diagram, and these labels,

00:19:41.687 --> 00:19:44.454
I know that my one side of the inequality

00:19:44.454 --> 00:19:46.539
is going to be 132 millimeters,

00:19:46.539 --> 00:19:48.893
since that's the size of the box,

00:19:48.893 --> 00:19:50.732
and it all has to fit within the box.

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:54.649
And then I have these, the
padding that I can work with,

00:19:54.649 --> 00:19:57.812
and so I've got this, and I've got this.

00:19:57.812 --> 00:20:00.319
So that feels like
something I can start with,

00:20:00.319 --> 00:20:03.221
and so that is going to be 20,

00:20:03.221 --> 00:20:07.388
and then within the box, I've
got 14 millimeter thick DVDs,

00:20:08.317 --> 00:20:11.506
since d represents the number of DVDs,

00:20:11.506 --> 00:20:14.349
I can write this as 14 d plus 20.

00:20:14.349 --> 00:20:17.016
So 14 millimeters thick per DVD,

00:20:18.075 --> 00:20:20.700
times the number of DVDs,
plus 20 for the padding,

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.246
should be less than or equal to 132.

00:20:24.246 --> 00:20:28.413
And so then that is going
to be my final answer, B.

00:20:29.263 --> 00:20:30.685
So,

00:20:30.685 --> 00:20:33.989
in this example, you saw that,

00:20:33.989 --> 00:20:36.833
really breaking down the question,

00:20:36.833 --> 00:20:38.967
into each of it's parts,

00:20:38.967 --> 00:20:40.710
pulling that information out,

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.716
figuring out how you want
to solve the problem,

00:20:42.716 --> 00:20:45.620
and then drawing a diagram
and doing it all on paper,

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.046
was a good way to keep yourself organized

00:20:48.046 --> 00:20:49.788
as you solve the problem,

00:20:49.788 --> 00:20:52.882
and ensure that you didn't make
any mistakes along the way.

00:20:52.882 --> 00:20:55.500
Now, that's the last careless
mistake focus problem,

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.852
but the same process
that we walked through,

00:20:58.852 --> 00:21:00.901
I'm also going to apply
in all of the other

00:21:00.901 --> 00:21:03.536
sample problems that
we walk through today.

00:21:03.536 --> 00:21:06.168
Since, like I mentioned,
it's not just for algebra,

00:21:06.168 --> 00:21:07.873
it's not just for word problems,

00:21:07.873 --> 00:21:12.652
it can really help you with,
across the SAT math test.

00:21:12.652 --> 00:21:14.118
And so next up,

00:21:14.118 --> 00:21:15.867
we're going to look at
some function notation,

00:21:15.867 --> 00:21:17.038
I'm going to do a quick overview,

00:21:17.038 --> 00:21:19.216
and then do some practice
problems together.

00:21:19.216 --> 00:21:21.216
Okay, let's take a look.

00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:26.689
So first in this function notation recap,

00:21:26.689 --> 00:21:30.022
I want to talk about what is a function.

00:21:31.079 --> 00:21:33.180
So function notation,

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.565
well a function, and I'll
do some abbreviation,

00:21:36.565 --> 00:21:40.398
takes in an input, does
some number crunching,

00:21:41.327 --> 00:21:43.577
and then creates an output.

00:21:45.222 --> 00:21:47.368
And so, you might have seen this written

00:21:47.368 --> 00:21:50.252
in your algebra class as f of x,

00:21:50.252 --> 00:21:52.252
or as g of x, or h of x,

00:21:54.394 --> 00:21:57.650
and in this case, x is
going to be your input,

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.073
and then all of the letters,

00:21:59.073 --> 00:21:59.990
f, g and h,

00:22:02.628 --> 00:22:05.396
are just different ways
of denoting a function.

00:22:05.396 --> 00:22:07.686
And so an example of a
function might be f of x,

00:22:07.686 --> 00:22:09.436
equals x plus two.

00:22:10.276 --> 00:22:14.084
And a few common ways you
might see this on the SAT

00:22:14.084 --> 00:22:16.319
is within a table format,

00:22:16.319 --> 00:22:18.829
so you might see something like this.

00:22:18.829 --> 00:22:21.802
And so for given values of x,

00:22:21.802 --> 00:22:25.552
f of x is going to be two, three and four,

00:22:27.154 --> 00:22:30.800
and similarly you can
represent this graphically.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.300
So x, for certain values of x,

00:22:34.493 --> 00:22:37.802
on the x axis, and then
f of x on the y axis,

00:22:37.802 --> 00:22:40.302
if you have zero, one and two,

00:22:41.722 --> 00:22:44.850
you have again, along the y axis,

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.490
one, two, three, four,

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.598
the same thing, the same
function can be represented

00:22:50.598 --> 00:22:54.341
as this line, and so for
corresponding values of x,

00:22:54.341 --> 00:22:56.508
you have values of f of x.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.074
Now the last thing I want
to give a quick overview of,

00:23:00.074 --> 00:23:01.880
is compositions of functions.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.547
So f of g of x, is
another common expression

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.416
that you'll see on the SAT math section,

00:23:09.416 --> 00:23:13.138
and this might also be written like this,

00:23:13.138 --> 00:23:14.948
it all means the same thing though.

00:23:14.948 --> 00:23:16.822
And what you want to remember here is,

00:23:16.822 --> 00:23:18.422
that you want to solve this first,

00:23:18.422 --> 00:23:21.391
by solving the inside,
so this, in this case,

00:23:21.391 --> 00:23:23.403
it would be g of x,

00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:26.532
and then solving for
the outside components,

00:23:26.532 --> 00:23:28.782
which would be f of g of x.

00:23:32.131 --> 00:23:37.067
And so this is a quick
overview of function notation,

00:23:37.067 --> 00:23:41.244
that should get you started with SAT math.

00:23:41.244 --> 00:23:42.570
And so what we're going to do next is,

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:43.859
see what this looks like,

00:23:43.859 --> 00:23:46.959
in the context of real SAT math questions.

00:23:46.959 --> 00:23:49.135
And what's coming up are four problems,

00:23:49.135 --> 00:23:51.306
and so they're two pairs each,

00:23:51.306 --> 00:23:54.738
so the first pair, the
first problem in each pair,

00:23:54.738 --> 00:23:58.209
I'm going to walk through
and work through together,

00:23:58.209 --> 00:23:59.835
but if you feel comfortable,

00:23:59.835 --> 00:24:02.758
then in the second question of that pair,

00:24:02.758 --> 00:24:04.803
go ahead and, you know, mute me,

00:24:04.803 --> 00:24:08.106
and go do the problem more independently,

00:24:08.106 --> 00:24:09.280
if you're comfortable.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.451
And then check back in
to see how I did it,

00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:13.988
and so, you know, only
if you're comfortable,

00:24:13.988 --> 00:24:16.697
otherwise you can watch me
work through it as well.

00:24:16.697 --> 00:24:18.654
But like I mentioned, four problems total,

00:24:18.654 --> 00:24:22.071
two pairs each, and so let's take a look.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.439
Okay, so I'll zoom in a little bit more,

00:24:27.439 --> 00:24:30.030
make sure everyone can see.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.687
And so, the graphs of
the functions f and g

00:24:33.687 --> 00:24:37.207
are shown to the left, what is
the value of f of g of zero,

00:24:37.207 --> 00:24:40.514
rounded to the nearest whole number?

00:24:40.514 --> 00:24:44.112
And so, I know that, and I
want to look at this graph,

00:24:44.112 --> 00:24:46.924
and so I've got f, and I've got g,

00:24:46.924 --> 00:24:48.223
and all of their corresponding values.

00:24:48.223 --> 00:24:50.940
And so the steps I want
to take to solve this,

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:55.107
are to solve for the inside,
and then the outside.

00:24:56.903 --> 00:24:59.621
And so I want to solve
for g of zero first,

00:24:59.621 --> 00:25:03.288
and then I want to solve
for f of g of zero.

00:25:04.944 --> 00:25:07.239
And like I said, this
is kind of my roadmap,

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:08.741
and so I've written out the steps,

00:25:08.741 --> 00:25:12.095
and then it just comes down
to following the steps,

00:25:12.095 --> 00:25:15.398
so it's easier for me to follow along.

00:25:15.398 --> 00:25:16.697
So if I look at g of zero,

00:25:16.697 --> 00:25:19.804
what is the value of g, when x is zero.

00:25:19.804 --> 00:25:22.510
Well, it looks like I'm just right here,

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.432
and so that y value is zero,

00:25:24.432 --> 00:25:26.815
and so what I can do is,
substitute in that zero.

00:25:26.815 --> 00:25:29.154
So then this, in the place of g of zero,

00:25:29.154 --> 00:25:31.372
and so this becomes f of zero.

00:25:31.372 --> 00:25:35.122
So when x is zero, what is the value of f?

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.608
It's just going to be right there,

00:25:38.608 --> 00:25:39.441
at five.

00:25:41.824 --> 00:25:43.086
So you've seen now,

00:25:43.086 --> 00:25:45.638
one example of function notation

00:25:45.638 --> 00:25:47.728
and questions in a graphical form.

00:25:47.728 --> 00:25:50.869
And then next question
will be similar to this,

00:25:50.869 --> 00:25:52.748
and so if you feel like you
have a good understanding,

00:25:52.748 --> 00:25:55.561
go ahead and read the question,
read ahead, work ahead,

00:25:55.561 --> 00:25:58.568
and feel free to mute me if you want.

00:25:58.568 --> 00:26:00.212
So you can work independently,

00:26:00.212 --> 00:26:02.267
and then come back here
to the live stream,

00:26:02.267 --> 00:26:06.208
after just a minute, and you'll
see how I worked through it.

00:26:06.208 --> 00:26:07.855
So let's look at the next one,

00:26:07.855 --> 00:26:12.022
and if you feel comfortable,
go ahead and work ahead.

00:26:13.884 --> 00:26:14.717
Okay,

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.152
so consider the graphs of the function f,

00:26:18.152 --> 00:26:20.582
and the function g shown above.

00:26:20.582 --> 00:26:22.932
Which of the following
bet approximates the value

00:26:22.932 --> 00:26:24.515
of g of f of three?

00:26:26.485 --> 00:26:31.364
Okay, so g of f of three, I've
got another composition here,

00:26:31.364 --> 00:26:33.614
now how might I solve this?

00:26:35.847 --> 00:26:39.233
So similar to the last question,

00:26:39.233 --> 00:26:43.400
and I want to solve the inner
part, and then the outer part.

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:49.157
And so I've got f over
here, I've got g over here,

00:26:50.338 --> 00:26:54.505
and so I want to solve for
this is g of f of three.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:58.412
It just makes it easy,

00:26:58.412 --> 00:27:00.213
I'm more used to seeing
it written like that,

00:27:00.213 --> 00:27:01.797
so in the function notation question,

00:27:01.797 --> 00:27:05.607
if you prefer this way,
or if you prefer this way,

00:27:05.607 --> 00:27:07.708
feel free to write it however

00:27:07.708 --> 00:27:09.882
is easier for you to interpret.

00:27:09.882 --> 00:27:14.049
So I've got f of three, and
I've got g of f of three,

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.985
and so f of three,

00:27:16.985 --> 00:27:21.141
so when x is three,
what is the value of f?

00:27:21.141 --> 00:27:23.121
Well, it looks like I'm right here,

00:27:23.121 --> 00:27:26.153
and so I'm going over to six.

00:27:26.153 --> 00:27:28.470
And so then I can substitute in this six

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.335
in the place of f of three,

00:27:30.335 --> 00:27:32.700
and this becomes g of six.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:37.113
So when x is six, and
now looking at g here,

00:27:37.113 --> 00:27:40.304
when x is six, what is the value of f?

00:27:40.304 --> 00:27:43.745
Well if I trace, the value of g, rather,

00:27:43.745 --> 00:27:47.544
if I trace this up, I head over here,

00:27:47.544 --> 00:27:50.461
and that value is going to be five.

00:27:51.651 --> 00:27:53.564
And so again, as a final step,

00:27:53.564 --> 00:27:54.767
I mark down the right answer,

00:27:54.767 --> 00:27:58.170
so that I don't mis-bubble anything,

00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.753
to my answer sheet.

00:28:00.871 --> 00:28:03.886
So you've now seen two graphical examples

00:28:03.886 --> 00:28:06.428
of function notation questions on the SAT,

00:28:06.428 --> 00:28:08.044
and hopefully, you know,

00:28:08.044 --> 00:28:09.326
if you were working independently on that,

00:28:09.326 --> 00:28:11.156
you were able to follow along,

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:12.989
and get to the right answer.

00:28:12.989 --> 00:28:15.104
But if you want more practice
with that kind of question,

00:28:15.104 --> 00:28:16.712
you can also head to Khan Academy

00:28:16.712 --> 00:28:20.177
to do that function notation practice.

00:28:20.177 --> 00:28:21.913
Now we're going to shift
gears a little bit,

00:28:21.913 --> 00:28:23.824
and the next two problems will be in more

00:28:23.824 --> 00:28:25.958
of an algebraic context.

00:28:25.958 --> 00:28:27.414
And again, these two will be,

00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:28.863
I'll work through the first one,

00:28:28.863 --> 00:28:31.140
and then, for the second
one, if you feel comfortable,

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.910
go ahead and work ahead of me,

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:35.544
and see if you get to the
same answer that I do.

00:28:35.544 --> 00:28:37.044
Let's take a look.

00:28:40.129 --> 00:28:41.817
Ah yes, and ignore the
big blue highlighting,

00:28:41.817 --> 00:28:46.588
I wanted to block out some
of the markings there.

00:28:46.588 --> 00:28:48.565
So let's give this question a read,

00:28:48.565 --> 00:28:52.035
let g of x equal ax minus five.

00:28:52.035 --> 00:28:56.296
Which of the following is
equivalent to g of g of x.

00:28:56.296 --> 00:28:57.629
So in this case,

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:01.726
it looks like there's going
to be some substitution.

00:29:01.726 --> 00:29:03.809
So substitution going on,

00:29:05.687 --> 00:29:07.958
and I'm working now with variables,

00:29:07.958 --> 00:29:09.458
instead of graphs,

00:29:11.102 --> 00:29:14.982
but I can follow some
of the same processes.

00:29:14.982 --> 00:29:18.482
And so this g of g of x, can be simplified

00:29:20.122 --> 00:29:22.872
to be g of eight x minus five,

00:29:23.886 --> 00:29:26.742
so in place of that g of x,

00:29:26.742 --> 00:29:27.898
everywhere I see g of x,

00:29:27.898 --> 00:29:29.590
I'm just substituting
this eight x minus five,

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.242
and so when I have g
of eight x minus five,

00:29:32.242 --> 00:29:34.575
I can further simplify this,

00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.982
like this.

00:29:37.818 --> 00:29:40.901
So eight times eight x minus five,

00:29:42.193 --> 00:29:45.989
minus five, so you'll see that, you know,

00:29:45.989 --> 00:29:49.470
this can be rewritten
as eight x minus five,

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:50.887
which was g of x.

00:29:52.273 --> 00:29:53.961
Just in place of this x,

00:29:53.961 --> 00:29:57.622
I've substituted this eight x minus five.

00:29:57.622 --> 00:29:59.847
And so now if I solve this,

00:29:59.847 --> 00:30:02.764
I get 64 x minus 40, minus five,

00:30:05.747 --> 00:30:08.497
and so I've got 64 x minus 45.

00:30:10.764 --> 00:30:12.749
And then here I am here,

00:30:12.749 --> 00:30:16.899
and that is going to be, answer choice B.

00:30:16.899 --> 00:30:18.178
And so in this case,

00:30:18.178 --> 00:30:20.409
it was just a series of substitutions,

00:30:20.409 --> 00:30:24.413
where I again, am working
from inside to out,

00:30:24.413 --> 00:30:26.622
and then solving on paper to avoid making

00:30:26.622 --> 00:30:28.852
any careless mistakes.

00:30:28.852 --> 00:30:31.250
So we're going to do one more
function notation question,

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.536
and if you feel pretty
comfortable with it,

00:30:33.536 --> 00:30:36.036
go ahead and work ahead of me.

00:30:37.756 --> 00:30:39.529
But if you want to just follow along,

00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:41.397
that is completely fine as well,

00:30:41.397 --> 00:30:42.592
and then after the function notation,

00:30:42.592 --> 00:30:46.259
we're going to move on
to tables and charts.

00:30:50.416 --> 00:30:52.525
So let's take a look here,

00:30:52.525 --> 00:30:56.192
so let f of x equal x over one over x,

00:30:57.125 --> 00:31:00.111
and let g of x equal one over x.

00:31:00.111 --> 00:31:02.131
Assuming x does not equal zero,

00:31:02.131 --> 00:31:06.298
which of the following is
equivalent to f of g of x?

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.850
So f of g of x,

00:31:11.302 --> 00:31:15.469
so based on the last
question, and how that worked,

00:31:16.556 --> 00:31:18.124
it's probably a safe assumption

00:31:18.124 --> 00:31:23.109
that there will be some
more substitution happening.

00:31:23.109 --> 00:31:25.109
And so, if I solve this,

00:31:26.653 --> 00:31:29.023
in place of this g of x, is the first,

00:31:29.023 --> 00:31:30.922
this is kind of solving from the inside.

00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:33.066
I can substitute in g of x,

00:31:33.066 --> 00:31:36.382
and so this becomes f of one over x,

00:31:36.382 --> 00:31:39.382
since this is what g of x equals.

00:31:40.354 --> 00:31:42.521
And so if f of one over x,

00:31:43.857 --> 00:31:46.085
that means everywhere is see an x,

00:31:46.085 --> 00:31:48.160
I want to substitute one over x,

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.226
and so, the algebra, there
are a few more variables

00:31:51.226 --> 00:31:53.799
happening here, but the
same principle applies,

00:31:53.799 --> 00:31:56.153
and so don't worry too much about that.

00:31:56.153 --> 00:32:00.320
And so f of x equals, is
up here, x over one over x,

00:32:01.448 --> 00:32:02.646
and so what that means is,

00:32:02.646 --> 00:32:06.230
I would substitute in place of this x,

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:08.503
I'm substituting one over x,

00:32:08.503 --> 00:32:12.889
minus one over, again,
I have another x here,

00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:16.442
and I'm going to substitute
another one over x.

00:32:16.442 --> 00:32:20.109
Now here again, Order
of Operations matters,

00:32:21.972 --> 00:32:23.139
of operations.

00:32:24.127 --> 00:32:26.703
And so, I've got one over x,

00:32:26.703 --> 00:32:29.145
and I'm going to do this division first,

00:32:29.145 --> 00:32:30.796
before I do the subtraction.

00:32:30.796 --> 00:32:33.574
And when you're dividing by a fraction,

00:32:33.574 --> 00:32:34.811
it's really,

00:32:34.811 --> 00:32:39.738
you should be multiplying
by the reciprocal of that.

00:32:39.738 --> 00:32:43.753
And so what I've got here is one over x,

00:32:43.753 --> 00:32:46.281
minus, and in this case, one times x is x,

00:32:46.281 --> 00:32:48.114
x divided by one is x.

00:32:49.721 --> 00:32:51.388
One over x, minus x.

00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:56.632
And that is going to be
your final answer there,

00:32:56.632 --> 00:32:58.490
answer choice D.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:59.516
So the algebra here,

00:32:59.516 --> 00:33:02.661
there are a few more variables
that you had to work with,

00:33:02.661 --> 00:33:05.852
but the same principle applied.

00:33:05.852 --> 00:33:08.951
And so if you have a good understanding

00:33:08.951 --> 00:33:13.083
of function notation,
and some of the basics,

00:33:13.083 --> 00:33:15.081
you can really scale it, no matter,

00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:18.272
regardless of what equation or what format

00:33:18.272 --> 00:33:20.772
the SAT shows the question as.

00:33:22.906 --> 00:33:25.685
So that's it for function
notation questions now,

00:33:25.685 --> 00:33:28.247
and we're going to change
now to our final topic

00:33:28.247 --> 00:33:31.019
of graphs and charts and tables.

00:33:31.019 --> 00:33:33.016
And like I mentioned
at the start of class,

00:33:33.016 --> 00:33:35.280
this will not only be
relevant for SAT math,

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.179
but the strategies and the approach

00:33:37.179 --> 00:33:38.954
that I'm going to walk through,

00:33:38.954 --> 00:33:40.568
and walk through,

00:33:40.568 --> 00:33:43.789
will also apply to SAT
reading and writing passages,

00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:47.196
that often have tables and
charts at the end as well.

00:33:47.196 --> 00:33:49.903
So let's take a look at
how one way to approach

00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:52.653
chart, graph and table questions.

00:33:55.159 --> 00:33:58.848
Oh, let me zoom out a little bit there.

00:33:58.848 --> 00:34:00.533
So how should you approach

00:34:00.533 --> 00:34:03.410
graph and table problems on the SAT math?

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.024
Well, it boils down to one sentence,

00:34:06.024 --> 00:34:07.141
and this is one approach

00:34:07.141 --> 00:34:09.816
that I found to be really helpful
for me and other students,

00:34:09.816 --> 00:34:12.842
and that is to read the
problem and understand

00:34:12.842 --> 00:34:17.665
the graph or table before you
look at the answer choices.

00:34:17.665 --> 00:34:19.566
And I want to emphasize that you want to

00:34:19.566 --> 00:34:22.713
leave those answer
choices for the very end,

00:34:22.713 --> 00:34:24.889
after you already have good understanding

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:26.504
of the graph and table.

00:34:26.504 --> 00:34:27.782
And the reason you do that,

00:34:27.782 --> 00:34:29.267
is that these answer choices

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:30.876
can include lots of information,

00:34:30.876 --> 00:34:33.126
that might be overwhelming.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:37.501
That might be overwhelming,
or a lot to process,

00:34:37.501 --> 00:34:39.501
it might be distracting,

00:34:40.655 --> 00:34:44.144
and it might also lead
you down a wrong path.

00:34:44.144 --> 00:34:47.144
So it can sometimes be a rabbit hole

00:34:48.043 --> 00:34:51.266
that can sway your interpretation

00:34:51.266 --> 00:34:53.251
of the data in front of you.

00:34:53.251 --> 00:34:55.568
And so the process I
encourage you to follow,

00:34:55.568 --> 00:34:59.637
is to read and understand the
context from the question.

00:34:59.637 --> 00:35:01.479
So that will give you good,

00:35:01.479 --> 00:35:04.384
kind of background information.

00:35:04.384 --> 00:35:07.828
And then, interpret the axes in a graph,

00:35:07.828 --> 00:35:10.512
for the row and column labels in a table.

00:35:10.512 --> 00:35:15.188
And so with those axes, you
get units with the labels,

00:35:15.188 --> 00:35:19.355
you get a lot of information
about what the data means,

00:35:20.505 --> 00:35:23.169
to help you interpret.

00:35:23.169 --> 00:35:25.234
Finally, or third, rather,

00:35:25.234 --> 00:35:27.497
I encourage you to explain what you see

00:35:27.497 --> 00:35:30.636
in your own words, and this
a check for understanding,

00:35:30.636 --> 00:35:32.636
check for understanding.

00:35:33.783 --> 00:35:38.722
And so if you're able to
explain this to yourself,

00:35:38.722 --> 00:35:40.801
or pretend that you're
explaining it to a friend,

00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:44.968
it's a good check and test
that you understand it enough

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.944
that you could explain it to someone else.

00:35:47.944 --> 00:35:50.307
And it ensures that you won't be swayed

00:35:50.307 --> 00:35:54.362
in the wrong direction by
any of the answer choices.

00:35:54.362 --> 00:35:56.346
Then, finally,

00:35:56.346 --> 00:35:57.719
you want to reread the question,

00:35:57.719 --> 00:36:01.228
and then, and only then,
look at the answer choices.

00:36:01.228 --> 00:36:04.408
So to recap, read the problem,

00:36:04.408 --> 00:36:06.108
and understand the graph and the table,

00:36:06.108 --> 00:36:08.673
and then look at the answer choices,

00:36:08.673 --> 00:36:11.134
so that you're not swayed or overwhelmed

00:36:11.134 --> 00:36:12.984
by all of the information.

00:36:12.984 --> 00:36:15.623
So this might be counterintuitive,

00:36:15.623 --> 00:36:19.503
or might not be exactly how you would have

00:36:19.503 --> 00:36:22.221
thought about trying
these problems before.

00:36:22.221 --> 00:36:23.624
But we're going to give it a try

00:36:23.624 --> 00:36:25.100
over the course of some real,

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.966
three SAT practice problems,

00:36:26.966 --> 00:36:28.695
where you get to see it in practice.

00:36:28.695 --> 00:36:30.012
So I encourage you to give it a go,

00:36:30.012 --> 00:36:33.000
if this feels good and
comfortable for you,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.118
consider practicing it more,

00:36:35.118 --> 00:36:36.902
so that it becomes a habit,

00:36:36.902 --> 00:36:39.210
and you're faster on the real SAT.

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:42.043
So let's take a look at a problem.

00:36:44.418 --> 00:36:45.536
Okay, I'm going to zoom in,

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:48.012
make sure you can read this.

00:36:48.012 --> 00:36:51.900
And so the graph at left in the sm plane

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.500
approximates the average mileage, m,

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.278
in miles per gallon that
Denise's pickup truck

00:36:57.278 --> 00:37:00.702
gets when she drives at a
speed of s miles per hour.

00:37:00.702 --> 00:37:02.813
What is the best
interpretation of the maximum

00:37:02.813 --> 00:37:04.396
point on the graph?

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:06.453
So,

00:37:08.018 --> 00:37:09.396
that makes sense,

00:37:09.396 --> 00:37:12.090
and now I want to shift over to the table,

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:14.911
and ignore this, so don't, don't,

00:37:14.911 --> 00:37:16.897
pay attention to over here.

00:37:16.897 --> 00:37:18.684
And so if I look at the table,

00:37:18.684 --> 00:37:20.622
I've got average pickup mileage,

00:37:20.622 --> 00:37:22.275
and so the title is helpful,

00:37:22.275 --> 00:37:24.472
I've got mileage there, on my y axis,

00:37:24.472 --> 00:37:27.055
I've got mileage and miles per gallon.

00:37:27.055 --> 00:37:31.174
On the x axis I've got
speed in miles per hour,

00:37:31.174 --> 00:37:35.469
okay, so I've got mileage
as it varies by speed.

00:37:35.469 --> 00:37:37.802
And so that was that step of

00:37:38.735 --> 00:37:42.902
explaining it in your own
words, as it varies by speed.

00:37:45.041 --> 00:37:46.899
And if I interpret the graph then,

00:37:46.899 --> 00:37:49.232
it looks like as I am going,

00:37:51.609 --> 00:37:54.671
as Denise is going, as she
goes faster, and faster,

00:37:54.671 --> 00:37:57.988
up until this maximum point here,

00:37:57.988 --> 00:38:01.687
her mileage is increasing up to a max

00:38:01.687 --> 00:38:04.360
of 18 miles per gallon,
and then it drops off.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.110
So, that makes sense,

00:38:07.573 --> 00:38:09.674
and that's kind of my
interpretation of the max point.

00:38:09.674 --> 00:38:12.671
And so let's which one of these
answer choices matches that.

00:38:12.671 --> 00:38:14.935
So Denise's truck gets a maximum mileage

00:38:14.935 --> 00:38:16.795
of 18 miles per gallon,

00:38:16.795 --> 00:38:18.214
and so I'll erase these xs,

00:38:18.214 --> 00:38:20.947
since they're no longer relevant.

00:38:20.947 --> 00:38:24.651
So yeah, that matches what my
interpretation of the graph,

00:38:24.651 --> 00:38:28.537
and so, yep, her maximum
mileage per gallon,

00:38:28.537 --> 00:38:30.752
is this, is that 18, so that works.

00:38:30.752 --> 00:38:33.144
Let's take a look at these
other answer choices,

00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:35.407
and see what we find.

00:38:35.407 --> 00:38:37.506
So Denise's truck gets a maximum mileage

00:38:37.506 --> 00:38:40.025
of 55 miles per gallon.

00:38:40.025 --> 00:38:41.879
Well, we just said that
the maximum mileage

00:38:41.879 --> 00:38:44.962
is here at 18, and so that 55 is out.

00:38:47.351 --> 00:38:48.609
Denise's truck can drive

00:38:48.609 --> 00:38:51.335
at a maximum speed of 18 miles per hour.

00:38:51.335 --> 00:38:54.203
Well no, we know that
this x axis is speed,

00:38:54.203 --> 00:38:56.360
and we've got 70, and you know,

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.371
she's still booking it, so, that's out.

00:38:59.371 --> 00:39:01.586
And then D, Denise's truck can drive

00:39:01.586 --> 00:39:05.002
at a maximum speed of 55 miles per hour.

00:39:05.002 --> 00:39:07.323
So that it is also not the case,

00:39:07.323 --> 00:39:09.963
since again, we have
this 70 miles per hour,

00:39:09.963 --> 00:39:12.235
and so we can go ahead and cross that off.

00:39:12.235 --> 00:39:14.809
And so our final answer is going to be A.

00:39:14.809 --> 00:39:17.250
And we are good to go.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.236
So that question, you saw what it,

00:39:19.236 --> 00:39:21.014
what this process looks like,

00:39:21.014 --> 00:39:22.938
where you read the
question, understand it,

00:39:22.938 --> 00:39:24.977
and then understand the graph,

00:39:24.977 --> 00:39:27.581
before you look at the answer choices,

00:39:27.581 --> 00:39:29.765
and are influenced by them.

00:39:29.765 --> 00:39:31.919
And so we're going to
look at a slightly more

00:39:31.919 --> 00:39:35.002
complex example in the next question.

00:39:35.981 --> 00:39:37.723
And again, if you feel comfortable,

00:39:37.723 --> 00:39:38.879
go ahead and work ahead, mute me,

00:39:38.879 --> 00:39:40.986
and then compare you answer.

00:39:40.986 --> 00:39:43.338
But if you want to follow
along, that works as well,

00:39:43.338 --> 00:39:47.338
so let's take a look at
another example of this.

00:39:50.802 --> 00:39:52.843
Okay, so let's take a look,

00:39:52.843 --> 00:39:55.946
the graph at left in the th plane,

00:39:55.946 --> 00:39:59.529
shows the function used
to model height, h,

00:40:00.616 --> 00:40:02.912
in feet, of the top of a pool toy,

00:40:02.912 --> 00:40:05.522
above the surface of the water,

00:40:05.522 --> 00:40:09.966
t seconds after the toy has
been thrown towards the surface.

00:40:09.966 --> 00:40:14.156
How many seconds after
the toy had been thrown,

00:40:14.156 --> 00:40:16.104
did the pool toy resurface?

00:40:16.104 --> 00:40:18.226
So how many seconds?

00:40:18.226 --> 00:40:20.893
Okay, so in this example,

00:40:20.893 --> 00:40:23.369
we can reread that question,

00:40:23.369 --> 00:40:24.951
just to better understand.

00:40:24.951 --> 00:40:28.397
And then hop over here, if
we still don't understand it,

00:40:28.397 --> 00:40:30.874
to see if the graph helps to clarify.

00:40:30.874 --> 00:40:35.015
So we've got the th plane,
used to model height in feet,

00:40:35.015 --> 00:40:38.312
above the surface of the water,

00:40:38.312 --> 00:40:40.358
t seconds after the toy has been thrown.

00:40:40.358 --> 00:40:41.678
And the question is,

00:40:41.678 --> 00:40:43.420
how many seconds after
the toy had been thrown,

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.642
did the pool toy resurface.

00:40:45.642 --> 00:40:48.515
So if I look next, if
this is step number one,

00:40:48.515 --> 00:40:50.746
step number two is to
understand the graph,

00:40:50.746 --> 00:40:54.030
so toy height above the
water after t seconds.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:57.550
And so on my axes, to understand these,

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:00.269
it says height above the
surface of the water in feet,

00:41:00.269 --> 00:41:02.573
so I've got height over here,

00:41:02.573 --> 00:41:06.139
and then seconds here, and this is time.

00:41:06.139 --> 00:41:10.056
And so I'm throwing an
object, so I'm throwing,

00:41:12.533 --> 00:41:13.617
and then based on this,

00:41:13.617 --> 00:41:17.784
since this is height above
the surface of the water, toy,

00:41:19.377 --> 00:41:21.415
so this is above water,

00:41:21.415 --> 00:41:22.415
above water,

00:41:24.767 --> 00:41:27.787
since this is the height
above, and it's positive.

00:41:27.787 --> 00:41:30.344
And then this is submerged, right,

00:41:30.344 --> 00:41:31.177
since,

00:41:33.054 --> 00:41:37.091
since I've got these negative
feet markers here on the left.

00:41:37.091 --> 00:41:39.008
And then if I,

00:41:39.008 --> 00:41:42.478
it feels like I have a good
understanding now of the graph,

00:41:42.478 --> 00:41:46.209
I know where the toy is
above water, and below water,

00:41:46.209 --> 00:41:47.780
so now I can look back at the question.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.937
And so how many seconds after
the toy had been thrown,

00:41:49.937 --> 00:41:52.187
did the pool toy resurface?

00:41:53.814 --> 00:41:56.450
And so resurfacing, it
looks like it's going to be,

00:41:56.450 --> 00:42:00.617
where, do you have an idea of
where on graph that might be.

00:42:03.533 --> 00:42:08.037
So, hopefully you've thrown
in some answers there.

00:42:08.037 --> 00:42:10.159
Well, it seems like it's going to be

00:42:10.159 --> 00:42:12.975
where it's above this x axis, right,

00:42:12.975 --> 00:42:15.754
so that is where, that's almost like,

00:42:15.754 --> 00:42:17.045
if I shade this blue,

00:42:17.045 --> 00:42:18.538
it almost makes it look
like the top of the pool.

00:42:18.538 --> 00:42:21.351
And so where it's popping back up,

00:42:21.351 --> 00:42:22.594
is going to be right here,

00:42:22.594 --> 00:42:24.420
since this is where the
toy is being thrown,

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.003
this is underwater.

00:42:28.491 --> 00:42:30.069
And then where it pops back up,

00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:32.223
is where it is now positive,

00:42:32.223 --> 00:42:33.717
and has some positive height,

00:42:33.717 --> 00:42:35.826
and that looks like it's at 1.1 seconds,

00:42:35.826 --> 00:42:38.121
since it's right between
the one and the 1.2.

00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:42.288
And so then my final answer
there is going to be, C.

00:42:44.343 --> 00:42:47.477
So in this question, you
saw a little bit more

00:42:47.477 --> 00:42:49.060
complex of a graph,

00:42:50.715 --> 00:42:54.684
and you know, the SAT
might have simpler graphs,

00:42:54.684 --> 00:42:57.283
it might have even more complex graphs,

00:42:57.283 --> 00:43:00.182
but if you really break down
the graph, piece by piece,

00:43:00.182 --> 00:43:02.686
axes by title, and all of that.

00:43:02.686 --> 00:43:05.117
It will help you understand it,

00:43:05.117 --> 00:43:08.009
and making sure you aren't intimidated,

00:43:08.009 --> 00:43:09.984
or kind of worried and
overwhelmed and thinking,

00:43:09.984 --> 00:43:12.171
oh man, where, I have
no idea what this means.

00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:13.745
If you break it down into it's parts,

00:43:13.745 --> 00:43:14.991
you can build it back up,

00:43:14.991 --> 00:43:17.026
and really strengthen that understanding.

00:43:17.026 --> 00:43:19.249
So the final question
I'm going to do today,

00:43:19.249 --> 00:43:21.249
is a question on tables,

00:43:22.898 --> 00:43:26.162
and so tables are a bit like graphs,

00:43:26.162 --> 00:43:29.111
and so a lot of the principles will apply,

00:43:29.111 --> 00:43:31.050
but you'll see where
there are some differences

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:33.525
in this practice question.

00:43:33.525 --> 00:43:35.920
And again, here, if you feel comfortable,

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.665
go ahead and work ahead,

00:43:37.665 --> 00:43:41.832
if you want to follow
along, go ahead and do that.

00:43:43.337 --> 00:43:47.157
Okay, so I'm just going
to zoom in here for now,

00:43:47.157 --> 00:43:49.894
and I'm going to start over here first,

00:43:49.894 --> 00:43:51.429
the table second,

00:43:51.429 --> 00:43:54.702
and then these answer choices third.

00:43:54.702 --> 00:43:57.066
So, an online store's marketing director

00:43:57.066 --> 00:43:59.463
uses a web based computer program

00:43:59.463 --> 00:44:01.737
to tabulate customer
responses to a survey,

00:44:01.737 --> 00:44:05.011
which asks customers
whether their priority

00:44:05.011 --> 00:44:08.476
when buying sneakers was comfort,

00:44:08.476 --> 00:44:12.225
okay that seems important,
comfort, look or price.

00:44:12.225 --> 00:44:15.453
The results are summarized
in the table at left.

00:44:15.453 --> 00:44:17.810
Which of the following
claims are supported

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:20.798
by the findings in the table?

00:44:20.798 --> 00:44:24.131
Okay, so I've got a survey, about shoes,

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.428
and the priorities, so that makes sense,

00:44:27.428 --> 00:44:30.660
and now I'm going to hop
over here to number two,

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.927
and I've got this sneaker survey.

00:44:32.927 --> 00:44:36.311
And I'm going to look now at the rows,

00:44:36.311 --> 00:44:40.144
and the column headers
to first ground myself.

00:44:41.229 --> 00:44:43.618
And so in the rows,
I've got gender and age,

00:44:43.618 --> 00:44:45.535
so male, ages 13 to 34,

00:44:47.144 --> 00:44:48.959
male 35 and over,

00:44:48.959 --> 00:44:51.257
and so this is exactly like it mentioned,

00:44:51.257 --> 00:44:52.702
gender and age.

00:44:52.702 --> 00:44:56.840
So this is some demographic information,

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.218
and then at the top,

00:44:58.218 --> 00:45:01.613
these are the priorities
that are mentioned over here,

00:45:01.613 --> 00:45:04.661
when buying sneakers, so
comfort, look or price.

00:45:04.661 --> 00:45:07.692
And then I've got my
totals, and my totals,

00:45:07.692 --> 00:45:11.037
so then this table, if I state
my understanding of this,

00:45:11.037 --> 00:45:14.704
is, you know, these are
customer priorities.

00:45:18.067 --> 00:45:20.484
Priorities by gender and age,

00:45:22.639 --> 00:45:24.794
since those are the segments in the rows,

00:45:24.794 --> 00:45:26.294
by gender and age.

00:45:27.859 --> 00:45:29.140
So now with that understanding,

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.777
I can finally go over to number three,

00:45:31.777 --> 00:45:33.527
the third step there,

00:45:34.537 --> 00:45:36.569
and look at each of these statements.

00:45:36.569 --> 00:45:39.811
So number one, males 35
and older are more likely

00:45:39.811 --> 00:45:42.241
to purchase sneakers based on price,

00:45:42.241 --> 00:45:44.568
than how the sneaker looks.

00:45:44.568 --> 00:45:48.010
And so I want to look
at males 35 and over,

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:50.371
so males 35 and older are over here,

00:45:50.371 --> 00:45:54.968
and it says they're more
likely to purchase on price.

00:45:54.968 --> 00:45:56.872
Is price more important than look?

00:45:56.872 --> 00:45:58.482
So is p greater than l?

00:45:58.482 --> 00:46:00.502
And so I've got price, and looks,

00:46:00.502 --> 00:46:04.486
and it does indeed, look
like price is more important

00:46:04.486 --> 00:46:07.790
to males 35 and over, than looks.

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:11.479
And so statement number
one is going to be true.

00:46:11.479 --> 00:46:13.335
Now I'll zoom out a little bit here,

00:46:13.335 --> 00:46:17.188
in case you were here, working ahead.

00:46:17.188 --> 00:46:18.801
Statement number two,

00:46:18.801 --> 00:46:21.533
males between 13 and 34,

00:46:21.533 --> 00:46:24.111
had the highest frequency of responding.

00:46:24.111 --> 00:46:26.597
And actually, I'm going
to change colors here,

00:46:26.597 --> 00:46:27.963
just to help color code.

00:46:27.963 --> 00:46:30.334
So males 13 to 34 had
the highest frequency

00:46:30.334 --> 00:46:33.181
of responding to the web based survey.

00:46:33.181 --> 00:46:35.124
So now, I'm looking at
another demographic,

00:46:35.124 --> 00:46:39.124
so males age 13 to 34 had
the highest frequency,

00:46:40.327 --> 00:46:43.345
so in this case, highest
frequency is the operative words,

00:46:43.345 --> 00:46:45.897
I'm not looking just at
comfort, look and price,

00:46:45.897 --> 00:46:47.684
I'm looking at their totals.

00:46:47.684 --> 00:46:51.784
And so that is going to
be there on the table.

00:46:51.784 --> 00:46:53.351
Now how might I figure out

00:46:53.351 --> 00:46:56.400
if they had the highest
frequency of responding.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:00.567
What number in the table
would I be comparing this to?

00:47:02.678 --> 00:47:04.909
So if you took a moment,

00:47:04.909 --> 00:47:07.934
I'll be actually comparing
it to these numbers here.

00:47:07.934 --> 00:47:10.851
And so is 140 greater than 61? Yes.

00:47:11.741 --> 00:47:12.939
Greater than 89? Yes.

00:47:12.939 --> 00:47:14.173
Greater than 27? Yes.

00:47:14.173 --> 00:47:16.116
And so that means males

00:47:16.116 --> 00:47:19.173
had the most numbers of
responses in this survey,

00:47:19.173 --> 00:47:22.590
and so statement number two is supported.

00:47:24.172 --> 00:47:26.079
Last, but not least, we've
got statement number three,

00:47:26.079 --> 00:47:27.194
so the probability that customer

00:47:27.194 --> 00:47:31.867
purchases sneakers, so that
a customer purchases sneakers

00:47:31.867 --> 00:47:35.284
based on price is approximately 24%.

00:47:38.196 --> 00:47:39.103
And so in this case,

00:47:39.103 --> 00:47:41.968
I'm no longer looking at just one segment,

00:47:41.968 --> 00:47:44.034
I'm looking at all customers.

00:47:44.034 --> 00:47:45.517
And then I'm looking at price.

00:47:45.517 --> 00:47:49.388
And so, which elements
of the table might I,

00:47:49.388 --> 00:47:53.555
will I need to see if statement
number three is supported?

00:47:57.058 --> 00:47:58.799
So if you took a moment,

00:47:58.799 --> 00:48:01.716
you might have said, this row here,

00:48:03.101 --> 00:48:05.839
and so I want to look at all customers,

00:48:05.839 --> 00:48:07.780
since this is just customers,

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.059
not male or female, or by age.

00:48:10.059 --> 00:48:13.289
And then I want to look at price here,

00:48:13.289 --> 00:48:17.141
and so it looks like this
is going to be a key number.

00:48:17.141 --> 00:48:19.076
And so the total number of customers

00:48:19.076 --> 00:48:22.263
that say price is the most
important thing for them.

00:48:22.263 --> 00:48:23.799
Now that's one part of the equation,

00:48:23.799 --> 00:48:26.567
but what about the second part?

00:48:26.567 --> 00:48:30.400
So how would I know if this is about 24%?

00:48:32.581 --> 00:48:35.884
Well, I would look at the
total number of responses,

00:48:35.884 --> 00:48:39.217
and so in this case, that's 75 over 317,

00:48:41.028 --> 00:48:43.422
and if you do the math, and you know,

00:48:43.422 --> 00:48:45.522
punch that number in on the calculator,

00:48:45.522 --> 00:48:49.146
that does get you to right about 24%.

00:48:49.146 --> 00:48:51.260
And so that is also going to be correct

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.126
and supported by the table.

00:48:53.126 --> 00:48:56.662
So then my final answer is going to be D,

00:48:56.662 --> 00:48:58.974
statements one, two and three.

00:48:58.974 --> 00:49:01.377
Now say you were short
on timein this question,

00:49:01.377 --> 00:49:03.791
there's actually another way
you might have done this,

00:49:03.791 --> 00:49:06.117
through a process of elimination.

00:49:06.117 --> 00:49:09.050
So say you checked statement
number one out first,

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:11.310
and you saw that statement
number one was correct,

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:13.628
well then, through a
process of elimination,

00:49:13.628 --> 00:49:16.781
A does not have number one in
it, so you know that's out.

00:49:16.781 --> 00:49:20.786
B also does not have one
in it, but C and D do,

00:49:20.786 --> 00:49:21.877
so you'd still,

00:49:21.877 --> 00:49:24.240
you would have gotten it
down to two, at least.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.220
Then, say you were here,

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:28.302
and you confirm that
number two is also correct,

00:49:28.302 --> 00:49:31.741
well then, you know that C
does not have number two,

00:49:31.741 --> 00:49:34.711
and so you can also cross that out.

00:49:34.711 --> 00:49:38.711
And by process of
elimination, get to D as well.

00:49:39.723 --> 00:49:42.693
So that's the last
question, practice question,

00:49:42.693 --> 00:49:45.352
that I am going to go through for today,

00:49:45.352 --> 00:49:47.206
on charts and graphs.

00:49:47.206 --> 00:49:50.683
And so that really is
the end of the concepts

00:49:50.683 --> 00:49:52.676
and the topics for today,

00:49:52.676 --> 00:49:55.544
and so I hope that you
found some of the work

00:49:55.544 --> 00:49:57.869
on careless mistakes with SAT math,

00:49:57.869 --> 00:50:01.618
and function notation, and
graphs and tables, to be helpful.

00:50:01.618 --> 00:50:03.478
Now, to wrap things up in class,

00:50:03.478 --> 00:50:06.902
I'm going to give out a badge
for attending the class,

00:50:06.902 --> 00:50:09.656
and then take some questions.

00:50:09.656 --> 00:50:12.142
So let's take a look at the badges,

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:14.337
and how you will get that,

00:50:14.337 --> 00:50:15.887
and then if you have any questions,

00:50:15.887 --> 00:50:17.096
go ahead and start typing them

00:50:17.096 --> 00:50:18.790
into the YouTube live chat box,

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:22.969
and I'll go ahead and answer
as many as I can, okay.

00:50:22.969 --> 00:50:24.386
So for the badge,

00:50:26.031 --> 00:50:28.347
you're going to get a badge link

00:50:28.347 --> 00:50:30.948
in the YouTube live chat box,

00:50:30.948 --> 00:50:32.899
and then once you click on the badge,

00:50:32.899 --> 00:50:34.760
you'll need to log into Khan Academy.

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.433
And then you'll see a notification

00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:38.677
in the top right of the screen.

00:50:38.677 --> 00:50:41.375
And so keep an eye out for that,

00:50:41.375 --> 00:50:45.383
it'll pop up next to this
little like bell icon,

00:50:45.383 --> 00:50:47.153
that's my best interpretation of a bell,

00:50:47.153 --> 00:50:49.055
in the top right of your screen.

00:50:49.055 --> 00:50:52.193
And then like I mentioned,
now I'm going to take a minute

00:50:52.193 --> 00:50:54.842
to go through and answer some questions.

00:50:54.842 --> 00:50:57.573
And so, the first question we have is,

00:50:57.573 --> 00:51:01.379
around time management
strategies on SAT math.

00:51:01.379 --> 00:51:04.405
So, first thing I would
encourage you to do,

00:51:04.405 --> 00:51:08.844
is go to Khan Academy, in our
Tips and Strategies sections,

00:51:08.844 --> 00:51:10.630
and we have two really good articles

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:12.245
about time management strategies,

00:51:12.245 --> 00:51:13.576
not just for SAT math,

00:51:13.576 --> 00:51:16.922
but also the reading and writing sections.

00:51:16.922 --> 00:51:19.596
Now for SAT math in particular,

00:51:19.596 --> 00:51:22.410
what I would encourage you to do is,

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:25.779
one strategy called the
two passes strategy.

00:51:25.779 --> 00:51:28.358
And so what you want
to do in the first pass

00:51:28.358 --> 00:51:30.692
is go through and answer the questions,

00:51:30.692 --> 00:51:34.747
answer as many of the
questions as you can,

00:51:34.747 --> 00:51:38.137
but don't spend too much
time on any one question.

00:51:38.137 --> 00:51:40.771
And the reason for that is
that all of the questions

00:51:40.771 --> 00:51:42.680
on the SAT, on math, reading and writing,

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.722
every question is worth
the same amount of points.

00:51:46.722 --> 00:51:49.441
So it's an easy question,
it's worth one point,

00:51:49.441 --> 00:51:51.465
if it's the hardest
question you've ever seen,

00:51:51.465 --> 00:51:52.906
it's still worth one point,

00:51:52.906 --> 00:51:55.128
and so investing too much
time in a hard question

00:51:55.128 --> 00:51:57.035
really is not worth it.

00:51:57.035 --> 00:51:58.354
So in first pass,

00:51:58.354 --> 00:52:00.142
go through and answer as
many questions as you can,

00:52:00.142 --> 00:52:02.434
while still being careful and effective.

00:52:02.434 --> 00:52:05.282
Then in the second pass, you
can prioritize your time,

00:52:05.282 --> 00:52:06.856
and what you want to remember,

00:52:06.856 --> 00:52:08.482
is that in the SAT math section,

00:52:08.482 --> 00:52:10.503
the questions go from easy,

00:52:10.503 --> 00:52:13.499
so say you have 10 questions,
or 15 questions in a section,

00:52:13.499 --> 00:52:15.236
questions one through five or six,

00:52:15.236 --> 00:52:18.846
will be easier, than
questions 11 through 15.

00:52:18.846 --> 00:52:20.334
And since these questions are worth

00:52:20.334 --> 00:52:22.276
all the same amount of points,

00:52:22.276 --> 00:52:25.173
you can prioritize your
time by going through,

00:52:25.173 --> 00:52:28.923
and making sure you get the
easy and medium questions,

00:52:28.923 --> 00:52:30.866
absolutely right,

00:52:30.866 --> 00:52:32.428
since they're all worth
the same amount of points,

00:52:32.428 --> 00:52:34.870
before going on to the hard ones.

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:37.634
And so these are few things you might do

00:52:37.634 --> 00:52:40.412
to get better at time
management on the SAT math.

00:52:40.412 --> 00:52:41.932
And the other thing I would suggest

00:52:41.932 --> 00:52:43.957
is just practicing with timed,

00:52:43.957 --> 00:52:45.906
with a timer at home,

00:52:45.906 --> 00:52:47.347
so that you get a sense for

00:52:47.347 --> 00:52:50.347
how fast or how slow you need to go.

00:52:51.941 --> 00:52:53.024
So let's see,

00:52:55.992 --> 00:52:59.009
okay, so this was good
feedback for the next session.

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:01.108
So can you do more difficult problems,

00:53:01.108 --> 00:53:02.430
could you please do some of the hardest

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:04.332
passport to advanced
mathematics questions?

00:53:04.332 --> 00:53:08.227
Absolutely, so I can,
maybe in our next class,

00:53:08.227 --> 00:53:10.727
have a trickier math question,

00:53:12.706 --> 00:53:14.149
to make it a little more challenging,

00:53:14.149 --> 00:53:15.935
and so we can do that.

00:53:15.935 --> 00:53:17.777
And so next question,

00:53:17.777 --> 00:53:19.835
will these questions be on the SAT?

00:53:19.835 --> 00:53:21.286
So yes, all of these questions

00:53:21.286 --> 00:53:23.144
were example problems taken from

00:53:23.144 --> 00:53:25.012
official SAT practice,

00:53:25.012 --> 00:53:27.263
taken from official practice and,

00:53:27.263 --> 00:53:30.620
which are all real practice questions from

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:34.755
the College Board, that
will show up on the SAT.

00:53:34.755 --> 00:53:37.556
And there are harder ones than these,

00:53:37.556 --> 00:53:39.664
there are also simpler ones than these,

00:53:39.664 --> 00:53:42.219
and so everything that you
see on official SAT practice,

00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:44.847
whether through the practice questions,

00:53:44.847 --> 00:53:47.773
the timed mini-sections,
or the practice exams,

00:53:47.773 --> 00:53:49.090
are all official questions

00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:51.034
that have been on the SAT in the past,

00:53:51.034 --> 00:53:51.904
and that we've built

00:53:51.904 --> 00:53:55.497
in collaboration with the College Board.

00:53:55.497 --> 00:53:56.330
Let's see,

00:53:59.651 --> 00:54:01.420
we have another one of,

00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:04.451
when should you start
studying for the SAT,

00:54:04.451 --> 00:54:06.146
so with that, I would really encourage you

00:54:06.146 --> 00:54:10.194
to first figure out when
you're going to take the SAT.

00:54:10.194 --> 00:54:12.626
So depending on if you're
a junior or a senior,

00:54:12.626 --> 00:54:14.898
and if you're thinking
about early admission,

00:54:14.898 --> 00:54:17.211
or early decision, you know,

00:54:17.211 --> 00:54:18.494
figure what is the right timing

00:54:18.494 --> 00:54:20.020
for you to take the SAT.

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:21.724
And then once you know that information,

00:54:21.724 --> 00:54:23.380
head to official SAT practice,

00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:26.548
and create a personalized
practice schedule.

00:54:26.548 --> 00:54:29.471
There, you'll be able to
input your information to say,

00:54:29.471 --> 00:54:31.709
I'm taking the SAT in October,

00:54:31.709 --> 00:54:34.078
or I'm taking it in August,

00:54:34.078 --> 00:54:36.265
and then based on today's date,

00:54:36.265 --> 00:54:39.330
and when you're signed up to take the SAT,

00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:41.277
we'll then recommend that you study say,

00:54:41.277 --> 00:54:43.619
an hour a week, two hours a week,

00:54:43.619 --> 00:54:46.232
and you can then create
that customized schedule

00:54:46.232 --> 00:54:49.017
to say, I'm going to
study three days a week,

00:54:49.017 --> 00:54:50.664
for an hour a week,

00:54:50.664 --> 00:54:52.359
since I've got, you
know, some amount of time

00:54:52.359 --> 00:54:54.880
before the test, so I
can kind of take it easy.

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:58.010
Or if you're exam is in, you know,

00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:00.412
two weeks or three weeks,
you might want to step it up,

00:55:00.412 --> 00:55:02.433
but that practice schedule
will really help you

00:55:02.433 --> 00:55:04.925
decide how many weeks in advance

00:55:04.925 --> 00:55:06.662
you want to start practicing,

00:55:06.662 --> 00:55:08.608
and how much to study per week.

00:55:08.608 --> 00:55:10.919
I would say, obviously
the more time you have,

00:55:10.919 --> 00:55:14.053
and the more leeway your have, the better.

00:55:14.053 --> 00:55:15.886
Let's see, so I think,

00:55:18.564 --> 00:55:19.600
we won't be able to finish,

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.843
okay, so this is a great last question.

00:55:21.843 --> 00:55:22.831
What if we are running out of time,

00:55:22.831 --> 00:55:24.481
and we know we won't be able to finish,

00:55:24.481 --> 00:55:26.061
is it best to guess?

00:55:26.061 --> 00:55:29.301
So there is no more
guessing penalty on the SAT,

00:55:29.301 --> 00:55:31.544
and so the answer to that question is yes.

00:55:31.544 --> 00:55:34.284
If you get a five minute warning,

00:55:34.284 --> 00:55:35.611
or realize there is not enough time,

00:55:35.611 --> 00:55:37.587
and you've got, you
know 10 questions left,

00:55:37.587 --> 00:55:39.068
hopefully that's not the case,

00:55:39.068 --> 00:55:40.878
because you did some time
practice, and you feel okay.

00:55:40.878 --> 00:55:42.696
But in that case, absolutely guess,

00:55:42.696 --> 00:55:46.087
so I don't know what your, you know,

00:55:46.087 --> 00:55:49.613
what you want to do if you
want to guess all Bs, all Cs,

00:55:49.613 --> 00:55:52.583
or make it random, but you should guess,

00:55:52.583 --> 00:55:56.345
there's no penalty for a
wrong answer on the SAT.

00:55:56.345 --> 00:56:00.067
So I think that's all
for SAT math for today,

00:56:00.067 --> 00:56:03.537
but for next week, we're
going to do SAT reading,

00:56:03.537 --> 00:56:05.894
and so that class is again, on Tuesday.

00:56:05.894 --> 00:56:07.307
And for the next class,

00:56:07.307 --> 00:56:09.949
I would ask you to think about, you know,

00:56:09.949 --> 00:56:12.174
when you're on the SAT reading,

00:56:12.174 --> 00:56:15.441
and you've narrowed down
the answer choices to,

00:56:15.441 --> 00:56:19.243
either B or C, or C or
D, down to the final two,

00:56:19.243 --> 00:56:23.288
how should you pick between
those final two answers?

00:56:23.288 --> 00:56:27.024
So when it's 50/50, what
approach do you use?

00:56:27.024 --> 00:56:28.921
And so that's going to
be one of the things

00:56:28.921 --> 00:56:31.925
that we'll tackle next
week with SAT reading,

00:56:31.925 --> 00:56:33.661
again, with some strategies and some real,

00:56:33.661 --> 00:56:35.808
practice problems that you can do.

00:56:35.808 --> 00:56:39.520
And so, that's it for today for SAT math,

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:42.466
but remember to join us next
Tuesday at 7:00 pm Pacific,

00:56:42.466 --> 00:56:44.207
4:00 pm, ah,

00:56:44.207 --> 00:56:46.406
7:00 pm Eastern, 4:00 Pacific,

00:56:46.406 --> 00:56:48.315
for our SAT reading class,

00:56:48.315 --> 00:56:49.597
and I hope this helpful,

00:56:49.597 --> 00:56:53.347
and best of luck as you
practice for the SAT.
