1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,710
You are listening to
radiolab radio from W N y.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,580
S. C. E. Yup. Hey,

3
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:14,610
this is Radiolab. I'm Jad
Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

4
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:18,210
Our topic today is goodness,
goodness, selflessness.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,830
So we've done the math I as the map.
Okay. So you ready for this? All right,

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,890
I'm ready. Alright, so a while back we,

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,930
we did this story that for us at
least really stuck in our heads.

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,710
It was a story that was, uh,

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,080
asking this really deep question and the
answer that we got to you answer didn't

10
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:38,810
quite click right. I remembered
that one. Yeah. Just to sort of, uh,

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,210
set the table. The question was,
why do people do good in the world?

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,240
So we asked that question, looked at
it from the perspective of genetics,

13
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:46,770
computer science, all kinds of things.

14
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:51,771
We ended up profiling these three
extraordinarily heroically good people.

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,830
Yes, they were heroes. They did
remarkable things, each one.

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,960
And we told their stories
with that question in mind.

17
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:00,860
Why do certain people do good in
the world and others don't? Yeah.

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,840
And so we're going to revisit that
question today and the story that we told

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,810
because I think we have something better
and smarter to say about it. Final,

20
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,170
something very peculiar to say
about it as it turns out. Yeah.

21
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:13,770
So we're gonna play you the original first
and then we're going to come back and

22
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:17,040
hopefully shed some new light
on it. Yup. So here we go

23
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,490
again. This story just began with a
simple question, that question. Let us,

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,100
well, for Koski two,

25
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:29,000
a guy named Walter with cal scoop and
I'm the executive director and the

26
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,650
secretary of the Carnegie
Hero Fund Commission. Cool.

27
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:33,500
Well thanks for doing this.
Can you just give us, uh,

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,500
a little background on the hero
fund? What is the Carnegie Hero Fund?

29
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,700
Carnegie Hero Fund is a private operating
foundation that was established by

30
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,100
Andrew Carnegie in 1904.

31
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:49,070
And what we do is recognize civilian
heroism throughout the United States and

32
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:52,500
Canada by giving an award
called the Carnegie Medal.

33
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,370
And accompanying the Carnegie metal is
a financial grant. How much? Uh, well,

34
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,680
currently the amount is $5,000. Wow.
And how do you guys choose your heroes?

35
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,660
We judged the heroic acts
against a list of requirements.

36
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,050
So then you have to have some
kind of definition of hero,

37
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:14,820
which includes some and excludes
others. Yes, perfect. Basic definition,

38
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:19,821
which is a civilian one
meaning no military who
voluntarily to leaves a point of

39
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:24,730
safety. Three to risk his
own life or her own life,

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,030
or to an extraordinary degree. Five.

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,410
To save or to attempt to save
the life of another human. Six.

42
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,560
How about seven y, can you hear? Can
you read that one more time? Okay.

43
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:36,210
I wasn't reading that
just came from memory.

44
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:40,320
So what is it that happens in a person's
mind at that pivotal moment when they

45
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,910
decided to voluntarily,

46
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,670
voluntarily leave a point of
safety line of sight and your risk,

47
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:48,300
their life to an extraordinary degree
to save the life of another human?

48
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,930
That's what we wanted to know.
Should we just jump in? Okay.

49
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,290
So the first one we have on our
list is a Laura Shrek. Okay.

50
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:01,070
That's file number seven three five
four six and the award number is 8,005

51
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,700
I am Laura shrike. I'm
from Matt Toon, Illinois,

52
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,760
and I currently live in
Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

53
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,390
Oh Wow. Laura spoke with our
producer, Tim Howard. Okay,

54
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,490
so we're going back a
little bit here. Yeah.

55
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:17,491
15 years back in the mid Nineties
1995 to 21 year old college students,

56
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,830
and I was driving through the country and
I saw a woman getting mauled by a bull

57
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,470
and a pasture. So she stomped
to see what was going on,

58
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,070
jumped out and started yelling
at her to see what I could do.

59
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,670
The woman was on the ground and
the bull was 150 pound Jersey Ball,

60
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,350
tossing her in the air and back on the
ground. Wow. She was clearly struggling.

61
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,170
And where were you? I was right
on the other side of the fence,

62
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,160
but the fence was electric.

63
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,140
[inaudible]

64
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,260
so here's the moment that we
find fascinating. At this point,

65
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:59,000
Laura can either go forward
through thousands of volts
of electricity toward an

66
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:02,480
angry bull that will
likely mall her to, or

67
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,510
she can stay safe.

68
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,283
No,

69
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,161
I want it.

70
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:16,720
Hadn't just climbed through the fence
and I don't remember ever feeling fi

71
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:17,590
electricity.

72
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,550
She says by the time she got through
crazily enough and Labor had shown up and

73
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:25,330
threw her a piece of pipe maybe about
two feet long or she approached the woman

74
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,570
who was still conscious the
whole time she's yelling at me,

75
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,480
hit the ball on the face as
hard as you can and don't stop.

76
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,450
So Miss Shriek went up to the ball and uh,

77
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,080
it repeatedly diffuse two
foot length of tubing.

78
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,720
I think it distracted the bull enough
where she was able to get out from under

79
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:47,380
him.

80
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,970
And as soon as we were outside the fence
looking back into the pastor and the

81
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:55,720
bull was literally right
there at the fence,

82
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,800
correct the ground a few times and
snorted. He was not, he was not happy

83
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,050
to our question.

84
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,050
When you were there at that fence and
you had the choice to either stay put or

85
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:13,490
to go through it, what was going through
your mind? Was there a calculation?

86
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,960
No, I can't really say that.

87
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,650
I mean you don't weigh your options
or anything like that? I did not know.

88
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,210
It was just, here's the problem,
here's what I need to do.

89
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,730
And something needed to happen.

90
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,743
Huh?

91
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,700
So there was no choice moment?

92
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,170
Not that I recall. No.

93
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,650
If nobody came to this woman's
rescue, she would die. Unfortunately.

94
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,380
This is the usual explanation.
Says Walter lobular no explanation.

95
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,570
I couldn't stand there and not do
anything. I would, I was compelled to act.

96
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,830
I didn't really take the time to
think about what else could happen.

97
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,330
No, I can't say I ever really thought
about my own life at that time. I mean,

98
00:05:54,331 --> 00:05:56,490
I think we just jumped ahead
because we thought we'd try again.

99
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:59,200
That's the voice. The next
Carnegie Hero that, uh,

100
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,820
Walter told us about William
David Pennell, William Panel,

101
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,260
who is the 8362nd person to
receive the Carnegie metal.

102
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,850
I produced your Lynne Levy tracked him
down. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear.

103
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,430
Oh, William David Pennell was 37 years
old at the time of his heroic act.

104
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:20,120
Was It 1999? Yes. I was,
uh, early in the morning.

105
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:24,590
It was like 3:19 AM in a small
town near Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,

106
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:26,690
Pennsylvania, Monongahela, Pennsylvania.

107
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,830
We was in bed sleeping and
my wife heard a lot of crash.

108
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,400
I actually didn't hear it from an
adult. My one dog was carrying on.

109
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,540
So right away I run down there.
Mr Pennell went outside his house.

110
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,030
There was a a very bad
automobile accident.

111
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,780
A car crashed head on until utility pole
was like whiplash up the windshield out

112
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:50,040
from under the hood from the responded
to the scene wearing only sweat pants or

113
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,160
shoes or shirt or nothing
on their chest in air foot.

114
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,290
So here we are, bill standing
in front of this ball of fire.

115
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,240
There are three teenagers inside that car
though he doesn't know it can either a

116
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:08,240
do nothing or B go in
through the driver's door

117
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,930
and his big fellow slumped out the door.

118
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,840
So I reached in and grabbed a
hold of them around the chest,

119
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,840
pull them from the driver's seat
out to the ground. The meantime,

120
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,400
the car was just like blazer
and my neighbor was there.

121
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:27,850
She was hollering. There's more of them
in there. So I run back to the vehicle.

122
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,570
We found that the front seat
passenger was trapped in the wreckage.

123
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,520
I finally got him loose
and pulled him out.

124
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:36,530
And currently Mr Pennell was aware
that a third person was in the car.

125
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,570
Third Young Man, Mr Pennell
entered the car a third time.

126
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,850
By then there was tires blown flames
had grown to about three feet above the

127
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,150
car's roof. The interior there,
like the headline or at the car,

128
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,610
the stuff was stripping like
plastic Donald, my back.

129
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,420
I mean I'm in there screaming, you
know, somebody give me a hand in here,

130
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,570
but nobody, nobody would help. And uh,

131
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,380
I reached in and grabbed a hold of the
kid who was in the back by the scruff of

132
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:08,760
the neck and pulled him out.

133
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:09,511
All right,

134
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:13,110
so when you were coming out of your
house and you're looking at that car,

135
00:08:13,111 --> 00:08:14,250
what was going through your head?

136
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,480
I'll just this to try to help. I mean, I,

137
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,200
I did what any normal person
would do. I mean, you know,

138
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:25,690
I just kept saying this to somebody
whose kid, you know what I mean?

139
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,440
It's a time my daughter was like 16.
And I'm saying to myself, you know,

140
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,230
if something, God forbid,
whatever happened to her,

141
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,390
that I would hope someone
would be there to help.

142
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,290
Do you ever talk to your neighbors and
ask them why they didn't come in there?

143
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,190
Uh, you know what, that's funny you
brought that up because no, I've never,

144
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,990
never brought it up. Never brought
it up. I don't know. I guess,

145
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,560
uh, maybe I probably wouldn't like
their answer. I don't know. Uh,

146
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,980
I don't

147
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,311
know why.

148
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:59,540
I've never asked him about what do you
think is the difference between you and

149
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,250
those other people who just
sort of stood by? Uh, I,

150
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,000
I couldn't answer that
[inaudible] answer that.

151
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,190
So our bull girl, she didn't know.
This guy didn't really know either.

152
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,780
Somebody must be able to tell us something
about what they were thinking at that

153
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:19,410
moment that allowed them, that gave
them the courage to do what they did.

154
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,980
I can't give you a definite answer as
to what propels people to do this. No,

155
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,610
we took one more shot with Walter
and uh, after we take a quick break,

156
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:30,720
we're going to hear one more hero story
from him. That's when we come back.

157
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,210
This is Sam.

158
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,750
You're calling from Denver, Colorado.

159

162
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,250
hi, I'm forming u s attorney. Prepare
Rara. I have a show called, stay tuned.

163
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,750
We talk to the best minds in
politics, law and culture.

164
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,210
Like our recent guest, Maggie Haberman,

165
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,930
a couple of Trump advisors over the years
have said to me that people close to

166
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:05,080
him in variably begin to act
like him. And that is true.

167
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:07,210
I have observed that
personally. You can hear,

168
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:11,230
stay tuned on apple podcasts or
anywhere you get your favorite shows.

169
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,050
Jan, Robert Radiolab. We're
back now with Walter Rakowski,

170
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,440
who's going to tell us the third and
final of his hero stories. He told us,

171
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,510
well that of all the cases he's heard,

172
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,820
this is the one that puzzles him the most.

173
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,900
The case of Wesley James Autry,

174
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,450
a construction worker from a New York
50 year old man who did jump into the

175
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,540
track that in a subway
station to remove a fellow,

176
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,730
a young man who had fallen onto the track.

177
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,230
The gentleman was a six
foot 280 pounds. He was,

178
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:53,940
he was in earth and yet Mr Autry persisted
despite the fact that a train was

179
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:58,260
coming. There would come a point and
let's, at least in my estimation,

180
00:10:58,261 --> 00:10:59,550
where you would have to say,

181
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,870
I have to get out of here because I'm
going to be killed on, I'm not suicidal,

182
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,330
but Mr Autry didn't think that way. He
and I parked in this in this manner.

183
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,900
What he did was he lay a top the victim
between the rails while the train passed

184
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:18,750
over them in the farthest
reaches of my imagination,

185
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,560
I can see myself jumping onto a
subway track to attempt the rescue.

186
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,500
What I can't see myself
doing is lying at top,

187
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,450
the victim while the train passes over me.

188
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,470
[inaudible]

189
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,210
making this story even more nuts.

190
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,790
When we finally met up with Wesley Autrey
on the platform where this incident

191
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,710
happened under 35th and Broadway.

192
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,620
He explained to us that his
daughters had been with them.

193
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,080
Okay. And uh, how old are
your daughters at that time?

194
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,320
My daughter was four and six. And this,

195
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:57,640
this them there should this
picture. Oh my God, super cute.

196
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,250
The one behind me is Shuki
and this the baby Sashi.

197
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,980
So when they're standing there and
this guy starts convulsing and then

198
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:08,240
eventually falls off the platform onto
the tracks, right as a train is coming,

199
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:13,030
his choice is pretty stark. In order
to save this complete stranger,

200
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,110
he's got to leave his daughters
behind potentially without a dad.

201
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,940
Yeah. I'm shaking and going into
another seizure for some strange reason.

202
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,170
A boys, I don't know, said that,
don't worry about your own,

203
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:28,870
to worry about your daughters.
You can do this. So he jumps,

204
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,300
runs to the guy. Is he conscious? No, no.

205
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,100
Tries to grab the guy's hand and
he's on my, grabbed his hand.

206
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,390
We'll slip a pride in a way he slipped.
I look up, the train is getting close.

207
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:44,260
I grabbed his hand again, we'll slip
apart just this goes up 50 feet,

208
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,870
20 feet, 10 feet, and then it's right
there and all you can do is grab the guy,

209
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:53,670
get them in a bear hug and flatten his
body again against the guy as much as he

210
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:54,504
can.

211
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:04,130
The first train car just grazed my
cats train car went right over it.

212
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,210
Train came to a stop over
the five cars passed over us.

213
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,080
I looked him in the eyes. Excuse me,
you seem to have a seizure or something.

214
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:13,730
I don't know you. You don't know me.

215
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,360
So I just kept talking to him until
he came through and he was like, well,

216
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,260
where are we? I'm like
willingly portrayed. He said,
well, who are you? I said,

217
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:25,160
I came down to save your life. So he kept
asking me, are we dead or when heaven,

218
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,190
I gave him a slight pinch on his
arm. He's that hall. Just I see you.

219
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,140
You are very much alive. Have you,

220
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,180
did you ever ask yourself at this point
like what am I doing here when he asked

221
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,240
it, what am I doing here? What about
you ma? I can hear the two ladies.

222
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:43,790
We had my daughter standing
the man between their legs.

223
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,200
I can hear that daughter screaming.
So when that train come to a stop,

224
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,900
I yelled up from underneath the train.
Excuse me. I'm the father. We are okay.

225
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,980
I just want to let my daughters know that,

226
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,580
that I'm okay because I know
that they are worried about me.

227
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,130
Everybody started clapping.
Can I ask you a question?

228
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:04,810
So it's the point at which you said
you heard a voice. Yes. That said,

229
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:09,670
I can do this. I can do this.
What's, what's what is amazing to me?

230
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,360
Is it you left your daughter's
right here and die after a guy.

231
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:17,530
You don't know if he was a stranger.
Total stranger. But you know what?

232
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,590
The mission wasn't con
completed. I was chose for that.

233
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,970
You felt shows like you were
cheating. I felt like I was a chosen

234
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,870
lift for a religious person
though. I would wonder why me?

235
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,510
Well, you know what, uh,

236
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,190
maybe 20 years ago I was
supposed to be at a certain point

237
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,870
and then he explained to us
exactly why he had jumped.

238
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:45,440
He was the one guy who could, he said
right before his feet left the platform,

239
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:49,070
this one specific moment
from his life flashed to mind

240
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,880
this thing that happened. You know,

241
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,180
I had a gun pulled to my temple,
but you know, it was a misfire.

242
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,530
So you know a gun was put
to your head and miss them.

243
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,720
So you are almost dead for a
second as the most dead, you know,

244
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:07,260
so you think you might might've been
spared for a spare for reason after that?

245
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:07,340
Right.

246
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,770
A moment. He says when the gun
went click and he didn't die,

247
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,200
he always wondered why had God spared
him that moment until he was on the

248
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:19,160
platform and he saw the guy
fall off. He says, then he knew,

249
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,580
this is why I can do this. I
can do this. I can do this.

250
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,790
That voice, when that boy said
that you going to be okay,

251
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,200
I knew everything was going to work out.

252
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,060
You know what I think at the
end of the day. What's that?

253
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,360
I don't think that there's an
answer to the question we asked.

254
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,820
I don't really hear real
question. Why were you a hero?

255
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,800
I don't think that any
three of these here.

256
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:50,500
I mean the last one had
the longest explanation.

257
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,200
He had been selected for some purpose,
but does he know why he was calling?

258
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:59,290
Not a clue. A CIA guy number three gives
me something. What does he give you?

259
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,600
Okay, so the first two, right?
They have no idea. None.

260
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,140
So there's just something
in them that made them act.

261
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,270
The guy number three is talking about
circumstances like the world prepared him

262
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:14,980
for that moment. Serendipity. So it
makes me think, well, what if uh,

263
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,560
circumstances are just right? Maybe
any of us could do that. I'll get,

264
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,730
I'll get a mailman. He, he used to
say to me all the time, he says,

265
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,160
how did you manage to do that up? Or
how did you manage her pulling kids out?

266
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,150
I don't know if I could've done that.
I said, well, you know what? I'll say,

267
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:31,660
you wouldn't do this or you wouldn't do
that to you're put in that situation.

268
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,620
In fact, when we asked Walter, how
many nominations do you get a year,

269
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,640
are they hard to find?

270
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,920
No, they are not hard at all to find a,

271
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,200
we are fortunate to be living in a
society regardless of what you hear

272
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,034
elsewhere.

273
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,390
We are fortunate to be living in a society
where people do look out for others,

274
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:48,290
even strangers.

275
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,110
He told us they've even had to up their
guidelines to make it harder to win

276
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,150
simply because of the vast
number for road deeds that, uh,

277
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,810
happen in day to day life. Okay. Okay.

278
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,700
Um, I guess I gotta say that, um,

279
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,870
we went with is feel good thought about
about all the people who are doing good

280
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,560
views. I honestly don't think we knew
what to say to end that story. Well,

281
00:17:13,561 --> 00:17:16,260
it's nice to know that there'd be
lot more good people than we thought,

282
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,570
but we went and we, we were
trying to figure out why people,

283
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,380
why people who do that do that and why
we're different or they're different than

284
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:27,370
us. And at the end we didn't really
get there. Ah, but then yeah,

285
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,530
this guy walks in, you should say,
just for our purposes who you are.

286
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,900
Once again, I'm Robert Sapolsky,

287
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:37,140
I'm a professor of neuroscience
at Stanford and university.

288
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,060
Robert has been on our program many,

289
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:42,510
many times talking about any number of
things and he had just come out with a

290
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:47,150
book called Behav trying to
explain why we do everything we do.

291
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,710
It goes into the brain and the
history, the culture, everything.

292
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,260
And we figured well maybe he would
have something to say about our,

293
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,040
our little puzzle. Yep. Probably.
Well let me just let, just ask you,

294
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,980
you've heard all three of
these things. What does this,

295
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,810
what do these three tails make you think?

296
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,040
I think what we see with all three is how
highfalutin moral reasoning plays like

297
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:13,800
zero role in what went on there. More
reasoning doesn't do anything. Right.

298
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,540
And you know, the first thing
that Robert Spolsky told us,

299
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,740
which maybe wasn't that surprising,

300
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:21,220
is that when we were asking
people what were they thinking,

301
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,810
that was sort of the wrong question.

302
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,470
And everybody as you saw, we
just gives the same answer,

303
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,450
which is I wasn't thinking,

304
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:31,980
I was feeling about what if this were my
16 year old daughter I hearing a voice

305
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:36,750
or with the bull woman saying, I
wasn't thinking like before I knew it,

306
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:37,770
I had jumped in.

307
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,730
The evidence suggests Soboleski
says that in situations like this,

308
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,810
people just don't reason their way to
a decision. That's not how it works.

309
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,700
Correct. People don't think
their way to or moral decision,

310
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:53,600
and in fact you give people enough
time to really think their way in a

311
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:54,650
circumstance like that.

312
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,360
Most people think their way to concluding
this isn't my problem or somebody else

313
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:03,500
will take care of it or here's why it's
their fault. So then we ask them, okay,

314
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:06,020
if it's not thinking or moral reasoning,

315
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,550
then maybe what these heroes are doing
is there. They're feeling they're there,

316
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,710
they're empathizing more
than the rest of us,

317
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:16,610
and that's why they do what they
do. Ironically, probably not.

318
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,390
I'm probably not. Yeah.
Okay. So empathy, you're,

319
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:25,040
you're feeling somebody else's
pain, pain, whether it's pain,

320
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:29,810
your toes on fire or pain, you're
feeling the pain of somebody else.

321
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,820
Pain is painful and if it's painful
enough and acute and burning enough,

322
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,350
what that translates
into is I can't take it.

323
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:43,250
This is too upsetting and you
need to run away at some point.

324
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,660
If you're mostly focused on
my God, what were this to be?

325
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,120
What would this feel like if
this were happening to me?

326
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:55,510
That's the predictor of people who don't
necessarily don't very readily make

327
00:19:55,761 --> 00:20:00,620
that leap from feeling empathy to
actually acting compassionately.

328
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,540
Oh, that's not what I expected you to say.

329
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,590
I thought you were going to take it
the other way. So you're saying, okay,

330
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,740
when it's hot, when it's me, me, me,
me, me, might, your pain is my pain.

331
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,850
Those people are less likely
to step forward. Yeah, well,

332
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,300
they're less likely to actually
go and do the compassionate thing.

333
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,080
Spolsky told us that there have actually
been studies that have found this,

334
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,880
that when someone actually empathizes
physically feels in other person's pain,

335
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,110
they're more likely to turn away from
it rather than step forward and try and

336
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,730
alleviate that person's suffering.

337
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,400
You put somebody in a
circumstance and for example,

338
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:39,401
how many shocks are they willing to get
to intervene to help somebody in some

339
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,140
simulation game for example,

340
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:47,650
and you look at is this the person
whose heart rates sores when they see

341
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:53,110
somebody else in this tough situation
or is this the kind where it remains

342
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:57,130
fairly steady, the ladder is more
likely to act compassionately.

343
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,780
So interesting. Okay,

344
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:03,700
so what we're barreling towards here is
it's not so much about moral reasoning,

345
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,490
it's not so much about vast empathy,

346
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,640
but it's about a type of empathy that
allows you to remain detached enough to

347
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:14,530
actually act.

348
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,660
So emotional distance will create
the humane or charitable act.

349
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,960
Exactly. You need a certain
amount of detachment.

350
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,360
That's surprisingly where it comes in
and that runs counter to so many of our

351
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:30,550
instincts about what
empathy should be about.

352
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,700
And what I think we see here is probably
the most reliable realm of people going

353
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,540
in doing the heroic thing,
which is when it's implicit,

354
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,190
when it's automatic, when it's not,
you sitting there reasoning through,

355
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:48,730
well how many copies of my genes am I
going to pass on if I do this or among my

356
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:51,220
close relatives and
where it's not empathy,

357
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,780
oh am I feeling for this person or as
this person or with this person or above

358
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,870
this. And instead, before I knew it,

359
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,450
I had jumped in the
river to save this child.

360
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,170
And I think that's where you see
some of the most interesting,

361
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:09,760
reliably sort of heroic
stuff when it's implicit,

362
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:14,790
when it's automatic and know how a person
can get that kind of compassion made

363
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:19,210
implicit. Is it a,

364
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,270
is it something you're born with or
something cultural at your parents? Uh,

365
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,830
or do you have any idea?

366
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,040
The thing is we don't know a ton about
the neurobiology of how a moral good goes

367
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:37,180
from being a frontal
task to an implicit task.

368
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,840
But we know a ton about how that
works in a much more mundane area,

369
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:46,230
which is like you'll learn how to do
something like you're a pianist and you're

370
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:51,481
learning some new tough piece of music
and there's this really tough trill and

371
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:56,230
every time you're playing it, as you
approach the trail, you're thinking,

372
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,940
here at comes, remember,

373
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,910
Tuck your elbow in and lead
with your thumb and do this.

374
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:05,280
It is what would be called a
declarative task, declarative,

375
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,550
explicit knowledge. And that's
completely about this part of the brain,

376
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:13,510
the hippocampus talking to the frontal
Cortex, and it's sitting there saying,

377
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:17,010
here it comes, and remember how you do
it and remember how you do it wrong,

378
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,410
what happened last time and how great
it felt when you talk to your elbow in.

379
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:21,310
So remember to that.

380
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:26,340
And then suddenly there's the day where
you're playing the piece and you realize

381
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,070
your four measures past the trill
and you played it just fine.

382
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,170
That's the first day you played it without
having to think about it and jargon

383
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:40,290
in the learning field is it has stopped
being an explicit declarative task and

384
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:44,020
it's become an implicit procedural task.

385
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,800
That's the first time your hands,
no would better than your head.

386
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:53,780
Does me take somebody who's like beating
the pants off of you a tennis and

387
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:58,160
they've just done like some amazing
backhand and crushed you and what you need

388
00:23:58,161 --> 00:24:02,000
to do strategically now is forced them
to take that procedural knowledge and

389
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:03,170
make it declarative again,

390
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,000
stop at that point and give him this
like obsequious smile. I said, oh my God,

391
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:12,260
you're an amazing tennis player. That
was an amazing shot. How did you do that?

392
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:17,660
Do you put your hand over on this side
or that side and what about your butt?

393
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:20,900
Are you scrunching your button on the
left side or the right and you force him?

394
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:25,901
It's like you make somebody like think
very explicitly and procedurally how you

395
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:28,910
go down flights of stairs and you're
going to fall down the stairs because none

396
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:29,744
of us have done stairs.

397
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,520
Proceduralise since we were
about two and a half years old,

398
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,870
a bunch of professors had swarmed over
our threes and released their first two

399
00:24:35,871 --> 00:24:38,750
of our three sims. They might've
been ruined for the next experience,

400
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:43,220
but if you let them do their natural
thing, then they would rescue again.

401
00:24:43,221 --> 00:24:47,780
Maybe if they could just keep it implicit.
Do you think that if it's implicit,

402
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,770
do you think that, uh, that there's, it's
a clean, it's a clean analogy. I mean,

403
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:56,570
do you think that that is the
people for whom it is automatic?

404
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:01,130
It's automatic because they've practiced
it in some way in the way that like

405
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:05,840
they probably in some
way, yeah. For example,

406
00:25:05,841 --> 00:25:10,841
lots of studies were done as to which
people in either Germany or Nazi occupied,

407
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,110
uh, Europe, older Jews gave them shelter,

408
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:20,111
put their own laws at risk and it
wasn't predicted by level of education.

409
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:24,510
There goes all that moral reasoning
stuff and it wasn't even particularly

410
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,740
predicted by things like religiosity
was people who had simply been raised,

411
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,010
you do the right thing. It was
automatic. It was implicit for them.

412
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,280
They didn't have to sit there and think
about or feel about it was automatic

413
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,710
because that, thank you mommy and Daddy.
Is that what that is? Thank you mommy.

414
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:47,570
Daddy, rabbi priest. What is
that? I think it's mostly that,

415
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,170
but of course it's messier than playing
a trail on a piano or doing a tennis

416
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:52,004
backhand.

417
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,050
I mean people first learned about it
and you literally can see the transition

418
00:25:57,051 --> 00:26:01,340
from which part of the brain's handling
the task. So the initial view was, okay,

419
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:03,230
that's how you do trills on the piano.

420
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,410
But then you see something
even more amazing,

421
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,740
which is more complex stuff happens. My,

422
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,090
my father in his last years
had a pretty severe dementia.

423
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,520
Um, he was a professor,

424
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:20,930
he was an architectural historian and
he reached a point where he could not

425
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:25,040
identify the names of all of this kids
consistently, didn't know where he was,

426
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,120
what decade, etc.

427
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,650
But prompt him and he could
give you this totally lucid,

428
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:33,260
opinionated, cranky, entertaining,

429
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:38,650
10 minute lecture on the history of
flying buttresses and then come back two

430
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:41,900
minutes later and prompt him again and
he'd give you the exact same one again.

431
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,770
For him, that was as
implicit as, you know,

432
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,670
the tennis player doing the backhand
or playing the trolls on the piano.

433
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,340
When I fully expect when I'm demented,

434
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,460
someday I'll give this exact
lecture that I just gave in.

435
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:58,970
I can do it over and over and over
until the student's complaint.

436
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,470
So all sorts of stuff.

437
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:04,770
More complex than a tennis
backhand becomes implicit.

438
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:08,730
I think what we're seeing with the woman
with the bowl there in the electric

439
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:13,731
fence is some incredibly high level
abstract stuff becomes implicit as well.

440
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,320
You don't like fling your elbow way out
to the right when you do the trill and

441
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,740
you don't stand by and watch somebody
being like done in you just before you

442
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:29,670
know it, you don't reason. You don't
feel you just do it. Before I knew it,

443
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:32,640
I had run in there. No. Is
this one of your lectures?

444
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:36,690
Do you talk about this very
thing? Um, in other words,

445
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:38,490
when we come and visit you in 13 years,

446
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,380
will you be treating us with this
very elect? Precisely. Empathy.

447
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:47,130
Empathy is an interesting topic.
Sit down. This will be on the final.

448
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,980
Okay, good.

449
