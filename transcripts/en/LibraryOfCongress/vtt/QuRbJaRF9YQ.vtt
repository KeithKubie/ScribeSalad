00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.780
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Hello, everybody.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.230
Thank you for coming to our panel,
Authorship in the Digital Age.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:35.790
I am Sarah Burnes, a DPLA Board
member and what we're going to do

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.210
for the next 45 minutes is
I will introduce these guys.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.860
Then I have a series
of questions for them.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.830
I hope that they will start talking
and squabbling amongst themselves

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.130
and we'll do that for about
half an hour and then we'll open

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.600
up the floor to you
for your questions.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.730
So, introductions.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.850
On my very left is Robin Sloan.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.320
He grew up in Detroit, went
to school at Michigan State

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.990
where he co-founded a literary
magazine called <i>Oats </i>.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.710
He has worked at Poynter
Current TV and Twitter,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.900
and at all those places his
jobs had to do with something

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.040
about the future of media.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.050
He is also the author of <i>Mr.
Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore </i>,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.120
which I had the very great
pleasure of helping to bring

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.220
out into the world, and actually
started as a short story published

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.730
on -- was that KDP
Kindle Direct Publishing?

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.030
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: It was, it was.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.330
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Yeah, KDP.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.630
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Back when that
was still kind of weird.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.930
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Right,
yes, exactly, exactly.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.800
And I checked yesterday.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.740
We have actually -- that
book has been published now

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.010
in 30 other countries which
is really very exciting.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.280
And he lives in the Bay Area.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.800
Virginia Heffernan writes
regularly about digital culture

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.550
for the <i>New York Times Magazine </i>.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.470
She is also the author of the
completely wonderful cult novel,

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.180
<i>The Underminer </i>which she wrote

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.980
with her extremely
funny friend Mike Albo

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.760
which I recommend you get
if you haven't read it.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.070
She holds a PhD in English
Literature from Harvard

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.070
and has a new book
coming out called <i>Magic</i>

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.830
<i>and Loss </i>which I've just
finished, and it really,

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.210
actually changed the way I
thought about the Internet.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.460
She looks at it, not just merely
as technology or a business tool,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.830
but as a piece of art
in its own right,

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.550
and then applies critical
tools in looking at it.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.840
And I really -- I think it's going
to blow your mind [laughter].

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.260
And she lives in Brooklyn near me.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.560
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yes.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.840
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Then Craig
Mod is a writer, designer,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.460
and photographer I think I'll say
who triangulates between Japan,

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.130
the Bay Area, and New York City.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.630
He's written for <i>The Atlantic,
the New Scientist, the New Yorker,</i>

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.750
<i>Virginia Quarterly Review, and
the New York Times </i>among lots

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.740
of other publications,
and then also online.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.270
And I really recommend
that you go to his website

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.890 position:56%
and I think you'll probably spend a
lot of time there reading his essays

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.410 position:56%
because they're fascinating and have
actually just been published in 2015

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.370
in Japan and in Korea,
is that right?

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.670
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Right.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.950
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: So his essays are
on topics as varied as walking,

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.430
which he loves to do, sushi,
but also on publishing,

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.530
especially e-book and app design,
design in the digital space.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.030
So just very briefly about myself.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.220
I am a literary agent
at the Gernert Company.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.780
I represent fiction writers,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.620
adult and children's fiction
writers, and non-fiction writers.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.100
I spent some time on the, what
we call the publishing side

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.290
of publishing which is
on the editorial side.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:42.780
And when I -- my first job in
publishing I worked on a typewriter

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.310
and we did out P&amp;Ls with
a calculator and a pencil,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.130
so this is -- we have come
a long way since those days.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.380
So I wanted to start
at the beginning

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.590
which is actually the
creative process

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.810
because of a suit I've
always been really fascinated

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.120
by the creative process
and where ideas happen

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.930 position:56%
and how they get executed and a book

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.790
for a long time was one single
consciousness onto a page.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.320 position:56%
The digital world has really changed
that and sort of what is created

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.460
and for whom and how and how fast.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.290
Its speed is something that I've
talked to many of you guys about.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.070
And so, Craig, actually, I
thought we would start with you --

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.370
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Okay.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.670
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: --
because you wanted to talk

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.120
about fast and weird books --

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.420
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Yeah.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.720
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: -- and
I'm interested in that,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.020
sort of how those are created

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.220
and how they then get
out into the world.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.520
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.400
So a lot of the essays
that I've worked

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.520
on online actually have
been really slow weirdly.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.000
So an idea will hold and I'll
kind of sit on it for six months

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.250
or for a year and then finally I'll
realize, ah okay, now I know how

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.550
to write about that thing.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.850
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Right.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.150
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Or I'll write --

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.030
like when I did a Kickstarter
for the book <i>Art Space Tokyo </i>,

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.790
the proposal for the Kickstarter
was written in September

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.840
and then the Kickstarter
happened the next May.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.630
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Is that
because the project itself --

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.120
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: It was
just kind of prep

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.310
so I think the interesting thing
about digital is you can kind

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.740
of like dip a toe in really
quickly and then you can --

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.140
I like to take a step back.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.440
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Right.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: So this when I did the
Kickstarter was back when you had

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.600
to get permission to
do the Kickstarter.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.120
So like you're e-mailing
the founders

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.980
of Kickstarter saying I have
this cool think I want to do.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.280
Is it cool if I do it?

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.180
And then they vet it and they
read it and they go okay, yeah,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.580
we're going to let you do it.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.700
And so I got the permission and
then eight months later it was

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.000
like all right, now
we can finally do it.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.650
I feel like we're ready.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.160
But fast books -- so as you
said, I've been slightly obsessed

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.720
with walks over the
last couple of years.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.080
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: He writes
wonderfully about walking.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.730
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: So in Japan I live
mainly in Tokyo and Japan has a lot

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.100
of beautiful pilgrimage
walks that are, you know,

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.890
these paths that are a thousand
years old or 1200 years old,

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.450
and they're really accessible,

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.000
and they're really
easy to do these walks.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.410
And I've done 10 or 11
in the last three years.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.110
And the last one I did was
just two weeks ago and I pulled

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.530
out Dan Rubin who's a great
photographer and another friend

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.300
of mine, and the three of us
did this walk for eight days

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.260
and it's called [foreign words].

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.490
It's one of the old
pilgrimage routes.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.740
And the goal was -- Dan and I
had wanted to do a book together

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.940
for a while, a photography
kind of collection,

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.670
and I said, all right, Dan.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.080 position:56%
Let's do this walk and then we're
going to hide in a house for a week,

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.310
this house in the countryside
that a friend of mine lent to us.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.250
It was old, it was freezing,
it was a 150-year-old sort

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:54.520
of Meiji era Japanese sort of
mayor's house that was kind

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.450
of converted, being
converted into an inn.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.090
And we took it over.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.580
We mailed a printer to the house.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.260
And I love -- Robin knows
I love this printer.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.810
Sarah knows I love this printer.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.170
Brother laser printers are
one of my favorite things.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.470
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Write
it down, everyone.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:10.770
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: They're incredible.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.070
They're like $80.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.370
They kind of last forever.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.940
You can buy cheap toner
if you look online.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.440
You don't have to buy
the real stuff.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.960
And we just blew through like six
toners in this old Japanese house.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.380
And we printed out all
the photos we took.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.680
It was like 3000 photos.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.110
And then we just started curating.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.900
And the goal was we had five days
to go through all these photos

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.480
from this walk we had
just done, meditate on it,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.040
come up with some subset,
and then make that a book.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.340
And we did.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.150
We finished last Saturday,
so just a few days ago.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.470
And it's done.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.030
We have the whole book done.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.270
And now we're just negotiating
with blurb to get some quotes

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.420
on slightly special
printing for print-on-demand.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.350
But the whole thing -- the goal's,
the whole thing is from experience

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:56.520
to shipping a book globally where
we take on as little of the onus

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.020 position:56%
of kind of warehousing and dealing
with shipping logistics as possible,

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.590
but still produce a beautiful
thing, a beautiful artifact.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.650
The goal is to do that
within about a month.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.950 position:56%
And I think we're going to hit that.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:07.250
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Wow.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.550
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: That's pretty fast.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.850
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Will
there be an e-book as well?

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.730
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: There's
going to be a website.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.030
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: A website.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.370
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: No e-book, yeah.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:15.670
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Yeah.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.970
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Yeah.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.490 position:56%
No, really, don't really know how to
shape an e-book around this stuff,

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.410
and it's a lot of work, and it
feels like the payoff isn't --

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.360
I don't find the payoff
to be quite there.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.660
So we're going to make a --

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.880 position:56%
we have this beautiful template for
a website where that maps the route.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.500
As you scroll you can kind
of see where we walked --

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.800
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Oh,
that's [inaudible].

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- and all the photos.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.400
As I was walking I run
this program called Moves.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.220
It's an old app that
was bought by Facebook.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.520
It still runs.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.240
It's constantly running
in the background.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.370
And what you can do is, if
I'm shooting with a camera

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:49.640 position:56%
that doesn't have GPS data my Moves
is recording GPS data 24-hours-a-day

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.560
of me, which is kind of creepy
but also kind of cool [laughter].

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.860
Our three years of data.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.520
I can literally import this
into Google Maps or Google Earth

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.310
and walk through, have Google Earth
fly me through the last three years

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.610
of my life, street by street.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:01.910
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Wow.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.210
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Which is
like weirdly compelling.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.670
And so we're able to layer
this data on top of the photos

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.110
and so we have pretty
precise GPS data for,

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.250
and elevation data
for all the images.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.810
So we map that onto a map,
do a little JavaScript,

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.500
and as you scroll it does
this beautiful thing.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.470
It shows you the photos and
shows you where we were.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.410
So it's kind of a -- it's
a nice artifact, too.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.010
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: That's very cool.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.290
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Craig, when you,
actually before you embarked

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.750
on this walk, when you were
imagining starting this project,

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.940
it sounds like you had
a vision of this book,

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.600
and it might have been
a blurry vision.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.900
You didn't know how
thick it was going to be

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.650
or you certainly didn't know what
the contents were going to be.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.520
But you like, you could kind of
see that shadowy form, right?

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.970
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: A little
bit, yeah, yeah.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: I mean, I think it's
-- to this question of creativity

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.470
and where do these projects start,
where do writing projects starts

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:49.910
in the year 2016, there's this kind
of way of thinking about stories

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.110 position:56%
and content that you sometimes hear.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:56.330
You hear it in, you know,
newsrooms or from some of these new

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.250
like multimedia companies
that aspire

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.180 position:56%
to produce content on all platforms.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.480
And they'll say something --

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.780
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Synergy.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.080
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Yeah.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.280
I'm going to make a contention
here, and I'm curious to know

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.430
if it resonates with you two at all

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.020 position:56%
because you might have actually very
different ideas or different kind

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.020
of temperaments in this regard.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.260
What you often hear is, you
know what we need to do?

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.490
We need to like take
an idea and then find

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.380
like the best medium
to express it in.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.120
And I think that is a lie.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.580
I think that is not how
things emerge in the world.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.880
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: That's not
the way my understanding --

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.180
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Yeah.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.480
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: That's not
the way we think about it.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.780
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Yeah, right?

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.080
Like -- and, I mean, you can --

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.380
I guess you can hypothetically
image how someone would go

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.230
through that process
and arrive at like

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.590
that would make a great
picture book.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:46.480
But it has no actual
correspondence to the way that any

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.080
of my projects have ever emerged.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.260
I mean, you mention the short
story version of this thing

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.750
that later became a novel.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.940 position:56%
The reason it existed -- I mean,
this is the truth, the ground truth.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.440
Craig and I both have sort of a
romance with the Kindle screen,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.760
the tactile properties of a Kindle
screen, and just the way it looks.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.060
It's kind of weird.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.330
And it was my enchantment with
that screen, my first experiences

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.750
with it, that made me
want to write something

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.600
for that screen, to
be on that screen.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.220
So the format and like
literally the material

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.800
in a very real way called
forth the story, the writing.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.100
And that's been the case.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.400
You can just get in the line

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.980
for almost everything I've been
produced; I mean I produced.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.280
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Can you
talk a little bit about

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.580
"Julie Rubicon" and how that --

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.880
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: I mean, yeah.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.180
Well, that's the bookend.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.480
Yeah, that's the -- there's
been all these examples

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.780
of things along the way.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.450
And the most recent was a
story that I wrote for Facebook

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.360
on Facebook, and it was not me.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.730
This was just, you know, you
can find it on my Facebook page.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:48.740 position:56%
It's free to read [laughter], and it
was -- again, it grew out of the --

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.780
not a sense of like
I've got a story.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.080
You know, like what, what?

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.560
Who just has a story
they want to tell?

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.130
I don't even know what that means.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.430
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Right.

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:00.730
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Instead it was
a fascination with this medium,

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.600
you know, the Facebook Note
as a think in the world,

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.610
and the way seeing how they spread
and seeing them kind of filter

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:10.150
into my own feed and thinking,
damn, that's interesting, you know?

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:14.030 position:56%
This is just like the esthetics of
it and sort of the assumptions built

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:17.400
into it, and the kind of things
that get written as Facebook Notes,

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.030
that like a little bit like
okay, it's 10 o'clock at night.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.520
I probably shouldn't
be writing this,

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.830
but [laughter] I think I'm
going to write it anyway.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:29.260
Publish. And so that,
starting from that,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.580 position:56%
I sort of developed this whole story
that became this weird sci-fi thing

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.920
and then became something that I --

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.600
it was my first foray
into Facebook publishing.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.020
But, again, it's, for me at
least, it begins with form.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.320
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Mm-hmm.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.620
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: It
begins with form.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.920
That's interesting.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.710
Virginia, you have spoken in
other contexts about hyperlexia

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.100
that we're sort of inflicted with.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.400
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Mm-hmm.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.360
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Is it
fair to say that we are?

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.140
And some of it is because the
east of that kind of publishing --

00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.440
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.740
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: -- of the even
just put something up on Facebook.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.400
And so they're -- so, but it's also
true that you said that, you know,

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.090
"The Internet," I'm going
to quote you, "is the latest

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.730
and most powerful extension
and expression

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.240
of the project of being human."

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.990 position:56%
So how -- could you just talk a
little bit about that, about what --

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:23.060
tell these guys what hyperlexia
is and how you see it, but then,

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:27.890
sort of how to -- I guess
the question is then,

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.190
how do we manage it?

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.490
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:35.170
So the idea of hyperlexia is
that we're reading too much,

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.550
we're reading all the time.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.430
And we just heard the Education
Panel talk a little bit

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.490
about the digital divide and
concerns about failing literacy.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:47.430
But we're in a society that
finds reading so intoxicating

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.260
that we won't even
stop driving to --

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.380
we'll risk highway
fatalities in order

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.330
to keep reading and writing texts.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:00.480
And I think in some ways the ease
of publishing is in fact a response

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:06.350 position:56%
to the, you know, crabbed difficulty
of writing in the 20th century.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.220
The heyday of writer's block,
the heyday of the <i>New Yorker </i>,

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.130 position:56%
that if you didn't squeeze something

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.880
into the <i>New Yorker </i>in the
so-called lapidary style,

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.800
like it's etched in
stone, where every --

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.330
I remember growing up with the idea
that every comma was sweated over,

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.640
that if you were a real
writer you spent, you know,

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.870
you spent all this time on your
M dashes and your, you know.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.190
And like a spelling error
would be, you know, a --

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.760
it's some kind of psychological
crisis.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.330
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Robin
has just recently written

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.940
about M dashes I believe
actually [laughter].

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.240
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.840
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Anyway,
sorry to interrupt.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.140
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Not at all.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:47.730
And, you know, we're in a very
typo-friendly culture now,

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.820
gaff-friendly culture now.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.970
I just wrote something
about Trump and Twitter.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.730
Well, let me back up and say
that following on, you know,

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.310
following on Craig's being
inspired by the idea of, you know,

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.830
publishing -- making
this book really quickly,

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.480
and Robin's skepticism about
whether we all have a story to tell

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.560
and we're just looking
for the medium.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.410
You know, we all heard
the expression

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:14.480 position:56%
"The medium is the message," and
sort of either thought it was opaque

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.190
or just, you know,
mystification, or it sunk in.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.310
But some of us decided
to take it seriously

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.870
and just kind of live by it.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:27.850
And I think that that is like,
you know, part of the project

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:32.720
of being me is to say there is no
Trump without Twitter, you know?

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.190
There is no Robin's book
without the Kindle screen.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:40.800
Like it just -- you, you know,
are working back from that and,

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.780
you know, to get a little abstract,

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.230
the technology is speaking
us, you know?

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:50.710
And that was -- so back
to the <i>New Yorker </i>.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:55.600
You know, one of the points that
students of 20th century poetry say

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.560 position:56%
of me is that 19th century, the
long line, the sort of Whitman line,

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.570
and that effusive style,
suddenly became --

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.930
because you had to
sell an ad against it

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:11.310
in the <i>New Yorker </i>and also
run a poem against non-fiction,

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:15.420
against spot art, and so forth,
and cartoons, they became short.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.150
And once they became short,
you just built this bottleneck

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.700
that like the hardest
thing in the world was

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.110
to overcome your writer's
block, you know,

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:26.140
the <i>New Yorker </i>writers
famously like retreat

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.730 position:56%
and they can't get anything done for
20 years, and that's real writing.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:34.400
And fake writing --
and so, I really --

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.370
you know, I grew up largely online.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.730
This, you know, accident
of network computing meant

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:44.230 position:56%
that in the ARPANET era, as a child,
I got online at Dartmouth College

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.190
and was playing like D&amp;D-style
games, like kids, you know,

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.350
like kids now except
that it was 1979.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.250
I knew that there was that
kind of writing and reading,

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:57.040
but that was false writing and
reading because it was like close

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.640
to TV and it was just bad
somehow because it was masquerade,

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.370
because you were --
you know, I was nine.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.140
I was pretending to be 18.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.560
Not to find predators but to --

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.060
although I was probably open
to a little of that [laughter].

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:18.250
But I also was -- I wanted to
be able for people to mistake me

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.870
for someone who could
talk coherently

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.170
about Reaganomics [laughter].

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:26.360
Okay. And I couldn't -- in
the classroom I, you know,

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.110
like didn't have a leg to stand
on to talk about the Cold War or,

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.500
you know, later, Reaganomics.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.170
But online I did, you know?

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.170
And I wasn't especially
comfortable in physical space.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:41.400
And all of a sudden I was
comfortable like writers forever,

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.380
on the page, with language,
with symbols, and so forth.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.450
So that was happening on one level,
and on the other level I wanted

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:51.820
to be a poet and what I knew of
poetry was the <i>New Yorker </i>poem.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.120
And what I knew of that was
that it was just so hard,

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.830
that you would get -- you know,

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:02.150
the ideal writer's story was you
got 50 rejections and then you,

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:06.180
you know, finally got this
one poem in or three poems in.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.760
And so those two things sat
uneasily with each other.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.470
There was this digital
world of like proliferation.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.660
You know, YouTube appeared
and all of a sudden it was

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.620
like everybody had
just been waiting.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.680
It was almost like a
civilization was unearthed instead

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.200
of an art form started.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.310
It was like everybody had been
waiting to post four-minute videos.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.830
And all of a sudden, you know,
just huge numbers of them went up.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.850
And then, also, these
polyglot comments.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:36.190
And the YouTube Comment
Section is like notorious

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:39.190
for being rabbley [assumed
spelling] and it's just, you know,

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.650
whatever you think of
mobs, you probably think

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.020
of the YouTube comment section.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:49.060 position:56%
On the other hand supremely literate
like hybrids of Asian languages

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.310
and English and like, you know,
emoticons and I don't know

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.030
if you can use emoji
or whatever now in --

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.330
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Oh, yeah.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:57.630
&gt;&gt; -- YouTube comments.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.210
But -- so that and the beginning
of Web 2.0 I was like oh,

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:03.610
that's strange literacy that
I remember from our, you know,

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:09.040
Dungeons and Dragons meets
Reaganomics meets -- I don't know.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.450
There was a lot of like damsels and
steeds and Led Zeppelin that sort

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.780
of influenced our language in
the '70s online [laughter].

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.080
And --

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.380
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Wait, computers.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.050
There was a while when every
computer server was named Gandalf.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:21.350
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Oh, yeah.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.650
Yes, exactly.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:23.950
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Like
every university --

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.250
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Exactly.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.550
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- it
was that you could tell.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:27.850 position:56%
It was the same of the analog of
the same person at every university.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:29.150
It was like just go.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:30.450
Virginia, just like set
up the server, so like --

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:31.750
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
Yeah, Gandalf.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.050
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- don't
mind if I do [laughter].

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.350
Small.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.650
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
[Inaudible] totally.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.950
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Yeah.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.250
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.550
For some reason that was like where
you lived and that's another medium

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.340
as a message thing is that,
you know, these token worlds,

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.760
<i>Star Trek </i>and so forth that
formed all these communities really

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.590
like when they found tech in
another idiom, the Grateful Dead,

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:49.890
when the found tech they were just

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.370
like where have you been
all my life, you know?

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.940
It was like -- I think,
doesn't your husband write

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.830
about self-digitizing communities?

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.200
Or at least he spoke to me about --

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.610
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: He
may well [laughter].

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:01.990
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
Like something --

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.910
but it was like something
about like the Greeks being

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.880
somehow self-digitizing.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.060
I mean, it -- this
is beyond my brain.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:13.730 position:56%
But, you know, that in ancient times
there were cultures that almost

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:17.610
like presaged or acted
digitally before digital.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.010
So, anyway.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.330
Those things all interest me.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:21.760
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: We'll
get him here next year.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.060
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Okay, good.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.710
When I discovered -- he might have
been telling me about another field

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.270
of study that he was -- anyway.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.010
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Right,
right, right.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.310
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
But so I went to work

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.930
at the <i>New Yorker </i>as
a fact-checker and,

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.280
still while I was there,
before anything was online

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.990
and as a fact-checker it was
about, you know, very sharp pencils

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:42.210
in this red and graphitey
combination

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.830 position:56%
where you were crossing out letters.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:47.750
And, indeed, every
letter had to be checked

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.990
because we were keeping
alive that idea that,

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.740
you know, was supremely elitist.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.200
That only we could do this
thing, and that we were

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.470
like had some unique
qualification to do it.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:02.470
You know Craig brought up sushi
and you might have told me this

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:03.770
or maybe I learned it in Tokyo,

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:07.320
that in America we think sushi's
incredibly difficult to make

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.400 position:56%
and you have to go through all these
guild procedures and like whatever.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.220 position:56%
And then when you sort of learn that
it's like raw fish and a little bit

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.270
of wasabi and so forth, you
think like why is this so hard?

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.210
Well, it's hard to bottleneck
it so that it's like, you know,

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.970
to keep a kind of guild
system alive so that you have

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.390
to like mop the floor for
a long time and it's all

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:27.290
that like wax on/wax
off thing so that you --

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.320
until you become Grand
Master of this thing.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.800
And that's what I discovered
at the <i>New Yorker </i>, you know.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.780
And so at the same time <i>Slate </i>and
all these online magazines were

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:40.670
appearing and it was just
like write it, you know?

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.600
I just like wrote something
really fast.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.900
It went up online.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.430
There were 500 comments.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.340
I remember one of them was, "Does
your mother have any children

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.010
who don't have brain
damage [laughter]?"

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.840
And Andrew's fine.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.140
My parents are here.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.760
My brother is fine
[laughter], but --

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:02.910
and I was like this is so
different from this, you know,

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:06.270
world that was the real
literacy, the real literacy.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:10.100
One thing I say in the book is that
reading scrolls, Torah scrolls,

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.690
you know, was for scribes only.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.670
And, you know, one of the
innovations of the Roman Empire was

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.020
to create the codex, the --

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.470
you know, what we recognize
as a book now.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.650
Those were supposed to be
illiterate because they were

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.690
so easy to find your place in.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:28.450
It was because they had pages
that broke it down for you.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:29.750
That's not even real reading.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.170
Real reading you have
to supply the vowels.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:33.930
You have to like keep your eye --

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.400
finding your place was what
only certain people could do.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.390
So, you know, it is amazing to
me, and it was a great panel

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.880
in Education, but it's amazing
to me to hear people talk

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.670
about how we have to cultivate
this literacy that can

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.590 position:56%
like only happen here at the Library
of Congress when, you know --

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:53.030
I mean, we're creating
entirely new languages

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.360
of this like incredible speed.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:01.920
I mean it's so far beyond emoji's,
like anyone -- it can't be easier.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.260
It's probably equally hard to learn
Ancient Hebrew as it is to learn

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.870
like really high-speed
use of gifs --

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:08.170
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Yeah,
yeah [laughter].

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:09.470
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: -- you know?

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:10.770
I don't understand --

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.070
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.370
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
-- you know, you set --

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.970
you're like halfway through
typing <i>Wolfman Jack </i>into a --

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.270
you know, something.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:17.570
And some one [pooh]
comes with a gif.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:18.870
It's like they read your mind.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.170
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: And it's for the --

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:21.470
and it's like the product
of a gif sommelier.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.770
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
Yeah [laughter].

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.070
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: It's so totally --

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.370
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Totally.

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:26.670
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- tuned to the --

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:27.970
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Totally.

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.270 position:56%
Remember Neil Dash was like -- he
can find a link so quickly on Slack.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.570
Like --

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:31.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Well, some people --

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.170
well, you know, some people
like keep gif stashes.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:34.470
I think that's --

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:35.770
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yes.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.070
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: --
that's the real --

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:38.370
the real high level thing
is that you have a --

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:39.670
if you're using your computer,

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:40.970
you actually have a
folder on your desktop --

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:42.270
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yes.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.570
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- and it's

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:44.870
like spring-loaded
[chu-chu], ready to go.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.170
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.470
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: I'm curious.

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:48.770
It's so -- it's amazing to hear
you talk about that sort of --

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:50.070
this new endlessness and
this new kind of profusion,

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.380 position:56%
and it makes me realize that for all
I know about your opinions, Craig,

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.040
about the way these things work,
I don't actually know how you feel

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.360
about that -- like the
endlessness, the profusion.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.660
I know you love edges.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.960
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: I love edges.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.310
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: I know you are,
but I know you love things,

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.680
I know you love things
that can be finished.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.980
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: I do, yeah.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.280
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Like --

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.580
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Well, yeah,
I think it's important.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.880
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: And so, I mean it
might be worth talking about that

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.100
for a second because that's
certainly relevant to, again,

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.230
you know, thinking about
what you're going to produce

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:19.000
and how it's going to be packaged.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.100
But does the like whomp of YouTube
or whatever -- does it like --

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.400
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
Oh, the whole thing.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.630
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- does it make
you like scared or ecstatic?

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.830
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: I think
it makes everybody scared.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.610
I mean, I think it's -- would
be to say that the, you know,

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.450
when you first -- I
mean, I had a fantasy,

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.130
I think a lot of people did,
that like one day I would kind

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.090
of read every book that existed.

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:44.510
And the first time I saw Google it
was like this Faustian overwhelm,

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:47.530
like I'll never be
as smart as Google.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.080 position:56%
And I was defeated on the first day,

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.720
like Kasparov lost to
Deep Blue at chess.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.020
I lost my will to play.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.320
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Over it.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.620
&gt;&gt;

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.920
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: But back in the
beginning when it was just Yahoo,

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.220
it was almost doable, right?

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.520
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Right.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.820
But there was a time --

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.120
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: It was
like, it was like you --

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.420
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: --
there was a time when you --

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.720
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- you could
look at it and go, ah --

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.020
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
-- first thought --

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Yeah, I could do this.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.620
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:09.920
Yeah. But there's -- for
all of us, there's a moment,

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.220
this thing is too big
to be read, you know?

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.520
My moral choices are often
about choosing not to read.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.820
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Well,
my greatest sadness

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.350
as a child was realizing I wasn't
going to be allowed to see 2100.

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:17.650
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Mm.

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:18.950
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Like I
got to have this --

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:20.250
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.550
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- I have
like this moment in a car --

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.850
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.150
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- where I went,
"I cant wait to see 2100.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:25.450
And like how many years is that?"

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:26.750
It was like, "Wait a
minute" [laughter].

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.050
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:29.350
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: "I'm not
going to be able -- like" --

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.650
and so my whole fantasy
of heaven was a VCR

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:31.950
that allowed me like
go through time.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.250
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Hmm.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.550
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Yeah.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:35.850
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: And get
your move -- get your move --

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:37.150
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Get my move is data.

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:38.450
Yeah. No. But, no,
the overall -- I'm --

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:39.750
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
That's the heavenly cloud.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:41.050
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: I am beyond
being over -- I'm just excited.

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:42.350
I love --

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.650
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:44.950
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- YouTube
is one of my favorite --

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.250
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:47.550
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- things
in the world now.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:48.850
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
Incredible resource.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.150
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: I am so
obsessed with YouTube.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.450 position:56%
I have -- and mainly in part because
they've done a really good job

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:52.750
of subscriptions, with being
able to draw boundaries

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.130
around the craziness
of it, of exploring.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:58.570
Like the YouTube apps on IOS and
iPad are really phenomenal now.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.320
They're like some of
the best apps out there.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.990
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Are
you making any videos?

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.290
Are you doing --

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:04.590
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.900
It's a -- video is
like it's so much --

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.080
that's the thing I feel like
could still be optimized.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.570
It's like the ease of
making video is not nearly

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:14.210
as easy as it is to do text.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:15.510
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:16.810
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: To do the comments.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:18.110
That said, Snapchat, I've
been using the heck out,

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.440
and I only do video on Snapchat.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.740
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: You
and my children.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.450
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: That's --
it's actually really fun.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:23.750
And that ephemerality --

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.830
I mean, Robin, I know you're
a Twitter deletionist.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.130
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Mm-hmm.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:28.740
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: The idea of like
not having things stick around,

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.640
not having the like archive is
kind of compelling in a weird way.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.940
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.800
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: And but so
-- but let me sharpen my --

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.100
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Sure.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.400
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- spear point --

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.700
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Yes.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.000
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- a
little bit [laughter].

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.300
As a author --

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.600
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Yes.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.900
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- as someone who
is creating things in this world,

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.200
and so not just as sort of
a consumer or an enjoyer,

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.500
but as like someone who
wants, like you want,

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.210
people to have this
book and enjoy it.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:52.760
Does the, you know, flinging it
into this world that is suddenly

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.100
like [inaudible] so much vaster?

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.400
Is that like -- how does that feel?

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.340
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: You're
talking about the walking book.

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.640
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Yeah.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.940
I can --

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.240
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.540
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Just like the
walking book, for example.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:06.840
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.140
The --

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.440
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: You've
made something with edges

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.740
and you're throwing it
into edgeless space.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.040
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Oh.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.340
Well, I mean it's exciting, right?

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.640
Because with that edgelessness
comes access to people.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.940
I mean, that's the
beauty of the Internet.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:17.240
It's like you put a
thing up there and you --

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.540
potentially a billion
people can read it.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.840
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Mm-hmm.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.140
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: And that's
pretty exciting, you know?

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.440 position:56%
And you just kind of have to deal
with this part and parcel of that --

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.740
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
It is online --

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.040
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- that bargain.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.340
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
It's online in PDF or?

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: It's not up there yet.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.940
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Right.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.240
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: But people --

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.540
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: All right.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:32.840
But it will be.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.140
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: That's [inaudible].

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:35.440
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
But it will be.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.740
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: It will just
be -- it will be the website.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.040
And, you asked if I was
going to do a digital book.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.340
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Yeah.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.640
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: I'd like --
the lines between what is

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.940
and what isn't a digital book, I
mean, are so fuzzy, in my opinion.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.240
You know, is an EPUB
inherently the only way

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.540
to be a digital book is a PDF
suddenly then a digital book?

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.840
I mean, is taking a PDF of a
website then a digital book?

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.600
I feel like making a website can be
as much a digital book as an EPUB.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.900
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Sure, absolutely.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.250
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: I mean EPUBS
are effectively websites.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:52.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Or a book, or a book

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.360
that you think can
acquire only online.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.660
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Right.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:56.960
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: I think there's
a lot of things like that.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.100
Like there's a whole genre --
this is like something interesting

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.400
to note in the world --

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.510
a whole genre of the like
many generations now,

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:05.290
descendants of Dungeons
and Dragons --

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:06.590
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:07.890
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- in
the role-playing game.

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:09.190
Kind of like --

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:10.490
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:11.790
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- kind
of like deconstructed --

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.090
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yes.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:14.390
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: --
and built back up.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:15.690
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:16.990
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: And they're all
sold exclusively as like $5 PDF's.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:18.290
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yes,
the $5 PDF, absolutely.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:19.590
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:20.890
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yes, yes.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:22.190
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Well, the
photography world is --

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:23.490
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: I'd
say, yeah, Tim Ferris thing.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.790
It's like -- you know, Tim Ferris
like just thinks he should be able

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:26.090
to make your entire living
in four hours a week.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:28.550
And he's just like the first
thing you need to get is a PDF

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.410
because people will pay to
download it and you, like --

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:32.710
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: How funny.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.010
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: --
tease it and carnival bark it

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:35.310
in all these ways that
the secret is in this PDF.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.070
And it will be three pages.

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.780
But one of the things
we're talking about,

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.380
this <i>New Yorker </i>thing is we
-- because we're writers --

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.680
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Yeah.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.980
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
-- we are, you know --

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.530
and an agent, like all
of us are determined

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:47.880
to jack up the value of --

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.180
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Yeah.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.480
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
-- what we do.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: But in terms of people
making money with digital books --

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.050
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:30:00.310
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- the photography
community hasn't nailed it.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:03.620
Like their guys just making
printing hundreds of thousands

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:08.820
of dollars a year selling
PDFs on how

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.900
to like use light room
[inaudible] --

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.200
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Oh, yeah.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.580
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- or
do iPhone photography.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.880
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Right.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.240
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Like the photography
world is so okay with PDFs.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.540
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Right.

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:22.490
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: And there's
no other way to do it

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:26.390
because you need all these
screenshots and a PDF is

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:29.420 position:56%
so much easier to make than an EPUB.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:30.720
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
Yeah, I get that.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.150
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: And anyone can do
it and they it up on their website

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:35.890
and they sell it using, you know,
Stripe or whatever, and it's just,

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:37.850
you know, they -- it's
just a download.

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:39.150
It's so effortless.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:45.640
But more than any other community
I've seen the photography community

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.310
embrace the PDF.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:51.730
It's like a true book, a true book
of like how to do photography.

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:54.530
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Let me
tell you like a weird thing

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:59.130
about making books valuable again,
making content valuable again.

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:05.770
ACQUITY, the insurance company,
a couple of years ago decided

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.060
that they were going to
publish their annual report

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.760
in a pop-up book.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.830
And pop-up books, including <i>Pat the
Bunny </i>and the massed produced ones,

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.020
all are made by hand.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:21.290
There's no way -- I mean, they
make them in China but each one --

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:24.070
there's no machine
technology involved.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:25.670
And what they did -- what it did,

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:29.290
because all the other annual
reports were circulated digitally,

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:33.500
some in PDFs and so forth,
was they created demand

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.660
for their annual report.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:41.090
And they'd had a great year and
all of a sudden everyone wanted

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:45.060
to get their hands on the
ACQUITY Annual Report.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.070
I mean, it was like, you know,
at some insurance whatever.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:49.670
It was the talk of the whole thing.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:54.520 position:56%
And, you know -- and I also recently
talked to the lawyer for Scholastic

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.170
who kept the last J. K.
Rowling thing offline

00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:58.850
until the release last
-- <i>Harry Potter </i>novel.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:03.500
And it meant she had to be in like,
I don't know what they call them.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.480
It's like the equivalent of clean
rooms or rubber rooms or something,

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.110
where there's no WiFi and they
had to like create computers

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.330
and printers and stuff that
never -- and no phones.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:17.400
Nothing could have any WiFi access.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.890
So it's like creating the
edges, creating the margins,

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:24.440
creating the like -- there can
only be 40 of these pop-up books.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.120
And like you will, there
will never be a 50th.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.200
And even if you took flat photos
of it, even if you whatever,

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.500 position:56%
you can't make another one of these.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.800
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Right.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.100
Well, and I think the
proliferation of the infinitude

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.400
of the Internet has made these
things even more compelling, right?

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Right, right.

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.000
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: And that's
why I mean with our --

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.300
this photo book, for example, it's
like we can put most of the photos

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.600
up on Instagram but
without those edges.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.900
And also just seeing photos big --

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.200
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.500
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- is sort of
compelling in and of itself.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.800
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah, yep.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.100
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Without
the edges, I don't know.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.400 position:56%
It's somehow -- I think people don't
take the time to really look at it.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.700
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.000
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: To really
give it a moment.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.300
And so a pop-up book is --

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.600
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
A good call, right?

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.900
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- a super-powerful
way of doing that, yeah, yeah.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.200
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: So I've
gotten through about a quarter

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.500
of my questions here [laughter].

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:57.800
But I'd like to open
it up to you guys

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.100
because I'm sure you
have questions, too.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.400
And if you don't, I'll
just keep going.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.700
Are there questions out there?

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.000
Yes.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.300
&gt;&gt; One of the first things
that attracted me to the work

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.600
of Craig was his fascination
with Japan, living in Japan.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.900
And one of the things that
bothers me about the Internet is

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.200
that you're always worried --

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.500
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.800
-- you're going to see the
Internet in a different way.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.100
So I wanted Craig to
talk a little bit

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.400
about what does the Internet look

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.700
like for a young person
in Japan right now?

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.000 position:56%
What are they doing on social media?

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.790
What types of things
are they reading,

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.470
from a literary perspective?

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:21.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: From Myanmar.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:22.510
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Well,
or Myanmar, yeah.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.960
I just spent two months in
Myanmar at the end of last year.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.340
Myanmar's fascinating just
because two years ago a SIM

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:34.410
for a cellphone cost $5000-ish, and
last year it went down to $1.50.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:36.080
So it's a pretty big drop.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.770
And then they opened up --

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:41.270 position:56%
the government realized being a
military dictatorship wasn't helping

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:43.260
them much and they
started opening up markets.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.800
Now there's 3G coverage
kind of all over the place.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.100
And you have a bunch
of farmers sitting

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:51.770
on buffalo playing Clash Your Clans
[laughter] which is kind of cool.

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:53.070
Japan is funny, right?

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.790
I mean Japan -- a lot of times when
people talk about Japan and things

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.640
that come out of Japan, there's
this Galapagos phrase that's

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.940
thrown around.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.900
The Galapagos keitei,
the Galapagos cellphones.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.830
You know, Japan, if you went
to -- I moved to Japan in 2000.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.610
You know the first cell
phone I got had a camera.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:09.550
It was a color screen, it
was this clamshell thing.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:11.330
I mean it felt magical.

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:13.560
I mean it really -- like there's
nothing else in the world like it.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.340
And none of those cell phones
were exported because none

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:20.510
of them were built to work on, you
know, global sort of cell networks.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.020
It could only work in Japan.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.570
A lot of the functionality
they built

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:25.710
for it was only workable in Japan.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:27.120
You could, you know, you
could use a cell phone to pay

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.630
for stuff at convenience stores.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:29.930
But, of course, it
only worked in Japan.

00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:31.290
It was all proprietary protocols.

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.130
The Internet on those
phones was called,

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:34.950
the DOCOMO Network
was called i-Mode,

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:36.880
so you weren't accessing
the open Internet.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.500
You were accessing i-Mode.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.800
And you had to like --

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.570
if you prostrated before the
DOCOMO gods maybe you got

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:42.870
in the i-Mode Menu.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:44.790
If you got in the i-Mode Menu,
then you were a billionaire.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:47.190
It's like -- there were all
these like weird gates to it.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:48.490
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Uh-huh.

00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:51.000
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: So the Internet
in Japan, and I'm by no means

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.420
like an expert on the Internet
in Japan, but it kind of evolved

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:58.590
in this weird way where in --
while we were embracing blogging

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.720
with our -- not with
pseudonyms, you know.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.660
We were ourselves blogging.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:07.250
Blogging became a thing where, you
know, Kettley and others said, oh,

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:09.010
hey, we can publish these folks.

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:12.150
This is to your point about this
being real literature or not,

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:15.160
being recognized as something
that can be made into book form

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.460
that should be out there.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.610
These people should get a platform
outside of just the Internet.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:21.960
Japan kind of evolved in
this kind of funky way.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.100
And you had things like cell phone
novels which a lot of people point

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.770
to which, by the way,
is totally not a thing.

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:29.070
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: So, yeah,

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.080
because American publishers
are totally fascinated

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.380
by that and want it --

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.680
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: It's like --

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: -- oh, we'll do it.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.280
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- for a millisecond.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.690
So one wrote up -- wrote a novel on
a cell phone and like someone wrote

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:38.990
about it for the <i>New York Times </i>.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:40.490
And that was it forever
and ever [laughter].

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:41.790
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Yeah.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:43.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Japan is the -- like
there are two fallacies about Japan.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.450
One is that it's technologically
advanced.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:46.750
It's totally not.

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:50.170 position:56%
Everyone faxes things and, you
know, you go into government offices

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:53.010
and it's like going back
into 1950 here in America.

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.650
And cell phones have not
really evolved at all either.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:56.950
Everyone uses an iPhone now.

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:58.250
That was really weird.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:01.190
iPhones sort of leapfrogging
everything in Japan much

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:03.870
to the sadness of Sony
and Toshiba and Sharp.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:07.020
But then also the cell phone
novels really aren't anything.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.750
Japan is still -- Japan has not --

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.960
they just got the Kindle
two-and-a-half years ago, right?

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.730
So Japan's like six
years behind on Kindle.

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:15.760
The publishers were
really against it.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.000
I've never seen a Kindle in public.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.300
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Hmm.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.600
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Wow.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.900
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: And then iBooks.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.870
I rarely see anyone using
an iPad to read books.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:26.290 position:56%
If they are, they're reading comics.

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:31.280
And that's a pragmatic sort
of choice because comics,

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.640
they're published weekly in these
things that are like 600 pages

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.100
and they look like phonebooks.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.880 position:56%
And so, you know, 10 years ago
you'd have people reading phonebooks

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.180
on the subway.

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.480
And they're very disposable.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.460
You're through the phonebook
in, you know, a couple of hours.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.570
And so if you can do that on your
iPad that's a little bit nicer.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.050
But for the most part
bookstores are thriving.

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:50.920
My neighborhood -- I moved in next

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.220
to my favorite bookstore
in the world.

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:55.680
It's the most profitable
bookstore in Japan right now.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.870
It opened three years ago,
three-and-a-half years ago.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.460
Just as Borders was closing
here, this bookstore was opening.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.760
This massive --

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.060
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Is it
an independent store?

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.360
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: It's not.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.950
It was a DVD rental company --

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:08.250
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Oh.

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:09.550
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- that
started doing bookstores.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:11.130
And they had this like -- this
idea of let's make this kind

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:12.950
of shrine to books and magazines.

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:14.250
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Mm-hmm.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:15.550
Sounds good.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:16.850
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: And it
worked really well.

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:22.590
And so the Internet in Japan and
literature kind of don't overlap

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:23.890
that much in what I've seen.

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:26.100
And one of my good friends,
Motoyuki Shibata is one

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:30.930
of the pre-eminent translators
of American fiction to Japanese.

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:33.440
He runs this great journal
called <i>Monkey Business </i>.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.270
In the States it's
<i>Monkey Business </i>.

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:36.680
In Japan it's just called <i>Monkey </i>.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.010
And nothing is online.

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:42.240
And they have all these
wonderful -- I keep poking him.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.570
I've been poking him for years
to get this stuff online.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:48.850
And there just isn't that
desire to get it up there.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.980 position:56%
So it's a very strange relationship.

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:54.160
But Japan is still very,
very analog on a whole.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.460
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Yes.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.910
Would you like a mic?

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:01.230
&gt;&gt; Well, I'll try to --

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.530
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Yeah.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:03.830
Here comes -- here comes one.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.130
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:07.430
&gt;&gt; I'm fascinated by --

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.410
I'm Bob Darnton [assumed spelling].

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:16.580
I was fascinated by Virginia
Heffernan's characterization

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:21.170
of the <i>New Yorker </i>[laughter]
as a kind of writing that --

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:24.440
from which you have been
liberated to the epitome

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:28.640
of in a way overwriting
by minimizing.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.080
My statistics are probably wrong,

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:38.810
but roughly 310,000 new books were
produced in the U.S. last year

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:41.560
through the normal trade process.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:46.340
And something like 700,000
were self-published.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.640
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
Amazing, yeah.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.900
&gt;&gt; The explosion of
self-publishing is amazing.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:55.070
I mean its authors
are now everywhere.

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:57.760
Everyone is an author
as you were saying,

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.560
and it has a kind of
liberating quality.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.410
So how to formulate
this as a question.

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:06.850
The question is, what
is authorship now?

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:12.210
The <i>New Yorker </i>no longer has
this ultimate seal of approval --

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:13.510
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Mm-hmm.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.550
&gt;&gt; -- and there is this liberating
effect that you described.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.040
It's fascinating to hear.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.240
So where are we going?

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.640
Are we going to have a world
of different kinds of authors

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.540
or everyone being an author?

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.530
You know, it used to be said

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:30.770
that books were written
for the general public.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:33.310
Now they're written
by the general public.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:34.610
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Mm-hmm.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:39.220
&gt;&gt; So how do you understand this
kind of sociological transformation

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.640
of the condition of the author?

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:45.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: I mean to
the extent that the word author has,

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:48.140
you know, authority attached
to it, I do actually --

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:51.690
you know, it's possible that there
will not -- that the terms --

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:55.990
that literature and
authorship still belong

00:39:55.990 --> 00:40:01.390
to analog media and to print books.

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:06.000
So I was in my more Bolshevik
for the Internet days

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.400
when I was a real -- like I didn't
see anything wrong with like,

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.880
you know, the way that
Sovietologists used to be

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:15.410
like Europe will fall and we'll get
rid of all this and -- so that's --

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:19.660
you know, I was like really
impatient with anyone who as

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.760
like I don't want to
use a touchscreen.

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.650
I was just like you better
get used to it [laughter].

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:29.060
I was on a panel with someone who's
not like that, Nicholson Baker,

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:33.950 position:56%
who objects so much to digitization
that he even wanted the card catalog

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:37.730
to be preserved just like --
it's a natural for digitization,

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:39.460
frankly, like a numerical system.

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:42.540
But, you know, he missed
the cards and so forth.

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:46.220
And, you know, I was talking very
excitedly about self-publishing,

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.170
a lot of which, you know --

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:51.700 position:56%
I was talking first about publishing
moving to e-books and how great

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.050
that was and how we weren't
going to lose anything.

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:56.970
And then I was talking
about self-publishing.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:01.010 position:56%
And he said, "Well, would you," you
know, "would you self-publish a book

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.740
and then you'd just do it
in e-book form, right?"

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:05.350
And I suddenly was
like, well, my book,

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:07.410
I want in rock and
leather, you know.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:10.020
I'm like, I want it on a shelf.

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:13.340
And so the author themselves,
you know --

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.560
the reading public seems to
be unwilling to pay much more

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.860
than $10 or $15 for an e-book.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:23.330
The authors will pay $40,000 to
do a print run of their own book.

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:25.640
So the one person that
will pay a lot

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:30.230
for a book is the author
themselves because, you know --

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:32.100 position:56%
my grandfather self-published a book

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.210
for his grandchildren,
beautifully printed.

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:36.490
It was called vanity
publishing in those days.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:41.620
And I'm still not sure
where vanity publishing ends

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.140
and self-publishing begins.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:47.060
I don't know -- I mean,
I'd like to ask Robin

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:50.500
because the KPL was close to --

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:51.800
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Mm-hmm.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.330
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: -- a little
bit close to self-publishing.

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:54.630
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Mm, totally.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:55.930
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:58.860 position:56%
So didn't you feel like you were
minted when it was made a real book?

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.830
You know, that like
that was the moment

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:04.020
that the <i>New Yorker </i>editors
says like you're good enough.

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.380
And like the vanity thing --

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:06.680
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Yes.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:07.980
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: -- has
to disappear at some point.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: I'll tell you is,
actually, so the short answer is no.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:14.220
I probably should have
though, and --

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.560
because here's what I learned
actually in that process.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.900
I didn't know about this because --
well, because, like you, I was --

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.470
and in some ways, in some
respects, I still am such a sort

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:23.770
of Internet patriot, you know?

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:25.070
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:26.700
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: But a native of
and kind of a ardent, you know --

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.000
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.740
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- patriot of the
Internet, the Internet Nation.

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:32.630
And so I didn't realize, and
what I didn't really know

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.670
about as a civilian
user at that point,

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:39.160
was the intellectual supply
chain and really the set

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.030
of social arrangements
that surround, you know,

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:45.850
established publishers and
publishing houses, and libraries,

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:49.240 position:56%
and bookstores, and all the way that
those things are woven together.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.940
And, I mean, I knew that there was
a social component to publishing

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:56.210
because I knew I had had to promote
my own little self-published thing

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:57.510
online --

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:58.810
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yes.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:00.110
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- and
tell people about it,

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:01.410
and the fact that I knew
people online or people

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:03.460
who had read me online was
important to its success.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.150 position:56%
But in retrospect I see that that
was like, you know, if we were going

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:10.120
to draw it on a whiteboard, that
would just be like a little star

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:13.210 position:56%
with a few spokes, and then I was
suddenly placed in this other system

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:16.650
that was like a dense, rich mesh --

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:17.950
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:19.250
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- because
it's so old and so established

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:22.210
and it has all these like
interesting feelings and senses

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:23.510
of authority built into it.

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:24.810
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:26.110
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: So I think --

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:27.410
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: And you're talking

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:28.710
about booksellers and
salespeople and --

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:30.010
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Exactly, exactly.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:31.310
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: --
reviewers and the whole --

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:32.610
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: NPR.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:33.910
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: -- the
whole old infrastructure.

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:35.210
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:36.510
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- agrarians
like the whole system.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:37.810
I mean, it's like -- it's
a very impressive system

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:39.110
and a very powerful system.

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:40.410
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Right.

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:42.320
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: And so, I
didn't actually understand

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.620
that I was being [inaudible] --

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.920
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Oh, yeah.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.220
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- kind
of sucked up into that.

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.520
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.820
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: And it was
only after the book came out

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:52.370
and I like experienced the rush
of that, very sort of slow,

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:53.710
you know, quiet rush from that.

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:57.620
That was like, oh, this
is a powerful thing.

00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.970
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Teah, yeah.

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:00.270
Yeah.

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:02.520
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: I just
want to interject something

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.470
about that question and --
Malcolm Cowley once said that,

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:09.610
"A writer is somebody
who has readers."

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:13.840
Which I go back and forth
in thinking that's very wise

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.570
and very cynical because
if you've written it

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:19.640
and no one reads it,
are you a writer?

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:24.890 position:56%
But one of the things that's -- from
vanity publishing to self-publishing

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:34.350
to actual, you know, Random House
publishing, is that the authors

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:37.050
who get the most readers
are the ones who are --

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:40.050
there are different opportunities,
let's put it that way,

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:44.550
to get lots of readers, and for
writers to get lots of readers.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:48.150
And that -- it's almost
that that's so --

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:51.370
that's very destabilized right
now because it used to be

00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:53.870
that the <i>New Yorker</i>
would say read this

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:59.980
or Bennett Cerf would say read
this, and those -- even though --

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:02.590
I love Robin describing the system

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:05.650
because it's a very
robust notion of it.

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:06.950
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yes.

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:08.440
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: But
the levers are changing.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.740
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Yeah.

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.040
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.340
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: But one
quick thing is Paul Graham,

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:18.550
who started Y Combinator, which
is like just a incubation VC

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:20.270
in San Francisco who
has an enormous amount

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:24.060
of intellectual authority and, you
know, is this like runic source

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.010
of wisdom about how to make money.

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:28.940
He [laughter] -- I
talked to him recently

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:33.480
and he had just redesigned
his bio because, you know,

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.510
a person like him, the same way
that, you know, Warren Buffett,

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:39.860
half of his mystique is his
prescription for making money

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:41.870
that he writes and
codifies in books.

00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:44.680
And then other half is how
he does make the money.

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.610
And Paul Graham had
just changed his bio

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:51.710
to say essayist something
and venture capitalist.

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:53.010
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Hmm.

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.590
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: And he
was so hard to get on the phone

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:57.740
as a journalist and he was like
so reluctant to tell me anything.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:01.070
And he's English and he's kind
of intimidating, and at the end

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:03.770
of the call he said, "Do you
think I could get one of my essays

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:05.070
in the <i>New Yorker </i>[laughter]?"

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:09.880
Like that is still an
aspiration, you know [laughter]?

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:14.060
And [laughter], you know, it's like
me wanting the Moroccan leather.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:15.360
He's so rich.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.660
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: He's so rich.

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:17.960
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
So he -- yeah, he does --

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.260
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: He
doesn't need anything.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:20.560
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Right.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.860
You would think he
doesn't need anything.

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.160
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Yeah.

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.460
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: But
you cannot buy your way

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:25.760
into the <i>New Yorker </i>and that is --

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.060
makes it covetable
by the Elon Musk's

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.360
of the world and by
the people who --

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.950
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: And you see this
fettishtization [sic] of that --

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:31.250
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Right.

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:32.550
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- rolled in a lot of
the new media startups that have --

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:33.850
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Right.

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:35.150 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- popped up recently.

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:36.450
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
And by the way,

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:37.750
thank God for the Eastern
establishment

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:39.050
like including the Library of
Congress would have no authority

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:40.350
with those Silicon Valley guys.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.460
They would just like move to Mars
and knock us all out [laughter].

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.070
We have to constantly --

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:45.500
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: I think
it's still happening.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.800
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
Yeah, you're right.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.570 position:56%
But we have to constantly be like --

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:49.940
but there's still something
very important

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.240
about the <i>New Yorker </i>[laughter].

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:56.390
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Sure, of course.

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:57.690
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
Oh, yeah, please, yes.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:58.990
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: You
may have the last word.

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:00.290
&gt;&gt; Oh, no.

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:02.220
I don't want -- but this
is apropos of the DPLA.

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:08.800
So I think the DPLA is developing
a real interest in authorship -

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.100
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.400
&gt;&gt; -- and has a role in this.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.700
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Mm-hmm.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:14.000
&gt;&gt; And one way this can
happen is through something

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.870
that you may not know of
called the Authors Alliance.

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:21.780
So we have created a kind
of voluntary organization

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:27.470
in which authors give over
the use of their copyrights

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:30.420
for open access publishing.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.890
And the DPLA can make
these books available.

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:38.490
It's, I think, crucial for authors
to understand that their books,

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:41.740
if you're talking about
money, which you did bring up,

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.530
cease to sell very rapidly.

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:45.830
What is the --

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:47.130
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Right.

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:48.430
&gt;&gt; -- commercial life
expectancy of a book?

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:51.520
It depends on the field and so
on, but often weeks, months.

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.230
Rarely more than years.

00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:56.320
So why can't we have a
system in which all kinds

00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:01.780
of authors make available
on open access their books.

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:05.500
They're not sacrificing anything
because they don't make money

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.010
on the certain point, but
they're getting something.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:10.510
Mainly, readers and
access to readership.

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:11.910
So that sounds like a commercial.

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:13.210
But I really feel [laughter] --

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.510
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: That
was a good one.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:15.820
&gt;&gt; -- the DPLA has a role to play

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:20.540
in this very interesting new
landscape you've described so well.

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:21.840
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Great.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.140
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
Yeah, I liked that.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.740
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Are we done?

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.130
So I don't know whether -- if
you can answer this quickly,

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:33.940
but I was just wondering if each
of you had a piece of advice

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:40.820
for a young writer, a young writer,
aspiring author, coming up today.

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:48.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: I do think I have
come to believe that what books are,

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.330
you know, of all sizes and
shapes, digital and analog,

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:54.940
is a set of social arrangements
and social relationships.

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.240
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Right.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:00.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: And so I do think
the most valuable thing you could do

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:03.020
is start to build that
little web of your own.

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:04.320
It sounds -- I don't know.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:08.510
It sounds urbanal and cliched to
say because we just talk so much

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:10.810 position:56%
about marketing and
self-promotion and things like that.

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:14.910
But it's still the truth, I
think, that the gap between --

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:18.370
talking about readers -- the
gap between like zero readers

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:22.440
and 15 readers, like real
readers, not drive-by people

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.380 position:56%
who found something on the Internet
and then moved on to the next thing.

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.210
But people who are
like, oh, I like this.

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:30.190
This is my kind of thing.

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:35.260
Like if you can get from zero to
15 or 35, that's the challenge,

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.880
because if you have 35
you can get 60 [laughter].

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:40.320 position:56%
If you got 60 you could probably get
200, and then, I mean, forget it --

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.620
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Right.

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:42.920
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- you know.

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:44.220
Then you're on your way.

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:45.520
So I would say it's -- and it's --

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.360
but it's hard to do because
35 readers, you know?

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:48.950
And like you know all of them.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:50.860
And they're -- like half are
related to you or whatever.

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.380
That's not the vision --

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:53.850
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Well,
you got to start somewhere.

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:55.150
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: That's
not -- you have to.

00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:56.450
I guess that's what I would say.

00:49:56.450 --> 00:50:01.750
I'd be like start an
e-mail list, add 35 people,

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:04.710
and know that that's the
first like foundation stone

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:06.040
of whatever's going to come --

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: That's smart.

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:08.640
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: -- because
it has to be by definition.

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.940
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.390
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: It's funny how e-mail
feels like the fresh new place.

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:12.690
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Mm, mm-hmm.

00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:13.990
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Right?

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:15.290
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:16.590
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Like I like
getting -- it's Sunday night.

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:17.890
You talk about the Sunday night
e-mail rush, the mailing list.

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:20.460
Sunday night comes and like all
of my favorite things come --

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:21.760
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.060
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- from
all over the world

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:24.360
from all these different
writers, and it's very weird.

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:25.660
It's like our --

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:26.960
&gt;&gt;

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.260
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
And they're written.

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:29.560
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: It's
kind of like our --

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:30.860
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: The
other thing is they're written.

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.160
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Yeah.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.460
Like people take it
really seriously.

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:34.760
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.060
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: You know.

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.360
Like a working library, you know?

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:38.660
When she sends out --

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:39.960
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Virginia,
do you have a newsletter?

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.260
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: I don't.

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.560
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: So -- okay.

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:43.860
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: And
newsletters are it, so --

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.160
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Yeah.

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.460
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
-- I don't know.

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Craig and Robin do.

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.060
They're very good.

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:50.360
You should subscribe.

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.660
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan:
They're really good.

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:52.960
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: And the Working
Library has a great one, too,

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.260
that comes out like
once every six months.

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.560
But when it does, it's like --

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.860
&gt;&gt; Robin Sloan: Yeah.

00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.160
&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Yeah.

00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.460
They spend so much time
on it, so much love.

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:00.760
&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: So the book
is called <i>Magic and Loss , my book.</i>

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.060
<i>And -- coming out in June.</i>

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:03.360
<i>And the magic is what I described
as the sort of Bolshevik thing.</i>

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.660
<i>The loss is, I think, the loss --</i>

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.920
<i>the sense of grief
that all of us feel,</i>

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:10.740
<i>not just like culture
elites or, you know,</i>

00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:15.300
<i>people left out of the digital
divide in this digital revolution.</i>

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:22.340
<i>And I now believe that a
young writer, if maybe --</i>

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:25.940
<i>this sounds like jargon, but to
get in touch with the part of her</i>

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:29.890
<i>that feels -- that
resists digitization.</i>

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:33.030
<i>So, you know, the
-- like you talked</i>

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:36.030
<i>about the social relationships,
we've had, you know,</i>

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:38.290
<i>an online relationship for a while.</i>

00:51:38.290 --> 00:51:42.710
<i>But when I saw you, it's so funny
because the Internet has jacked</i>

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:45.600
<i>up the values of personal
interactions.</i>

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:49.360
<i>So it's like, you know, we could
just be meeting as two panelists</i>

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.080
<i>who kind of knew each other's work.</i>

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:54.310
<i>But instead it's like, you
know, we hugged each other hello.</i>

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:55.610
<i>You know, we've never
met in person.</i>

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:58.510
<i>Because like suddenly the
human body is like, you know,</i>

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:00.500
<i>it's like the critically
and scariest says</i>

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:05.590
<i>like we think imagination is so
great and then you compare the dry,</i>

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:09.960
<i>you know, imagination to like
the sensory emotional world</i>

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.100
<i>of like bodies, you know?</i>

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:15.750
<i>The Navy is training people
with sextants and compasses</i>

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:20.460
<i>and celestial navigation now
because they fear an attack on GPS.</i>

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:23.510
<i>If we make all of our interactions
of the physical world based</i>

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:27.790
<i>in abstract maps, then we,
you know, have lost the role</i>

00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:31.220
<i>of like magnets and
stars and so get in touch</i>

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:36.450
<i>with earlier technologies like
printing and find the part of you</i>

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:40.510
<i>that is, you know, is -- that
loves leather or loves live music</i>

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:46.970 position:56%
<i>and not mp3's or whatever because
not only will that affect the medium</i>

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:49.830
<i>that you work in but also
that's your story to tell.</i>

00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:51.340
<i>That's your story, you know?</i>

00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:55.810
<i>That's that particular
kind of exquisite pain is,</i>

00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:57.670
<i>I think, a wonderful narrative.</i>

00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:59.350
<i>At least I can't get enough of it.</i>

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:01.190
<i>&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: Hmm.</i>

00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:06.280
<i>I would just say, sort of
to your point, Virginia,</i>

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:09.670
<i>like don't be afraid of technology.</i>

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:13.380
<i>And, in fact, the most interesting
intersections, I think, of writing</i>

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:15.630
<i>or creating or authorship
today are happening</i>

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:18.980
<i>with these weird fuzzy
boundaries of tech and printing.</i>

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:22.310
<i>One of my favorite examples
is a photographer/artist,</i>

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:24.640
<i>Mishka Henner, a British
photographer.</i>

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:28.030
<i>And he's kind of come to light
in the last five or six years</i>

00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:33.120
<i>because he started printing
out Google Map satellite photos.</i>

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.420
<i>Like that was his thing.</i>

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:38.040
<i>And so like he'd go and find
all of the U.S. hidden army bases</i>

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.440
<i>around the world on Google
Maps, and then print that out</i>

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.310
<i>and call it like 51 bases.</i>

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:44.950
<i>Or doing other things
with print on demand.</i>

00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:46.250
<i>And it was funny.</i>

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:48.840
<i>It was like the printing
of the stuff --</i>

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:52.220
<i>like he'd collate these
collections of photos.</i>

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:55.400 position:56%
<i>But it was the printing that
allowed like the Tate to acquire it.</i>

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.300
<i>And the Tate acquiring
it was the thing</i>

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.290
<i>that allowed him to
be a real artist.</i>

00:53:59.290 --> 00:54:00.590
<i>&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Mm-hmm.</i>

00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:02.140
<i>&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: And that allowed
him all these other affordances.</i>

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.010
<i>But it was only because he was
willing to play in this kind</i>

00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:06.070
<i>of space of like well,
what is photography?</i>

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:07.870
<i>Well, photography is, you know,</i>

00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:09.520
<i>being interested in
light and imagery.</i>

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.750
<i>And, well, what if I use
Google Maps to find these things</i>

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:15.720
<i>or Google Street View to find,
you know, people that are kind</i>

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:18.410
<i>of accidently in these
collections of data?</i>

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:21.480
<i>And if I take that, draw a box
around it, give it the boundaries,</i>

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.680
<i>and then use cheap print on
demand to put it out in the world</i>

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.140
<i>as an artifact -- like that's --</i>

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:29.980
<i>it sounds simple but that's
actually quite a few like kind</i>

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:34.110
<i>of like jumps to make and
willingness to experiment.</i>

00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:37.110
<i>And I think that like
his body of work</i>

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:40.770
<i>and the recognition he's got is
a great example of what happens</i>

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:42.120
<i>when you start to
play in that space.</i>

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.560
<i>&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: I love it.</i>

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:45.550
<i>&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: So I think there's --</i>

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:46.850
<i>&gt;&gt; Virginia Heffernan: Yeah.</i>

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:48.150
<i>&gt;&gt; Craig Mod: -- lots
of opportunity there.</i>

00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:49.450
<i>&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnes: Thank
you guys so much.</i>

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:50.750
<i>We could go for another
hour-and-a-half,</i>

00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:52.550
<i>but we're already over time.</i>

00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:56.540
