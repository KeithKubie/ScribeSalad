MING TAN: Well, good
morning, my friends.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.290
My name is Ming, and I'm the
jolly good fellow of Google.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.870
During my long tenure in Google,
I have hosted many luminaries,

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.320
and they all have one thing
in common, they're all adults.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.560
And adults are boring.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.680
But not today, my friends.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.420
Today my very special
guest, Vivienne Harr,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.020
is only 10 years old.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.500
At the age of ten
she has already

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.510
been working to save
the world for two years.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.030
And she's already given
more money to charity

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.500
than most adults have
given in their lifetimes.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.240
And she's already an inspiration
for millions of people,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.750
including myself.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.210
When I grow up, I want to
be a lot more like her.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.140
When Vivienne was
eight years old,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.780
she learned that there was
child slavery in the world.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.680
And she was deeply
troubled by it.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.990
So she decided to make a
lemonade stand every day

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.570
until she raised $100,000
to end child slavery.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.500
And she succeeded
in raising $100,000.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.340
So two years later,
she and her family,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.900
her lovely family
is here, has started

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.879
a Make a Stand-- Make
a Stand Lemon-Aid.

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:22.920
See, I have to read this.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.830
I told you, adults are boring.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.570
A social impact brand that
supports Vivienne's vision

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.790
of a world where all 18
million enslaved children

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.730
are free and safe.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.360
Vivienne has won the George H.
W. Bush Point of Light award.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.160
She was recognized as one
of 50 most influential

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.130
philanthropists in America.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.670
She once rang the
opening bell for NASDAQ.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.910
She is the youngest person
ever featured at TED.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.067
And she's just an
amazing human being.

00:01:54.067 --> 00:01:55.900
And with that my friends,
please give a warm

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.513
welcome to Vivienne Harr.

00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:02.826
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:02.826 --> 00:02:04.120
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.790
-So serendipitous the
way all of this occurred.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.110
Alex and I were up on a
date weekend in Sonoma.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.560
And we were drinking
wine and eating cheese

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.530
and blissfully unaware of a
lot of the evils in the world.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.900
And we stroll into
this gallery, and there

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.000
was one photo in particular
of these two boys,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.225
roughly my daughter's age, who
have these giant rocks strapped

00:02:24.225 --> 00:02:25.570
to their heads.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.760
Alex starts weeping
uncontrollably, shaking,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.890
thinking that that
could be our kids.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.920
-They go out and they work.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.190
And they get really sad.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.800
And they cry.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.740
And whenever they cry
and try and run away,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.170
bad things happen.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.460
And it's like
living a nightmare.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.800
-She said I want to
free 500 of these kids.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.900
And it was this
gigantic, audacious goal.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.170
And we're thinking, OK,
wow, talk to us about this.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.884
-And we said, well,
that's $150,000.

00:02:56.884 --> 00:02:58.050
How are we going to do that?

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.310
And she said, I could
tell my lemonade.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.710
-When Vivian first started
her lemonade stand,

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.800
she was charging $2 a cup.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.670
And we're getting nowhere.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.304
She wants to raise $150,000,
and we're $81 into it.

00:03:11.304 --> 00:03:13.970
I said, Vivienne, we're going to
have to do something different,

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.710
because we're not
making any headway.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.855
-We made it free and pay
what's in your heart.

00:03:17.855 --> 00:03:22.539
And it just started
going up and up and up.

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:24.330
-And she wants you to
make a stand with her

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.240
for a very special cause.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.250
-A little girl
from the North Bay

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.970
is fighting against
child slavery.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.069
-She's making her
mark on the world.

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:38.780
-I am Vivienne.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.650
I am nine.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.026
I have been making a stand
for 322 days in a row.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.960
-People fall into slavery,
not because they're willing

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.850
and not because
they're stupid, it's

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.350
because they've been lied to.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.310
-It exists everywhere.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.454
Every country is
afflicted with slavery.

00:03:59.454 --> 00:04:02.260
-I thought how could this be?

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.770
Wasn't this already taking
care of in the 1800s?

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.060
-Even if you have
some trepidation,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.010
all your choices are bad.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.744
And so you say, OK.

00:04:12.744 --> 00:04:14.736
And then your child is gone.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.690
-With something as
simple as a bar chocolate

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.305
or a cup of lemonade, you can
reach halfway across the world

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:29.640
and help a family
out of poverty,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.810
help a kid stay in school,
and help keep hope alive.

00:04:35.612 --> 00:04:37.168
What we do makes
a difference What

00:04:37.168 --> 00:04:39.350
we do with our lives
makes a difference.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.705
That's a blessing, that
what we do matters.

00:04:59.525 --> 00:05:01.010
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.190
VIVIENNE HARR: Hi, everyone.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.490
I'm Vivienne and I'm 10.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.860
And I'm the founder and chief
inspiration officer-- wait,

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.600
before I say this,
can you all hear me?

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.250
OK, and I'm the founder and
chief inspiration officer

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.550
of Make a Stand.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.040
I may be small, but
I have a big vision,

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.740
a vision of a world where
anyone, anywhere can

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.590
make a stand
wherever they stand.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.500
I'd like to thank a few
people before I begin.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.550
I'd like to thank Ming Tan
for making this all happen.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.260
And I'd like to thank
Google for making

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.060
a technology for humanity.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.550
We have that in common.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.326
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.975
VIVIENNE HARR: This is my
talk called Be One Person.

00:05:52.975 --> 00:05:54.370
Me and my dad came up with that.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.430
In 2012 I saw a photo
that would change my life.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.500
This is the photo I saw-- you
guys saw it in the trailer--

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.210
but I saw this at a gallery.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.620
And it just made me so
sad because I didn't even

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.000
know this existed.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.050
And when my parents
showed it to me,

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.230
I didn't know what to think.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.070
So I said I can set
up a lemonade stand,

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.720
because at the time
I was eight and I

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.440
didn't know how to make
an app or anything.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.070
But now I do, so-- well not
me personally, but-- so, yeah,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.650
I just think it's so sad.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.500
And I just wanted to help.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.650
I thought slavery ended
with Abraham Lincoln,

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.560
but I was wrong.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.940
I decided to be a voice for the
18 million kids without one.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:55.545
That's me.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.740
Oh boy.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.220
So I set up my lemonade stand.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.750
It was the only business
experience I had.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.550
I decided to make a
stand, rain or shine,

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.255
for 365 days in a row
to end child slavery.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.630
I didn't know what
would happen, but I

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.850
knew we were facing in
the right direction.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.520
When you face in
the right direction,

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.050
you know you're
going to do well.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.932
And you know that what
you're doing is right.

00:07:29.932 --> 00:07:30.890
And that's what I knew.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.020
That's Turner, he was
three at the time.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.090
Turner, that's you.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:47.190
So he was grumpy and some days
were really harder than others.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.830
And he was just sitting
there with an empty bowl that

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.163
was filled with cheddar bunnies.

00:07:51.163 --> 00:07:54.569
And he was like, this
is-- no one is coming.

00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:56.110
And I'm like, Turner,
they will come.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:56.776
Just be patient.

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:58.890
And he's like, OK, fine.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.360
And so he's sitting
there and he's like--

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.590
and then I'm like, Turner,
I want to thank you.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.400
And he said, sure, Viv.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.250
And so we did it together and
then a few customers showed up

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.660
and he got a little
happier, right, Turner?

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.470
But we never gave up.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:24.430
Time Square was amazingly cold.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.040
We were out there
for like four hours

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.260
selling freezing cold
lemonade that had been-- I

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.190
guess it was just so
cold because the streets

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.210
were really cold.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.668
And they were making
it freezinger.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.330
After 173 days,
would you believe it,

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.250
we were in Times Square
freezing our heads off.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.760
We raised over $100,000
to end child slavery.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.450
And we kept on going
and bottled the hope.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.130
I like to think of
that as my bottles are

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.892
saying I'm looking at you, Coke.

00:09:04.892 --> 00:09:07.832
And I'm going to get you.

00:09:07.832 --> 00:09:09.040
I'm going grow as big as you.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.580
I'm going to get you, Coke.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.070
And the lem-gems are the eyes.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.422
I'm looking at you, Coke.

00:09:13.422 --> 00:09:14.650
I'm looking at you.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:15.700
We're going to beat you.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.200
Big things have very, very,
very small beginnings.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.100
So this is ringing the
bell at the Twitter IPO.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.970
It was nerve wracking, because
at the time I got nervous.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.542
It was really scary and I didn't
even have to say anything.

00:09:38.542 --> 00:09:39.750
I just had to press a button.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.140
And I'm like, what if I
don't press the right button.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.760
That was me with everyone.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.370
And today we rang the
bell for hope and freedom.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.880
And just as people were
thinking, no, I can't.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.260
I can't.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.890
Actually, you can.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.502
AUDIENCE: Is that
Captain Picard?

00:10:00.502 --> 00:10:03.540
VIVIENNE HARR: Yes it is.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.180
Yeah, I know, right?

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.385
On this crazy journey I learned
five not-so-crazy things.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:16.040
One, compassion is not
compassion without action.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.060
That basically explains
the whole slide.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.430
I don't even have anything
else to say about that one.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:28.070
Two, if you put your feet in
the right place and stand firm

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:33.070
you will do good things,
no, great things.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.410
Three, if you can dream
it, you can do it.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.410
This is a quote by Walt Disney.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.410
And best last name
and best quote ever.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.170
Four, dream big and you'll
achieve dreaming your dream.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.310
Oh, and something I
have to say about this.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.213
No offense to grown ups, but you
guys kind of see the obstacles.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.590
And sometimes you
just need to do it.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.060
And that's what we kids do.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.430
So a little advice from kids.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.730
Five, you don't have to be
big or powerful to change

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.260
the world.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.400
Now what?

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.150
OK, I believe people are good.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.820
I believe each of us
wants to have a voice

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.240
and make a difference.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.446
I believe in technology
for humanity.

00:11:30.446 --> 00:11:32.320
And I believe if you
give people a great tool

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.403
they will do great things.

00:11:33.403 --> 00:11:36.030
Sorry, I had
something in my eye.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.070
I believe, do you?

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.010
Make a Stand is a simple,
mobile technology that

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.435
helps people do great things.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.600
It's crowd-funding re-imagined,
this is mobile funding.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.610
Our vision is a world
where anyone, anywhere can

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.190
make a stand
wherever they stand.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.030
Our mission is at
least 10 million people

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.890
making at least $1 billion
of impact every year.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.730
So, Google,

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.690
AUDIENCE: Yes?

00:12:16.676 --> 00:12:18.795
VIVIENNE HARR: I have
a question for you.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.950
Will you help us
create a better world

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:29.434
where anyone, anywhere can make
a stand wherever they stand?

00:12:29.434 --> 00:12:31.694
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:12:31.694 --> 00:12:35.340
VIVIENNE HARR: If so, please
see me after the talk.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.346
Thank you, ever so much.

00:12:38.346 --> 00:12:42.792
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.428
MING TAN: Now everybody's
going to want to adopt you.

00:12:49.428 --> 00:12:52.030
Sorry, parents.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.630
Get in line.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.064
Anybody have any
questions for Vivienne?

00:12:59.064 --> 00:13:00.730
AUDIENCE: So, first
I want to thank you.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.380
And as a mom of kids who
are younger than you,

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.290
I hope that they become
like you someday.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:07.541
So you're a real inspiration.

00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:08.040
Thank you.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.687
And thank you guys, I see your
family and your brother, who

00:13:11.687 --> 00:13:14.020
I know is doing a lot to help
and doing his own thing as

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:14.520
well.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.380
So that's great.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.920
My question for you is, have
you had the opportunity yet

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.790
to meet any of the
people that you helped?

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:26.000
VIVIENNE HARR: No, but
I will be going to Nepal

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.480
sometime next year.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.384
AUDIENCE: But you did
meet some of them.

00:13:29.384 --> 00:13:33.010
VIVIENNE HARR: Oh,
and I did-- did I?

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.850
I didn't free them,
But I did meet

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:41.520
some people who have
been freed in Dallas.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.525
Basically yes and no.

00:13:43.525 --> 00:13:45.490
AUDIENCE: What was
that like for you?

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.970
VIVIENNE HARR: It was good.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.829
And it was happy and
sad because it was good

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:53.120
that they're out of slavery
and sad that they were ever

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.620
in slavery.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.300
AUDIENCE: So where does the
money go that you raise?

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.120
How did you decide?

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.350
Because as we spoke
before your presentation,

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:06.120
I do my own project to end
child slave labor on cacao

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.114
plantations in West
Central African countries.

00:14:08.114 --> 00:14:10.030
One of the hardest things
for me to figure out

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.640
was where does the
money go and how

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.390
do I make sure that kids
stay out of slavery.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.990
VIVIENNE HARR: So I give
it to seven really amazing

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.690
organizations.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.690
My dad knows,
actually, all of them.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.740
But I don't.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.180
I know some.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:41.890
There's Free the Slaves and GEMS
and the Nepal Youth Foundation.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.160
And that's it.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.680
That's all I know.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.210
AUDIENCE: I don't usually cry.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:49.930
And you have me bawling.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.570
And I couldn't be prouder to
be in the same room as you.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.200
And what I'd like to
know, because sometimes I

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.410
feel that there are a lot of
problems in the world that

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.590
are hard to tackle but you
clearly have dreamed so big,

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.920
what keeps you going?

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.060
What mantra or what
saying do you really

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.010
believe in every day?

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.850
VIVIENNE HARR:
Well, I believe just

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.990
never give up and keep going.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.610
And I really want to
end child slavery.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.630
And also I want to set
up an animal sanctuary

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.640
to help animals that were
in slavery and stuff,

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.770
because I've always
really loved animals.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.030
And so my friend is going
to help me with that

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.950
and help me with child
slavery and stuff.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.520
So that's what keeps me going--
because it's the right thing

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.420
to do.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.000
And I believe in it.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.300
And it's fun.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.810
And it's rewarding.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.480
And it makes you really happy.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.010
Instead of some
job that doesn't.

00:15:57.447 --> 00:16:01.375
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.670
MING TAN: This book
available over at the back.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.710
I think-- Vivienne you'll
be doing book signing?

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:10.543
VIVIENNE HARR: Yeah.

00:16:10.543 --> 00:16:12.760
MING TAN: So there
will be book signing.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.905
Also, for those on
YouTube, this is available

00:16:14.905 --> 00:16:15.780
where books are sold.

00:16:20.795 --> 00:16:21.830
Check out the website.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.920
Let's give a warm thank
you to Vivienne Harr.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.170
[APPLAUSE]
