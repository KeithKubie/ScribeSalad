00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.945
Now directly, the physics body itself exposes a function that allows us to set

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:08.762
a linear velocity vector on it. The trick here however is properly constructing

00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:12.142
this velocity vector such that it does the right thing as the physics engine is

00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:17.237
moving. Now your job during this next quiz is to properly fill in the move_dir

00:00:17.237 --> 00:00:22.462
vector with input from the user. Such that setLinearVelocity will do the right

00:00:22.462 --> 00:00:24.810
thing over the next few frames.
