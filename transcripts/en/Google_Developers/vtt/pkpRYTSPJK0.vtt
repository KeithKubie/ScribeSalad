[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:13.570
FEMALE SPEAKER: JackThreads
is a [INAUDIBLE] destination

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.580
for men's fashion.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.720
I think everyone here is
unique in so many ways.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.222
We have such a crazy,
hodgepodge of people here.

00:00:21.222 --> 00:00:22.680
MALE SPEAKER: We
understand so much

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.180
about our guys'
needs, the demand

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.880
that they have for truly
personalized communication.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.470
Almost 70% of the interactions
that we have with our audience

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.189
are mobile.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.050
More than 50% of
our transactions

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.690
are driven through mobile.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.180
We've leaned in really
hard to build best-in-class

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.390
mobile experiences,
where every day

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.090
you don't know what
you're going to find.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.060
We want to feel
like the smallest

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.130
big company in the world.

00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:55.480
LUIS: There's 1.2 billion
people in the world learning

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.760
a foreign language.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.260
The majority of these people,
they're learning to get a job.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.550
And they are of low
socioeconomic conditions.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.590
My views on
education have always

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.730
been influenced by where I
come from which is Guatemala.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.340
So Guatemala's a
very poor country.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.260
I wanted to come up
with a way to teach

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.776
languages that
was entirely free.

00:01:12.776 --> 00:01:14.400
Today, Duolingo is
the most popular way

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.730
to languages in the world.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.350
We have 30 million students.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.680
There are more people learning
a language on Duolingo

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.590
than in the entire US
public school system.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.220
85% of the people use
it through an app.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.900
Over the next 20
years, education

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.850
is going to fundamentally shift.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.510
Smartphones are going to
allow us to bring education

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.655
to the people who don't
have access to it.

00:01:40.554 --> 00:01:41.970
FEMALE SPEAKER:
We had seen Andres

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.470
a couple times during our PE
period, studying the track.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.070
And we didn't realize it
took so much work to actually

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.365
get to near the school.

00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:51.740
FEMALE SPEAKER:
They have to live

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.210
through darkness every day.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.669
No one can really feel it and
they take seeing for granted.

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:57.210
FEMALE SPEAKER: We
were like, why not

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.050
create something that will
actually make a difference?

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.875
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello
Navi will use GPS

00:02:01.875 --> 00:02:04.330
and a location
sensor so that way

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.000
you can have a specific point
for each of his classes.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.740
HELLO NAVI: Where
do you want to go?

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.834
FEMALE SPEAKER: The coding, it
took weeks just to get it down.

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:15.042
FEMALE SPEAKER: If you mess
up one little tiny thing,

00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:17.470
it can mess up the whole app.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.394
FEMALE SPEAKER: We made a
difference not just to him,

00:02:20.394 --> 00:02:24.250
but to the many others who
will eventually use this app.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.710
ANDRES: They care about me.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.910
That's why they made
this app happen.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.290
I never got to hear the
word, "inspiration,"

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.110
in my whole entire life.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.560
It made me proud.
