00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.803
- [Voiceover] So if you
are like most of us,

00:00:01.803 --> 00:00:05.338
your body probably sweats when it is warm,

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:06.618
when your environment is warm,

00:00:06.618 --> 00:00:08.731
and you probably realize that it sweats

00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:10.316
in order to cool itself,

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:12.632
in order to keep the
body from overheating.

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:14.400
But you probably have wondered,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.558
"Well, how does this work?

00:00:15.558 --> 00:00:17.142
"What is actually causing that?"

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:20.413
And the simple answer is it's happening--

00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:22.283
or what's allowing your body to cool--

00:00:22.283 --> 00:00:24.874
the chemical process,
I guess you could say

00:00:24.874 --> 00:00:26.276
the physical process is happening

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:27.881
is evaporative cooling.

00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:31.457
Evaporative cooling.

00:00:31.457 --> 00:00:34.170
Which is really the
notion that as that water,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.120
those beats of sweat vaporize,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.132
it's actually gonna cool your arm down.

00:00:38.132 --> 00:00:40.062
But that begs the question,

00:00:40.062 --> 00:00:41.951
how does that actually happen?

00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:44.247
And so let's just
visualize it a little bit.

00:00:44.247 --> 00:00:46.482
Let's just say that is your arm,

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:49.245
so this is your arm right
over here, so let's...

00:00:49.245 --> 00:00:50.566
I don't draw my best...

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.659
Draw a quick arm right over here,

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.869
so okay, that's your arm,
and it's got beads of sweat.

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:57.047
Let's say it's a hot environment

00:00:57.047 --> 00:01:00.135
it's got beads of sweat right over here.

00:01:00.135 --> 00:01:02.370
And if we were to zoom in on that sweat,

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.849
if we were to zoom in on that sweat,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.815
we would see the
constituent water molecules

00:01:07.815 --> 00:01:10.842
and sweat is mainly H20.

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:12.122
It is mainly water.

00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:14.581
Now when we talk about the
temperature of something,

00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:16.673
we're talking about the
average kinetic energy.

00:01:16.673 --> 00:01:17.973
Each of the individual molecules,

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:19.477
they all have different kinetic energies.

00:01:19.477 --> 00:01:20.940
They're all bouncing
around in different ways

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.154
and transferring the momentum
in all different ways.

00:01:23.154 --> 00:01:25.288
And so you can imagine a reality.

00:01:25.288 --> 00:01:27.218
Maybe this one has a
fairly high kinetic energy.

00:01:27.218 --> 00:01:28.295
It's moving in that direction.

00:01:28.295 --> 00:01:29.839
This one has a lower kinetic energy.

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:30.931
moving in this direction.

00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:32.800
Maybe this one has a
medium kinetic energy,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.958
moving in this direction.

00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.254
Maybe this one has a
really high kinetic energy

00:01:36.254 --> 00:01:38.143
moving in that direction.

00:01:38.143 --> 00:01:40.012
And so we've already talked about

00:01:40.012 --> 00:01:41.614
how hydrogen bonds in water

00:01:41.614 --> 00:01:43.117
between the partially negative end

00:01:43.117 --> 00:01:44.275
and the partially positive ends.

00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:45.860
That's what keeps the water together

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.135
as these things move past
and flow past each other.

00:01:48.135 --> 00:01:49.781
What gives the water its cohesion

00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:51.528
is these hydrogen bonds.

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:52.890
But if all of a sudden--

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.657
remember, we're talking about
the average kinetic energy--

00:01:54.657 --> 00:01:56.425
but even if we're at room temperature,

00:01:56.425 --> 00:01:58.985
and the average kinetic
energy isn't so hot,

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:00.955
you might have individual particles,

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:02.540
individual molecules that actually have

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.942
quite a high kinetic energy

00:02:03.942 --> 00:02:05.141
and if they're in the right place,

00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:08.493
if they're near the surface
and their kinetic energy

00:02:08.493 --> 00:02:12.130
is high enough to break the hydrogen bonds

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.202
with neighboring water molecules,

00:02:14.202 --> 00:02:16.437
and to overcome the
pressure in the atmosphere,

00:02:16.437 --> 00:02:19.119
so let's say that this is,
these are just gas molecules

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:20.683
in the atmosphere here.

00:02:20.683 --> 00:02:22.938
But it's enough to break
free and none of these things

00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:24.462
bounce into it and force it back

00:02:24.462 --> 00:02:25.702
to form hydrogen bonds.

00:02:25.702 --> 00:02:29.034
This thing could actually break free

00:02:29.034 --> 00:02:32.284
and enter and become water vapor.

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:34.317
And become in its gaseous state.

00:02:34.317 --> 00:02:36.978
And it'll be so far apart
from other water molecules

00:02:36.978 --> 00:02:39.091
that it won't form hydrogen bonds anymore.

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:43.763
So by vaporizing or by this
process of evaporation,

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:44.495
what's happening?

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:48.761
Well if your highest
kinetic energy particles

00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:52.012
or some of your highest
kinetic energy particles

00:02:52.012 --> 00:02:54.430
are able to escape, what's going to happen

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.177
to the average kinetic energy?

00:02:56.177 --> 00:03:00.484
Well as the highest kinetic
energy things escape

00:03:00.484 --> 00:03:02.475
and those are the ones that
are most likely to escape,

00:03:02.475 --> 00:03:05.677
well then your average kinetic
energy is going to go down.

00:03:05.677 --> 00:03:09.222
So average kinetic energy

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:10.828
is going to go down.

00:03:10.828 --> 00:03:12.026
Or another way of saying it,

00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:14.220
is that your temperature
is going to go down.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.496
Your temperature is going to go down

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:20.336
because as these molecules
turn into water vapor,

00:03:20.336 --> 00:03:22.550
they're going to be the
highest kinetic energy,

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.623
energy is transferred to
them, and then they escape.

00:03:24.623 --> 00:03:26.228
And so what's left over is going

00:03:26.228 --> 00:03:28.483
to have a lower average kinetic energy.

00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:29.824
And you're saying, "Well, how does that

00:03:29.824 --> 00:03:31.978
"actually cool down my hand?"

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:35.635
Well, your hand is made
up of molecules as well.

00:03:35.635 --> 00:03:38.642
So let's say this is the
surface of your hand,

00:03:38.642 --> 00:03:39.535
those are the molecules,

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:41.547
they have some average kinetic energy,

00:03:41.547 --> 00:03:43.721
they are kind of vibrating in place,

00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:45.062
especially if we're
talking about they're...

00:03:45.062 --> 00:03:46.159
they're a solid.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.190
And so maybe I'll draw the more,

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.100
you know, they're vibrating like this,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.213
they're bonded to each other in some way.

00:03:52.213 --> 00:03:54.550
I won't go into the details of what types

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.769
of molecules these are,

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.597
but then if you have your
water molecules here,

00:03:57.597 --> 00:03:59.771
water molecules that are
sitting on the surface,

00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:02.189
and I'm drawing this is
kind of a cross-section.

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.956
Let me draw the water molecules.

00:04:03.956 --> 00:04:06.029
I'll draw them as blue molecules.

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:07.675
So this is an H2O right over here.

00:04:07.675 --> 00:04:11.364
H2O. This is an H2O.

00:04:11.364 --> 00:04:13.782
And this is an H2O.

00:04:13.782 --> 00:04:15.651
And they have some hydrogen bonding,

00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:18.373
so there is some hydrogen
bonding going on.

00:04:18.373 --> 00:04:22.924
Well, as the high kinetic
energy water molecules escape,

00:04:22.924 --> 00:04:25.504
I'll say this one right over here escapes,

00:04:25.504 --> 00:04:27.496
and so the average kinetic energy

00:04:27.496 --> 00:04:29.995
of what's left over is lower,

00:04:29.995 --> 00:04:32.209
so then the temperature has gone down,

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:34.566
and now your body molecules,

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:36.496
the ones that are all warmed up,

00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:38.548
and because of whatever's
going on inside of your body,

00:04:38.548 --> 00:04:40.925
well, those can now bump into,

00:04:40.925 --> 00:04:43.058
they can vibrate and bump
into these water molecules

00:04:43.058 --> 00:04:44.704
and increase their kinetic energy

00:04:44.704 --> 00:04:46.350
more than the ones that have
the most kinetic energy.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.670
Those might escape again.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.235
And so it's a--one way
of thinking about it

00:04:49.235 --> 00:04:51.063
is that all that heat is being used

00:04:51.063 --> 00:04:53.217
to allow these individual water molecules

00:04:53.217 --> 00:04:55.127
to escape in order to vaporize.

00:04:55.127 --> 00:04:57.930
And so that heat is leaving your body,

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.434
so it allows you to cool down.

00:04:59.434 --> 00:05:02.908
Cooling down happens by
heat actually leaving.

00:05:02.908 --> 00:05:04.737
So that's how evaporative...

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:06.037
I wrote evaporative cool...

00:05:06.037 --> 00:05:07.987
That's how evaporative cooling...

00:05:07.987 --> 00:05:11.238
That's how evaporative
cooling actually works.
