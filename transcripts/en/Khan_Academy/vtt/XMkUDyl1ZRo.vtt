00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.790
So where I had left off
is we had the circuit.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.010
We had these little
leads here.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.550
This was kind of
our innovation.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.320
And this is actually called a
commutator, where this part

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.800
that's connected to our rotating
piece, that's the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.080
commutator.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.300
And these are the brushes.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.570
So you could imagine, you could
design them as brushes

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.950
that always stay in touch.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.900
Kind of like the brushes
on a, what was that?

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.900
What are those cars at
the amusement park?

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.260
Bumper cars, right?

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.000
On the bumper cars you have a
pole behind your bumper car.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.960
I'll draw that for fun.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.880
So let's say this is
your bumper car.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.070
Looks like a shoe
a little bit.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.910
This is you driving
your bumper car.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.200
And they have a pole.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.350
And at the top of the pole,
you'll see these brushes that

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.720
are touching the
ceiling, right?

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.320
You could view that as the
same type of brush.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.260
And what it allows is a constant
electric current to

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.430
flow through the ceiling.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.950
I don't know what direction
it's going in.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.580
But it allows a current to
flow through the ceiling.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.570
And maybe your car is grounded
so the current can flow down

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.370
to ground, so that your car
could be powered by the

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.470
ceiling and not have to carry
a battery in every car.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.890
Which would be kind of a waste
of energy and probably some

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.590
type of a health hazard
and safety risk,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.540
et cetera, et cetera.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.450
So those brushes on your bumper
cars might not be all

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.620
that different from the brushes
that are touching the

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.420
commutators here.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.710
Just a little bit
of terminology.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.120
And it never hurts to
introduce bumper car

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.672
references.

00:01:18.672 --> 00:01:20.360
I probably should have done
them earlier when we were

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.860
learning about momentum
and things.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.210
But anyway.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.980
So what was happening here?

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.870
So going back to our
first video.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.910
We have the current going
down like this.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.090
And then if you use your right
hand rule with the cross

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.680
product, you know that the net
force from the magnetic field

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.270
is going to be downwards on the
left hand side, upward on

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.250
the right hand side.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.890
So you have a net torque
rotating it like that.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.050
Rotating the right out of the
page, the left into the page

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.800
or into the video screen.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.900
Up to the point that you've
rotated 90 degrees and now

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.880
you're looking kind of, so
this side right here.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.480
Let me do it in a different
color so you can see it.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.210
This side is this side,
right on top.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.960
And this side is on the bottom,
below the page.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.240
This side is now
above the page.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.830
If this distance is r,
this side is now r

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.320
units above the page.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.180
And I said ideally maybe your
commutator loses touch with

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.530
the brushes at this
point, right?

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.820
Because they're popping out a
little bit, so when you're

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.940
vertical, you actually lose
touch with the brushes.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.620
So you have no circuit flowing,
so you save a little

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.280
battery energy.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.210
And you just let a little bit of
the angular momentum carry

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.950
this whole rotating contraption
further a little

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.860
bit to the point that
your configuration

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.190
will look like this.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.810
So I know I keep changing
colors, but the whole

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.320
contraption will now
look like this.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.420
OK, that's my positive,
negative, positive, negative,

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.660
current flows like this.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.670
Now we assume that the
commutator has

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.960
gotten back in touch.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.100
And let me color code this.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.610
So if this side is this
color, right?

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.140
Now this is when we're looking
at top on, where it's popping

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.320
out of the screen, where
it's above the screen.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.980
And now we've rotated 180
degrees and this side is on

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.340
this side, right?

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.860
Let me pick a suitable color.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.470
If this side was green.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.280
Now this side, we flip the whole
thing over 180 degrees.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.920
And now something interesting
happens.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.390
Remember, before we had this
commutator and everything, if

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.760
we just flipped it over, the
current, because before when

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.500
we didn't have the commutator,
the current here was flowing

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.860
down here, up here.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.380
And before the commutator, we
had the current flowing down

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.470
here and up here.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.510
And so we were switching
directions.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.540
And so you would have had this
thing that would never

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.440
completely rotate.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.410
It would just keep flipping
over, right?

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.640
Which may be useful for, I don't
know, if you wanted to

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.600
flip things.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.120
But it's not useful
as a motor.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.390
So what happens here?

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.580
Now this side, all of a sudden
instead of being connected to

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.800
this lead, is now connected
to this lead.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.390
And this green side is now
connected to this lead.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.160
So something interesting
happens.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.600
Now the current on the left side
is still flowing down,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.580
right, and the current
on the right side is

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.140
still flowing up.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.820
So we're back to this
configuration except that this

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.820
contraption has flipped over.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.550
The brown side is now on the
left and the green side is now

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.410
on the right.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.690
And what that allows is that
those net torques are still

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.440
going in that same rotational
direction.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.720
Use your right hand rule.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.770
The current is flowing
down here.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.250
So if your magnetic field is
coming to the left, then the

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.680
net force is going to be
down there and it's

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.140
going to be up there.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.170
And so we can continue
indefinite, and we solve our

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.250
other problem.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.360
That we will never keep twisting
these wires here.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.780
So now using the commutator, we
have essentially created an

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.655
electric motor.

00:04:51.655 --> 00:04:53.710
And remember I drew that little
thing, that could be

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.390
like the axle.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.200
Maybe that turns the wheels
or something.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.880
So if you have a constant
magnetic field and you just by

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.120
using this commutator which,
as soon as you get to that

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.300
kind of vertical point, it cuts
the current, and then

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.060
when you go a little bit past
vertical, a little bit past 90

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.190
degrees, it switches the
direction of the current.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.600
So on the left hand side you
always have the current coming

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.840
down, and on the right hand
side you always have the

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.720
current going up.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.450
So that the net torque is always
going to be pushing, is

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.540
always going to be rotating this
contraption down on the

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.990
left hand side and up on
the right hand side.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.040
Coming out of the page on the
right hand side and then down

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.990
on the left hand side.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.730
And you could actually
turn a wheel now.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.400
You could create an
electric car.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.380
So that is the basics
really of how

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.150
electric motors are created.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.190
Well, there's another way
you could have done it.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.320
You didn't have to use
the commutator.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.100
One methodology you could have
used is you could have had the

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.650
magnetic field going until you
get to this point, and then

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.770
you turn off the magnetic
field, right?

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.150
And maybe you wait for this
situation to go all the way

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.060
180 degrees and then you turn
the magnetic field back on

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.130
again, right?

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.550
That's one possibility.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.460
But that's maybe not as
efficient cause half of the

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.910
cycle you're not powering it.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.325
Or maybe you switch
the direction of

00:06:13.325 --> 00:06:14.310
the magnetic field.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.240
Or another option, you don't
have to use a commutator.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.890
Maybe you use some other
contraption to switch the

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.160
direction of the
magnetic field.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.030
But this is probably the
simplest way to do it.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.010
And I think it gives you a
general idea of how an

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.480
electric motor can be created.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.460
And then we could play around
with the mechanics of

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.230
innovations on it.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.500
But all electric motors are
essentially some variation of

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.020
what you have learned
in this video.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.820
Isn't it neat to learn
something useful?

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.070
See you in the next video.
