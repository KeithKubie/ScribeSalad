KIKO: My name is Kiko.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.970
I'm part of the music team
here at Google YouTube.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.160
And I'm excited
to be here today.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.620
We have a special guest
for you guys today,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.300
a gentleman by the
name of Sparsh who

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.870
has inspired so many throughout
the world through his music

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.570
as well as his philanthropic
work with cancer research

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.450
and children with disabilities
and earthquake victims, et

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.536
cetera.

00:00:25.536 --> 00:00:27.160
And he's going to
perform for us today.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.312
So without further ado, Sparsh.

00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:30.270
SPARSH SHAH: Thank you.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.205
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

00:00:33.205 --> 00:00:34.246
[MUSIC - "LOSE YOURSELF"]

00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:35.329
SPARSH SHAH: (SINGING) Ah.

00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:42.695
Ah.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.150
Ah.

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:15.200
(RAPPING) Look, if you had
one shot or one opportunity

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.680
to seize everything you
ever wanted, one moment,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.980
would you capture it,
or just let it slip?

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.480
Yo.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.140
His palms are sweaty,
knees weak, arms are heavy.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.430
There's vomit on his sweater
already, Mom's spaghetti.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.080
He's nervous.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.820
But on the surface, he looks
calm and ready to drop bombs

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.567
but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down.

00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:38.775
The whole crowd goes so loud.

00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:41.545
He opens his mouth, but
the words won't come out.

00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:42.940
And he's choking out.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.505
Everybody's joking now.

00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:45.756
The clock's run out.

00:01:45.756 --> 00:01:47.184
Time's up, over-- blaow!

00:01:47.184 --> 00:01:49.090
Snap back to reality.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.250
Oh, there goes gravity.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.294
Oh, there goes
Rabbit, he choked.

00:01:52.294 --> 00:01:54.180
He's so mad, but he
won't give up that easy.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.660
No, he won't have it,
he knows, his whole

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.124
back's to these ropes.

00:01:58.124 --> 00:01:59.314
It don't matter, he's dope.

00:01:59.314 --> 00:02:00.564
He knows that, but he's broke.

00:02:00.564 --> 00:02:03.004
He's so stagnant, he
knows when he goes back

00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:05.690
to his mobile home, that's when
it's back to the lab again, yo!

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.731
This whole rhapsody better
go capture this moment

00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:09.841
and hope it don't pass him.

00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:13.206
You better lose yourself in the
music, the moment, you own it.

00:02:13.206 --> 00:02:14.380
You better never let it go.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.880
Come on!

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.220
You only get one shot.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.180
Do not miss your chance to blow.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.140
Because opportunity
comes once in a lifetime.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.080
You better lose yourself
in the music, the moment.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.060
You own it.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.610
You better never let it go.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.044
You only get one shot.

00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:30.390
Do not miss your chance
to blow this opportunity

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.640
comes once in a lifetime, yo.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.236
His soul's escaping through
this hole that is gaping.

00:02:35.236 --> 00:02:37.140
This world is mine
for the taking.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.830
Make me king as we move
toward a New World Order,

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.830
a normal life is boring.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.960
But superstardom's
close to post-mortem.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.128
It only goes harder.

00:02:46.128 --> 00:02:47.540
Homie grows hotter.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.040
He blows.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.623
It's all over.

00:02:48.623 --> 00:02:51.690
These haters all on him,
coast-to-coast shows.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.430
He's known as the Globetrotter,
lonely roads God only knows.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.300
He's grown farther from home.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.166
He's no brother.

00:02:57.166 --> 00:03:00.190
He goes home and barely
knows his little brother.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.484
But hold your nose 'cause
here goes the cold water.

00:03:03.484 --> 00:03:04.900
His homies don't
want him no more.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.730
He's cold product.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.720
They moved on to the
next schmoe who flows.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.310
He nose-dove and sold nada.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.824
So the soap opera is told.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.760
It unfolds, I suppose
it's old, partner.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.032
But the beat goes on.

00:03:15.032 --> 00:03:17.261
Da da dom da dom.

00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:18.844
You better lose
yourself in the music.

00:03:18.844 --> 00:03:19.815
The moment, you own it.

00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:20.960
You better never let it go.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.080
You only get one shot.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.706
Do not miss your chance to blow.

00:03:24.706 --> 00:03:27.236
This opportunity comes
ones in a lifetime.

00:03:27.236 --> 00:03:30.440
You better lose yourself
in the music, the moment.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.940
You own it.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.520
You better never let it go.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.010
You only get one shot.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.340
Do not miss your chance to blow.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.450
This opportunity comes
once in a lifetime, yo!

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.300
No more games.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.010
I'm gonna change
what you call rage.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.960
Tear this entire roof
off like a T rex caged.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.440
I was playing in the beginning.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.372
The mood all changed.

00:03:47.372 --> 00:03:50.170
I'm been chewed up and spit
out and booed offstage.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.520
But I kept rhyming and stepped
right in the next cypher.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.992
Best believe somebody's
paying the Pied Piper.

00:03:55.992 --> 00:03:58.224
All the pain inside
amplified by the fact

00:03:58.224 --> 00:04:01.680
that I can't get by
with my nine-to-five

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.520
and I can't provide the right
type of life for my family,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.030
'cause man, these underpaid
food stamps don't buy diapers.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.258
And there's no movie,
there's no Mekhi Phifer.

00:04:11.258 --> 00:04:13.488
This is my life and
these times are so hard.

00:04:13.488 --> 00:04:17.093
But it's getting even harder
trying to feed and water

00:04:17.093 --> 00:04:18.589
my seed, plus teeter-totter.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.784
Caught up between being a
brother and a prima donna.

00:04:20.784 --> 00:04:23.940
Baby mama drama screaming
on her, too much for me

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.230
to wanna stay in one spot.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.024
Another day of
monotony's gotten me

00:04:27.024 --> 00:04:28.832
to the point I'm like a snail.

00:04:28.832 --> 00:04:32.290
I've got to formulate a plot
or end up in jail or shot.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.360
Success is the only
option I have left.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.242
Failure's not.

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:38.075
Mom, I love you, but
this trailer's got to go.

00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:40.566
I cannot grow old
in Salem's Lot.

00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:41.550
So here I go.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.534
It's my shot.

00:04:42.534 --> 00:04:43.981
Wheels fail me not.

00:04:43.981 --> 00:04:45.814
This may be the only
opportunity that I got.

00:04:45.814 --> 00:04:47.742
You'd better lose
yourself in the music.

00:04:47.742 --> 00:04:50.634
The moment you own it, you
better never let it go.

00:04:50.634 --> 00:04:52.080
You only get one shot.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.810
Do not miss your chance to blow.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.805
If you know the lyrics, sing!

00:04:56.805 --> 00:04:57.305
Come on!

00:04:57.305 --> 00:04:58.888
You better lose
yourself in the music.

00:04:58.888 --> 00:05:00.798
The moment, you own it.

00:05:00.798 --> 00:05:02.295
You better never let it go.

00:05:02.295 --> 00:05:03.792
You only get one shot.

00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:05.788
Do not miss your chance to blow.

00:05:05.788 --> 00:05:08.283
This opportunity comes
once in a lifetime.

00:05:08.283 --> 00:05:09.281

You can do anything

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.161
you set your mind to, man.

00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:15.592
Keep talking.

00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:17.050
It's not over yet, ready?

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.994

up for him once again.

SPARSH SHAH: Thank
you so much Is there

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.380
a way to turn this off?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.100
So that, oh, OK.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.590
It's off.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.430
Well, you Googlers
are always one--

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.920
at least a few steps ahead.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.740
It's always what my dad told
me when we used to play chess.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.470
Like, always think a
couple of steps ahead.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.500
You guys are way ahead.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.220
KIKO: Well, first.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.642
I just want to thank you
for joining us today.

00:06:40.642 --> 00:06:42.725
SPARSH SHAH: Thank you so
much for having me here.

00:06:42.725 --> 00:06:43.266
It's amazing.

00:06:43.266 --> 00:06:44.660
KIKO: Absolutely.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.760
So I guess my first
question is, I guess, when,

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.380
and how old were
you when you first

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.767
realized your love for music?

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:54.600
SPARSH SHAH: The great
thing about that is--

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.090
for me, music, it's
been with me all along.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.730
I mean, it's not like
I grew into music.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.530
Music grew with me.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.037
Like, it's the deepest
part of my soul.

00:07:08.037 --> 00:07:09.870
It's like we were two
childhood friends that

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.140
grew up in the same neighborhood
and we always knew each other.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.230
And I was exposed to music
ever since I was little.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.390
So that's the great thing,
because I got to learn.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.320
I would hum every song that
my family played in the car.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.430
I would start singing.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.263
Ultimately, I started
correcting my parents.

00:07:29.276 --> 00:07:31.410
It was crazy.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.995
I started with piano actually.

00:07:32.995 --> 00:07:36.890
I broke my arms a
lot, broke my legs

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.920
a lot because of my condition.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:45.240
But that really-- my mom
told me that no matter

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.890
how many bones you
broke in you life,

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.660
your voice would never break.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.570
So I realized, you
know, yeah, I may

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.350
be here with 130
fractures in my life now.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.900
I had 40 coming out of the womb.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.070
But my vocal cords, like,
my voice never broke.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:05.430
So that's basically why I became
a singer and not necessarily

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.590
an instrumental musician.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.690
That's, like, my main focus.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.220
KIKO: That's good advice, mom.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.000
The voice will never break.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.180
So thank you for that.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.690
My next question is, just you
touched on some of the things

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.410
you've endured health wise.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.060
So I guess my question is how
did you keep your motivation up

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.560
to do some of the
things that you've

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.070
been doing, sort of
regardless of everything else.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:33.750
SPARSH SHAH: For me, my
motivation comes from--

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.730
I mean, really, it
comes from everybody.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.039
So you all here, I'm
just letting you know,

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.270
you are my motivation.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.580
And I really mean that by
the heart when I say it.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.080
So thank you.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.673
Thank you for that.

00:08:44.673 --> 00:08:46.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.980
So that's the thing.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.700
Like, for me, it comes
from three places,

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.050
my fans, my friends
and my family, and God.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.840
I mean, my fans, they've been
my global support system.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.980
They've been with me everywhere
through my musical journey.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.530
And I've been able to
help them out, too.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.030
So it's not just
them supporting me.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.700
It's me supporting them with
my music and my message.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.100
I've been so blessed to have
inspired so many people,

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.976
and show them, you
know, it doesn't

00:09:12.976 --> 00:09:14.100
matter what you go through.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.630
It matters what
you want to get to.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:21.360
And doing that is great
for me and for my fans,

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.430
like for me to tell my
fans that and for them

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.290
to get that message.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.670
It's great.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:31.230
My friends and my family,
I mean, obviously, my fans

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.920
are my biggest support system.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.380
But my family is like my
longest running support system.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.420
They knew me since I was born.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:43.290
So they've always--
without them, I

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.940
would not have
been gently raised

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.690
to be the child I am today.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.710
And the values that they gave
me, they imbibed into me.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.880
It was, oh, my god, it was cra--

00:09:57.464 --> 00:09:59.880
the values that they gave me,
without that I wouldn't have

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.760
been the strong, resilient
teenager that I am today

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.510
and I definitely wouldn't
have gone out to the world

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.910
and showcased my talent.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.330
And most importantly, I
believe my greatest strength

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.140
comes from God.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.330
He's there with
me wherever I go,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.080
wherever I am, and
no matter what.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.690
And you know,
every day I wake up

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.440
and I always thank God for
giving me another day of life.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.420
Because number one, he could
easily take it away from me.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:35.530
Every breath, I believe every
breath we take is by his grace.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.814
Me coming out with 40
fractures in the womb--

00:10:37.814 --> 00:10:39.480
I mean, I know, you're
probably thinking

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.813
what is this kid talking about
with all these fractures?

00:10:41.813 --> 00:10:45.690
I have osteogenesis imperfecta,
which is brittle bones disease

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:46.690
in layman's terms.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.980
And I've suffered many
fractures through my life,

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.390
many surgeries.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.392
And with those 40 fractures,
some of the biggest

00:10:53.392 --> 00:10:54.600
surgeries I've gone through--

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.450
I had a spinal fusion in August.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.960
All that, I honestly think
that without God's grace,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.370
I wouldn't have been here today.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.370
So I always thank him for
giving me another day.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.930
Because he could have taken
it away from me in an instant.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.850
He could take over for me
right now if he wanted to.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.690
But the fact that he didn't
and he's letting me live

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.540
is just saying your
fight's not over, son.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.920
You're going to fight for me.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.420
I know you're going
to fight for me.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.800
So that's why I
wake up every day.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.420
And I think if we
all open our eyes

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.140
and live like that, that's the
greatest sense of purpose we

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.781
could ever have in
our life, period.

00:11:27.781 --> 00:11:28.280
KIKO: Amen.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:28.988
SPARSH SHAH: Woo!

00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:32.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.860
KIKO: So in just knowing
part of your story,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.974
there's been a lot of high
points that I read through.

00:11:37.974 --> 00:11:39.390
But what do you
feel like has been

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.397
your best or happiest
moment so far in the journey

00:11:42.397 --> 00:11:43.230
that you've been on.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.890
SPARSH SHAH: Wow.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:44.460
That's crazy.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.220
Definitely Google is one
of my happiest moments.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:47.970
KIKO: Thank you.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.390
SPARSH SHAH: Of course.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:49.890
Yeah.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.822
I mean I've had a
lot of performances.

00:11:51.822 --> 00:11:52.530
That's the thing.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.950
I don't let my biggest
performance define my success.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.630
I'm not the kind
of guy that says,

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.500
yo, you know, I performed
at Madison Square Garden,

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.880
UN headquarters, Google,
Deloitte, all the stuff.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.360
Yeah, I performed
in all of those.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.800
But that doesn't define me.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.200
What defines me, honestly, is I
think my biggest achievement is

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.770
just every time I've been able
to touch someone's heart, that

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.660
has become my
biggest achievement.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.310
Because what's the
point of going out--

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.570
like one of my dreams is to sing
in front of a billion people.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:26.450
Yeah, a billion--

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.600
I mean, it's doable, right?

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.300
But what's the point of singing
in front of a billion people

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.160
if nobody's really
going to hear you?

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.040
If nobody's actually
going to listen.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.340
So that's why I say
that it doesn't matter

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.320
about what I did as an artist.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.289
What matters is who I
touched as an artist.

00:12:46.289 --> 00:12:46.830
KIKO: Gotcha.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.990
And it's also, obviously, you've
done a lot of covers of Eminem

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.140
and stuff like that.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.790
But I guess my question is,
what artists inspire you,

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.690
just in general?

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.540
SPARSH SHAH: I mean,
there's a few actually.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.090
Obviously, since I
came across Not Afraid,

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.360
Eminem was my favorite artist.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.560
And he has such a
great lyrical genius.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.640
I love that.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.400
His story is great.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.590
And I think, actually,
he was the one--

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.750
I had been exposed to
hip hop, I realized,

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.120
as I look back over
the years, more slowly

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.530
and slowly until I got to him.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.690
But I always avoided
the mainstream industry,

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.220
because I thought, oh, man.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:26.910
It's so bad.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.740
All these people talking
about bad things and all that.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.580
But I think Eminem was really
the rapper who showed me

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.830
that you could be
in the industry

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.190
and you don't have to
rap about that stuff.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.750
Hip hop is not always bad.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.040
It can be used for good.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.400
It's not the devil's
music as they would say.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.670
You can take a rhythm
and just rap over a beat

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.580
and you could make the
most inspirational message.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.330
But I think like as I got
further and discovered

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.640
some other artists, I remember,
before I came to Eminem,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.140
I used to listen MattyBRaps,
really awesome YouTube

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.270
sensation and rapper.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:08.070
Few other rappers, they're
two rappers I'm huge fans of--

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.170
Minister, he's a gospel rapper.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.280
And also Dee-1, he's
like a mix between gospel

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.950
and conscious rap.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.660
My favorite part
about him is that he

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:23.610
doesn't let go of his
values and he will not bend.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:29.250
Like he won't do something
that he knows is--

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.880
he won't sacrifice
something greater for, like,

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.450
one opportunity.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.520
I love his motto.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.810
It's called three's up.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.400
So be real, be righteous,
and be relevant.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.220
And I think every rapper
needs to live up to that,

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.160
because we're living
in an industry

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.870
right now that is barely real,
definitely not righteous,

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:54.030
and I mean, only a little
relevant, if anything.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.030
So I want to be one of those
guys that really lives up

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.890
to that.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.200
KIKO: And also, like you
know, you mentioned, I

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.850
think a lot of people have a
love for music very early on.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.760
But I guess for you,
at what point did you

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.440
realize that this
was really going

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.210
to be a thing-- like,
something that was

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:12.660
very important in your life?

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.280
SPARSH SHAH: Yeah, ever
since I was little.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.430
I've known it ever
since I was little.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:21.280
And that was the great thing.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.740
It was my dream
always to inspire.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:29.020
So I wasn't following
another dream.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.286
Like, I'm going to
make these records.

00:15:31.286 --> 00:15:32.410
I'm going to do this money.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.150
I'm going to get this money.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.390
I'm going to buy this
stuff, get rich, and all.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.010
I'm going to sing in live tours.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.990
That was byproduct.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:44.560
Really, the main
dream that I had

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.191
was to inspire
everyone in the world.

00:15:48.191 --> 00:15:49.690
Singing in front
of a billion people

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.720
was just a vehicle to do that,
now that I look back on it.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.730
And that's why I always say.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.140
I want to sparsh
people's hearts.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.900
Sparsh, my name actually
means touch, to touch.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.660
So I just sparshed my left hand.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.800
SPARSH SHAH: So in that way,
that's what I want to do.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.190
I want to sparsh
people's hearts.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.310
KIKO: In all the people that
you've touched and spoken with

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.200
and had an opportunity to meet,
was there a specific message

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.700
that you've gotten from anyone
that specifically touched you

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.125
through all your journeys?

00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:22.120
SPARSH SHAH: Ooh.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.525
That's a tough one.

00:16:25.525 --> 00:16:29.200
Hm, a specific message, like, a
message that really struck me.

00:16:36.445 --> 00:16:39.290
Ooh, man, you got me there.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.560
I think honestly
the biggest messages

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.860
I'd ever gotten were
from my parents.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.270
I mean, I got so much
encouragement from everyone

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:56.300
that I had met through
my performance journey

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.230
and everything.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:00.050
But my mom and dad,
they were the ones

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:04.160
that really kept me grounded.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.460
They showed me my purpose.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.419
They showed me who I
really could be, who I was

00:17:11.419 --> 00:17:13.010
and who I could be.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.170
And so they always picked me up.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:24.736
A lot of people
with disabilities,

00:17:24.736 --> 00:17:26.069
I mean, now time's are changing.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:28.344
But a lot of people
with disabilities,

00:17:28.344 --> 00:17:29.760
they're not really
that recognized

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.200
because of their disability.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.134
But that's what I like to say
I like to dis my disability.

00:17:35.134 --> 00:17:36.118
Poof.

00:17:36.118 --> 00:17:37.620
I dissed my disability.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.460
That's the thing.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.500
So my parents always
gave me that attitude.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.390
If you can believe it,
you can achieve it.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.320
And I really took that to heart.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.740
And I think that's the
reason why I'm here today.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.330
That message is
the reason why I'm

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:55.080
able to go out and sing in front
of 20,000 to 30,000 people.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.880
And technically, I'm talking
in front of millions,

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.217
if not billions of
people, because this is

00:18:00.217 --> 00:18:01.425
going to go out to the world.

00:18:01.425 --> 00:18:02.230
KIKO: Yeah.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.145
SPARSH SHAH: So without
that, without that attitude

00:18:05.145 --> 00:18:06.520
and without that
outlook on life,

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.160
I definitely would not have
been able to come here so

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.326
boldly on stage and
be able to do that.

00:18:12.326 --> 00:18:13.220
KIKO: Good.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.285
And now, what is your
process for creating music?

00:18:16.285 --> 00:18:17.160
SPARSH SHAH: Oh, wow.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.190
Glad you asked.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:25.200
So usually when I was
little, I used to--

00:18:28.044 --> 00:18:30.210
yeah, when I was little and
I started writing songs,

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.190
the first song I wrote
was at the age of 10.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:33.815
And it was "This Love
Will Never Fade."

00:18:33.815 --> 00:18:35.820
And I didn't know
how to make music.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.970
I was really bad at composing.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.400
I still suck at the piano.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.930
But I didn't know how
to make music like that.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.350
And so I would try and
try, and it never worked.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.000
But I would always
write down songs first.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.800
I'd write down a song
first, and then I

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.260
would try, frustratingly, try
to come up with a piano tune.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.950
And then time kept
going on, sometimes

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.770
I would find really
good beats online,

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.690
especially when I
started making rap songs.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.060
And I fell in love with rap.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.790
I listened to the beat,
make a song out of it.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.830
And then I realized
that, you know,

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.460
I'd written so many songs.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.860
And I tried going out to
people who could record me.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.900
But everyone who I
knew was really busy.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.210
So I said, you know what?

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.980
I have to do it on my own.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:27.220
It was like a do or die thing,
because you got to move fast.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.076
And so I was, like,
you know what?

00:19:30.076 --> 00:19:31.200
I had to make my own music.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.600
If nobody's going to do it
and make my music for me,

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.460
and nobody's going
to help record it,

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.100
I need to get the tools
that I need to do that.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.755
I got a recording set
for Christmas one day.

00:19:40.755 --> 00:19:42.630
I don't remember how
many years ago that was,

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.400
probably a few years ago.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.350
And I got that done.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:51.190
I started writing, and
I started making music.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.020
So in fact, I have a MacBook.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.890
I mean, I could
show you something.

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.534
KIKO: That'd be great.

00:19:57.534 --> 00:19:58.200
SPARSH SHAH: OK.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.070
Let's do this.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.990
OK, so you all ready?

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:08.630
I'm going to teach you guys
how to make a simple beat.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:09.970
You ready for this?

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:10.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:17.280
SPARSH SHAH: OK, so if you could
turn up this screen, please.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.380
All right, here we are.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.890
I'm using the cute little
Garage Band software.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.760
I know everyone uses Logic
and Pro Tools and stuff.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.530
I'll show you this track later.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.620
But let's make a new project.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.810
All right, now I'm going to
do this completely random, OK?

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:36.040
Ready?

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.040
You could yell out
anything you want.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.280
I don't even mind.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.410
All right, ready?

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:43.090
What key do you
want the song to be?

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.460
It could be, like,
I think it's from--

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:50.180
yeah, it's A to all
the way to G sharp.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.340
What would do you want?

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.372
Yell out a number.

00:20:53.372 --> 00:20:54.080

00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:57.460

SPARSH SHAH: 140.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.294
OK, time signature?

00:21:13.294 --> 00:21:15.080
Oh.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.730
You know, I'll just
stick with the 4/4.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.094
It's easier, you know?

00:21:18.094 --> 00:21:19.010
I'm sticking with 4/4.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.650

Let's do this.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.323
I'm going to try it.

00:21:23.323 --> 00:21:26.660
So I'm not going to use
any audios or drummers.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.040
I'm just going to do
software instruments.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.930
So somebody just
give me a good--

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:35.670
is there anybody a
good beatboxer here?

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.350
You don't even have
to be that good.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.140
All right.

SPARSH SHAH: OK.

[MIMICS BEAT] OK.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:49.980
I got this.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.380
I got this, ready?

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:55.750
So what you're going
to do is you go, like--

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.850
I'm going to go to the old
GarageBand instruments.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.330
Because I love to start
with that drum kit, hip hop.

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:03.576
Watch this, ready?

00:22:03.576 --> 00:22:04.700
It's called musical typing.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.690
It's so cool.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:09.020
See, there's all these
different instruments.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.410
Boom chee-- all right, so we're
going to start with that beat,

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:13.187
ready?

00:22:13.187 --> 00:22:16.049
[PLAYS BEAT]

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:24.960
SPARSH SHAH: OK, so now all
I got to do is you go here,

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:30.540
you quantize the music
so that it's on beat.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.970
OK, there it is.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:35.470
So now what you can do is you
can layer extra stuff on this.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:36.560
So it's really cool.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.620
So this is the basic beat.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.320
[PLAYS BEAT]

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.850
SPARSH SHAH: That's
the metronome.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:45.410
Right?

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:46.070
So now watch?

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.894
Cool, right?

00:22:51.894 --> 00:22:53.060
So like something like that.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.020
And then you could
go to the piano.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:59.150
[PIANO PLAYING]

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.860
SPARSH SHAH: So you
could record that.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.600
It's really cool, because
then you can come up

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.558
with really cool tunes.

00:23:03.558 --> 00:23:06.500

is an instrumental I made.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:19.578
It's really cool, ready?

00:23:37.506 --> 00:23:40.494

truck beat, by the way.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:47.310
Anybody feeling the vibe?

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.270
I know you are.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:49.270
Yeah, you're feeling it.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:50.252
I can tell.

00:23:54.671 --> 00:23:57.617
I made this, like, I just
came up with this idea

00:23:57.617 --> 00:24:00.563
after finding out how
to use [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:00.563 --> 00:24:03.018
So I figured out
the chords and--

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:12.670
So that is just a snippet
of an instrumental.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:14.510
And I just made this song--

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:16.270
no, don't save.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.790
I'm always clicking don't save.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.640
It's funny.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.740
Now this is a song
that I just actually

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.200
composed like two days ago.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.790
And I have the lyrics to it.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:30.450
So you could even read that.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:31.810
All right, ready?

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.260
It's like my intro song.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.980
So like before I release
all my other songs,

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.210
this is, like, yo, world.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.200
This is me.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.230
So I came up with this
after some pretty hard work.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.360
It took me a very
long time to make.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.239
And this is basic.

00:24:46.239 --> 00:24:47.905

mixing and mastering,

00:24:47.905 --> 00:24:49.570

I'm just really
piecing music together.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:54.550

I've come up with.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:58.989

Rose up from the
wounds that I took.

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:45.640
These got so much
boom, you'll be shook.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.840
Move around faster than
the cast [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.810
Read that book because
I'm right in my pages.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.382
[INAUDIBLE] by the ghost.

00:25:53.382 --> 00:25:55.340
Story's been written,
but I came with the most.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.381
Move throughout the world
and the coast to coast.

00:25:57.381 --> 00:25:58.085
Never go slow.

00:25:58.085 --> 00:25:58.730
Never go slow.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.438
Yo, I may be learning,
not yet I'm great.

00:26:00.438 --> 00:26:09.786
But I'm burning [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:09.786 --> 00:26:11.205
(SPEAKING) Let me
try that again.

00:26:11.205 --> 00:26:12.592
[CHEERING]

00:26:12.592 --> 00:26:14.300
KIKO: Woo, how about
a round of applause?

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.432
SPARSH SHAH: It's going
to get better, ready?

00:26:16.432 --> 00:26:18.160
(RAPPING) Yo, rap
flowing like water.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:23.920
My [INAUDIBLE]
music is my fodder

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.710
'cause this is only inception.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:27.520
Hip hop training succession.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.080
I'm here to help
reclaim the lost

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.570
kingdom faded in regression.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:34.840
[INAUDIBLE] to separate the wee
from [INAUDIBLE] I'ma stay bold

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.770
and I won't be scared.

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.624
But even in my life, I'm
remembering my prayers.

00:26:38.624 --> 00:26:40.460
(SPEAKING) And that's
like part of it.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:40.960
KIKO: Woo!

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.900
KIKO: Round of
applause, everyone.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.850
Thank you for that.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.940
SPARSH SHAH: Of course.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.570
Oh, right.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.544
I'm using this mic.

00:26:53.544 --> 00:26:55.710
KIKO: I guess my question
is, obviously, you've done

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.150
a lot of creating for yourself.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.430
Like, who is your dream to
obviously record-- you're

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:00.310
making tracks.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.290
You're making beats.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.540
Is it your dream to have
someone else, I guess,

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.790
record to your tracks as well?

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.680
And if so, who
would be your dream

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.820
to have someone record
to any of your tracks?

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.240
SPARSH SHAH: Ooh, honestly.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:17.700
Yeah, I would definitely
love to work with others

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.160
to produce my tracks.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.190
You know, I've never really had
any anybody in mind for that.

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:25.980
But you know, hey, if
anybody's out there,

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.030
and you're watching this.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.860
I know, I mean, this
is Google, right?

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.340
Anything's possible.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.400
So I don't know.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:38.950
I'm free, if you guys want
some of my music to you know,

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:42.180
to produce some stuff,
I'm totally ready for it.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.020
So yeah.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.920
KIKO: What about artist wise,
to record to any of your tracks?

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.805
SPARSH SHAH: Artist
wise, artist wise, wow.

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:52.830
Definite-- I think ever
since "Not Afraid,"

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.230
it was definitely my dream
to perform with Eminem.

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.610
So I mean, that's
just performing.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.510
But if we got to do
something studio wise.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.310
That would be pretty cool, too.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:05.320
I mean, I'm totally
ready for that.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.215
KIKO: That would be dope.

00:28:07.215 --> 00:28:11.930
So guys, we're going to play
a cool game, a memory game.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:13.620
Could we get some volunteers?

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.460
I'm not going to say what it is.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.584
Because I don't want to
scare you all off just yet.

00:28:16.584 --> 00:28:19.890
But a memory game we're going
to play here with Sparsh.

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.480
Can we get some
volunteers, please?

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.625
We have two mics set up
at two sides of the room.

00:28:23.625 --> 00:28:24.750
SPARSH SHAH: Come on, guys.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.749
Don't need to be scared.

00:28:25.749 --> 00:28:26.640
Oh, yeah, let's go.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.090
KIKO: Thank you.

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:27.480
Thank you.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.020
Thank you.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.120
Could we get another volunteer?

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.150
SPARSH SHAH: Anyone
from this side?

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:31.380
KIKO: Anyone from this side?

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:31.830
SPARSH SHAH: Step up.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:32.996
You don't have to be scared.

00:28:32.996 --> 00:28:33.685
Don't worry.

00:28:33.685 --> 00:28:36.160
KIKO: [LAUGHS] All right.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.030
So the game that we are
going to play today.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:44.340
So Sparsh is a master
at the numbers of pi.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:48.480
He's memorized a significant--
way down the line.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.414
I'm not even close.

00:28:49.414 --> 00:28:51.580
So we're not going to even
talk about what I can do.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.850
But we're going to play a
little game, and see if--

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:54.920
this is Google, right?

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.231
So we have a lot of
great minds in the room.

00:28:57.231 --> 00:28:59.730
We're going to see if anybody
can go back and forth with him

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:04.560
with the numbers of pi that he
knows and that you guys know.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.430
This should be fun.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:06.221
This should be fun.

00:29:06.221 --> 00:29:07.120
This should be fun.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.800
So I guess, do you
want to start off?

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.236
Who wants to start off here?

00:29:11.236 --> 00:29:12.135
AUDIENCE: 3.

00:29:12.135 --> 00:29:12.634
KIKO: Huh?

00:29:12.634 --> 00:29:13.332
[LAUGHS]

00:29:13.332 --> 00:29:14.498
AUDIENCE: I'll start with 3.

00:29:14.498 --> 00:29:15.164
I know that one.

00:29:15.164 --> 00:29:17.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.286
SPARSH SHAH: All right.

00:29:19.286 --> 00:29:20.960
Do you want to--

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:21.460
wait.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.560
Do you-- can you--

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.010
I mean, do you have any more?

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:27.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.990
AUDIENCE: 3.145?

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:32.230
SPARSH SHAH: Almost.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:33.581
1-5.

00:29:33.581 --> 00:29:34.080
Don't worry.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:34.580
It's fine.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.315
It's fine.

00:29:35.315 --> 00:29:36.190
KIKO: You're not out.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.265
SPARSH SHAH: You ready?

00:29:37.265 --> 00:29:38.300
Try your best.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.000
Try your best.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.583
AUDIENCE: Question
is can I Google it?

00:29:40.583 --> 00:29:43.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:45.790
SPARSH SHAH: I would
leave to Mr. Kiko.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.620
KIKO: Listen.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.004
However you want to
try to beat this man.

00:29:49.004 --> 00:29:50.670
SPARSH SHAH: I would
say, you know what?

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:52.320
Let's try doing this.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.570
You have the stuff on the wall.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:58.790
Take like a few seconds to
memorize it as much as you can,

00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.790
right?

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:02.186
And then we do like a face off.

00:30:02.186 --> 00:30:03.060
Does that make sense?

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.220
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.170
SPARSH SHAH: Let me
know when you're ready.

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:05.830
You're ready?

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:06.520
AUDIENCE: I'm ready.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:06.660
OK.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.349
Let's do this.

00:30:07.349 --> 00:30:07.890
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:14.220
3.14159265 and that's it.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.100
SPARSH SHAH: OK.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.360
Good job.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.040
You ready?

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:19.665
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:19.665 --> 00:30:25.440
3.14159265-- you lose me there.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:25.940
KIKO: Woo!

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:26.416

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:32.190
KIKO: [LAUGHS]

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.059
SPARSH SHAH: Me?

00:30:34.059 --> 00:30:35.357
All right.

00:30:35.357 --> 00:30:36.440
This is my humble attempt.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:41.240
No, no way.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.250
Look, it's good, right?

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:43.590
It's all in good fun.

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.710
So that's the great thing.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:46.316

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:21.770
Wait up.

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:22.970
Might want to stay there.

open it up for questions,

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.930
if any of you guys have
any questions for Sparsh.

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:50.180
SPARSH SHAH: Feel free to ask.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:50.846
KIKO: Feel free.

00:32:50.846 --> 00:32:52.840
Mics in both corners over here.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:59.170
SPARSH SHAH: So nobody wants
to know anything else about me?

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:04.130
That is odd, especially
in a building of techno--

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.660
like, such great minds
all assembled here

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.190
in the world's
greatest technology.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.712
OK!

00:33:09.712 --> 00:33:10.670
There, we got somebody!

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.319
[CLAPPING]

00:33:12.319 --> 00:33:14.110
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you could just

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:17.020
talk a little bit about
how you use technology

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.100
and how that helps you.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:21.210
You've demonstrated,
obviously, with music creation.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:24.300
But I know, I mean, you have
a large YouTube following.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:28.510
Just how do you interact with
computers, mobile devices,

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:33.410
those types of things to help
you with your daily activities?

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:34.350
SPARSH SHAH: Ooh.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:38.650
That I would break
down into two things.

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.630
First one, two
words, social media.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:44.800
The second one
would be education.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:49.570
I mean, because now we've got
Google Classroom, Google Docs,

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:51.090
Google Drive, all this stuff.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:59.470
And I don't know what you guys
are thinking about the Google

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:00.730
Drive, Classroom and stuff.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.070
But we're using it.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.720
It's great.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.410
It's a really great platform.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:08.709
We get to use it for keeping
our classes up to date,

00:34:08.709 --> 00:34:09.250
and all that.

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:11.429
So for example, if I need
to look up an assignment

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:13.262
and my teacher has a
Google Classroom thing,

00:34:13.262 --> 00:34:15.909
all I got to do is go on my
phone app and just click it.

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:17.909
It's so efficient the way
you guys have made it.

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:20.290
So first of all,
thanks for that.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:23.590
And second of all,
the social media--

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:28.150
I mean, I've been pretty
active on social media.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:32.710
I mean, Facebook, Instagram,
Twitter, Snapchat, and YouTube.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:37.100
So it's, like, me
trying to build my base.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.500
So that's a great thing.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.469
And I'm able to use social
media to reach people

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:43.219
from all over the world.

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:44.739
So that's a great thing.

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:47.770
Because if I did not
have that ability,

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.020
right, like, if we were
back in the old days

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:55.239
and we didn't have
that kind of ability,

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:56.679
it would take
years for a message

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:59.020
to travel by sea
or boat or whatever

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.690
the case may have been,
even through telegrams

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:03.460
and telegraphs.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:07.120
Now we have an ability to
send a text to someone right

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:12.340
across the world in one click
to live stream things, which

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.880
I know you, probably, guys are
specialized at because you guys

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.270
are like so awesome
with that field.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:22.930
But you know, that's the
great thing about social media

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:26.020
and technology is that I get
to reach so much more people

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:29.860
than I really could have
if I was in the old days.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:33.910
And that's why I feel like
my one billion people dream

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:35.890
is really realistic in my eyes.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:40.370
Because I know I can do it
with the technology I have.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:40.870
Thank you.

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:41.935
Oh, what's your name?

00:35:41.935 --> 00:35:43.132
AUDIENCE: I'm Mac.

00:35:43.132 --> 00:35:43.840
SPARSH SHAH: Mac?

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.500
Mr. Mac?

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:45.347
Nice.

00:35:45.347 --> 00:35:46.180
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:50.590
SPARSH SHAH: And the other
awesome young lady who competed

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:52.019
with me in the pi game--

00:35:52.019 --> 00:35:52.810
what was your name?

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:54.370
AUDIENCE: My name's Emery.

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:55.920
SPARSH SHAH: Miss Emery, nice.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.420
Mr. Mac and Miss Emery.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:57.920
OK.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.378
I will do my best
to remember that.

00:35:59.378 --> 00:35:59.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.420
KIKO: OK, we have
another question.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:02.336
SPARSH SHAH: Oh, sure.

00:36:02.336 --> 00:36:06.260
Yeah, I'm curious what
would you're like in school.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:09.166
Are you in school now and
what subjects do you like?

00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:10.540
And obviously,
you must be pretty

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:12.760
amazing at math and numbers.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.490
And also, like,
what you're good at

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:15.740
and what you're interested in.

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.130
And how much time
you spend with music

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:20.069
and balance that with school?

00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:21.610
SPARSH SHAH: Wow,
very good question.

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:22.109
Thank you.

00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:23.755
Your name?

00:36:23.755 --> 00:36:24.630
AUDIENCE: I'm Jeremy.

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.100
SPARSH SHAH: Mr. Jeremy.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:31.150
So I think I love music.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:33.330
And even as a school
subject, my favorite class

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:34.720
would definitely be music.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.620
Anything to do with that, even
if it's instrumental music.

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:42.490
Because it's, like,
oh, my god, it's crazy.

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:49.930
The connections, that music
has with us as human beings

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:55.080
and us as a core, in our core--

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.410
it's amazing.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:37:00.410
Music can make someone vent.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:01.585
It can make someone cry.

00:37:01.585 --> 00:37:04.720
It can make someone laugh,
make someone smile--

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.740
all at the same time.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.460
And that I think is
very, very powerful.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.090
And in a way, all art is like
that, you know what I mean?

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:15.020
Every art tells a story
in a different form.

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:20.020
And the way I mostly balance
music and school, music

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:24.490
and school, I must say, it's
a very challenging task.

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:27.070
But the main way I
just try to do it

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.860
is taking one day
at a time, you know?

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.740
Take it a minute, day at a time.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:35.400
Because then I can really
break it down and say, yo,

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:39.100
I don't have to
worry about tomorrow.

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:42.260
You keep in mind tomorrow,
but you don't worry about it.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.420
And that really helps.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.350
Because that takes
off a lot of stress

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:48.220
and when I'm going through the
motions of doing my homework

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.140
and stuff and trying
to finish it as fast as

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:52.660
I can so that I can
do my music stuff.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.480
So yeah, I try my best to
spend as much time with music

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.710
as I can.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:58.560
And sometimes it
may not work out.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:03.110
But it's an everlasting
seesaw that I just got

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:06.000
to work out the right way to.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.863
Thank you.

00:38:06.863 --> 00:38:07.690
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:10.062
SPARSH SHAH: Oh, did
you have something else?

00:38:10.062 --> 00:38:10.760
Oh, OK.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:14.212
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:14.212 --> 00:38:14.878
SPARSH SHAH: Hi.

00:38:14.878 --> 00:38:15.920
AUDIENCE: My name's Kat.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:20.410
I want to know what
inspires you to write music.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:22.220
And maybe you can
also talk a little bit

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.070
about what your big
dream is of what impact

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.889
you want your music to have.

00:38:26.889 --> 00:38:28.430
SPARSH SHAH: Wow,
that's a great one.

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:34.820
I think for me, music--

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:39.920
almost every song that
I've written in my life--

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.340
it's come from real
stories in my life.

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:46.940
Basically I tell people that
if you were to take my songs

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.510
and put them in the order, the
exact order they were written,

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.820
they spell the story of my life.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:56.150
Because the way when I write--

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:57.830
that's like my venting place.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:01.160
I can vent out the deepest
feelings that I have,

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.140
the emotions that I have,
and what I'm going through.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:10.467
And so it becomes like a
chronicle of some sort.

00:39:10.467 --> 00:39:12.300
When you look at the
songs and you're, like,

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.674
oh, this is what
Sparsh was going

00:39:13.674 --> 00:39:14.890
through when he wrote this.

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:17.000
Oh, and now this is what
Sparsh is going through.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.470
He moved on from this.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.310
Now he's in something different.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:22.280
And that's really what helped--

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.030
that's what I know.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:27.741
That's how I get
inspired to write music.

00:39:27.741 --> 00:39:29.990
And I think the biggest
effect I want my music to have

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:32.480
is just to inspire people
that, you know what?

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.310
No matter what
you're going through,

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:36.279
what obstacles you have,
if you can believe it,

00:39:36.279 --> 00:39:37.070
you can achieve it.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.740
Nothing's impossible.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.740
Like I said in my Ted talk, if
I could turn impossible into I'm

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.460
possible, you could, too.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.480
So yeah.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.150
AUDIENCE: Hey, Sparsh,
thank you for being here.

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:52.750
It's a real pleasure
to have you here.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:53.839
SPARSH SHAH: Thank you.

00:39:53.839 --> 00:39:55.880
AUDIENCE: And for performing
for us and all that.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.420
I do have a question
for you, which

00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:00.800
is you're, like, a relentlessly
positive person which

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.280
is amazing.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:06.950
You manage to find
positivity in so many things.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:10.110
Do you ever get down?

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:12.130
What gets you down?

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:14.240
If you feel comfortable
sharing with us,

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:14.640
SPARSH SHAH: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.389
AUDIENCE: --sometimes,
like, as an artist,

00:40:16.389 --> 00:40:19.640
does that ever inspire you?

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.430
Or do you find something
in your heart--

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:23.930
do you want to talk
about that ever?

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:24.890
SPARSH SHAH: Of course.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:27.050
I definitely do.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:28.752
Thank you for asking
that question.

00:40:28.752 --> 00:40:30.210
And that's the
great thing about us

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:34.280
as human beings is that we may--

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.390
like this is the thing.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:36.860
We look positive.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.900
We always try to look
positive on the outside.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:42.350
But we have to realize
that we have to let

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:43.970
people be vulnerable sometimes.

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:46.580
Because we all get down.

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.740
Simply put, we all
get down, right?

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:51.280
And usually, what
I told Miss Kat,

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:55.340
right, was that when
I'm writing songs often

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:59.450
it comes from very dark
and sad moments in my life.

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:01.570
As I'm going through
them, that's my vent.

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:05.000
Like, a lot of times I'm going
through situations where I

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.375
really wouldn't--

00:41:06.375 --> 00:41:08.000
instead of talking
to someone about it,

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.560
I would write a song about it.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.570
Because in that way, I
could express my feelings

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:12.860
to the world.

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.540
I could express my
feelings to myself,

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.130
and that's the ironic thing.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:17.270
Because even though
I don't want to talk

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:18.646
to somebody at
the moment, I know

00:41:18.646 --> 00:41:20.520
that I'm going to release
this and everyone's

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.830
going to hear it in the world.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:22.980
But that's the great thing.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.520
Because if there is even
one person out there

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:31.565
who says, oh, my god, that is
exactly what I'm going through.

00:41:31.565 --> 00:41:33.920
Or I understand his pain.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.210
I know where he's coming from.

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:38.859
Then that's all I ever

00:41:38.859 --> 00:41:39.650
AUDIENCE: [SNEEZE].

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:40.760
SPARSH SHAH: --wanted
to do as an artist.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.710
If I could--

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:46.850
God bless you-- if I could
change someone's life like that

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:49.760
and show them the positive
side of everything

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.560
that I went through,
and they know what

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.290
I've been through, that's it.

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:56.730
That's my ultimate goal.

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:57.490
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:58.908
SPARSH SHAH: Of course.

00:41:58.908 --> 00:42:00.780
KIKO: I think we have
one more question.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.071
AUDIENCE: Hi Sparsh, thank
you very much for everything

00:42:03.071 --> 00:42:04.770
you showed us today.

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:07.380
It was inspiring and
super cool as well.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.470
I have a very simple
technical question.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:14.280
So memorizing the
digits of pi so it

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.280
sounded like you were
actually approaching this

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:21.780
through music, as with
everything else in your life,

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:24.330
it's so core, as a filter.

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.910
So is that safe to assume,
that you basically memorized it

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:29.400
as a set of lyrics?

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.200
SPARSH SHAH: Yeah, I rapped pi.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.520
That's literally what I did.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.450
I rapped pi.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.970
You hit the nail on the head.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:40.850
So you know, that's the great
thing about mnemonic devices.

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:45.090
I learned pi through this
song "Pi" by Hard and Firm.

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:48.990
But they only had like
the first 191 digits.

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:51.649
And so after that I
needed to keep on going.

00:42:51.649 --> 00:42:53.190
But then, I was,
like, you know, it's

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:55.680
like every bar has eight digits.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:11.230
So for example, 3.1415926535897
93238462 643383279--

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:12.930
well, that was the odd one out.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:16.350
But that's how I learned pi.

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:18.190
I kept on going with that.

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:19.830
So even after the
song ended, I just

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:22.380
kept on pretending that
the song was going on,

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.250
that it would infinitely loop.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:27.510
And that way I just
kept thinking about it.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:31.050
And then that's when I
realized I could use this

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:32.920
as a great and powerful tool.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.800
Like, I could use
music to remember

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.280
all these things in my life.

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.994
So it was a pretty cool
experience learning it.

00:43:40.994 --> 00:43:41.910
AUDIENCE: Pretty cool.

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:42.743
Thank you very much.

00:43:42.743 --> 00:43:43.830
SPARSH SHAH: Your name?

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:44.955
AUDIENCE: I'm Balint.

00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:46.170
SPARSH SHAH: Say that again?

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:47.270
AUDIENCE: Balint.

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.266
It's B-A-L-I-N-T.

00:43:49.266 --> 00:43:50.160
SPARSH SHAH: Balint.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:50.800
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:51.633
SPARSH SHAH: Balint.

00:43:51.633 --> 00:43:52.590
OK.

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:54.170
I'm trying my best.

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:55.260
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.366
SPARSH SHAH: Of course.

00:43:56.366 --> 00:43:57.990
KIKO: Thank you all
for your questions.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:00.870
And I want to say thank you,
Sparsh, for being here today.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:01.828
SPARSH SHAH: Thank you.

00:44:01.828 --> 00:44:04.220
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]
