00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
So a few months ago, I was celebrating

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.500
a friend's birthday at one of her favorite dive bars

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.140
where you walk in through a fridge.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.560
There's nothing cooler!  Hahaha!

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.440
Get it?  Haha!  There's nothing cooler than walking into the fridge.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.920
Going to get some drinks!

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.700
And I was standing in line, waiting to buy her a drink

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.540
just answering work emails, when this guy said:

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.120
Hi there!  Traveling from Australia.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.180
What are you doing here?

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.860
Oh hi!  Cool.  I'm here for a friend's birthday.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.680
Nice, birthdays.  I'm an engineer.  What do you do?

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.760
Well it's L.A. so I'm an actress and comedian.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.300
Comedian!  That's funny.  Tell me something funny.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.080
Ah, well I don't ask you to engineer on your off-time.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.580
So...

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.460
That's funny.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.880
Freeze frame on this gross invasion of personal space.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.100
Now at this point, you know, my natural inclination

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.780
was to tell him that I had a boyfriend.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.040
Because guys at bars don't normally talk to you

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.280
or touch you unless they're trying to hit on you.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.680
But then I was wondering, do I really need to be

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.520
someone else's property for you to respect me?

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.500
So what's your name?

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.380
Uh, Anna.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.260
Oh, I love that name.  Hanna.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.820
Uh, no it's Anna.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.340
Oh, I'm sorry.  Anna.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.280
Then he did it again.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.780
Now at this point I knew that I wanted to tell him to stop

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.060
but I thought of all the different ways that I could approach it.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.360
Right?  I could be nice.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.500
You seem like a fine, decent person, but that makes me

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.300
feel really uncomfortable so please stop touching me.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.300
I could be mean.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.780
Get the fuck off me you strange man!

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.920
Stranger Danger!  Stranger--

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.400
I could speak for women everywhere.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.280
I know you and other men are going to hide behind

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.980
the excuse of "Oh what?  We can't talk to people anymore?"

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.580
"Conversation starters are evil now?  What a bitch!"

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.680
But you know what?  If your only intent is to get into my pants

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.840
then fuck you.  Because if I were a dude, you wouldn't look at me twice

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.800
and you wouldn't demand that I pay attention to you

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.900
and you wouldn't put your clammy hands all over me

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.480
without my permission.  I am a human being.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.720
Not a piece of meat for you to conquer

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.540
while you're traveling abroad you selfish Australian bastard.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.900
Or I could just speak for myself.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.920
Dislike.  Block.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.800
Instead, I did nothing because my drink ready

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.340
and I grabbed it and I escaped the situation.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.520
But not before he touched me one more time.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.240
And look, I know not all guys are like this, okay?

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.280
I've had plenty of conversations with dudes are parties

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.700
or at bars where they're just looking to have a good time

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.500
and not be creepy and weird.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.420
And I know that this kind of creepy stuff happens to guys too.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.220
Like once in a meeting, my boyfriend was very clearly

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.040
and uncomfortably hit on by a producer.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.040
You know, I've been a big producer in Hollywood for a very long time now

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.380
and I notice a star as soon as I seen one.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.360
I don't know why you're hanging around with her haha!

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.460
You can do everything yourself.  You don't need her.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.300
I've known many a stars in my life

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.620
and they all did whatever they needed to do

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.420
in order to get to where they are--I'm talking

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.960
A-list, B-list, C-list, all the lists, you name it, they're on it.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.020
It just takes one little act of charity.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.540
But this kind of entitlement,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.560
where someon feels like they're owed your body

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.300
or your attention or your time, happens all too often.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.900
And I don't know what the best way to react is.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.680
You know?  Like how do you turn someone down?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.600
What's the best way to clarify that you're not interested?

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.260
Because sometimes a person says:

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.180
Hey, you want to get coffee sometime?

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.660
And you want to be 100% clear and say:

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.500
Yeah sure!  I'd love to catch up as friends.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.440
But their response will be:

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.040
Fuck you!  Why would you think I want to be more

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.680
than friends with you?  You're fat, and ugly and dumb

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.060
and you hurt my ego because you rejected me

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.160
and that is an idea that's foreign to me!

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.980
This is a very weird and complex issue which I don't feel

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.740
like I can accurately distill down to a few minutes.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.760
Especially because it's something that I'm still going through myself.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.240
But if you have any experience with this or any advice,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.600
please let me know.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.180
Because the next time someone feels entitled to my body

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.740
I just might react like this:

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.440
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.240
