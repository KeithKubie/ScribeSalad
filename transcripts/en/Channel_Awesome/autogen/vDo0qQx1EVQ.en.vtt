excuse<00:11:12.960><c> my</c><00:11:13.140><c> only</c><00:11:13.650><c> problem</c><00:11:13.860><c> is</c><00:11:14.040><c> CGI</c><00:11:14.460><c> has</c><00:11:14.580><c> this</c>

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:14.970 align:start position:0%
excuse my only problem is CGI has this
 

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.460 align:start position:0%
excuse my only problem is CGI has this
quality<00:11:15.420><c> of</c><00:11:15.450><c> feeling</c><00:11:15.840><c> like</c><00:11:15.960><c> it's</c><00:11:16.110><c> not</c><00:11:16.260><c> really</c>

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:16.470 align:start position:0%
quality of feeling like it's not really
 

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.430 align:start position:0%
quality of feeling like it's not really
there<00:11:16.860><c> so</c><00:11:17.420><c> even</c><00:11:18.420><c> if</c><00:11:18.540><c> it's</c><00:11:18.690><c> she</c><00:11:18.960><c> supposed</c><00:11:19.290><c> to</c><00:11:19.350><c> be</c>

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
there so even if it's she supposed to be
 

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.020 align:start position:0%
there so even if it's she supposed to be
artificial<00:11:20.070><c> there</c><00:11:20.340><c> was</c><00:11:20.460><c> still</c><00:11:20.670><c> times</c><00:11:20.880><c> I'm</c>

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:21.030 align:start position:0%
artificial there was still times I'm
 

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.610 align:start position:0%
artificial there was still times I'm
like<00:11:21.180><c> yeah</c><00:11:21.780><c> she</c><00:11:21.930><c> just</c><00:11:22.020><c> feels</c><00:11:22.200><c> like</c><00:11:22.320><c> she</c><00:11:22.410><c> was</c>

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
like yeah she just feels like she was
 

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.770 align:start position:0%
like yeah she just feels like she was
digitally<00:11:23.160><c> inserted</c><00:11:23.310><c> in</c><00:11:23.850><c> sometimes</c><00:11:24.360><c> not</c><00:11:24.630><c> all</c>

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:24.780 align:start position:0%

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.900 align:start position:0%

the<00:11:24.900><c> times</c><00:11:25.140><c> but</c><00:11:25.320><c> sad</c><00:11:25.860><c> that's</c><00:11:26.130><c> my</c><00:11:26.400><c> issue</c><00:11:26.610><c> with</c>

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:26.910 align:start position:0%
the times but sad that's my issue with
 

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.370 align:start position:0%
the times but sad that's my issue with
these<00:11:27.030><c> into</c><00:11:27.360><c> the</c><00:11:27.480><c> fight</c><00:11:27.720><c> scenes</c><00:11:27.990><c> or</c><00:11:28.140><c> of</c><00:11:28.230><c> course</c>

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
these into the fight scenes or of course
 

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.170 align:start position:0%
these into the fight scenes or of course
she's<00:11:28.620><c> all</c><00:11:28.770><c> CG</c><00:11:29.190><c> there</c><00:11:29.460><c> I</c><00:11:29.490><c> doubt</c><00:11:29.730><c> there's</c><00:11:29.910><c> even</c>

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
she's all CG there I doubt there's even
 

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.790 align:start position:0%
she's all CG there I doubt there's even
data<00:11:30.510><c> motion</c><00:11:31.020><c> capture</c><00:11:31.290><c> or</c><00:11:31.350><c> anything</c><00:11:31.530><c> and</c><00:11:31.740><c> so</c>

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
data motion capture or anything and so
 

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.650 align:start position:0%
data motion capture or anything and so
like<00:11:32.700><c> they</c><00:11:32.910><c> were</c><00:11:32.970><c> hitting</c><00:11:33.240><c> miss</c><00:11:33.420><c> where</c><00:11:33.600><c> I'm</c>

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
like they were hitting miss where I'm
 

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
like they were hitting miss where I'm
just<00:11:33.810><c> like</c><00:11:33.960><c> oh</c><00:11:34.140><c> no</c><00:11:34.890><c> really</c><00:11:35.220><c> looks</c><00:11:35.400><c> like</c><00:11:35.550><c> she's</c>

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:35.730 align:start position:0%
just like oh no really looks like she's
 

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.640 align:start position:0%
just like oh no really looks like she's
there<00:11:35.910><c> another</c><00:11:36.150><c> time</c><00:11:36.360><c> like</c><00:11:36.750><c> that</c><00:11:37.410><c> when</c><00:11:37.560><c> they</c>

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:37.650 align:start position:0%
there another time like that when they
 

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:38.300 align:start position:0%
there another time like that when they
did<00:11:37.710><c> the</c>

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:38.310 align:start position:0%
did the
 

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.250 align:start position:0%

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
speed up again I feel like there's not

it okay I'll take this every once in a
 

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.700 align:start position:0%
it okay I'll take this every once in a
while<00:11:52.740><c> yeah</c><00:11:54.050><c> there</c><00:11:55.050><c> were</c><00:11:55.140><c> a</c><00:11:55.200><c> couple</c><00:11:55.410><c> there</c>

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:55.710 align:start position:0%
while yeah there were a couple there
 

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.620 align:start position:0%
while yeah there were a couple there
were<00:11:55.860><c> a</c><00:11:55.890><c> couple</c><00:11:56.130><c> of</c><00:11:56.340><c> them</c><00:11:56.460><c> that</c><00:11:56.670><c> were</c><00:11:57.300><c> really</c>

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:57.630 align:start position:0%
were a couple of them that were really
 

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.860 align:start position:0%
were a couple of them that were really
cool<00:11:57.840><c> it</c><00:11:58.200><c> I</c><00:11:58.580><c> mean</c><00:11:59.580><c> anime</c><00:11:59.880><c> has</c><00:12:00.090><c> speed</c><00:12:00.390><c> lines</c><00:12:00.630><c> and</c>

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:00.870 align:start position:0%
cool it I mean anime has speed lines and
 

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.630 align:start position:0%
cool it I mean anime has speed lines and
stuff<00:12:01.050><c> but</c><00:12:01.230><c> I</c><00:12:01.290><c> don't</c><00:12:01.530><c> see</c><00:12:01.890><c> that</c><00:12:01.920><c> particular</c>

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
stuff but I don't see that particular
 

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.030 align:start position:0%
stuff but I don't see that particular
technique<00:12:03.030><c> employed</c><00:12:03.420><c> a</c><00:12:03.780><c> thousand</c><00:12:04.500><c> times</c><00:12:04.740><c> like</c>

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
technique employed a thousand times like
 

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.180 align:start position:0%
technique employed a thousand times like
it<00:12:05.190><c> is</c><00:12:05.310><c> over</c><00:12:05.460><c> here</c><00:12:05.730><c> no</c><00:12:05.880><c> no</c><00:12:06.060><c> okay</c><00:12:06.450><c> here</c><00:12:06.630><c> I</c><00:12:07.200><c> mean</c>

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:08.190 align:start position:0%
it is over here no no okay here I mean
 

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.290 align:start position:0%
it is over here no no okay here I mean
when<00:12:08.310><c> they</c><00:12:08.400><c> do</c><00:12:08.460><c> slow-mo</c><00:12:09.000><c> it's</c><00:12:09.180><c> like</c>

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
when they do slow-mo it's like
 

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.970 align:start position:0%
when they do slow-mo it's like
somebody's<00:12:09.870><c> flying</c><00:12:10.140><c> and</c><00:12:10.410><c> then</c><00:12:10.740><c> you'll</c><00:12:10.890><c> hear</c>

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
somebody's flying and then you'll hear
 

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
somebody's flying and then you'll hear
the<00:12:11.040><c> inner</c><00:12:11.280><c> thought</c><00:12:11.490><c> of</c><00:12:11.640><c> the</c><00:12:11.730><c> person</c><00:12:12.030><c> flying</c>

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:12.210 align:start position:0%
the inner thought of the person flying
 

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
the inner thought of the person flying
and<00:12:12.450><c> the</c><00:12:12.510><c> speed</c><00:12:12.720><c> lines</c><00:12:12.900><c> are</c><00:12:13.050><c> going</c><00:12:13.260><c> it's</c><00:12:13.410><c> like</c>

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:13.530 align:start position:0%
and the speed lines are going it's like
 

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.260 align:start position:0%
and the speed lines are going it's like
well<00:12:13.860><c> technically</c><00:12:14.550><c> that's</c><00:12:14.700><c> not</c><00:12:14.850><c> slow-mo</c>

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:15.270 align:start position:0%
well technically that's not slow-mo
 

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
well technically that's not slow-mo
because<00:12:15.420><c> the</c><00:12:15.510><c> speed</c><00:12:15.720><c> lines</c><00:12:15.870><c> are</c><00:12:15.990><c> going</c><00:12:16.170><c> like</c>

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:16.290 align:start position:0%
because the speed lines are going like
 

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.110 align:start position:0%
because the speed lines are going like
that<00:12:16.320><c> but</c><00:12:16.740><c> if</c><00:12:17.340><c> they're</c><00:12:17.550><c> really</c><00:12:17.730><c> going</c><00:12:17.940><c> that</c>

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
that but if they're really going that
 

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.700 align:start position:0%
that but if they're really going that
fast<00:12:18.300><c> to</c><00:12:18.480><c> be</c><00:12:18.570><c> over</c><00:12:18.780><c> in</c><00:12:18.870><c> a</c><00:12:18.960><c> second</c><00:12:19.380><c> but</c><00:12:19.500><c> somehow</c>

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:19.710 align:start position:0%
fast to be over in a second but somehow
 

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
fast to be over in a second but somehow
they're<00:12:20.010><c> flying</c><00:12:20.220><c> for</c><00:12:20.520><c> a</c><00:12:20.550><c> minute</c><00:12:20.880><c> yeah</c><00:12:21.000><c> that's</c>

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:21.210 align:start position:0%
they're flying for a minute yeah that's
 

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.970 align:start position:0%
they're flying for a minute yeah that's

what you had in the OVA and yeah and a
 

00:30:31.059 --> 00:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
what you had in the OVA and yeah and a
lot<00:30:31.210><c> like</c><00:30:31.480><c> that</c><00:30:31.510><c> doesn't</c><00:30:31.750><c> really</c><00:30:31.990><c> end</c><00:30:32.230><c> they</c>

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:32.470 align:start position:0%

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:35.110 align:start position:0%
like that volume and I think volume one
 

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
like that volume and I think volume one
ends<00:30:35.500><c> where</c><00:30:35.890><c> we</c><00:30:36.340><c> think</c><00:30:36.490><c> like</c><00:30:36.669><c> that</c><00:30:36.880><c> continues</c>

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:37.450 align:start position:0%
ends where we think like that continues
 

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
ends where we think like that continues
into<00:30:37.630><c> volume</c><00:30:37.840><c> two</c><00:30:38.110><c> but</c><00:30:38.350><c> it</c><00:30:38.880><c> yeah</c><00:30:39.880><c> so</c><00:30:40.179><c> so</c><00:30:40.780><c> I</c>
