00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.870
What do you think are some of the best qualities of, good data visualization.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.880
&gt;&gt; So for me, it definitely depends on the purpose of the data visualization.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.166
I tend to draw a distinction between the exploratory and the explanatory.

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:15.962
&gt;&gt; Hm. &gt;&gt; Where exploratory you're really trying to get a sense of wh,

00:00:15.962 --> 00:00:19.930
what the data is, what it can tell you and, it's a process of turning over

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.488
maybe 100 different rocks to try to find those, one or two interesting nuggets.

00:00:24.488 --> 00:00:27.869
Then once you've found the interesting nuggets you're in the explanatory space

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.150
of wanting to then communicate those things to somebody else.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.340
So when it comes to effective data visualization on the exploratory side,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.260
it's about allowing your users to be able to connect things

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.710
in interesting ways and look at data from different angles.

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:46.550
In an unbiased and unleading way.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.040
On the explanatory side which is where I spend most of the time

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.085
in my work teaching and writing, I typically cover five key lessons for success.

00:00:55.085 --> 00:01:00.060
&gt;&gt; Hm. &gt;&gt; So the first is having a really robust understanding of the context.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.640
Who your audience is and what they need to know or do before you

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.282
really even start thinking about how you're going to show the data.

00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:08.110
&gt;&gt; Hm. &gt;&gt; Then when it comes to showing the data,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.870
the second lesson is around choosing an appropriate type of visual.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.810
So you want to think really about what is it you want your audience to do

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.290
with the information, and what sort of graph or other visual types are going to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.970
allow them to do that in the most easy, straightforward fashion?

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.640
Third lesson, is around clutter.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.530
Getting comfortable identifying and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.120
eliminating those things that aren't adding informative value to our visuals.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.118
And cutting those.

00:01:33.118 --> 00:01:35.334
Doing so decreases cognitive load, and

00:01:35.334 --> 00:01:37.754
also causes our data to just stand out more.

00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:41.004
And when it comes to our data standing out more, the fourth lesson is around,

00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:44.270
drawing your audience's attention to where you want them to pay it.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.660
So using color, and size, and placement on page.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.020
Strategically as indicators to your audience that say hey,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.960
this is most important, look here first.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.080
Or this is next most important.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.460
Pay attention here next.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.500
And so on and so forth.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.920
And the final lesson is around story.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.660
For me the most successful explanatory data visualizations,

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.820
make themselves a pivotal point in a story or a narrative that's being told.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.320
&gt;&gt; Hm.
