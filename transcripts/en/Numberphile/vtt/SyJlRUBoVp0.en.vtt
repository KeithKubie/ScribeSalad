00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.880
We talk about the two square theorem.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.640
This concerns prime numbers.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.960
You know, the numbers which are only divisible by 1 and themselves.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:18.060
The question: how to write a prime number as the sum of two squares of natural numbers

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.980
- of positive natural numbers.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.320
The easiest example is: take the prime number 2, the smallest prime number.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.780
You can write this as 1 squared plus 1 squared.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.880
Let's try the next prime, 3.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.700
Well... 1 squared plus 1 squared - obviously not.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.300
1 squared plus 2 squared - already too big, so, no.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.100
Argh.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.740
5, 1 squared plus 2 squared. Works.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.660
Let's do this

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.140
Fourth example: 7.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.940
You try 1 squared plus...

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.440
6, 6 is not a square...

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.580
2 squared is 4, plus 3, 3 is not a square.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.580
Uh, we see it's not possible.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.640
And the question is:

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.980
Do there exist natural numbers,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.460
x and y,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.840
such that p is x squared plus y squared.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.420
We're asking for a simple criterion

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.800
which for an arbitrary prime number

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.620
we know that there are arbitrarily large prime numbers, say,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.660
with 10 million digits.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.560
You tell me or I tell you

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.480
can be written as the sum of 2 squares

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.300
or not.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.980
And if the prime number is so large

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.260
we cannot try it out like we did with the small primes

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.660
Brady: "Are we looking here for a formula, or, like, a way to get those squares, or just...?"

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.940
No. Impossible. That would be great.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.680
Nobody knows a formula.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.280
You, you can only decide if you have good luck

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.220
whether it is possible at all, not a formula

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.860
which gives you x and y.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.600
If you would give me some prime number, say you search on the internet

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.360
for large prime numbers,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.680
you give me one and then tell professor, now tell me yes or no,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.140
and then, within a second I will tell you yes or no.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.140
Brady: "But you won't be able to tell me what those squares are."

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.480
Absolutely not. Nobody will be able. Not only me.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.520
I suggest that we look into the history briefly.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.680
Who did this first? This is the famous French mathematician

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.860
Pierre de Fermat, who did other important things, and he liked such easy to formulate problems

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.380
And what did he do with these problems?

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.980
He made tests. He made long tables.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.380
So he took, we have here four primes,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.680
he took the primes up to hundred,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.500
the primes up to thousand,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.620
wrote down this list

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.580
and checked by hand, case by case.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.800
If you do that, we can, we should show such a list,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.600
at the first glance you don't see any pattern.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.940
But Fermat finally observed a very very simple rule.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.680
And that's already his theorem which I write down now.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:26.640
Prime number p is the sum of two squares if and only if

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:34.160
we subtract 1 from p, get a nice number, if this number is divisible by 4.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.240
That means you can make a very very simple test. So let's consider small prime.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.540
Let's say 17.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.940
We subtract one, we get 16. Ah!

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.240
Divisible by four? It works. And now we check, is it really true?

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.700
And we see, ah, 17 is 4 times 4 plus 1 times 1, true.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:05.400
Let's consider 23, other nice prime. We subtract 1, get 22, not divisible by 4

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:13.040
So, I, you can try it yourself at home, you will not be able to write it as the sum of two squares.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.980
And the remarkable thing is this is an easy test to subtract, and to check whether it's divisible by 4.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.420
It's very easy, and you can try now on the internet, write down huge prime numbers

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.940
subtract 1, try to divide by 4, and you know, here you go, and you will not be able to find x and y.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.220
He saw it and he tested it again and again.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.360
We don't know whether he wrote down a proof.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.260
He said it's a theorem.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.960
But he is famous for this.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.180
He likes, when he was convinced that something is true, he probably believed in God

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.200
and in the order in the world, and he said,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.600
if I see this so often, it must be true.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.580
So he wrote down theorem, but without proof.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.300
And the mathematicians after him wondered about the proof. Very good mathematicians, and could not do it.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.760
Hundred years later, the Swiss mathematician Euler gave the first proof.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.080
A tricky proof.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.240
Complicated. Too complicated for this video. First proof.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.160
Then, fifty years later, Gauss gave a completely different proof.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.240
Seventy years later, Dedekind gave again a completely different proof.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.740
So the mathematicians like to give different proofs of the same theorem because of

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.300
every proof sheds light on the statement,

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.580
and all these proofs shed different light on the statement.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.560
So that's, all these proofs are too complicated even to speak about that here.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:59.840
But about fifteen years ago, the mathematician Don Zagier from Bonn gave the famous one sentence proof.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.800
And that we are going to talk about.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.200
Brady: "One sentence?!"

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.600
In one sentence. Of course you will see for an ingenious mathematician like Zagier,

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.500
it can be done in one sentence.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.000
For ordinary mathematicians like me, I need already ten sentences.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.420
And for ordinary people we will add a few more.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.740
...numbers in particular positive numbers. Because of if you would have infinitely many solutions

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.120
then these numbers would get arbitrarily large.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.600
And p is a fixed number, so we would get on the right side numbers which are larger than p.
