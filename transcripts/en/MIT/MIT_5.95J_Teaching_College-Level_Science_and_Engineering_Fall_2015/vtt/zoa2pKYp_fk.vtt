JANET RANKIN: Well, active
learning is the idea

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.660
that students, to
really learn something,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.100
to really understand something
have to be actively involved

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.250
and that just sitting passively
and listening to a lecture

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.610
really doesn't help students
develop the higher order

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.890
cognitive processes that
they need to really,

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.720
really understand something.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.600
So you can listen to something,
you can watch a movie,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.060
you can watch TV, and you
can generally get the plot.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.310
But if you're asked to
recall specific details

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.360
or to even explain a
particular nuance associated

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.960
with the TV show or movie,
you can't really do it.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.150
And that's what happens
often in a lecture,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.240
is that students will
sit in the lecture,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.080
they'll write down
what's being said,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.930
but they're not really
engaged with the material.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.160
So active learning is this
idea of, people say minds on,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.190
always hands on sometimes.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.460
So students have to be actively
with their mind thinking

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.190
about the material,
applying what's being said,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.500
and given opportunities
within the lecture

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.990
to apply what's being
taught or the topic at hand.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.530
And then active learning,
strictly speaking

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.050
means that just one particular
individual is active.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.530
Interactive, we tend to parse
that a little bit and say

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.230
interactive learning would mean
the student has been active

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.240
in his or her own mind in
thinking about the material,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.110
but then is also interacting
with others, peers

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.510
or potentially the
faculty member or TA

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.740
in order to further
develop understanding,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.620
construct meaning for the topic.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.430
I always start maybe the
second session of the class.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.190
The second class
meeting is a discussion

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.020
of what we know about
how people learn.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.080
So a discussion
of the literature

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.780
and the research on human
cognition and learning.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.530
And if you take a
constructivist point of view

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.440
or a constructionist point
of view, which really says

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.900
that as I said
before, to understand,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.539
people have to make
meaning of a topic,

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.000
they have to construct
their own meaning.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.110
And we show the research that
really shows that this is true.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.600
For higher level
cognitive processes,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.530
people have to be
actively engaged.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.010
And there's research
to show that.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.830
We also show the
classroom-based research,

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.460
so [? Freeman's ?]
2014 paper that

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.110
was a meta-analysis of
this 225 other studies that

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.190
showed that in courses, in
college-level courses where

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.410
active learning
was used, there was

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.630
a 12% decrease in
the failure rate.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.930
And they normalized it to
all of the important factors

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.580
that they should
be normalized to--

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.440
the experience of
the instructor,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.050
the size of the class, the
type of the institution,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.180
the position that the class
is situated within the larger

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.380
curriculum.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.660
And across the
board it was shown

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.960
that there was a 12% decrease
on average of the failure rate.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.200
And they make a
comment in the paper

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.180
that if that had been a
clinical trial of a drug

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.020
and 12% of the people on
the drug had [? shown ?]

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.410
marked improvement, they would
have had to stop the trial

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.330
and give everyone the drug.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.320
So this idea that there's a
12% decrease in the failure

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.045
rate in courses that use
active learning, to me

00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:27.670
is pretty compelling
that we should all

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.170
be using active learning.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.510
So whenever possible, because
our students are MIT students,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.090
we use data, we
use the research,

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.600
and we try to find really good
research, solid research that

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.840
shows the way people
learn and then

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.590
how to support that with
specific classroom practices.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.860
So many of the students
haven't had the experience

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.182
of being in a class where
active learning was used,

00:03:53.182 --> 00:03:54.640
so they don't really
understand it.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.360
So when we start to talk
about it as a way of teaching,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.590
they may not really get it.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.430
So throughout the course,
from the first class

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.860
all the way through,
I try to use

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.410
several different types
of active learning

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.150
exercises each class.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.100
So the students
themselves are actively

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.500
engaged with the material
from the first day.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.320
So I may have them
break into pairs

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.170
and discuss a particular
topic or identify

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.800
something they didn't understand
from the pre-class readings.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.957
And then after three
minutes, they can either

00:04:26.957 --> 00:04:28.540
share their comments
with someone else

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.771
or maybe we just report
out to the larger group.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:34.270
If they just report, if they
just write down and then report

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.670
back, that's a pretty good
example of active learning.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.880
It's pretty simple,
it's what you

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.440
might call low-hanging
fruit in terms

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.080
of what it takes for a
faculty member to do that.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.850
So I'll do that, I'll
have them do that.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.340
And then I step
back and say, OK,

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.045
why did I ask you
to think about it?

00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:51.670
Why did I ask you to
take three minutes

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.170
before we had this discussion?

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.080
So I try to deconstruct
the exercise for them,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.300
showing them the
advantages for the learner.
