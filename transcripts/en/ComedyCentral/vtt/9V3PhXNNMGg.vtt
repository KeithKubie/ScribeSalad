00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:03.636
As we all know, Kevin is
one of the biggest movie stars

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.606
in the business right now,
and he deserves it.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.641
He struggled for years.

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:11.411
When he finally got
his first big paycheck,

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:15.648
he spent $150,000
on a watch.

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:18.518
I forget that term for that.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.953
It's not
"African-American rich."

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:22.688
It'll come to me.

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.958
[cheers and applause]

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.232
Justin,
you know the word.

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:35.868
I know you're all wondering
why I'm here tonight.

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:38.838
It's because Martha Stewart
changes people's lives

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:42.642
for the better,
like Shaq for instance.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:46.879
When Shaq bought his house--
Shaq, are you listening?

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:49.415
I was the first person
he called.

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:52.819
The house had 13 bedrooms,
and I helped convert 8 of them

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:57.590
into refrigerators.

00:00:57.623 --> 00:01:00.259
I believe the bedroom
is the most important room

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:03.096
in the house, but I don't
have to tell you that, Ludacris.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.532
You have three kids
with three different women.

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:09.936
May I suggest pulling out
sometime, and finishing

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:14.774
on some fine, highly absorbent
Martha Stewart bed linens?
