00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:18.968
JAMES MCLURKIN: All right.

00:00:30.192 --> 00:00:32.720
How tall is the Space Needle?

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.960
DEVICE: The Space
Needle is 605 feet tall.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.850
JAMES MCLURKIN: What
does a train sound like?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.849
DEVICE: This is a train.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.150
[CHUGGING]

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.180
So the goal of AIY Projects is
to get a AI out to everybody,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.910
being able to build
a tool that takes

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.540
really powerful, sophisticated
artificial intelligence

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.290
and reduces it down to
literally a cardboard box.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.970
The possibilities are limitless.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.894
[BEEPING]

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.597
You do need to add a
little bit of software

00:01:05.597 --> 00:01:07.430
in order to tailor it
to do exactly what you

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.850
want to do, to look for the
words that you want to find.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.290
After that, you
need to connect it

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.630
to what you want to control--

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.770
train, fast--

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.690
[TRAIN WHIRRING]

--motors or light or
turbos or anything else

00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:24.890
that you can control with
an electrical signal.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.750
[TRAIN WHIRRING]

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.480
It literally is
just that simple.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.940
If you can plug wires
into a circuit board,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.040
then you can connect a
motor to the voice kit.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.516
Train, stop.

00:01:35.516 --> 00:01:37.380
[TRAIN WHIRRING]

[WHIRRING STOPS]

00:01:39.244 --> 00:01:41.110
There we go.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.320
So we built this kit for
makers, for people like you

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.330
who love building stuff,
who love tinkering,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.967
who love taking things apart,
who love making things better.

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:51.550
So I want to know what the users
are going to build and to see

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.720
where they take it.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.170
