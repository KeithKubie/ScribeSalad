00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.517
-Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:10.517 --> 00:00:11.100
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.391
I'm dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:13.391 --> 00:00:16.590
And I am delighted to welcome
you here this afternoon

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.240
for this lecture by
Khalil Gibran Muhammad.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.950
First I want to tell you a
few words about Radcliffe.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.600
At Radcliffe, we bring
together, scholars

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.370
and scientists and
artists who break

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.440
new ground within their own
fields, but more importantly,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.830
who cross disciplinary
boundaries

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.310
to make an impact
that transcends

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.820
any one subject area.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.320
And we are dedicated to sharing
the fruits of their work

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.940
with broad public audiences in
person, like today, and online.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.750
Each year, for example, we host
our annual gender conference,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.480
in which we examine
an important topic

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.810
through the lens of gender.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.340
This year's gender
conference is called

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.450
"Ways with Words-- Exploring
Language and Gender."

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.060
Radcliffe is an
intellectual community

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.530
dedicated to inquiry
and to action,

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.580
with its own preeminent research
library, the Schlesinger.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.360
These qualities make
Radcliffe the ideal place

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.770
to host a lecture by
Khalil Muhammad, who

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.300
is a scholar, a public figure,
and the current director

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.400
of another major
research library.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.810
We often hear about
the elusive figure

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.030
of the public intellectual.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.410
And even more often, we hear
laments about the disappearance

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.630
of the public intellectual.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.530
But Khalil actually is one.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.510
And last I checked, he is
still here, alive and kicking.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.860
He currently directs the
Schomburg Center for Research

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.760
in Black Culture at the
New York Public Library,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.820
one of the leading research
facilities dedicated

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.970
to the study of the
African diaspora.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.480
He is also a historian and a
visiting professor at the City

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.660
University of New York.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.590
And before that,
he was a professor

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.080
of History at
Indiana University.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.320
Moreover, Khalil is
a public intellectual

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.420
you will be seeing around these
parts more often in the future,

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.070
because he will be joining the
Harvard community next year

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.780
as Professor of History,
Race, and Public

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.710
Policy at the Harvard
Kennedy School,

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.130
and as a Suzanne Young Murray
professor at the Radcliffe

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.310
Institute.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.530
We are very grateful
to Sue Murray, who's

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.400
sitting over here, for her
generous and enthusiastic

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.380
support of Radcliffe's mission.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.840
And I am so pleased that she
could be with us here tonight

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.120
to welcome Khalil.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.610
Radcliffe professors are
distinguished scholars

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.580
recruited to Harvard with
a very special invitation--

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.910
to join a home school as
well, and be a Harvard faculty

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.560
member there, and to
participate in Radcliffe's

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.140
unique interdisciplinary
community.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.360
In Khalil's case, the Suzanne
Young Murray professorship

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.350
will help him return
to intensive immersion

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.840
in archival research
and scholarship

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.570
after a number of years
serving as intellectual leader

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.370
and administrator of
the Schomburg Center.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.760
Khalil will now
have the opportunity

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.390
to return to research in
manuscript collections

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.110
after working so hard to
collect and preserve them.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.860
And I have to say that
as an historian myself

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.660
in my fifth year as Radcliffe
dean, I'm pretty jealous.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.860
We hope that while
Khalil is here

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.200
at Radcliffe, which he will
actually be here next year,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.700
he will draw on the
unsurpassed staff and resources

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.280
of our own Schlesinger
Library in doing his research.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.160
Throughout his career, Khalil
has brought scholarship

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.460
and public policy together.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.140
He regularly turns a historians
sharp eye and sensitive ear

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.780
to major issues of our day.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.346
His first book, The Condemnation
of Blackness-- Race, Crime,

00:04:08.346 --> 00:04:12.460
and the Making of
Modern Urban America,

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.300
examines how sociologists
in the early 20th century

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:22.089
worked to shift explanations for
crime away from innate biology

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:25.810
and toward economic
and cultural factors.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.470
But their efforts backfired
for African Americans

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.470
because they resulted in
widespread association

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.280
of black culture
with criminality.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.230
That stereotyping,
in turn, made it

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.210
easier for whites to perpetuate
racism and systematically

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.430
deny rights to black Americans.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.080
The Condemnation of Blackness
won critical acclaim,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.570
a wide public audience, and the
2011 John Hope Franklin Best

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.290
Book Award in American Studies.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.080
Its relevance today is obvious.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.350
In recent months,
daily headlines

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.850
have transported us from the
streets of Ferguson, Missouri

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.030
and Cleveland,
Ohio into the cell

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.310
blocks of Waller County, Texas.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.620
We have encountered movements
like Black Lives Matter

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.110
and we've watched protests
unfold from city blocks

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.820
to college campuses.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.860
Khalil's deep research into
how ideas about race and crime

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.680
circumscribe opportunities
for African-Americans

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.020
is both timely and
timelessly important.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.080
Khalil also helps
us attend to some

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.580
of our own specific priorities
right here in Radcliffe yard.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.080
In fact, even before the
Radcliffe professorship arose,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.040
Jane Kamensky, our new
Pforzheimer Faculty Director

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.900
of the Schlesinger
Library and a Professor

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.550
of History at Harvard,
had identified Khalil

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.670
as someone uniquely
equipped to help us

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.210
with our goal of diversifying
the Schlesinger Library's

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.650
manuscript holdings-- to
ensure that they document

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.910
a wide ranging history of
women and gender in America.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.820
With that aim in
mind, Jane invited

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.400
Khalil to come and consult
on building our collections

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.960
and to deliver
this lecture today.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.980
So when Khalil accepted
Harvard and Radcliffe's offer

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.300
to join us as a professor,
we had the good fortune

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.700
of having already
scheduled this visit.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.440
Thus today has become
a kind of welcome

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.120
to what I hope will be
Khalil's long and happy career

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.210
at Harvard.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.320
I could not be more pleased.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.230
So now I'll turn
things over to Jane.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.176
Thanks.

00:06:42.176 --> 00:06:44.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.840
-Good afternoon, everybody.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.220
Let me add my welcome to
Liz's and to share with you

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.670
the Schlesinger Library's
tremendous sense

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.960
of excitement and pride
in hosting Dr. Khalil

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.010
Muhammad here this afternoon.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.530
I'm keenly aware that
my remarks are now

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.080
all that stand between you and
his talk, so I'll be brief.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.970
I want to concentrate on an
aspect of Muhammad's profile

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.120
that we mustn't
lose sight of as we

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.280
celebrate his many other
striking accomplishments.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.110
And that's his librarianship--
or to be more precise,

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.570
his work as director since
mid-2011 of the New York Public

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.650
Library Schomburg Center for
Research in Black Culture.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.710
And I'm going to use the
word transformative a lot,

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.590
which is a kind of term of
art in the Academy often

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.790
overused and, in this
case, actually true.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.000
So Liz has given you a little
of the back story here,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.950
that early last fall, right
after I got to Schlesinger,

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.430
we invited Khalil to visit
Radcliffe this winter.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.390
And did so in utter
ignorance that he would soon

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.460
become our colleague.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.376
Many of my best ideas are
done in utter ignorance.

00:08:00.376 --> 00:08:01.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.160
Our invitation was part
of an ongoing process

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.240
of strategic planning
to widen the diversity

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.700
and deepen the inclusiveness
of our archival holdings,

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.880
a process that my
wonderful colleagues had

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.100
set in motion about three
years before I showed up

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.330
to take credit for it.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.330
That planning got an infusion
of energy and expertise

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.430
from a conference
in October 2014

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.410
that Khalil put
together at Schomburg

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.770
called "The State of Black
Research Collections."

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.710
That gathering investigated the
crucial role that institutions

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.679
collecting African-American
and African diasporic materials

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.590
play in the future
of the humanities,

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.290
as well as the extraordinary
pressures on such institutions

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:49.880
today and creative solutions to
fight against those pressures.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.690
That conference connected two
of my Schlesinger colleagues

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.480
to two stellar curators,
one from Spelman

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.270
and one from the Library
Company of Philadelphia,

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:03.040
who have since come to Cambridge
to share their strategic acumen

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.940
with us.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.480
So Khalil's visit to
Schlesinger yesterday,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.700
and earlier today we've been now
running him hard for 36 hours,

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.340
is in many ways the
capstone of a project

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.120
that he himself catalyzed
through his work at Schomburg.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.540
As you've heard from
Liz and will hear again

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.190
in a few minutes, Muhammad's
major scholarly work

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.100
has centered on the relationship
between quantitative and

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.390
racial, indeed racist,
regimes of thought and policy.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.160
His prize winning 2010 book
Condemnation of Blackness

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.340
documents the pernicious uses of
statistical methods and claims

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.200
to create a discourse of black
criminality, a language that

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.260
emerged in the half
century after 1890

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.900
and that we continue
to live inside today.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.470
As you know, Khalil's
topic for this afternoon

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.750
is how numbers lie.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.360
So it is with some
trepidation that I

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.490
want to give you the
story of his leadership

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.350
at Schomburg by the numbers.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.400
He has raised the
library's profile

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.170
through a social
media strategy that

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.630
includes Twitter feeds with
a combined 25,000 followers

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.590
and a Facebook community
over 45,000 strong.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.940
He has ceded a
substantial increase

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.620
in media coverage
of the Center's work

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:28.140
from, by LexisNexis, 331
newspaper articles mentioning

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:34.330
Schomburg between
2005 and 2010 to 481

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.580
since he took the helm
in mid-2011-- a growth

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.630
rate of nearly 50%
which does not include,

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.330
by the way, last week's
gorgeous New Yorker

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.190
cover titled "Schomburg
Center, Harlem, New York."

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.050
In the crucial realm
of donor support,

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.480
Khalil maintained the
Schomburg's enduring

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.650
relationship with
Ford and Rockefeller

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.190
and New York City and
other important funders

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.190
while bringing in new
resources from foundations

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.170
and individuals, including
Schomburg's largest

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.610
ever individual
donation, a $2.5 million

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.390
gift from Ruth and Sidney
Lapidus to establish and endow

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.220
the Lapidus Center for
the Historical Analysis

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.450
of Transatlantic Slavery.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.900
Over all, he increased
fund raising enough

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.670
that he could grow an annual
budget to nearly twice the size

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.860
of the one that he inherited.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.180
Khalil brought the
community into the center

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.430
and has taken the center even
deeper into its community.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.460
Under his leadership, Schomburg
has experienced a 26% increase

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.820
in overall attendance
in the last three years

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.250
and a 39% increase in
program attendance.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:47.170
He has spearheaded a $22 million
renovation project, which

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.370
will break ground
just as he's leaving

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:53.060
and will serve as a monument
to his directorship for decades

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.010
to come-- all of this as
a denominator over less

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.500
than five years.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.970
These numbers, I
submit, don't lie.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:02.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.410
Of course, they also don't
tell the whole story.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:10.220
Muhammad's phenomenal success
as Director of the Schomburg

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.130
is a product of expansive
vision and relentless energy.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.850
And truly I'm exhausted by just
a day and a half with the man.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.630
Under his leadership, the Center
has held pioneering exhibitions

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.650
on topics ranging from black
gay life to the 50th anniversary

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.100
of the March on Washington
to the Obama presidency.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.320
He has innovated in
public programming,

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.430
in the arts, politics,
and popular culture,

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:38.370
as well as continuing to
promote scholarly research.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.270
Recent Schomburg
events have featured

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.770
speakers as diverse as
Tim Boland and Eric Foner

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.740
and topics ranging
from marronage

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.150
in the 18th and 19th
century Caribbean

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.440
to the life of radical black
feminist Florence "Flo" Kennedy

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.540
whose papers, if you'll
forgive me a plug here,

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.810
the Schlesinger holds.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.230
Over the last two
days alone while he's

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:03.850
visiting with us at Radcliffe,
Khalil has missed lectures

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.200
on black conservatism by
our colleague Leah Wright

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.440
Rigueur and the
premiere of Dapline,

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.800
a choreographic collaboration
centered on the dap

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.430
as a conduit for black identity,
solidarity, and history.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:22.180
Among many other aspects of
his innovative programming,

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:26.560
Khalil has raised the profile
of women, gender, and sexuality

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.070
among a menu of topics that
I think had traditionally

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.060
skewed somewhat less
intrasectionally and somewhat

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.310
more heroically male.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:39.040
Equally significant as these
marquee public events which

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.430
feature regularly
in the Times society

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:45.410
pages are the programs
Muhammad Schomburg undertakes

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.000
with New York City school
children from kindergarten

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.750
through college.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:54.150
This includes not just class
visits, but dedicated calendar

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.360
spaces like the Junior
Scholars Initiative, which

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.520
brings high schoolers interested
in black history and culture

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.010
to the Schomburg on Saturday
mornings for a long program,

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.940
thus undertaking the
crucial work of sustaining

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.250
black history and building the
pipeline of scholars of color

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.630
from the pre-collegiate
level upwards.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.160
In all of these ways,
Muhammad forged the Schomburg

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.250
into a very rare
kind of powerhouse--

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.480
an institution that hones
the cutting edge of research

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.020
by supporting advanced study
at the very highest level

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:35.150
and by nourishing deep
sustained community engagement.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.510
I will not win any
friends here today

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.450
by admitting that my
first response when

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.132
I heard that Khalil had accepted
the offer to join us at Harvard

00:14:44.132 --> 00:14:47.450
was to feel just a
little bit guilty.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.740
I quote the Amsterdam News,
the great Harlem newspaper

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.900
from last December--
"In recent weeks,

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:59.060
the Harlem community has been
stunned by a series of shocks

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.280
in which Muhammad's
announced departure figured

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.330
as the latest and perhaps
the gravest of several."

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.380
But as Khalil told
that reporter,

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.060
he leaves the Schomburg far
stronger than he found it.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.560
And perhaps most
important to us,

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.130
he's bringing the
Center's agenda

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.310
to Cambridge, where
he will continue

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.730
to forge the model of
the public intellectual

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.330
as community engaged
scholar, who demonstrates

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.730
that the cutting edge
and the neighborhood

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.820
are closer together
than we often think.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.970
I feel so privileged
to live and work

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.680
in Khalil Muhammad's
intellectual and institutional

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.800
neighborhood now.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.580
And I'm delighted to welcome him
to Radcliffe, not just today,

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.860
but for the future.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.310
Thank you.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:53.086 --> 00:15:54.210
-Thank you very much, Jane.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:16:00.080
I am totally embarrassed
and entirely grateful

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.610
for the very warm
and gracious welcome.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.110
I really appreciate that.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.370
To Dean Cohen, thank you
for your leadership here.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.520
As I've said to many
people since we've

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.250
gotten to know each other that
one of the first books that I

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.090
read was her first book.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:21.150
And Making of-- I've
forgotten the name.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.000
Making the New Deal.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:22.610
That's right.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.160
I always remember the
term welfare capitalism.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.680
And these parlor immigrants
who surrounded themselves

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.700
with the accouterments
of the bourgeoisie, which

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.660
was groundbreaking in
its way of disrupting

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.060
the usual bromides of labor,
history, and social history.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.830
So made a difference.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.930
And to be here in this moment,
to be part of this community,

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.200
and to be able to be
part of her leadership

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.100
is very special to me.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.810
I also want to
say to Sue Murray,

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.150
thank you very much for
your generosity as a donor

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.710
to the Radcliffe Institute.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:56.300
I know how important it
is for these institutions

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.900
to depend on generous people.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.110
And I am grateful that I
benefit from your generosity.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.380
To my colleagues in
the library world,

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.859
to Marilyn Dunn and her
leadership at the Schlesinger

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:10.579
Library, you've done
a magnificent job

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:11.700
over the past 10 years.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.700
You have an amazing
staff of people.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:18.810
And I know that Jane appreciates
having great morale and a team

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.869
of people who work really hard.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:24.210
In all the ways
that Jane described,

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.329
the Schomburg Center's
success by the numbers--

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:29.220
which I appreciate the dig--
partly what I will say,

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.175
I will explain lying.

00:17:30.175 --> 00:17:31.800
I have all sorts of
disclaimers, right?

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.140
But I got you here
in the audience.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.360
But to the extent that I get
to take any credit for what

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.250
has happened at the
Schomburg Center,

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.270
I take credit because people
show up to work every day

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.920
and are passionate and committed
to an institution that's

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.260
90 years old.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.810
And we carry forward the
responsibility that we inherit.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.940
And we try to do the best
that we can to inspire others

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.610
so that one day they get to
step into those shoes as well.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.700
And I certainly got
that spirit with regard

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.166
to your leadership at
the Schlesinger Library.

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:05.290
I see a number of colleagues
at the Kennedy School.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.079
And at the risk of
leaving anyone out,

00:18:08.079 --> 00:18:10.120
I'll just say thank you
very much for being here.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.650
Thank you for selecting
me to be at the school

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.140
to be a colleague of yours,
to the graduate students, some

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.320
of whom I saw earlier, and
to so many others who I

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.630
am meeting for the first time.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.296
Even if I'm a peer
and you're out there,

00:18:22.296 --> 00:18:24.600
I hope that we get a
chance to talk later.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.660
I see Alex.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.540
Thanks, Alex, for coming.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.900
And finally, to
family and friends.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.241
There are old friends and new
friends here in the audience.

00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:34.740
The person who
taught me how to make

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.480
blueberry pancakes
as a nine-year-old

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.680
is literally in the room.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.860
So this feels very
special to me.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.860
Well, anyone who's heard
me lecture on my book,

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.210
and you heard all those great
things that I did at Schomburg,

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.300
so you'll bear with
me that I am mostly

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.690
delivering a lecture
here inspired by the The

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.340
Condemnation of Blackness.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.110
The great part about
the book for me

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.950
is that it makes a lot
of different arguments

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.680
and works with a lot
of primary material.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.410
And it's always in
conversation with the present--

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:12.870
sometimes attenuated,
sometimes very directly.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.360
But nevertheless, I'm still
inspired to talk about it.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.050
So if you've heard me talk about
The Condemnation of Blackness

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.067
before, you might get
something new today.

00:19:21.067 --> 00:19:22.900
And if not, well, thank
you for showing up--

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.120
Anyhow.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.850
The last thing I'll
say as a disclaimer--

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:32.150
I am happy to talk about
the scholarly inspiration,

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:37.650
the literature review that
inspired this work during Q&amp;A,

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.140
if you're interested.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.990
But I won't roll
it back in the way

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.800
that I might before
a scholarly audience.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.070
I think we've got a
pretty mixed crowd here.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.400
And lastly, there's
a lot of text.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.710
I have played with
presentation over the years

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.090
and one of the
things that I find

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:56.270
is that rather than reading
either complicated thoughts

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.980
and showing you an image
to go along with it,

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.900
I think that people can
stew with the words.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.670
Words matter.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:03.510
Ideas matter.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.990
In some ways, that is
of the heart and soul

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:07.240
of this research.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.190
"How Numbers Lie--
Intersectional Violence

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:13.070
and the Quantification of Race."

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.160
The first part of
this story opens

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.830
with the assent of the
use of quantitative data

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:22.510
to assess the demographic
health and welfare

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.920
of groups across the world.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.620
This is often commonly
determined through literatures

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.120
on the emergence of eugenics,
the science of breeding

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.870
better races, partly a
consequence of the evolution

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:40.750
of capitalism in Europe, also
concerned about population

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:41.510
control.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.600
But this is the age
of science and reason.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.160
And out of that age
of science and reason,

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.780
statistics become a
mainline instrument

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.000
for assessing who is
doing well and who

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.870
is doing poorly in society.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:59.520
African-Americans, as a group
within a larger constellation

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.520
of global populations
moving hither and yon,

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.030
emerge out of a
specific moment having

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:10.070
to do with the end or
collapse of slavery in America

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:13.570
as a result of the end
of the Civil War in 1865.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.160
There is tremendous
instability of thought

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.890
about what these people
are actually made of.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.590
And the very questions
that turn on whether or not

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.210
African-Americans are
endowed with the capacity

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:31.030
to fully participate
in a civilized society

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:35.520
turns, in part, on the
received wisdom of the past--

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.280
having to do with
anthropological assessments

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.110
of Africa, having to
do with religious ideas

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.400
about multiple
species of humanity,

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.290
and perhaps more germane
to this conversation,

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:53.440
having to do with the physical
or the constitutional makeup

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.580
of African-Americans or
people of African descent.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.760
Haiti and Jamaica,
for example, also

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.030
get thrown in as
historical examples

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:05.650
of what happens when black
people are handed or forced

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:09.960
themselves into leadership
of independent nations.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.530
All of these ideas, however,
were hotly contested,

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:17.000
north and South, black
and white, regionally.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.940
And therefore it wasn't
until roughly the emergence

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:26.530
of a US-based statistical
reasoning that happens right

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.390
about 1890s.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.370
And one of the progenitors
of this idea, he

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.120
was-- for many white
Americans-- a kind

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.870
of Ta-Nehisi Coates of popular
writing for the Atlantic

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:39.950
Monthly in the
late 19th century.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.330
His name was Nathaniel Shaler.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.980
He also was a Harvard
paleontologist

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.600
and a very
well-respect individual

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.700
who contributed great bodies
of knowledge, some of which

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.890
had to do with some of the
earliest writings calling

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:58.640
for statistics to resolve
these debates about who

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.180
black people were and what
were they in fact capable of.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.350
So here we hear Shaler
saying statistics

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.830
will lead the way to a true
understanding of black people's

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.540
true racial capacity.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.630
I often use the term bookmark to
call your attention to holding

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:17.160
onto an idea because where we
start is, as you can guess,

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.690
where we will finish.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.070
But this ultimate
idea that statistics

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.760
will help us to
solve these problems

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.620
has been the governing idea
of positivism or empiricism,

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.970
particularly within the field
of demographics and race

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.120
since this time period.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:38.170
Just for illustrative purposes,
Nathaniel Shaler was not alone.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:42.030
Richard Mayo-Smith, who
had the enviable job

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:45.130
of actually establishing
the discipline

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.930
of statistical
research, writing here

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.770
for the Association
for the Statistical

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.780
Association of America,
an article in 1893,

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.470
"Statistical Data
for the Assimilation

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.070
of Races and Nationalities."

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:01.240
There is no origin
story, no genealogy,

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.110
about the use of
quantitative data

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:08.050
to assess demographic groups
that does not turn on race.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.780
So there's no point of recovery.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.030
This is not a
point of departure.

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.250
This is the foundation
of how we come

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:19.640
to think about demographics as
a way of measuring communities.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.140
Fast forward to the
future and we're

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.700
going to play with
this back and forth.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.540
This is, in some
ways, anathema to some

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.630
of my historian colleagues.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.520
Might explain why I'm
in the Kennedy School.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.850
But that's OK.

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:33.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.790
But I want to make that visible.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.860
Because part of the
point of these ideas

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:42.870
is to see the scaffolding,
to see the constructions,

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.290
and to make them visible to us.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:46.720
So we're all familiar
with CompStat.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.950
It has been, for 20 years now,
the most advanced technology

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:56.180
using data and
statistics to correlate

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.030
criminal activity
by neighborhood

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.515
using spatial mapping software.

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.120
William Bratton
was among the first

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:09.230
to deploy it under Rudolph
Giuliani in the 1990s.

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:12.790
And here we see Mayor Michael
Bloomberg and Ray Kelly

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:17.000
presiding over a
CompStat meeting.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.540
Now moving from CompStat to
these incarceration rates,

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.960
essentially you're
seeing the artifacts

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.430
of the way in which data has
produced a social phenomenon.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.720
But at the same time,
I want you to also

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:34.740
be aware of the ways in
which we are all prisoners

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.890
or creatures of a way of
thinking about how to govern

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:41.250
ourselves in society--
how to make decisions

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.530
about what to do with, say,
inequality or violence,

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:45.400
for example.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.370
And so I see this mostly
as an illustration

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:49.990
in conversation with CompStat.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.980
These two are both
policy implications.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.380
But they're also artifacts
of the choices we've made.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.660
These are the long tails
of those early ideas

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.600
about statistics leading the
way to the true racial capacity

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.410
of a group.

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:05.730
And so you know these numbers.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.150
They're familiar with you.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.630
Here we have tremendous
racial disparity

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:14.400
by race and ethnicity
measured as recently as 2010.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.830
This comes from Prison
Policy Initiative using

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.680
Bureau of Justice Statistics.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.950
Additionally, as
is often the case,

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.570
we talk a lot about
the relationship

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:30.910
of violent crime per capita in
relationship to incarceration

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:31.410
rates.

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:37.100
And in some ways, the entire
debate turns on whether or not

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.680
the people's-- the choice
of individuals to engage

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.310
in criminal activity or
self-harm or the harm of others

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:48.520
is directly related to
those incarceration rates,

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.790
that CompStat is a reflection
of the behavior demonstrated

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.940
in these crime charts.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.660
Part of the truth of
these numbers, dare I say,

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:02.310
is that they do measure
things that are happening.

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:07.070
They do measure some reflection
of behavior on the ground.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:12.120
Why that behavior is happening,
what we ought to do about it,

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.750
is the conceit of this lecture--
that the numbers don't in fact

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.630
tell us or answer either
of those questions.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.890
Never have and never will.

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:26.830
And yet, most of us govern
ourselves under the presumption

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.320
that they speak loud
and clear and lead

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.650
to inevitable or
inexorable conclusions.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:37.700
Stop and frisk, yet another
signpost of the time.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.800
Except for many people,
particularly on the left,

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.030
see these numbers as
an absolute reflection

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.710
of overzealous
discriminatory policing.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:49.700
And indeed, many of
those on the left

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.960
were, at least in
a federal court,

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.110
given credence to their
beliefs in a Floyd decision

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.120
back in 2012 where
there was recognition

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.430
of discriminatory policing.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.110
My point here is not to
adjudicate the case either way,

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:05.770
except that these
numbers clearly

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.040
don't speak for themselves.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.890
They are subject to intense
ideological debates about what,

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:14.340
in fact, do they measure.

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.100
And yet when we have a
conversation about them,

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.860
I just want to expose
our contemporary logic

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.570
and reasoning so that you
have a sense, perhaps, of how

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.050
deeply held these notions are.

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:28.020
In an interview
with Meet the Press

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.930
by David Gregory of Ray Kelly
on the heels of his time

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.570
as Commissioner of New
York Police Department,

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:37.750
he was asked is Stop and
Frisk racial profiling?

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:39.614
And here is his response.

00:28:39.614 --> 00:28:42.030
"It doesn't mean that people
are not doing anything wrong.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.810
If you look at the statute,
it says reasonable suspicion

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:47.550
that individuals may be
about to commit a crime.

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:50.360
There's a preventative
aspect to this.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.890
People say innocent.

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:53.570
That is not the
appropriate word.

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:56.180
This is the standard
law enforcement practice

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.740
around America."

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.220
So the numbers
which are supposed

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:06.450
to be artifacts of behavior
and potentially policy choices

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.310
about how to respond
to that behavior now

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:13.230
also suggest a moral
claim as to whether you

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.800
can, in fact, be innocent
whether or not you've

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.920
committed a crime or not.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:23.340
So you can see how we just build
layers and layers of reasoning

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.090
on top of some very
fundamental things--

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:29.660
whether or not there is a cold
body laying on the street,

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.970
or whether or not there's
a missing pot of cash.

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:36.530
We add and add and
add to those layers.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:37.890
Why do we do this?

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.620
Well according to Ray Kelly
and the justification for this,

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.945
it has something to
do with our history.

00:29:43.945 --> 00:29:46.320
Now here I'm going to do a
little bit of sleight of hand,

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.236
because it's not obvious
that it has something

00:29:48.236 --> 00:29:49.460
to do with our reasoning.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.890
So I'll read what he says.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.680
"We think the reasonable
criteria, that

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.320
is to the question of whether
to judge Stop and Frisk as

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.480
racial profiling or not, is
presented to us by the Rand

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:06.001
Corporation, an institution that
has been in existence for 100

00:30:06.001 --> 00:30:06.500
years."

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.920
Now first you have to
stop and ask yourself,

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.590
this is Meet the Press, right?

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.680
I mean, we're not
at a conference.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.410
We're not talking
amongst policy experts.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.160
We're talking to
the American public.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.040
Do they really care about
the Rand Corporation?

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:26.290
So it's a gesture to
authority, to expertise.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:28.935
So he says, "To take a
look at racial profiling

00:30:28.935 --> 00:30:30.810
to determine if it
happened, you should first

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.226
look at the universe
of people who

00:30:32.226 --> 00:30:34.460
are the perpetrators
identified by the victims

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.260
of violent crime.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.890
And in New York that universe
comports to the racial makeup

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:41.920
of the people being stopped."

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:46.220
Translation-- that because black
people victimize each other

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.740
in their communities,
the police response

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.860
to that victimization
in those communities

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.000
can't, by definition,
be either discriminatory

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.800
or a form of racial profiling.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.160
That's the logic.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:03.360
Now last I checked, the
very constitutional basis,

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.940
as a matter of legal
principle, does not

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.820
judge the fitness or
behavior of groups--

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.330
but for that inconvenient
3/5ths clause that Annette

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:17.840
can talk to us about during
the Q&amp;A-- but judges people

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.960
by their individuality.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:25.220
So this does, in fact, say to us
that a social science research

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:30.660
organization says it's OK
as a matter of efficiency

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.880
or as a matter of public
safety, maybe not as a matter

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.700
of constitutional
principle, to discriminate

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.970
against an entire
group of people

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:41.070
just because there may
be criminal activity

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.100
within the group.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.000
Now it's obvious
that, of course,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.760
all groups are more likely
to commit harm against people

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.370
they know and people
just like them,

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:52.170
by our usual
demographic categories.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:56.470
So some of this doesn't
make sense either.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:58.880
Now what does that
translate to in terms

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.970
of our usual
political discourse?

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:07.860
This is an exchange articulated
by Mayor Giuliani in response

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.940
to a critique mounted by Michael
Dyson also on Meet the Press

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.330
two years later.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:16.910
This is in response to
Ferguson and a conversation

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:19.700
about the uprising
then unfolding.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:24.330
And Giuliani gestures
to this crime statistic.

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:26.340
"I find it very
disappointing that you're not

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.120
discussing the fact that
93% of blacks in America

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.550
are killed by other blacks.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:33.610
I would like the
attention paid to that."

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:35.630
I call this the
violence card in the way

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:38.040
that some people refer
to our discussions

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.850
about race and racism in
America as the race card

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:44.360
because it really is intended
to end the conversation.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.270
In this sense, this is
Rudolph Giuliani's way

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.200
of saying the numbers
speak for themselves--

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.520
that by knowing that this
is what black people do

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:57.170
to each other, we need not
have further conversation

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:59.630
about any
responsibility that lies

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:03.480
outside of the black community.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.490
Well, it's an old
yarn, as it turns out.

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.140
And as I talk, I
will increasingly

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.310
reveal my own position on how
to interpret these matters.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:16.620
But I leave it to you
to decide for yourself.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:21.680
Ida B. Wells was one of the
first activists and journalist

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.760
scholars to use
research and knowledge

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.390
in the service of
social transformation,

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:31.340
particularly around the
problem of sexual violence

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.750
and racial violence
more broadly.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:36.950
She happened to be sitting
at a fancy dinner party

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:40.950
where someone was remarking on
the recent events that unfolded

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:44.350
in Atlanta, now known
as the Atlanta Race Riot

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:49.670
of 1906, which was, for
shorthand purposes, a pogrom

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:54.670
directed against the really
middle to upper class

00:33:54.670 --> 00:34:00.580
black community, mostly situated
in the area of the west side

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.820
of Atlanta today, which
houses the Atlanta University

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.520
Colleges-- Spelman,
Morehouse, Clark.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:13.000
So the discourse around
what caused white people

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.030
to arm themselves and to attack
wholesale the black community

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:21.170
turned, as it turns out,
even in a polite dinner

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:23.820
party in Chicago,
on the behavior

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.260
of black people,
their criminality that

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.750
has elicited this response.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:33.110
Now think about contemporary
forms of racial violence--

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:35.860
whether George Zimmerman
and Trayvon Martin,

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.480
or the man who
shot Jordan Davis,

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.179
or various forms of state
violence turning on loud music

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:44.570
or grey hoodies.

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:47.389
This notion that the
inherent threat of danger

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:50.159
posed by these
African-Americans, who

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:55.440
are not by definition
innocent and who are menacing,

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.660
contributes to their
premature death.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.110
And so the suffragist
Mary Plummer,

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:03.880
who was the wife of a wealthy
corporate lawyer, George

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:07.830
Plummer in Chicago,
responds to Ida B. Wells,

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:09.580
who is objecting to
what she's hearing.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.140
And she says, "I do not
know what we can say"--

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.320
this is Plummer speaking--
"about this terrible affair.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.090
But there is one thing I can say
and that is to urge all of you

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:20.520
to drive the criminals
out from among you.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.190
Have you've forgotten"--
here's the gesture--

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:26.440
"that 10% of all the crimes
committed in Chicago last year

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:30.380
were by colored men, less
than 3% of the population."

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.550
Hence, playing
the violence card.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.090
It's her Trump card.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:37.200
This is not about what
white people are doing, even

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.750
in the South in the height
of the establishment

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:44.660
and infrastructure of Jim Crow.

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:47.830
Here is Ida B. Wells'
1892 publication

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.300
Southern Horrors-- Lynch
Law in all its Phases,

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.970
where she turns to mainstream,
largely white, newspapers

00:35:54.970 --> 00:36:02.240
to document the actual record
of what has caused race riots

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.700
and lynchings directed
mostly against black men,

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.060
but occasionally
against black women.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.860
And so she says in doing her
research, out of their mouths

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.700
shall murderers be condemned.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:17.890
This is, in her way, a gesture
to authority and expertise.

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:22.980
She wants to essentially say
that your own sources document

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:26.450
that the propaganda
and the justifications,

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:29.420
the logic, the ideas,
the ways in which they

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.540
Mary Plummers of the world
are speaking to these issues,

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:36.710
is not even true in
your own newspapers.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:40.200
What she discovers is that she's
able to debunk the rape myth,

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:46.460
that only 31% of all black
men accused of rape--

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.570
and subsequently
lynched, because that was

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:52.950
the set of data she was
focused on-- were even accused,

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:54.990
or she says charged with rape.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:59.380
She also debunked the myth of
black female licentiousness.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:02.310
And we'll talk a little bit
about that in just a moment,

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:06.530
that this notion that black
women themselves could not

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:10.580
be raped is part of
the discussion shifting

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:14.070
the narrative or inverting the
racial narrative by reporting

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.720
on white male rape
of black women.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:20.480
What's fascinating about this
moment is she proceeds Du Bois

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:25.460
and really precedes
much of the official,

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.010
or what I would call
nationalizing, discourse

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:30.760
of these ideas as they
become essentially

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:35.070
a standard way of assessing
how black people are doing.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.884
What are their communities like?

00:37:36.884 --> 00:37:37.800
Should you live there?

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.950
Should they have full
access to their mobility,

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:41.690
whether it's in the
North or the South?

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:45.360
She tells a story of Pat
Hanifan of Nashville, who

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.920
outraged a little colored girl.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.780
Now here the distinction
for her is important.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.340
He was caught.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.920
He was not lynched.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.300
He served time in
prison up to six months.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.396
And then he became
a city detective.

00:37:58.396 --> 00:38:00.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.320
Now because of the importance
of this seminal moment,

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:11.460
this origin story, the lines
had not quite yet hardened.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.730
A lot of people were making
these claims forcefully

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:17.140
and reaching toward
sources of authority

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.750
precisely because they
saw these as openings.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:25.550
And in this way, the fruits
of Ida B. Wells' early efforts

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:29.780
were expressed through the
work of Nathaniel Shaler,

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:33.360
the very man who opens
our moment by giving voice

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.300
to this importance
of statistics.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:38.400
Also, on the eve of his
death-- he died in 1904--

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.480
but roughly 10 years later
writes essentially that

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.280
"I'm inclined to believe that on
the whole there is less danger

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.800
to be apprehended from
them in this regard"--

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:52.240
that is of rape by men
against women, black women--

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.840
"from an equal body of whites
of the like social grade."

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.550
This was relatively
treasonous in terms

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:04.240
of how Southerners understood
the relationship of lynchings

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.670
to proof of black criminality.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:09.420
And as it filtered into
a national discourse,

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.180
most people were not
interested in the footnotes

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:16.400
or the asterisks in the way
that Shaler here positioned it.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.970
What most people were
interested in is a much more

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:22.130
simple narrative
that was articulated

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.190
by one of the
earliest progenitors

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:28.790
of this nationalizing rhetoric,
a man named Frederick Hoffman.

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:33.670
Frederick Hoffman was the
first to turn to census data

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:37.240
in order to determine
by demographic standards

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.055
at the time that the
story of black people's

00:39:40.055 --> 00:39:44.350
true racial capacity was not to
be told in the numbers of birth

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:49.820
rates or mortality
rates or morbidity rates

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.380
based on disease incidence
in the African-American

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:54.770
population.

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:57.410
But in fact, the most
compelling number

00:39:57.410 --> 00:40:01.110
was the number of
African-Americans in prison.

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:02.780
As a result of that
number, he says,

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:05.100
"The city negro brought
into direct competition

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.640
with the white race has
usually but one avenue out

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:14.750
of his dilemma-- the road to
prison or to an early grave."

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:19.030
Now it would be nice to say
that the basic construct here,

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:22.580
this notion that the evidence
proves that black people will

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:28.390
only land either in
an incapacitated cage

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:33.520
or die prematurely, we wish it
weren't as resonant as it turns

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.620
out to be, even to this day.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.590
This is the number
upon which Hoffman

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:40.530
made this seminal claim.

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:45.290
And there is really no
national audience for this data

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:47.300
or for the interpretation
of the data

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:51.230
before Hoffman does this as
a result of the 1890 census.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:55.880
But it was because 12% of the
population of African-Americans

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.970
were represented in
the prison population

00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:00.660
across the North and the
South, but mostly in the South,

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.370
as 30% of the
nation's prisoners.

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:06.780
Just so that you believe
me that this moment

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.300
and the infrastructure
upon which we sit today

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:13.580
is still very much with us,
here's a more recent quote.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.160
Back in 2008,
Senator John Edwards,

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.480
running in the early
days before the news

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.540
of his adulterous affair
while his wife lay sick

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:26.260
with cancer put him
out of the race,

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.617
he said, "When you have young
African-American men who

00:41:28.617 --> 00:41:30.450
are completely convinced
that they're either

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:32.990
going to die or go to
prison and see absolutely

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.830
no hope in their
lives, they don't

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:38.030
see anything getting better."

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:43.030
Now here he's gesturing to
the statistics, which today

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:46.890
are 40% versus
13%-- fairly flat,

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:48.940
I would argue, although
some might be more

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.760
concerned about 30% versus 40%.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.850
But I would say, given
120 years of history,

00:41:54.850 --> 00:42:00.000
we could see this as a fairly
flat proportion of the problem.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.180
And if you listen
to Hoffman carefully

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.810
in the quote, "the
city negro only

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:06.060
has but one avenue
out of his dilemma",

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:10.450
he's not actually prescribing
racist responses to it.

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:11.500
Not yet, at least.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.150
Not in the statement alone.

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:17.690
Not in the way that John
Edwards really intends for us--

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:21.050
this is a calling card
for us to respond.

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:25.500
But you see that the number
doesn't tell us what to do.

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.310
The 30% versus 12%
didn't tell us any more

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:30.460
than that it was an
artifact of what?

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.310
The political
economy of punishment

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:34.000
in the Jim Crow South?

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.550
The establishment and reach of
convict leasing and chain gangs

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:39.970
to suppress the economic
and political mobility

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:42.790
of black people at
the dawn of freedom?

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:44.970
Do we even know how
many people were,

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:47.520
in fact, criminals
by some standard

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.430
that we might all agree
on today looking back

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:52.330
on that time period?

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:55.120
I like to invoke here Steven
Gould's Mismeasure of Man,

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.090
which was incredibly
influential to me

00:42:57.090 --> 00:42:58.470
as an early graduate student.

00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:02.390
Because the search for G,
that coefficient of genius,

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:05.450
sent a lot of people
into a tailspin

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:07.320
trying to prove the
point that you could

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:10.810
correlate in native
or innate intelligence

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:12.830
by racial categories.

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:15.920
And he debunked those
myths time and time again,

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:20.640
showing over time that
people failed repeatedly.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.830
Well in many ways, it's
really not worth our time

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:26.800
to try to have a conversation
about how many of those

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:30.850
30% are, in fact, criminals that
get what they deserve, any more

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:34.010
than it is worth our time
today trying to figure out

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:36.640
what portion of those
40% are criminals

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.149
who get what they deserve.

00:43:38.149 --> 00:43:40.190
But there are probably a
lot of graduate students

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:45.290
here and elsewhere who
are doing exactly that.

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:47.700
I'm interested in the
currency of such figures.

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.850
I'm interested in the
long tail of such figures

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:54.220
as being able to simplify
complex reality that

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.870
govern the choices that we make
and the way that we actually

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:58.200
live our lives.

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.480
And so here are
illustrative examples.

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.100
And I'm going to
move back and forth

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.670
between competing definitions
of how we should interpret

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:06.350
these statistics.

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:08.480
Take this as one example.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:12.490
Here we have a proudly
racist governor.

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:14.410
He was a white
supremacist governor.

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:19.000
He felt that black people had
no place in the governance

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.670
or political economy of
the state of Mississippi.

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:24.090
And he did not mince his words.

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:26.850
One of the benefits of that
day, maybe those benefits

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:28.680
are returning in
this day and age.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:33.330
Nevertheless, he also reached
for authority, for expertise.

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:34.850
And so where does
he look for it?

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:38.340
He says-- and I'll give you
a little context for this.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.200
This is a debate
where it turns out

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:46.580
you can track basically that
there were disproportionately

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:49.210
more criminals in the
North than in the South.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.430
And you could track
school attendance

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:53.520
in the North versus the South.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.940
And of course, when
you're a social scientist

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.440
and you need something
smart to say,

00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.860
you correlate those two
things and essentially come up

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:03.840
with the answer, that, oh, the
more educational opportunities

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.710
we extend to black people,
the more criminal they are.

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:10.830
So he says, "To school the Negro
is to increase his criminality.

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:12.837
Official statistics do not lie.

00:45:12.837 --> 00:45:15.170
And they tell us that the
Negroes who can read and write

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:16.810
are more criminal
than the illiterate.

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:19.219
In New England where
they are best educated,

00:45:19.219 --> 00:45:21.010
they are four and a
half times as criminals

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:23.640
as in the Black Belt, where
they are most ignorant.

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.360
The more money for Negro
education, the more Negro

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.110
crime.

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:31.240
This is the unmistakable showing
of the United States census."

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.330
I'm going to resist
using Trump's name again.

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:35.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:38.770
But you could imagine
that such logic would

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:43.270
be articulated if
he were engaged

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:46.830
in the same sources
of information.

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:52.370
Now fortunately much of this
discourse in its earliest days

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:54.470
was met with resistance
and response,

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:57.750
just as Isa B. Wells was
responding to the rape myth,

00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:01.350
so too did one of Howard
University's earliest

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:03.860
black sociologists, a
man named Kelly Miller.

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:07.310
He responded directly
to the allegation

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.100
that the census
data proved, because

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.100
of the North-South divide
and the greater access

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.183
to educational opportunity,
that black people were

00:46:13.183 --> 00:46:16.670
turned into criminals
because of their education.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:19.382
He says, "Where legal processes
are acknowledged to be fair

00:46:19.382 --> 00:46:20.840
and where the Negro
has the fullest

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.881
educational opportunity,
he shows a criminal rate

00:46:22.881 --> 00:46:25.660
three to four times as great
as his ignorant and oppressed

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:26.750
brother in the South.

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:29.410
And the conclusion is hastily
reached that education

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:33.290
makes the Negro a criminal."

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:35.020
Here's his proof.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:38.330
He says that, "Black
men are five times more

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:44.510
likely in Massachusetts to
serve time than in Mississippi."

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:47.370
If you're on the left, you
might be disturbed by that.

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:49.540
If you're on the right,
you might say, ah ha.

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:50.110
See?

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:52.150
That's the point.

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:54.840
Turns out white
men were 10 times

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.940
over-represented
in Massachusetts

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:01.970
in terms of their prison
rates than in Mississippi.

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:04.800
Now I'm sure if I
poll the audience,

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.290
some Harvard brilliance
will issue forth

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:11.920
and someone will point out that
the bureaucracies and agencies

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:15.250
of the criminal justice system
were far more sophisticated

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:19.950
here in Massachusetts with its
very old colonial communities

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:23.780
of carceral archipelago,
essentially.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.540
And at the same time,
population density

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.810
and a more urban
population dictated

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:30.950
the norms of most criminal
justice activities

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:32.800
even in that day.

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.330
So Kelly Miller
asked the question.

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:38.350
Did education make Northern
whites criminal, too?

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:41.440
And his answer, "Or shall we
foster the bliss of ignorance

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:45.010
only when it is found
under a black skin."

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:48.950
So this back and forth,
this really statistical game

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:52.480
of interpretation, is
foundational in the same way

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.800
that Michael Eric
Dyson is response

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.870
to Rudolph Giuliani saying
84% of all homicides

00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:00.650
among whites are
by other whites.

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:03.396
They're just going
back and forth.

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:10.220
One of the vocal socialists
and progressive labor party

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.270
members, a man
named Harry Vroomen,

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:14.900
also introduces us
to another thread

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:18.550
of ideas that are ascendant
at this time period.

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:23.020
So we've talked about the
racialization of crime

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.770
as it pertains to black people.

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:29.730
But we start to hear the
de-racialization of crime

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:33.360
as it pertains to European
immigrants and poor whites.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.640
The project of
decriminalization,

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:41.300
as it turns out, also depends
on statistical interpretations.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.110
In other words, the
numbers are just

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:45.850
the starting point
for a practice

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:50.080
of etiological preference
and policy advocacy.

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.040
And in this case,
the reverse is true.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:56.080
"The whole problem of crime,
as today expressed in society,

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.260
is summed up in the
problem of poverty.

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:00.850
We have churches
enough, schools enough,

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:03.310
moral sentiment
enough, to regenerate

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:06.910
the world in a decade, were
it not for the awful pressure

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:10.450
brought to bear on nine
tenths of the human race which

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:14.110
all but forces them
to be vicious."

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:17.020
Now I'll just gesture
here to part of my work

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.230
as a progressive era historian.

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:22.090
And that is, much of the
history of the progressive era

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:25.990
has been written as a Northern
white story of native whites

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:27.900
and European
immigrants, and then

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:32.120
in the South, a story
of whites and blacks.

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.940
There's not a lot-- there is
some, but not as much as there

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.530
should be-- of the understanding
of the relationship

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:39.200
of the progressive
era as experienced

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.900
by black people who were there.

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:45.110
And so in this case,
here we have the voice

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:47.430
of the vast majority
of people who

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:51.500
are the focus and target
of social reformers

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:54.040
and criminal justice
officials who happen to be

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.650
white or of European ancestry.

00:49:56.650 --> 00:50:00.860
And it turns out that an
increasingly vocal argument

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:03.000
in favor of what
to do with them is

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.790
to interpret the crime
statistics as symptomatic

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:07.480
of class inequality.

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.270
This is what Bernie
Sanders would sound

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:14.160
like if he were around in 1895.

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.700
Frederick Hoffman,
the same person

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.490
who invented-- or
I should say, led

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:23.190
the way-- towards a
nationalizing discourse

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:29.660
of racial criminalization
also had progressive leanings

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:33.040
when it came to interpreting
the criminality of whites.

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.760
Here he says, an extended
quote, "The study of statistics,

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.850
of suicide, madness,
and crime, is

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:41.070
one of the utmost
importance to any society.

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:43.090
When such an increase
has been proved to exist,

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:45.220
it is the duty of
society to leave nothing

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:47.770
undone until the
evil has been checked

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:49.580
or been brought under control.

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.770
The health of the people
must come before the wealth

00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:52.720
of the people.

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.320
We must be far from
truly civilized

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.450
as long as we permit
to exist or accept

00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:00.890
as inevitable conditions
which, year after year, drive

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:05.190
an increasing army of
unfortunates to madness, crime,

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:06.260
or suicide.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:09.130
It is the struggle of the
classes-- the masses--

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:12.810
against the classes."

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:14.820
When he spoke of
crime statistics

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.900
for African-Americans four years
later in a seminal work, Race,

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.710
Traits, and Tendencies,
he said, prison statistics

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:23.370
from all over the place,
from Chicago to Jersey

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:26.640
to Charleston, South Carolina,
confirm the census data

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.520
and show without exception that
the criminality of the Negro

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.380
exceeds that of any other race
of any numerical importance

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:33.100
in this country.

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:34.800
We'll stop there.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.220
So just pause.

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.050
That's a fact.

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:40.751
There's no disputing the fact.

00:51:40.751 --> 00:51:42.500
And you have to
understand the difference.

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.480
We can all look
at the latest data

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:47.249
of people who are in prison.

00:51:47.249 --> 00:51:48.540
We can look at the arrest data.

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:49.860
That data isn't made up.

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:52.370
The data is not lying.

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:55.120
But what does the data
tell us has happened

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.230
or why it has happened or
what we should do about it

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:00.010
is where the lying begins.

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:03.030
And so now Hoffman is going to
tell us how to interpret it,

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:06.020
even though he was
very fond of reflecting

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:07.000
on his foreign birth.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.290
He was German.

00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:13.900
And that he was very committed
to a very unbiased observation.

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:16.630
He was, in his mind, the
Alexis de Tocqueville

00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:18.870
of the late 20th
century on race.

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:21.162
He says, "When the Negro
learns respect life, property,

00:52:21.162 --> 00:52:22.828
and chastity, until
he learns to believe

00:52:22.828 --> 00:52:24.300
in the value of a
personal morality

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:28.160
operating in his daily life,
the criminal tendencies

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.900
will increase."

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:31.990
So here we have a
gesture towards how

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:36.610
do we fix it-- quite at
odds with a notion of this

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:39.410
being a reflection
of class inequality

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:44.150
or industrialisation's
strain on everyday people

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:48.920
who are turning to self-harm
and the harm of others.

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.674
He then goes on to
extend the notion.

00:52:50.674 --> 00:52:52.840
"I have given the statistics
of the general progress

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:55.020
of the race in religion and
education for the country

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.120
at large and have shown
that in church and school,

00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.970
the number of attending
members or pupils--"

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:01.810
This is what statistical
regression looks like before we

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:03.370
have statistical regression.

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:06.060
So rather than coefficients
for church and school

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:09.190
factored in to isolate
the independent variable,

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:11.620
the notion here is that,
using descriptive data,

00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:14.690
I can show that black people
have greater and greater access

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:17.540
to school and to moral training
and their crime statistics

00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:18.700
are going through the roof.

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:22.140
Therefore, we can isolate
that it's them and not

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:25.720
the structures of opportunity
that are surrounding them.

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.760
And says ultimately,
"But in the statistics

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.450
of crime and the data of
illegitimacy--" now marrying,

00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:34.070
essentially the extended
tropes of black women's

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:36.550
licentiousness and
sexual depravity

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:42.360
with the male-centric idea
of criminality as proof

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:44.710
that neither religion nor
education has influence

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:47.720
to an appreciable degree on
the moral progress of the race.

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.700
This at the height of the
codification of Jim Crow

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.430
segregation in
America, the same year

00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:55.230
that Plessy vs.
Ferguson was formed,

00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:59.320
ultimately positions this
criminality discourse

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:03.420
at the heart of a nationalizing
project that essentially

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:06.220
co-signs on premature
death and co-signs

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:10.030
on nationalized
explicit discrimination.

00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:13.300
Now it will take de
facto forms in the North,

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:15.910
but the underlying rationale
that black communities

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:18.910
ought to be treated differently
is articulated here.

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:20.450
And we ought to
think twice about

00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:25.350
how much to invest in their
opportunity structures.

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:28.690
Now to make the
point and to show you

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:30.810
rather than just to
simply say that they

00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:33.090
had different ideas about
what to do with our Irish

00:54:33.090 --> 00:54:35.840
and Italian cousins,
it turns out

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:39.150
that Frederick Bushee did a
groundbreaking study called

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:41.000
"Ethnic Factors in the
Population of Boston"

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.410
published in 1903.

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:46.080
He noted that the Irish had the
highest rates of petty crime

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.860
and the Italians topped the
list for major felonies.

00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:50.550
Quote, "There is
moral degradation

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:52.590
among Irish families
as a result of drink

00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:55.150
which is not found among
other nationalities,

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:57.640
for quarrels which
are serious affairs,

00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:00.070
for flashes of anger
which mean a knife thrust,

00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:04.780
one must go to the
Italian quarters."

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:06.760
Hoffman himself agreed.

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.590
"The Irish and Italians show a
percentage of arrests decidedly

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:12.120
above the average"--
but here's the kicker--

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:16.900
"yet small when compared with
that of the colored element."

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.930
So part of the statistical
sophistry that's going on here

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:22.590
is a call for an
intervention on one hand,

00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:25.360
a call for neglect on the
other, and the neglect

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:29.400
being predicated on somehow
the racial disparity being

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:33.340
so excessive that it's proof of
the underlying moral degeneracy

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:36.390
of the entire group.

00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:39.590
Instead, our Irish and
Italians were labeled Americans

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:41.990
in process.

00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:45.620
And as Americans in the process,
they just needed more time

00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:47.420
to work things out.

00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:50.450
Another Harvard economist
named William Ripley

00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:52.300
said they "were
fellow passengers

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:56.040
on our ship of state" who
simply needed to be nurtured

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:58.880
through playgrounds
and public recreation,

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:01.650
through all sorts
of reforms that

00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:03.970
would be pro-social
interventions

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:05.630
into their communities.

00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:09.980
And that begins to look
like the progressive era.

00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:14.510
Just so that you don't think I'm
hiding from African-Americans,

00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:17.260
some of whom participated
for various reasons--

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:21.310
sometimes because their class
positions compelled them

00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:24.980
to denigrate their social
inferiors, sometimes

00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:27.071
because they truly
fundamentally believe

00:56:27.071 --> 00:56:29.070
that there was something
wrong with black people

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:32.420
and they just happened to be the
exception that proved the rule.

00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:34.490
In this case, William
Hannibal Thomas

00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:37.630
wrote a book called The
American Negro in 1901,

00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:40.490
occurring right in the
midst of this nationalizing

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:43.510
debate of which he
himself is responding to.

00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:45.870
And in his tirade
of black traits,

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:48.530
and here's just a
highlight, he calls blacks,

00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:50.100
"savage at heart".

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:52.820
He refers to them as "unable
practically to discern

00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:54.660
between right and wrong."

00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:57.310
They are "intrinsically
inferior type of humanity."

00:56:57.310 --> 00:56:59.940
"A record of lawless
existence led by every impulse

00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:02.470
and passion." "Really,
the inferiority

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:04.760
of the Negro in mind, morals,
judgment, and character

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:07.150
is such that there is no
doubt that some very plausible

00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:09.460
confirmatory evidence of
the justice of the simian

00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:12.410
theory of human origin might be
derived from a close inspection

00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:13.955
of his demeanor."

00:57:13.955 --> 00:57:16.455
I'm at Harvard, so I don't need
to explain what he's saying.

00:57:16.455 --> 00:57:16.955
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:16.955 --> 00:57:18.825
But those are fighting words.

00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:25.110
But here's the part of it
that I think is revealing.

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:28.000
They should have been roundly
dismissed by the standards

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.110
that he brought to the table.

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:31.770
He was not a sociologist.

00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:33.770
He had not been trained
as a sociologist.

00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:38.250
He had been a reconstruction era
judge during the Reconstruction

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:43.000
period, from Ohio, who had kind
of a panopticon view of what

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.180
was going on in the South.

00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:47.420
And so that he walked away with
these strongly held positions

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:49.990
gave him some credibility
on the subject,

00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:52.800
but not by the standards of
the social sciences gesturing

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.060
toward statistics.

00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:57.190
And yet Franklin Giddings,
founder of Columbia University

00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:59.890
Sociology Department and the
third president of the American

00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:02.480
Sociological
Association, says this

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:06.770
in his unpublished manuscript
review of Thomas's manuscript.

00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:08.530
This is what gets it published.

00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:11.200
"As a sociological study, it is
one of the most valuable things

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.950
to be put in the hands
of genuine students

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:14.860
of American conditions
that I know of.

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:16.680
Presents his subject
without an atom

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:19.010
of the sentimentality
which is so often proved

00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:22.930
a blemish in many books
otherwise most excellent."

00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:24.740
I can think of a few
people more recently

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.590
who have been accused
of sentimentality when

00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:30.500
writing in defense of or
as a critique of racism

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.450
in American society.

00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:35.670
So therefore, even
the justification

00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:37.450
to publish Hannibal
Thomas's text

00:58:37.450 --> 00:58:41.220
is because it is sitting within
an ideological context that

00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:46.150
doesn't really depend on
data for its authenticity.

00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:48.190
Here is the illustration
that brings you

00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:50.750
all here, curious and
wondering what was

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:52.980
this illustration all about.

00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:56.604
It comes to us as a result of
Newberry Library in Chicago.

00:58:56.604 --> 00:58:59.020
It is the annual report of the
Central Howard Association.

00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:00.686
What was the Central
Howard Association?

00:59:00.686 --> 00:59:03.270
It was a prisoner
reentry organization.

00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:09.690
Their focus was on trying to
get men back home so that they

00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:13.170
could reconstitute
families for the purposes

00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:15.760
of economic and social mobility.

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:20.350
This was a standard way of
fund raising and reporting back

00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:23.340
to fundraisers what
direct social service

00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:25.750
organizations like
settlement houses were doing.

00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:28.850
This is on the ground
response to the notion

00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:32.330
that the criminality was
symptomatic of class inequality

00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:34.650
and that we needed
to do something

00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:37.480
about it until the
evil had been checked.

00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:40.630
Now I will tone down the
way that I often narrate

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:42.310
this illustration tonight.

00:59:42.310 --> 00:59:45.560
But it's really fascinating
to see-- in part

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:49.350
because it is an image
of what we might consider

00:59:49.350 --> 00:59:53.170
an all white slum or an
inner city white ghetto

00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:55.160
of the early 20th century.

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.600
Here we have potentially
a single mother.

00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.570
It's not exactly clear, but
she's certainly by herself

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:03.120
with a lot of babies.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:07.070
Now in the long discourse
of the data of illegitimacy

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:10.330
of black women and their
sexual depravity and incapacity

01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:14.080
keep their legs closed,
this is a presentation

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.920
of white womanhood
with too many babies.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.870
And the intended
consequence of that is they

01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:22.000
are potentially
juvenile delinquencies.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.430
They live in a bad neighborhood.

01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:26.880
It has all the markings of
the relationship of poverty

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.374
to moral worth and
undesirability.

01:00:29.374 --> 01:00:31.040
How do we know it's
a poor neighborhood?

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.590
She's missing shingles
from the home.

01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:37.130
She does a degraded
occupation as a washerwoman.

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:40.330
And every bad neighborhood
from that moment to this moment

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:42.200
comes with an abusive
police officer

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.430
at the end of the street.

01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:48.630
And there he is carting
away a protesting person.

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:50.590
Additionally, bad
neighborhoods usually

01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:53.720
have bars, at least not the
ones that have been gentrified.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:57.710
And so there in the background
in the top left says, saloon.

01:00:57.710 --> 01:01:02.000
We could stop there and
see the face of criminality

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.890
of the Irish or the Italians,
of Jewish immigrants, that all

01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:09.740
these people are talking about.

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:11.530
But what are we to make of it?

01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:13.890
"How Criminals Are
Made." "So long

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:16.600
as there are bad tenements,
sweatshops, brutal policemen,

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.800
bad jails, child labor,
dishonest and grinding

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.442
employers, saloons
and gambling dens,

01:01:20.442 --> 01:01:21.900
so long as boys
are taught to fight

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:23.740
and allowed to carry
firearms, so long

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:25.890
as fathers are indifferent
deserters and mothers

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.840
must maintain the
family by the washboard,

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.490
so long crime will continue.

01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:32.920
What will you do to help this
association to prevent it?"

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:37.630
No correlation of access
to churches or to schools

01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:40.130
or the association that the
criminality is something

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:41.930
they have to deal
with before anyone

01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:43.620
can intervene on their behalf.

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:46.120
This is a progressive
era robust response

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:50.890
to saving these communities
from themselves.

01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:53.870
Jane Addams was the
archetype of social worker

01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:55.760
who spearheaded a
national movement

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.460
and helped to provide cover,
fund raising, and foundation

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.640
to the universe of
settlement houses

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.730
and other direct service
agencies like the Central

01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:05.960
Howard Association of
which we just looked at.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.870
What I want you to
see here is this

01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:10.380
is what sentimentality
looks like when

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.810
middle class and
elite white women

01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:14.650
are working on behalf of
the poor, many of whom

01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:17.550
don't speak English or the
native language of which

01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:20.600
these women oftentimes
represented as Americans.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.670
In other words, they had no
more in common with these women

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:29.380
and their families than their
African-American counterparts

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:32.950
except some broad notion
of European ancestry.

01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:35.200
But weren't these
women Americans

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.750
just like their multi
generation black counterparts

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:38.870
from the South?

01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:40.890
And so I leave it to
you to figure out who

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:43.150
they had more allegiances to.

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:46.930
But essentially, they
narrated the problem

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:50.760
of 15,000 young people brought
before Chicago's juvenile court

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.840
in 1904 in "The Spirit of
Youth and City Streets"

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:56.080
by Jane Addams.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.360
She described how these
young people "stole from

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.982
their parents, 'swiped
junk,' pawned their clothes

01:03:00.982 --> 01:03:02.440
and shoes-- did
any desperate thing

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:05.400
to 'get the dope,'
as they called it."

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.360
Talked about a
Polish youth shooting

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.700
an Irish boy in the
head and said "This tale

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.590
could be duplicated
almost every morning.

01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:14.300
What might be merely a boyish
scrap is turned into a tragedy

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.400
because some boy
has a revolver."

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:21.090
And then this is the part that I
think is even really revealing.

01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:24.070
She says, "We certainly cannot
expect the fathers and mothers

01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:26.630
who have come to the city from
farms or who have immigrated

01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:29.140
from other lands to appreciate
or rectify these dangers.

01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:30.640
Nor could we expect
the young people

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.290
themselves to kill the cancer
of modern city conditions."

01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:39.360
So there's no discourse of
personal responsibility.

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.810
This is not about learning
to respect other people's

01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:42.860
property.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:46.530
This is not about
chastity or morality.

01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:50.840
This is about context and
structural barriers baked

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.110
into a response to the
crime statistics which

01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:56.280
were symptomatic of
class inequality,

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:59.240
as these progressives
kept telling us.

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.440
She goes on to talk
about prostitution

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.880
and tells this story
of a young girl

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.710
who is described
here saying, "I just

01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:07.710
had to go to dances some
time after pushing down

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:10.020
the lever of my machine
with my right foot

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:12.670
and using both my arms,
feeding it for 10 hours a day."

01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:15.000
This is the
sentimental narration

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.130
of the experience
that leads people

01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:20.000
down lives of sexual
or moral degradation,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.010
as well as criminality.

01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:23.760
"The partying ended
when a sympathetic man

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.230
befriended her only to try to
steer her into prostitution.

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:29.040
'Of course, I threatened to
kill him,' she told Addams.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.540
Any decent girl would."

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.880
And this is a way of
showing their humanity,

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.010
their resistance in the
wake of industrial grinding.

01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:42.020
Jane Addams writes in one of
the earliest issues of Crisis

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:45.180
magazine-- she was a co-founder
along with many others

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:49.740
including socialists like
William Walling and Du Bois.

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:52.930
She writes in the third issue
of Crisis magazine in response

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:54.690
to the problem of
the lack of inherited

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:57.150
control in the black community.

01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:58.800
She says, "One could
easily illustrate

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.770
this lack of inherited
control by comparing

01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:03.210
the experiences of a group
of colored girl with those

01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:05.670
of a group representing the
daughters of Italian immigrants

01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:09.770
or of any other Southern
European peoples.

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:12.150
The Italian girls very
much enjoy the novelty

01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:15.300
of factory work, the
opportunity to earn money

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.160
and to dress as Americans do,
but this new freedom of theirs

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.810
is carefully guarded."

01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:22.660
In the same book when
she talks about--

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:25.660
in the previous discussion,
she talks about parents

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.200
can't control this.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.110
Factory work is degrading.

01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:30.742
These girls are
vulnerable by virtue

01:05:30.742 --> 01:05:32.700
of having to leave the
house in the first place

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:36.470
to contribute to the
household to being steered

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:38.250
into lives of prostitution.

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:40.720
So we have to ask ourselves
why would she say something

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.180
to an audience of
black readers dealing

01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:46.250
with the problem of the
segregated experiences

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:48.910
of black people,
girls in particular?

01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:52.630
But for this notion that
somehow the possibilities

01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:54.420
of prostitution for
the black community

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:59.130
did germinate somewhere beyond
the larger industrial crisis,

01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:01.780
that there was still something
inside of black people

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:05.270
that was that G, that
special coefficient

01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:09.320
of inferiority that needed
to be addressed before they

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:13.000
could be pushed into a larger
project of progressive era

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.449
intervention.

01:06:15.449 --> 01:06:16.990
Just so you don't
think I made it up,

01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:18.739
when her work was
reviewed in the American

01:06:18.739 --> 01:06:21.050
Journal of Sociology,
it was noted "sociology

01:06:21.050 --> 01:06:23.310
has published a classic.

01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:26.590
So exquisitely and
poetically has Miss Addams

01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:28.830
revealed the precious stuff
of which young hearts are

01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:30.640
made that we gladly
give her book

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:33.810
a place besides
Wordsworth's great Ode."

01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:37.980
By contrast of Franklin Giddings
praising William Hannibal

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:43.060
Thomas for a racist screed
against black people because

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:47.120
he didn't show a blemish
of sentimentality.

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:52.810
So almost everywhere we look,
we see-- I'm calling them lies,

01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:56.110
because they are not a
reflection of anything factual

01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:58.200
or empirical or positivist.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:03.250
They are people's interpretation
of what's happening in society.

01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:05.000
Francis Keller
emerges on the scene

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.130
also as one of essentially
the first female American

01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:08.750
criminologist.

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:12.150
She is a bad ass by the
standards of that day.

01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:15.620
And partly a bad ass because she
publishes some of the earliest

01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:18.660
studies turning
to resolve or end

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:21.310
the question of whether you
could locate criminality

01:07:21.310 --> 01:07:23.060
in the body.

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:25.620
And so she does literally
some of the first Tuskegee

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:28.720
experiments comparing
black women at Tuskegee

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:33.240
with Northern women in college
to measure mostly their memory,

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.019
because she sees their
capacity to remember things

01:07:36.019 --> 01:07:37.560
as a reflection of
their brain power.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.320
And she finds that
there is no difference.

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.340
She also compares
black women in prison

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.420
in the South to white
women prison in the South.

01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:45.510
After she does a
battery of tests,

01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:48.840
she comes to the conclusion that
there is no physical evidence

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:51.930
that black people are inferior
to white people in constitution

01:07:51.930 --> 01:07:54.010
or their mental capacity.

01:07:54.010 --> 01:07:56.160
She also says-- or
she says here-- "It

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:59.732
is impossible to estimate the
persistency of racial traits

01:07:59.732 --> 01:08:01.690
or the limitations, mental
or physical, imposed

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:04.070
by the racial development
until a parallel environment is

01:08:04.070 --> 01:08:04.570
removed."

01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:07.406
So she's shifting the gaze
from body to community.

01:08:07.406 --> 01:08:08.780
"And that is the
environment must

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:10.405
be shown to be of
such a nature that it

01:08:10.405 --> 01:08:12.850
offers every opportunity for
development and improvement.

01:08:12.850 --> 01:08:15.450
In no phase of the Negros life--
domestic, social, industrial,

01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:17.908
political, or religious-- does
this appear to be the case."

01:08:17.908 --> 01:08:19.220
This is a big deal.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.356
It's a really big deal.

01:08:20.356 --> 01:08:22.689
Now that she happened to the
first female criminologist,

01:08:22.689 --> 01:08:24.880
she doesn't get much
traction with this idea.

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.344
But the idea basically here
is to say black people don't

01:08:27.344 --> 01:08:29.260
have equal conditions of life.

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:31.830
And therefore we can't turn
to their crime statistics

01:08:31.830 --> 01:08:34.620
as a measure of what
they're capable of until we

01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:39.170
quote unquote, "create
a parallel environment."

01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:43.590
Yet even here she turns
on black women's behavior

01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:48.439
as some, again, co-efficient,
some residue, something extra

01:08:48.439 --> 01:08:51.010
that suggests that
they themselves

01:08:51.010 --> 01:08:54.140
are not fully prepared for
the full fruits of freedom.

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.497
She said, "They left their
happy-go-lucky cheerful life

01:08:56.497 --> 01:08:57.080
in the South."

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:57.720
Now, really?

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:00.810
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:05.069
"As migrants only to end up
drifting into immorality."

01:09:05.069 --> 01:09:07.790
Now talk about
passive voice here.

01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:11.140
They just simply leave the South
and now they're prostitutes.

01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:13.189
"They often had the
best of intentions,

01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:15.970
but partly due to their
'ignorance,' their inflated

01:09:15.970 --> 01:09:17.930
ambitions--" Think about that.

01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:20.290
Because part of knowing
your place in this time

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:23.170
period is knowing
what to reach for.

01:09:23.170 --> 01:09:25.800
And choosing not to
reach for your place

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.560
also means, in the South,
landing on a convict leash

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:33.029
or in a chain gang and in
the North, being surveyed

01:09:33.029 --> 01:09:34.779
or racially quarantined.

01:09:34.779 --> 01:09:36.729
To them, going to
Philadelphia or New York

01:09:36.729 --> 01:09:38.240
seemed like going to heaven.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.729
How dare they think such things?

01:09:41.729 --> 01:09:45.560
Mary White Ovington also wrote
essentially the second major

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.979
study of the black urban
experience as a sequel to Du

01:09:47.979 --> 01:09:50.569
Bois' The Philadelphia
Negro, published in 1911.

01:09:50.569 --> 01:09:52.800
When she turns to the
experiences of black women,

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.600
she says "a very
large percentage

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:58.220
of crime among colored women,
unduly large percentage

01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:01.100
of disorderly, depraved
colored--" I'm sorry.

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:04.110
That's a little choppy there.

01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:08.940
She then goes on to excuse
black men's criminality was

01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:11.250
no higher than could be
expected, because she's

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:13.000
much more interested
in a book called Half

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.510
a Man on understanding that
black men faced barriers

01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:20.090
to their economic
participation and she

01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:21.481
did believe that
that contributed

01:10:21.481 --> 01:10:22.980
to their criminality
in the same way

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:24.560
that Francis Keller
was beginning

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.150
to talk about structure.

01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:29.350
But depravity among the girls
and improper guardianship-- he

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:33.980
girls and their mothers-- were
the races most serious defects.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.540
So this is what the
intersectional violence

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:39.420
looks like in the
progressive era, which

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:42.250
then turns on what the
race is capable of because

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:47.440
of its defective
daughters and mothers.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:51.490
Du Bois weighed in also
that resistance was always

01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:52.240
around the corner.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:55.000
He talked about the unscientific
use of the statistical method

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.730
in response to Hoffman.

01:10:56.730 --> 01:10:59.570
He pointed out in
the acerbic way

01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:02.280
that Du Bois often did that
"German cities, Montreal,

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:04.870
Naples, Belfast, Budapest,
Breslau, and Madrid all

01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:08.030
have shown within a few year,
death rates equal to American

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:11.210
Negroes in cities" as if to
completely up-end, as Ida B.

01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:15.200
Wells had once done, the notion
that you couldn't correlate

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.790
the evidence of premature
death with the racial capacity

01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:19.310
of groups.

01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:22.570
Because if you could,
then were Europe's races

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:24.720
becoming extinct?

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.210
He talked about
illegitimacy rates

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:29.050
in Rome, Munich,
Stockholm, Paris, Brussels,

01:11:29.050 --> 01:11:31.940
as being higher than
Negroes in Washington DC,

01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:35.160
to call fundamentally
into question the lie

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:39.410
or the interpretation
or the etiology at play.

01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:42.500
What happened to Bushee's
Italian and Irish criminals?

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:44.770
Though I like to
ask it another way.

01:11:44.770 --> 01:11:47.200
How many Italian Americans
committed armed robbery

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.640
last quarter?

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.120
How about
Irish-American burglars?

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.674
Does anyone know?

01:11:52.674 --> 01:11:54.215
You don't know any
more than you know

01:11:54.215 --> 01:11:58.180
how many police shootings there
were in police departments.

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.980
Because at some
point, we decided

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:02.830
that this was not useful data.

01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:06.490
And the moment that we
decided it was the moment when

01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:08.800
social scientist
Edward Sutherland,

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:16.100
the first canonized
American criminologist, who

01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:18.970
wrote several editions of the
book Principles of Criminology,

01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:21.040
noted that "the second
generation of immigrants

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.860
appears to approach the
native-born of native parentage

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:26.540
in regard to the kinds
of crimes committed."

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.990
Translation-- well, they're
just like white people,

01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:31.290
therefore we don't need
to know anything specific

01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:33.550
about Italian-Americans
and Irish-Americans.

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:36.680
This is decriminalization.

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:38.550
Though whereas
we've seen nothing

01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:41.740
but continued racial
criminalization of blacks,

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:44.530
we are seeing both in
the policy response

01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:47.300
to poverty in white and
immigrant communities,

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:50.590
a mechanism for decriminalizing.

01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:54.360
We've seen a literary trope
of sentimentality directed

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.160
towards these groups as
young kids getting caught up

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:01.160
in the spirit of urban adventure
and the tragedy is on us.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.320
And now we begin to
see the disappearance

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:05.290
of the statistical
gaze that had been born

01:13:05.290 --> 01:13:08.150
in the eugenics era
across the 19th century

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:10.920
to prove that certain
groups were inferior

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.480
and should no
longer be supported.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:15.010
This was also part of the
Social Darwinist argument,

01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:17.250
that it was in an
inefficient use of resources

01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:20.860
to prop up inferior groups.

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:24.390
The Uniform Crime reports, we
should not be surprised then,

01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:29.197
begins in 1930 and by
1933 is able to say

01:13:29.197 --> 01:13:31.030
that "it is believed
that figures pertaining

01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:33.050
to the number of Negroes
and foreign-born whites who

01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:35.400
were arrested and fingerprinted
can most fairly be presented

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.850
by showing them in proportion to
the number of such individuals

01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:39.120
in the general population."

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:45.040
This is essentially the
fermentation and foundation

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:48.930
for how we use crime
statistics to this day.

01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:51.190
This is the most
authoritative evidence

01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:54.920
of local criminal activity by
arrest data across the nation

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:55.990
beginning in this moment.

01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:57.198
There's a back story to that.

01:13:57.198 --> 01:13:58.720
I'm not here to
tell you that story.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:03.850
But guess what happens fairly
quickly between 1933 and 1940.

01:14:03.850 --> 01:14:07.105
Notice it says "it is
significant to point out

01:14:07.105 --> 01:14:08.480
that the figure
for native whites

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.896
includes the
immediate descendants

01:14:09.896 --> 01:14:11.770
of foreign-born individuals."

01:14:11.770 --> 01:14:14.280
Hence what happened
to Bushee's Italians

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.580
and Irish is that
they became white,

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:19.870
they disappeared, and so
too did their criminality,

01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:24.110
leaving blackness as the
dominant and primary measure

01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:28.110
of statistical deviation
and behavioral deviance

01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:30.660
in American society,
because it always still

01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:33.650
captured as an artifact the
fundamental inequality that

01:14:33.650 --> 01:14:35.690
existed in American society.

01:14:35.690 --> 01:14:38.970
And that's where we are
today, ladies and gentlemen.

01:14:38.970 --> 01:14:41.460
I'll just mention here
Charles S. Johnson,

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.815
leading black
sociologist, pointed out

01:14:43.815 --> 01:14:45.190
that there was
bias in the system

01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:48.860
because when they studied it
and asked white criminal justice

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:51.417
officials in Chicago in the
wake of a major race riot,

01:14:51.417 --> 01:14:52.250
they admitted to it.

01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:53.400
They said, yes.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:57.110
We police black
communities differently.

01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:59.990
As a result of that, the Chicago
Commission on Race Relation

01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:02.080
considered it best to
avoid giving currency

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.980
to figures which carried
such clear evidence

01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:07.140
of their own inaccuracy
and misrepresentation.

01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.700
But it didn't matter to
the Uniform Crime Reports.

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.440
So here again you
see the resistance.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.660
We had choices.

01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:14.140
We could've chosen differently.

01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:15.860
We might not have lied.

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:20.740
But as a set of policy
choices, we continue to do so.

01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:23.440
In the "Department of
Justice Ferguson Report",

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.182
we shouldn't be surprised
then, coming up to more recent

01:15:26.182 --> 01:15:28.640
history, that "City officials
have frequently asserted that

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.510
the harsh and disparate results
of Ferguson's law enforcement

01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:34.300
system"-- this is according
to the officials in Ferguson--

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:37.220
"do not indicate problems with
police or court practices,

01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:39.990
but instead reflect a
perverse of lack of personal

01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:42.600
responsibility among certain
segments of the community."

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:46.990
If we gave them the most
generous reading possible,

01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:50.050
for their explanation,
it's still not obvious

01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:53.060
that they should have been
using dogs on children

01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:56.170
or surveying the community
for the purposes of generating

01:15:56.170 --> 01:16:00.260
revenue, that they might have
responded like progressives,

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:01.940
that they might have
taken the evidence

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:04.120
of a lack of personal
responsibility

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.740
among certain segments
of the community

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:09.330
as a robust
opportunity to engage

01:16:09.330 --> 01:16:12.070
in that community with
pro-social interventions.

01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:14.040
But once we baked
in these layers

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.420
of saying from
the very beginning

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:17.394
that you don't treat
black people the way

01:16:17.394 --> 01:16:19.560
you treat white people,
even when they're criminals,

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.518
or that there's criminality
in their community,

01:16:21.518 --> 01:16:23.520
as Ray Kelly
reminded us, then we

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:27.440
shouldn't be surprised at
the harvest or the outcome.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.500
FBI Director James Comey tells
us that our greatest challenge,

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.260
in a speech that he
gave two years ago--

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:34.135
I'm sorry, last year.
"The greatest challenge

01:16:34.135 --> 01:16:37.030
is to grow drug resistance
and violence resistance kids."

01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:39.020
How are we going to do that?

01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:41.719
"The first step to understanding
what is really going on

01:16:41.719 --> 01:16:43.260
in our communities
and in our country

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:45.800
is to gather more and
better data related

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:48.700
to those we arrest, those
we confront breaking the law

01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:51.480
and jeopardizing public safety,
and those who confront us.

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.670
Data seems a dry
and boring word,

01:16:53.670 --> 01:16:57.290
but without it we cannot
understand our world and make

01:16:57.290 --> 01:16:59.515
it better."

01:16:59.515 --> 01:17:00.890
It's a little
depressing, I know,

01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:02.650
but I leave it to
you to figure out.

01:17:02.650 --> 01:17:04.354
Responding to
Black Lives Matter,

01:17:04.354 --> 01:17:05.770
"it's because
blacks commit murder

01:17:05.770 --> 01:17:08.860
eight times more per capita than
any other group in our society.

01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:10.380
And when I assign
police officers

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:11.796
with Commissioner
William Bratton,

01:17:11.796 --> 01:17:13.340
we did it based on statistics.

01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:14.874
We didn't do it based on race.

01:17:14.874 --> 01:17:16.790
If there were a lot of
murders in a community,

01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:19.780
we put a lot of police
officers there."

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:22.890
Remember how criminals are made?

01:17:22.890 --> 01:17:25.260
Maybe it's just they don't know.

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:27.330
Our historical memory
is so corrupted

01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:30.720
that if they just knew
better, they'd do differently.

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.110
Frankly, that's what
I'm holding on to.

01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:35.850
Finally, yesterday's-- I'm
sorry, The New York Times.

01:17:35.850 --> 01:17:38.030
I saw it yesterday,
published on February 22.

01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:41.410
"Why are White
Death Rates Rising?"

01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:46.030
And I read this, I
pulled out a few quotes,

01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:48.820
but here we are back
again almost full circle

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:50.350
100 years later.

01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:54.190
In our global capital moment
of an information age,

01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:56.230
we are seeing yet
again the ravages

01:17:56.230 --> 01:17:59.260
of the industrial economy take--
the post-industrial economy

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:01.730
of the information, they take
hold of white communities

01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:03.300
across America.

01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.480
Both studies attributed
at the higher death rates

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:08.370
to increases and poisonings and
chronic liver disease, which

01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:11.280
mainly reflect drug
overdoses and alcohol abuse,

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.930
and to suicides-- not
unlike Frederick Hoffman

01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:15.980
talked about the
health of the people.

01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:18.590
A 35-year-old white man
who did a construction job

01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:20.670
said it's much harder
for me as a grown man

01:18:20.670 --> 01:18:22.970
than it was for my father.

01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:25.460
Already we're in that
sentimental space--

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:29.050
the pathos of what's
happening to white Americans?

01:18:29.050 --> 01:18:33.800
And then here, evoking a version
of Robert Merton's strain

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:39.750
theory, we have a gesture to the
failed expectations of people

01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:42.730
expecting more out of life but
meeting structural barriers

01:18:42.730 --> 01:18:44.110
at every turn.

01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:45.690
Reference group
theory here noted

01:18:45.690 --> 01:18:47.920
at the bottom explains
why people who have more

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.430
may feel that they have less.

01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:51.854
What matters is to whom
you are comparing yourself.

01:18:51.854 --> 01:18:53.270
It's not that white
workers aren't

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:56.080
doing worse than
African-Americans or Hispanics.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.840
It's that they think
they're doing worse

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.131
than their parents' generation.

01:18:59.131 --> 01:19:01.080
And I should've included that.

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.880
So I'm going to
leave you at the end

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:07.110
of my talk with
the question to you

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:11.850
that we can hopefully engage
in Q&amp;A is, do numbers lie?

01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:14.670
Because the issue is not
that we can't use data

01:19:14.670 --> 01:19:16.680
in order to discover
and describe

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.100
the communities, the
world in which we live.

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.790
But that won't help us figure
out what to do about it.

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:24.580
And often times it does
just the opposite-- serves

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:26.410
as a shorthand
reference for what

01:19:26.410 --> 01:19:29.060
we want to do about
it, which in this case,

01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:32.410
has been to do intersectional
violence to black people

01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:33.460
since the 1890s.

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:34.824
Thank you very much.

01:19:34.824 --> 01:19:37.090
[APPLAUSE]
