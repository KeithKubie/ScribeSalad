00:00:00.564 --> 00:00:02.320
- [David] Hello grammarians,
today we're going to talk

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.913
about two of my, well, I
don't know if I'd call them

00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:07.899
favorite, but two of my most
frequently confused words.

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.353
I make this mistake all the time

00:00:10.353 --> 00:00:12.197
and I think it's important
to keep it straight.

00:00:12.197 --> 00:00:16.114
Affect and effect are
two very different words.

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:19.303
What is the difference you might ask.

00:00:19.303 --> 00:00:22.126
Well, that's why I'm here.

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:23.963
To sum it up, let's just put

00:00:23.963 --> 00:00:27.058
the TL, DR right at the top.

00:00:27.058 --> 00:00:30.178
Affect is a verb, just
think of that as a verb.

00:00:30.178 --> 00:00:32.774
And effect, think of that as a noun.

00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:34.607
It's more complicated
than that, obviously,

00:00:34.607 --> 00:00:36.676
but most of the time, when
you're looking at these

00:00:36.676 --> 00:00:37.883
two words and you're trying to decide,

00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:40.405
oh which one do I use?

00:00:40.405 --> 00:00:42.255
Affect is a verb, effect is a noun.

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:45.920
That's the too long,
didn't read of this video,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.421
and who reads a video, but
this is your key takeaway.

00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:52.234
Let me give you some examples.

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:53.442
Let's take this sentence:

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:57.783
the drought had a nasty
blank on Angela's crops.

00:00:57.783 --> 00:00:59.783
Now, both of these words

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
mean something happened,

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:06.097
right?

00:01:06.097 --> 00:01:09.347
They both mean that there was a change,

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:14.493
but effect with an E is
the result of that change,

00:01:14.493 --> 00:01:17.160
and affect with an A, or affect,

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.522
is the change agent if that makes sense.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.632
So, we're looking at this sentence:

00:01:24.632 --> 00:01:27.296
the drought had a nasty
blank on Angela's crops.

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:28.814
We know we need to use one of those.

00:01:28.814 --> 00:01:32.635
Well, we're signaling here
by using the article a

00:01:32.635 --> 00:01:35.781
and the adjective nasty that
we're looking for a noun.

00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:39.668
So, we'd wanna say: the
drought had a nasty effect.

00:01:39.668 --> 00:01:42.806
Another way to think of
this is effect with an E

00:01:42.806 --> 00:01:46.369
is the same way as saying result.

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.677
Similarly, if we wanted to
write this sentence again,

00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:53.527
but with affect, with a verb, we'd say:

00:01:53.527 --> 00:01:57.118
the drought affected Angela's crops.

00:01:57.118 --> 00:01:59.459
So, affect, we're using it as a verb,

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.301
effect we're using it as a noun.

00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:03.884
And I'm exaggerating the
pronunciation of those

00:02:03.884 --> 00:02:07.213
just to give you the distinction.

00:02:07.213 --> 00:02:11.460
Now, of course there are
always obnoxious exceptions,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.309
let's cover them briefly,
but just bear in mind that

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:16.142
these are pretty rare.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.123
Number one: the word
effect with an E as verb.

00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:27.589
When you see this as a verb
it usually means to create.

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:31.756
The way I usually see this is
in the phrase effect change,

00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:36.339
which really means to bring about change.

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.400
Effect here means to create.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.900
So, Kimiko hoped that the
new mayor would effect change

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.953
in her town.

00:02:43.953 --> 00:02:46.987
What we're saying here
is really, make change.

00:02:46.987 --> 00:02:51.154
When we say effect as a verb
that really just means to make.

00:02:52.623 --> 00:02:55.659
And the other obnoxious exception

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.326
is affect as a noun,

00:03:02.121 --> 00:03:04.046
which is like a psychology term,

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:07.213
it really means someone's personality.

00:03:08.084 --> 00:03:11.551
So, for example Percy had a smug affect.

00:03:11.551 --> 00:03:15.637
And that just means his
personality is smug.

00:03:15.637 --> 00:03:19.653
Now, I wanna hit again
that these are exceptions

00:03:19.653 --> 00:03:20.637
and they're pretty rare.

00:03:20.637 --> 00:03:25.174
I would caution avoiding
them most of the time.

00:03:25.174 --> 00:03:28.992
I think your big takeaway
is that affect is a verb

00:03:28.992 --> 00:03:33.811
and effect is a noun, and
yes these exceptions exist

00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:36.882
but I think in the interest
of clarity, you need

00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:39.051
to be very certain when you're using them.

00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:42.791
Because affect here as a
noun is professional jargon,

00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:45.741
frankly, this is psychologist talk

00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:48.180
and that means it's a very
particular kind of English,

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.093
it's to be used in a specific context.

00:03:51.093 --> 00:03:54.093
Likewise, effect as a verb, frankly,

00:03:55.236 --> 00:03:56.558
I don't what you get out of this.

00:03:56.558 --> 00:03:58.808
I would just say make, frankly,

00:03:58.808 --> 00:04:00.974
I'm not sure it's worth the confusion.

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:03.910
But that's just a style
tip, obviously it's still

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.175
grammatical to use it that way,

00:04:06.175 --> 00:04:08.570
you just have to be careful of confusion.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.468
So, what's the takeaway?

00:04:10.468 --> 00:04:13.134
Affect is a verb, effect is a noun,

00:04:13.134 --> 00:04:14.668
but there are exceptions.

00:04:14.668 --> 00:04:15.963
You can learn anything.

00:04:15.963 --> 00:04:16.796
David out.
