00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.500
 Seating can be a beautiful rest of a busy day 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.000
 But as many of us spend most of the time working on an office 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.700
 Followed by free time in front of a computer or TV 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.920
 One has to wonder, 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.800
 How does sitting affect your body? 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.140
 The answer is very shocking 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.060
 Once seated, the electrical activity in your muscles decreases significantly 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.100
 Your calorie burning rate is reduced to one minute per minute 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.960
 After only 3 hours of sitting, there is a 50% reduction in the widening of the arteries 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.260
 Resulting in a decrease in blood flow 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.600
 Sit for 24 hours continuously, and your insulin will lose 40% of its ability to absorb glucose 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.680
 Which increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.020
 Things get worse here 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.020
 After two weeks of sitting for more than 6 hours a day 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.700
 Low-density lipoproteins (LDL), sometimes called LDL cholesterol, increase. 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.040
 With many fatty molecules, puts you at risk of gaining weight. 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.300
 Above all this, the enzyme responsible for lipid analysis, drops. 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.340
 Because of a long period of inactivity, your muscles begin to collapse. 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.320
 Gradually, the contraction of your muscles weakens, ending by blocking the return of blood to the heart. 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.110
 Even if you practice regularly, 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.590
 The moment you stop moving, the breakdown starts again, proportioning to your sitting time. 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.100
 This scary part, 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.700
 Research shows that exercise alone does not frustrate the negative effects of something like smoking, 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.400
 The negative effects of long sitting are not discouraged 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.700
 After a year, the ether begins to accumulate 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.020
 Some studies on women showed a reduction in bone mass of more than 1% each year 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.380
 Do you think your mind is more important than your body? 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.740
 Physical movement not only helps pump blood and oxygen into the brain, but also sends hormones to improve mood. 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.960
 When we do not move, brain functions begin to slow down. 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.560
 Perhaps the most shocking, that after 10-20 years of sitting for 6 hours a day, 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.920
 May lose more than 7 years of "quality-adjusted years" 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.140
 The number of years it has been without medical problems or death 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.500
 For example, the risk of death from heart disease increases 64% 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.000
 While the risk of prostate cancer or breast cancer increases 30% 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.480
 If everyone sat for no more than 3 hours a day, it is estimated that the average age will increase by two years. 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.260
 Simply put, our bodies were not designed to stagnate. 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.860
 Sitting for 8 hours while working is as bad as sitting at home watching television 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.640
 As far as those who go to the gyms 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.200
 It can literally be deadly. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.200
 So what's the best solution? 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.100
 We put together a list of the best tips to fight the B-sit, no matter how lazy you are, 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.920
