(classical piano music)

00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:25.901
- [Carta Narrator] We
are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:28.401
Bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:31.194 --> 00:00:35.222
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:35.222 --> 00:00:39.419
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:42.797
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:42.797 --> 00:00:44.880
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:47.516
We grow up slowly.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.299
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:51.232 --> 00:00:53.315
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.096
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:57.096 --> 00:00:58.096
of the past.

00:01:00.073 --> 00:01:03.743
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.743 --> 00:01:07.910
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.354
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:01:12.354 --> 00:01:13.937
of humans like you.

00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:04.191
- When we talk about medicine,
I think it's quite important

00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:07.442
to think about what is medicine?

00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:11.442
Right, it is the study
and intervention of human

00:02:12.407 --> 00:02:15.134
physiological systems,
and physical systems,

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:17.573
and psychiatric systems.

00:02:17.573 --> 00:02:20.339
When they are dis-regulated.

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:24.328
To attempt to correct what
is going on, to improve

00:02:24.328 --> 00:02:27.955
human health and in order to do that,

00:02:27.955 --> 00:02:30.116
we have to have a deep
understanding of not only

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:31.994
the dysfunction of these systems,

00:02:31.994 --> 00:02:35.983
but how they function
when doing healthy things

00:02:35.983 --> 00:02:37.483
within our bodies.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.442
And so, to me, the term
medicine really means

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:44.917
applied human biology.

00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:49.148
And as every biologist knows,
we have a favorite quote,

00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:51.427
which is that nothing
in biology makes sense,

00:02:51.427 --> 00:02:54.111
except in the light of evolution.

00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:58.101
And this means that to understand
the organizing principles

00:02:58.101 --> 00:03:01.283
of any organism,
biologically on this planet,

00:03:01.283 --> 00:03:04.708
we need to understand
its evolutionary history.

00:03:04.708 --> 00:03:06.909
And the series of selected
pressures that have shaped

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.396
that organism to function the way it does

00:03:09.396 --> 00:03:12.898
in the particular context
in which it finds itself.

00:03:12.898 --> 00:03:16.153
And, as an anthropologist,
who studies maternal health

00:03:16.153 --> 00:03:18.799
and infant development, I
have a particularly favorite

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.889
adaptation that I care about.

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.987
And it is the synthesis of
milk from mammary glands,

00:03:24.987 --> 00:03:27.714
which is the defining
characteristic of our

00:03:27.714 --> 00:03:29.788
mammalian class.

00:03:29.788 --> 00:03:33.167
It's as Barbara pointed
out, why mammals are at risk

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:36.380
of breast cancer, because
we have mammary glands.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.017
And mother's milk, initially
a random mutation for

00:03:41.017 --> 00:03:45.125
minor secretion that perhaps
hydrated young or provided

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:48.129
rudimentary immunofactors,
have been shaped by hundreds

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.420
of millions of years of
evolution and natural selection,

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.778
to become increasingly complex.

00:03:53.778 --> 00:03:57.806
Such that it provides
nourishment for young,

00:03:57.806 --> 00:04:01.670
it provides comprehensive
immune protection

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.089
for the pathogens babies
are likely to encounter.

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:08.467
And it also provides bio-active
hormones from maternal

00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:12.005
circulation that cross over
into the infant and influence

00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:14.571
infant physiological regulation.

00:04:14.571 --> 00:04:17.415
It is due to this complex
bio-fluid that is food,

00:04:17.415 --> 00:04:22.175
medicine and signal that has
led every major governmental

00:04:22.175 --> 00:04:26.526
and non-governmental organization
to recognize mother's milk

00:04:26.526 --> 00:04:31.002
as both liquid gold and
breastfeeding as the gold standard

00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:34.504
of early life input from the mother.

00:04:34.504 --> 00:04:38.046
However, because of the
ubiquity of milk within

00:04:38.046 --> 00:04:41.715
our environment, and its
seeming replication in the form

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:44.970
of artificial breast milk
that you can buy at the store,

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.179
we have come to take milk for granted,

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:51.558
and think of it as a
standardized, systematized,

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:53.388
simple kind of thing.

00:04:53.388 --> 00:04:55.137
And we've lost sight of
the things that make it

00:04:55.137 --> 00:04:58.191
incredibly complex and special.

00:04:58.191 --> 00:05:00.312
And it's that we have
not actually identified

00:05:00.312 --> 00:05:02.674
what are liquid gold standards.

00:05:02.674 --> 00:05:05.598
We do not have a systematic
understanding of milk.

00:05:05.598 --> 00:05:08.335
How it varies, what that
variance does when ingested

00:05:08.335 --> 00:05:11.389
by the infant, and these are
fundamental things we need

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.419
to uncover in order to
better manage infant health

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.904
within the neonatal intensive care unit.

00:05:17.904 --> 00:05:21.527
And better target our
public health intervention.

00:05:21.527 --> 00:05:24.662
And so, I think an evolutionary
perspective is incredibly

00:05:24.662 --> 00:05:28.829
important in order to both
design and effectively target

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:33.171
research studies, but also to
help inform our understanding

00:05:33.171 --> 00:05:35.167
of this dynamic system.

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:38.175
Because lactation is a
complex adaptive system

00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:41.147
in which natural selection
has shaped mothers' physiology

00:05:41.147 --> 00:05:45.314
and their mammary glands to
synthesize milk in complex ways.

00:05:46.273 --> 00:05:48.430
And there's a fundamental
thing that I think is very

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.953
challenging when we're thinking
about managing the health

00:05:50.953 --> 00:05:52.861
of a mother and an infant.

00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:55.467
Because we think about, how
do we optimize that infant's

00:05:55.467 --> 00:05:58.312
outcome in that particular time and place?

00:05:58.312 --> 00:06:00.996
For the challenge that infant is handling.

00:06:00.996 --> 00:06:02.663
Or trying to handle.

00:06:03.642 --> 00:06:05.677
And this is challenging
because natural selection

00:06:05.677 --> 00:06:08.038
has not shaped mothers to
optimize the outcome of

00:06:08.038 --> 00:06:10.072
a particular infant.

00:06:10.072 --> 00:06:12.761
Natural selection has
shaped mothers' physiology

00:06:12.761 --> 00:06:15.284
to allocate investment
in young across an entire

00:06:15.284 --> 00:06:17.042
reproductive career.

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:20.099
To maximize her reproductive
success across her

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.016
reproductive life span.

00:06:23.026 --> 00:06:25.670
And because of this, we see
that there are going to be

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.002
a number of trade-offs
in how she allocates

00:06:29.002 --> 00:06:31.682
resources between her
own body and how she's

00:06:31.682 --> 00:06:34.242
nourishing her infant.

00:06:34.242 --> 00:06:37.088
Just like I can only spend a dollar once,

00:06:37.088 --> 00:06:40.183
an organism can only burn a calorie once.

00:06:40.183 --> 00:06:43.441
And if that calorie's
burned on immune function,

00:06:43.441 --> 00:06:46.807
it's not available to allocate
toward infant development.

00:06:46.807 --> 00:06:51.295
And we see the signature
of these trade-offs

00:06:51.295 --> 00:06:54.585
broadly in how mothers
are synthesizing milk.

00:06:54.585 --> 00:06:57.311
But this evolutionary
life history perspective

00:06:57.311 --> 00:06:59.958
has not been systematically
integrated into medical

00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.971
approaches within infant care management.

00:07:02.971 --> 00:07:05.657
The important thing there is
that food, medicine, and signal

00:07:05.657 --> 00:07:09.324
of milk is going to
vary across all mothers.

00:07:10.253 --> 00:07:12.489
The presence and abundance
of a particular milk

00:07:12.489 --> 00:07:16.395
bio-active is not
standardized, and in fact,

00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:19.854
the signature in milk across
each individual mother

00:07:19.854 --> 00:07:21.199
is going to be different.

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:24.535
When we look at milk
synthesis, across every single

00:07:24.535 --> 00:07:27.183
potential scale of consideration,

00:07:27.183 --> 00:07:29.055
we find that milk varies.

00:07:29.055 --> 00:07:31.371
It varies across species.

00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:34.824
It varies across
populations within species.

00:07:34.824 --> 00:07:38.276
Across individuals within
populations, within

00:07:38.276 --> 00:07:41.164
individual across lactations,
within individuals within a

00:07:41.164 --> 00:07:45.314
lactation, and we can actually
see the synthesis of milk

00:07:45.314 --> 00:07:48.690
and composition of a
particular bio-active shift

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.420
from hour to hour throughout the day.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.779
And so, to kind of think
about, what are the signatures

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:57.193
that we see in the milk
a mother synthesizes?

00:07:57.193 --> 00:08:00.937
So, Dr Elizabeth Quinn has
shown that just the fat content

00:08:00.937 --> 00:08:03.533
in milk, you can go to the
store and it's processed

00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:05.652
and you can get it at
three percent, two percent,

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:09.064
one percent, or where the
fat's entirely removed.

00:08:09.064 --> 00:08:11.337
But across human
populations, the mean value

00:08:11.337 --> 00:08:14.587
of the fat content in their
milk is substantially variable.

00:08:14.587 --> 00:08:17.763
We see gradients between
rural and urban communities

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:21.096
in things like, their
minerals, fatty acids, hormones

00:08:21.096 --> 00:08:23.618
and sugars within milk.

00:08:23.618 --> 00:08:26.590
We see the signature of
cultural ecology in the form

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.562
of subsistence patterns in their milk.

00:08:29.562 --> 00:08:32.653
This is shown for fatty
acids, immunofactors, sugars,

00:08:32.653 --> 00:08:34.483
and minerals.

00:08:34.483 --> 00:08:37.899
Melanie Martin now at
Yale University has shown

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:41.600
that among forager
horticulturalists in the Amazon

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.320
that the Omega-3 fatty acid
concentration in their milk

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.643
is not only higher than
that which is found

00:08:46.643 --> 00:08:50.306
in the breast milk of women
living in the Ohio River Valley,

00:08:50.306 --> 00:08:53.853
but their ratio of Omega-3s to Omega-6s is

00:08:53.853 --> 00:08:56.091
closer to what we consider
to be the most healthy

00:08:56.091 --> 00:08:57.473
for infants.

00:08:57.473 --> 00:09:01.373
Across individuals, when
we look at dairy cows

00:09:01.373 --> 00:09:05.078
as a model for lactation
biology, humans and monkeys

00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:07.762
as another model for human bio-medicine,

00:09:07.762 --> 00:09:10.000
we find that maternal
characteristics are going to

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.833
leave their signature in milk.

00:09:11.833 --> 00:09:13.988
Mothers who have better body conditions,

00:09:13.988 --> 00:09:17.439
lower parasite loads, and
greater social capital

00:09:17.439 --> 00:09:20.485
or access to resources, are
going to synthesize milk

00:09:20.485 --> 00:09:23.943
in different ways than mothers
who are more constrained.

00:09:23.943 --> 00:09:26.350
We see this in the volume of
milk that they're producing,

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.521
fat concentration and hormonal signals.

00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:31.431
Similarly across these same species,

00:09:31.431 --> 00:09:33.831
we find that the infants'
characteristics are also

00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:36.433
implicated in the variation
of milk that mothers

00:09:36.433 --> 00:09:38.388
are synthesizing.

00:09:38.388 --> 00:09:40.546
So, the age of the infant
at birth in terms of

00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:43.639
gestational age, the infant's
sex, whether it's male

00:09:43.639 --> 00:09:46.528
or female, and whether
or not the infant is sick

00:09:46.528 --> 00:09:48.972
are all implicated in
different aspects of milk

00:09:48.972 --> 00:09:51.773
composition and production.

00:09:51.773 --> 00:09:54.174
This differentiated
biological recipe in milk

00:09:54.174 --> 00:09:56.616
has been found broadly
across a number of different

00:09:56.616 --> 00:09:59.710
mammal species and it's
important to understand

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.231
that this does not
necessarily mean that mothers

00:10:02.231 --> 00:10:03.982
are making better or worse milk

00:10:03.982 --> 00:10:06.383
for either sons or daughters.

00:10:06.383 --> 00:10:08.779
But where sons and daughters
have different developmental

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:11.591
priorities, different
developmental trajectories,

00:10:11.591 --> 00:10:13.870
we can expect that the
milk that mothers use

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.475
to nourish them is going
to influence aspects

00:10:16.475 --> 00:10:19.475
of those developmental trajectories.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.906
When we go to the grocery store,

00:10:22.906 --> 00:10:26.565
or the pharmacy, there's
different deodorant for

00:10:26.565 --> 00:10:28.315
men and women, right?

00:10:29.741 --> 00:10:31.984
But when we go into the
infant formula section,

00:10:31.984 --> 00:10:33.614
in the grocery store,

00:10:33.614 --> 00:10:36.218
it's one size fits all.

00:10:36.218 --> 00:10:39.672
And we do not yet have enough
information scientifically

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:42.560
to say that's not best practices.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.366
We haven't allocated the
research effort to understanding,

00:10:45.366 --> 00:10:48.249
could we get better infant
developmental outcomes

00:10:48.249 --> 00:10:52.228
if we had more tailored milk for them?

00:10:52.228 --> 00:10:54.138
For infants who don't have
access to breast milk,

00:10:54.138 --> 00:10:55.642
for whatever reason.

00:10:55.642 --> 00:10:59.962
Across time, we see that mothers
early in their reproductive

00:10:59.962 --> 00:11:03.791
career, dairy cows, seals,
and monkeys I work with,

00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:05.786
that adolescent mothers
make different milk

00:11:05.786 --> 00:11:07.700
than mature mothers,

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.115
that across parities,
mothers make different milks.

00:11:11.115 --> 00:11:13.471
This can be in the nutritional components,

00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:15.513
as well as the hormonal
components of their milk.

00:11:15.513 --> 00:11:17.268
And the signatures that
this may leave in infant

00:11:17.268 --> 00:11:20.318
development are still poorly understood.

00:11:20.318 --> 00:11:23.568
So lactation is an adaptive
contingency system,

00:11:23.568 --> 00:11:26.496
in which mothers that have
more access to resources

00:11:26.496 --> 00:11:29.950
are able to up-regulate
aspects of milk synthesis

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.845
or mothers that are
constrained down-regulate

00:11:32.845 --> 00:11:34.921
milk synthesis to protect
their condition for

00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:37.483
future reproduction,
and this is shown both

00:11:37.483 --> 00:11:39.309
through the milk that they're synthesizing

00:11:39.309 --> 00:11:41.955
and their behavioral
dynamic with their infant.

00:11:41.955 --> 00:11:44.152
And this is a function
of maternal resources

00:11:44.152 --> 00:11:47.891
and their allocations among
different trade off priorities.

00:11:47.891 --> 00:11:52.244
An adolescent thirteen
year old human mother

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:54.726
is going to be constrained in her capacity

00:11:54.726 --> 00:11:58.673
to synthesize milk, so that
means that clinical support

00:11:58.673 --> 00:12:00.993
for that mother-infant dyad
is going to have to take

00:12:00.993 --> 00:12:05.219
into consideration the
cascading trade off allocations

00:12:05.219 --> 00:12:09.495
between her condition and
the condition of her infant.

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:11.816
And this is important
because where milk production

00:12:11.816 --> 00:12:15.801
is constrained, where milk
production is insufficient,

00:12:15.801 --> 00:12:18.898
we see impacts on infant development.

00:12:18.898 --> 00:12:21.459
So milk composition and
milk volume is implicated

00:12:21.459 --> 00:12:23.938
in different growth,
their immune functions,

00:12:23.938 --> 00:12:27.554
how microbes colonize
their intestinal tract,

00:12:27.554 --> 00:12:29.789
their cognition and their behavior.

00:12:29.789 --> 00:12:32.273
We see this in animal
model systems in a variety

00:12:32.273 --> 00:12:34.308
of different human settings.

00:12:34.308 --> 00:12:37.074
And this is quite important
because in the media,

00:12:37.074 --> 00:12:40.699
we're seeing a lot of
pushback on the specialness

00:12:40.699 --> 00:12:44.117
of breast milk, or the
importance of breast milk.

00:12:44.117 --> 00:12:46.802
Because it's really
centered around a narrative

00:12:46.802 --> 00:12:48.597
of best case scenario.

00:12:48.597 --> 00:12:52.301
For full term infants,
that are born healthy,

00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:56.611
and raised in incredibly protected
and buffered environments

00:12:56.611 --> 00:12:59.410
the effect size that's
transferred by being breastfed

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.701
or formula fed is going
to be fairly moderate.

00:13:02.701 --> 00:13:05.063
But when we anchor the
narrative to those best case

00:13:05.063 --> 00:13:09.216
scenarios, we lose sight
of many situations in which

00:13:09.216 --> 00:13:12.151
the consequences can be quite a bit dire.

00:13:12.151 --> 00:13:14.431
So if we think about the
premature infant born

00:13:14.431 --> 00:13:18.598
in the less than 39 weeks,
that ends up in the NICU,

00:13:20.287 --> 00:13:23.542
you know, very very young
infants, 25, 27, 29 weeks of age

00:13:23.542 --> 00:13:25.494
that spend a substantial
amount of time in the neonatal

00:13:25.494 --> 00:13:28.627
intensive care unit, breast
milk or bio-active features

00:13:28.627 --> 00:13:31.921
of breast milk can be absolutely
critical for their health.

00:13:31.921 --> 00:13:34.685
If we think of children
growing up in spaces with

00:13:34.685 --> 00:13:37.696
substantial infectious disease risk,

00:13:37.696 --> 00:13:39.812
then the immunofactors that
are present in breast milk

00:13:39.812 --> 00:13:42.664
and not found in other alternatives,

00:13:42.664 --> 00:13:45.247
are going to be very important.

00:13:46.281 --> 00:13:48.475
In settings in which
there is substantial risk

00:13:48.475 --> 00:13:50.514
of development of
allergies or other kinds of

00:13:50.514 --> 00:13:53.446
autoimmune kinds of
challenges, then breast milk

00:13:53.446 --> 00:13:56.048
may be a buffer to that.

00:13:56.048 --> 00:14:00.199
And even when we think about
that best case scenario,

00:14:00.199 --> 00:14:02.195
where individuals are most buffered,

00:14:02.195 --> 00:14:04.844
and the effect sizes
are the most moderate,

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:07.894
when we scale those up
across a population,

00:14:07.894 --> 00:14:10.869
the health consequences add up.

00:14:10.869 --> 00:14:15.548
And the health care dollar
costs add up substantially.

00:14:15.548 --> 00:14:19.499
So we need to think about not
just the best case scenario,

00:14:19.499 --> 00:14:21.168
not just one child and her options,

00:14:21.168 --> 00:14:25.316
but at a public health,
population level as well.

00:14:25.316 --> 00:14:27.952
So this is a complex adaptive system,

00:14:27.952 --> 00:14:30.677
and we can use that
understanding of these systems

00:14:30.677 --> 00:14:32.831
and how they've been
shaped by natural selection

00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:35.119
to identify particular
strategies and targets

00:14:35.119 --> 00:14:36.951
for intervention.

00:14:36.951 --> 00:14:39.397
So some aspects of milk
synthesis are going to be

00:14:39.397 --> 00:14:42.533
quite flexible, some are going
to represent constraints,

00:14:42.533 --> 00:14:44.409
and some are going to
be fixed as a function

00:14:44.409 --> 00:14:46.689
of genotype or other types of variables.

00:14:46.689 --> 00:14:50.108
And these situations where
these represent trade-offs

00:14:50.108 --> 00:14:54.016
of the mother, we can
use public interventions,

00:14:54.016 --> 00:14:57.149
access to resources, social
justice and public health

00:14:57.149 --> 00:14:59.996
interventions like the WIC program to help

00:14:59.996 --> 00:15:02.848
improve the resources so
mothers are not trading off

00:15:02.848 --> 00:15:05.212
to the same extent as
they are when they have

00:15:05.212 --> 00:15:06.798
fewer resources.

00:15:06.798 --> 00:15:09.117
When the constraints become more fixed,

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.313
when there isn't a capacity
to influence mothers,

00:15:11.313 --> 00:15:13.222
to up-regulate their milk synthesis,

00:15:13.222 --> 00:15:15.262
or shift their milk composition,

00:15:15.262 --> 00:15:17.982
then we have opportunities
in which evolutionary

00:15:17.982 --> 00:15:21.321
insights can yield
important advantages to how

00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:23.654
we approach milk management.

00:15:24.658 --> 00:15:27.713
So right now we see that
20 million infants are born

00:15:27.713 --> 00:15:30.482
premature across the globe each year.

00:15:30.482 --> 00:15:31.985
The vast majority of these are happening

00:15:31.985 --> 00:15:33.774
in the global South.

00:15:33.774 --> 00:15:36.821
And these infants are administered milk

00:15:36.821 --> 00:15:39.629
as a clinical intervention,
so this is either

00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:42.883
donor milk, formula, or
other kinds of modified

00:15:42.883 --> 00:15:45.565
milk products, which
have their own bioethical

00:15:45.565 --> 00:15:47.071
considerations.

00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:51.343
Right now, these milks
represent mean values

00:15:51.343 --> 00:15:54.147
as though we know the gold standard.

00:15:54.147 --> 00:15:58.230
And this is an erasing of
a lot of the individual

00:15:59.515 --> 00:16:02.977
or more specialized,
tailored features of milk.

00:16:02.977 --> 00:16:06.312
And these products and
interventions are based off of

00:16:06.312 --> 00:16:09.894
mean values among what would we call,

00:16:09.894 --> 00:16:13.070
or what Joe Henrich would
coin, weird populations.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.244
Westernized, educated,
industrialized, rich,

00:16:16.244 --> 00:16:18.934
democratic populations, okay?

00:16:18.934 --> 00:16:20.684
Weird, they're weird.

00:16:22.553 --> 00:16:26.720
And they do not necessarily
reflect ancestral conditions.

00:16:28.616 --> 00:16:31.872
Or the diversity of milks
that mothers are making,

00:16:31.872 --> 00:16:34.435
but if we make this our gold standard,

00:16:34.435 --> 00:16:37.695
and it's not actually
the best target for us

00:16:37.695 --> 00:16:41.689
to replicate and match,
then we're going down

00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:43.889
a sub-optimal pathway.

00:16:43.889 --> 00:16:46.579
So we can think about,
what do we know about milk?

00:16:46.579 --> 00:16:50.610
What has already been found
out, and can we from there

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.908
design clinical trials
and other kinds of studies

00:16:53.908 --> 00:16:55.859
to see if there is
added-value space within

00:16:55.859 --> 00:16:57.726
clinical care.

00:16:57.726 --> 00:17:00.329
So right now in the
NICU, some form of milk

00:17:00.329 --> 00:17:02.282
is being provided.

00:17:02.282 --> 00:17:04.800
Can we do better if we
start thinking in terms

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.036
of precision milk,
along with other aspects

00:17:07.036 --> 00:17:08.869
of precision medicine?

00:17:09.719 --> 00:17:11.959
So can we do better if we match milk

00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:16.514
for the, whether the child or
baby is a son or a daughter?

00:17:16.514 --> 00:17:19.234
Can we do better if we give
morning milk in the morning

00:17:19.234 --> 00:17:21.390
and night milk at night?

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.426
Adults and children have
circadian rhythms in which

00:17:23.426 --> 00:17:27.110
our glucocorticoids are
higher in the morning

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:29.819
and lower in the afternoon and evening

00:17:29.819 --> 00:17:31.307
and while we sleep.

00:17:31.307 --> 00:17:34.198
Babies don't have a circadian rhythm.

00:17:34.198 --> 00:17:36.678
They get information
about a circadian rhythm

00:17:36.678 --> 00:17:39.405
through their mother's milk.

00:17:39.405 --> 00:17:42.704
So what happens when we
provide day milk at night?

00:17:42.704 --> 00:17:44.697
Does that excite the babies' systems?

00:17:44.697 --> 00:17:47.341
This is an empirical
question for which we do not

00:17:47.341 --> 00:17:51.368
have published information at this time.

00:17:51.368 --> 00:17:54.951
For babies that get
milk could we do better

00:17:55.796 --> 00:17:59.580
if we matched donors in a selective way?

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.263
That we add value by
taking milk from particular

00:18:02.263 --> 00:18:06.610
life history stages or mothers
of particular genotypes

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.360
in the donor options?

00:18:09.538 --> 00:18:10.762
It's an empirical question.

00:18:10.762 --> 00:18:12.309
We don't yet know.

00:18:12.309 --> 00:18:15.079
The FUT2 genotype influences what sugars

00:18:15.079 --> 00:18:17.963
and whether or not they're fucosselated,

00:18:17.963 --> 00:18:18.796
are present in milk,

00:18:18.796 --> 00:18:20.203
and these are important for influencing

00:18:20.203 --> 00:18:22.929
the microbial colonization
of the infant's gut.

00:18:22.929 --> 00:18:26.472
Can we target pooling milk across mothers

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:28.585
to create a super milk that's going to be

00:18:28.585 --> 00:18:31.229
quite important for
particularly vulnerable

00:18:31.229 --> 00:18:32.860
or sick infants?

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.824
Can we mix glicands to maximize the health

00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:39.071
of the microbial system
colonizing the infant's gut?

00:18:39.071 --> 00:18:43.664
Can we provide particular
microbes to those infants?

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:47.286
Right now, all of the
milk processing techniques

00:18:47.286 --> 00:18:49.607
in the neonatal intensive
care unit involve

00:18:49.607 --> 00:18:52.581
neutralizing these components
of milk that we know

00:18:52.581 --> 00:18:55.248
are potentially quite important.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.900
And lastly, can we co-opt and bio-engineer

00:19:01.275 --> 00:19:04.323
milk bio-actives from
other species that are

00:19:04.323 --> 00:19:07.573
solving evolutionary problems that have

00:19:08.552 --> 00:19:11.275
importance for infants in the NICU today?

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:13.393
So when you look at the
marsupials, kangaroos,

00:19:13.393 --> 00:19:16.570
wallabies, they're born
at very, very early stages

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:17.820
of development.

00:19:18.886 --> 00:19:21.610
They have very undeveloped lungs.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:24.374
And there's milk
bio-actives within the milk

00:19:24.374 --> 00:19:26.894
that their mothers
synthesize, that accelerate

00:19:26.894 --> 00:19:30.190
the development of their
lungs specifically.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.357
Could it be possible to
replicate or bio-engineer that

00:19:35.268 --> 00:19:39.787
in ways that we can provide it
to these 25, 27, 29 week old

00:19:39.787 --> 00:19:42.474
infants who are at huge
risk for pnuemonial disease

00:19:42.474 --> 00:19:45.276
because their lungs are undeveloped?

00:19:45.276 --> 00:19:47.148
And there are people in
Australia working on answering

00:19:47.148 --> 00:19:48.568
that question right now.

00:19:48.568 --> 00:19:50.760
They're using an evolutionary perspective

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.125
of how natural selection
has shaped adaptations

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:56.258
to solve problems that
have implications for

00:19:56.258 --> 00:19:58.815
the unique challenges that humans face

00:19:58.815 --> 00:20:02.550
in our particular cultural context.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:06.898
And lastly, when most of
this has been talking about

00:20:06.898 --> 00:20:09.220
donor milks and bioengineering.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.101
But there are many infants
who do not have access to milk

00:20:12.101 --> 00:20:13.973
for a variety of reasons.

00:20:13.973 --> 00:20:15.930
There are metabolic disorders,

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.005
other kinds of illnesses in
which mothers are not able

00:20:18.005 --> 00:20:19.507
to synthesize milk,

00:20:19.507 --> 00:20:21.666
there's historical traumas
and cultural contexts

00:20:21.666 --> 00:20:24.517
that make it very difficult.

00:20:24.517 --> 00:20:26.749
There are infants who are
raised by wonderful families

00:20:26.749 --> 00:20:29.595
that don't include a mom.

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:33.762
And these families rely in
very important ways on formula.

00:20:35.085 --> 00:20:37.766
Artificial breast milk.

00:20:37.766 --> 00:20:40.493
How do we make a better
artificial breast milk

00:20:40.493 --> 00:20:44.849
that delivers more of the
important bio-actives in milk

00:20:44.849 --> 00:20:48.514
to help enhance those
infants' development?

00:20:48.514 --> 00:20:51.274
These are the kinds of things
we can take an evolutionary

00:20:51.274 --> 00:20:56.156
perspective, apply it to a
variety of clinical and cultural

00:20:56.156 --> 00:20:58.906
settings to improve human health.

00:21:00.947 --> 00:21:04.772
And this is what it means to
be thinking evolutionarily

00:21:04.772 --> 00:21:08.472
to approach medical condition
challenges of human infants.

00:21:08.472 --> 00:21:09.389
Thank you.
