00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right! This quiz is on finite state machines.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I have drawn a super cool one here at the top

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and then down here at the bottom, I have four candidate regular expressions.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What I'd like you to do is note each regular expression that has exactly the same language

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that accepts exactly the same strings as this finite state machine.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That is what I want you to go backwards and find from this finite state machine

00:00:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
best regular expression that matches it.
