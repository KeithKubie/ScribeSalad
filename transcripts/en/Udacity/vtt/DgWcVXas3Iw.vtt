00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The diagram that we get works as follows. Let's for instance look at the two red curves.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
They show the effect the initial value has on the result.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It changes the initial value up and down by 5 * 10⁴ tons and you get this curve and that curve.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You can immediately spot that this blue curve belongs to a factor that's more critical.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The blue one is the carrying capacity, and obviously,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the most critical is M for magenta, the maximum growth rate.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If we want to improve the reliability of our result, we definitely need to work on the uncertainty

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
of all maximum growth rate as opposed to what we just did.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This code doesn't look at the complete temporal evolution, it just looks at one single value,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the total amount of harvest for that particular set of parameters.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It compares what happens when that factor goes up to what happens when that factor goes down

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and then determines the factor for which this difference is largest.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
When you show here as we increase the value of that factor, the result may go down,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and as we decrease the value of that factor, the result may go up,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
so that we end up with a negative sign of the difference here.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is why we're using the absolute value and corresponding to what we guessed from the curves,

00:01:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
the most critical parameter is the maximum growth rate.
