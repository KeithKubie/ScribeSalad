00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:06,250
This is Jocko podcast number
41 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,490
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:17,020
And tonight we are lucky to
have a guest on the podcast.

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,570
My friend,
my teammate,

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,590
my brother Tonia fratty and I'm going
to start the podcast by reading a speech

6
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:36,410
that I wrote when Tony
Retired from the teens.

7
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,290
And for whatever reason,

8
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:44,150
some reason that I don't remember
it was work or job or some travel or

9
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:44,601
something.

10
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:49,601
I couldn't actually be
there to read this myself.

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,820
And that's the way the teams is. You
do your job, that's the priority.

12
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:59,660
And I knew Tony would understand that I
wouldn't be there and it would be no big

13
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:03,890
deal to him.
And I acted like it was no big deal to me.

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,560
But I wanted to be there and I should
have been there in a wrote a speech and

15
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:14,690
I'm emailed it to one of our,
one of our friends,

16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,310
one of our Bros, another seal
master chief, and he read it there.

17
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,600
But I should have been
there to read it myself.

18
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,060
And you will hear that this speeches

19
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,350
kind of like Tony is draw
and straightforward and real.

20
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:41,280
And so here's the speech that I
wrote for Tony when he retired.

21
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,173
Here we go.

22
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,303
First of all,

23
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,340
I apologize to Tony that I couldn't be
there out in the desert today to see you

24
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:52,664
off.

25
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,060
And for those of you that
are with him today, no,

26
00:01:58,061 --> 00:02:02,080
this Tony a fratty is a hero,

27
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,630
a dirty, scrappy, rough,

28
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,390
hard mean bastard,

29
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,550
but a hero.

30
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,200
I have known him for over 20 years and
in those 20 years I got to see him in

31
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:19,700
many capacities.

32
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,390
First as a young hardcore beer swilling
muscle car driving machine gunning fist

33
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:30,690
fighting,
third class petty officer.

34
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,440
Then as an experienced hardcore
Jack Daniels swilling fist fighting,

35
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:42,601
second class leading petty officer
next as a Badass hardcore fist fighting

36
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,360
knowledge filled,
first class training cell instructor.

37
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,510
And finally as a seal platoon chief and
we all know that being a platoon chief

38
00:02:58,131 --> 00:03:02,560
is supposed to, that you're
hard core. It's supposed to
mean that your experience,

39
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,600
it's supposed to mean that
you're a tough bastard.

40
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,070
It's supposed to mean
that you're fearless.

41
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:08,440
It's supposed to mean that
you're a true leader of men.

42
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,490
Unfortunately,
we all know

43
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,880
that that isn't always true,
but with Tony,

44
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,430
it's 100% true.
Tony is without question,

45
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,560
the primordial seal chief,
the ultimate senior enlisted leader.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,380
When I joined the teams,

47
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,520
I joined a follow guys like Tony into
unbridled combat into the violent fray

48
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,000
into hell.

49
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,410
Yeah.

50
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,830
I was lucky enough to work with Tony
when he was one of the platoon chiefs in

51
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:50,940
our task unit and seal team
three from 2005 to 2006

52
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,790
task unit bruiser.

53
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,690
We started our work up here in the desert,

54
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,230
the true forging ground of frog
men with a couple of years on me.

55
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,420
He was the oldest guy in the troop and
therefore the primary representative of

56
00:04:08,521 --> 00:04:13,230
the old breed and he represented
the old breed with honor.

57
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,820
He immediately proved that he was
physically harder, mentally tougher,

58
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:20,850
and operationally superior
to any of the young bucks.

59
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,790
Really it was August 115 plus degrees.

60
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,930
He didn't get tired.
He out shot everyone.

61
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,260
He ran immediate action
drills like Erwin Rommel.

62
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,460
He didn't drink water seriously.

63
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,920
Coffee in Copenhagen.

64
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,550
That's it and desert training
was just the beginning.

65
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,930
He led every evolution through the entire
workup, always coming up with the plan,

66
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:51,450
always training and mentoring
the new guys and everyone else.

67
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,130
We trained and we trained hard.
I drew a line in the sand.

68
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,080
Tony held that line.

69
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,950
We pushed the envelope in every
evolution and prepared for war

70
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,150
somehow.

71
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,350
Some way we knew what the future held.

72
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,270
We deployed to Ramadi,

73
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:19,271
Iraq in April of 2006
and two are absolute joy.

74
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,150
It was an embroiled in a war zone.

75
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,750
We had been on the ground about a
day when I went to meet the brewer,

76
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,040
the brigade commander Toni,

77
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,220
who was already out in the city in a
sniper Overwatch position as I walked into

78
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:39,281
the brigade tactical operation center
and shook hands with the colonel John

79
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,760
Grotowski.
He said,

80
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:44,090
one of your snipers just killed an Iud
in place are up on race track where we

81
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:46,550
lost form four marines three days ago

82
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,800
and that is exactly what he needed
us to do. He needed us to kill them.

83
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,940
That sniper was Tony with the kill of
the deployment strategic due to its

84
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:00,590
timing,

85
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,850
timing that opened up the entire
battlespace to task unit bruiser.

86
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,500
And so we fought and fought and
killed the enemy by the Bushel.

87
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,200
And Tony was at the front the entire time.
He never wavered.

88
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,420
He never faltered despite
the heat, despite the danger,
despite heavy casualties,

89
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:28,421
he constantly pushed to get out over and
over and over again to kill the savages

90
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:32,420
that were determined to destroy
America and coalition forces.

91
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,550
He never asked for a pause or a
break or a night off or a minute off.

92
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,570
Everything that I ever asked of him,
everything he did,

93
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,650
and he did it with every ounce or
commitment and drive and selflessness and

94
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:52,100
professionalism that any
human could ever muster.

95
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,150
And we would talk and laugh and we
would discuss what we could do better.

96
00:06:57,151 --> 00:07:00,980
And we'd come up with a plan. And in
the end, Tony would give me a head nod.

97
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,070
And that had not meant he had it.
It was done.

98
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,260
He owned it.
And I never doubted that ever.

99
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,200
He never missed an operation and applied
himself to each mission with solemn

100
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:22,390
gravity.
As the senior enlisted leader,

101
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,000
he poured over maps and imagery.

102
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,360
He held detailed warning orders.

103
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:32,650
He briefed the platoon with clarity
and directness. He led rehearsals.

104
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,370
He did everything he could do
to be ready in his platoon,

105
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:37,990
performed magnificently.

106
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,740
Accounting for hundreds of enemy killed
when his own men were wounded or killed

107
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:47,680
in action. It only fueled his
motivation to kill more of the enemy,

108
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,070
to fight harder to slaughter
more of the evil soul.

109
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:54,240
This enemy and rid the world
of their wretched kind.

110
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,490
That is what every seal should
aspire to be like. In Tony's words,

111
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,380
BTF a big tough frog man with no fear,

112
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,900
no hesitation and no mercy.

113
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,620
Just be to BTF through
everything like Tony did

114
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,780
for senior chief of Friday's courage,
determination, and leadership.

115
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,420
I will be eternally grateful.

116
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,010
I owe him more than I can ever
repay him for what he did for me,

117
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,330
for the task unit,
for the teams and for our great nation.

118
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,830
Let there be no doubt the
man before you as a hero,

119
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,360
the teams or a worse place without his
presence, his guidance, his leadership,

120
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,380
his example,

121
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,080
those that served with him must strive
to carry the torch and pass it on so that

122
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:47,840
his spirit burns bright
in the team's forever.

123
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,470
I recently watched a movie about,
let me kill sister,

124
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,233
the lead,

125
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,510
the leader of the original
classic heavy metal thrash band,

126
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:07,170
Motorhead, the movie
chronicles, the life of Lemmy,

127
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,110
the hard living,
rock and roll legend.

128
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,630
The movie paints a picture of a
unique individual that will never,

129
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,540
that can never exist again.

130
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,740
The movie is called Lemmy,
49% motherfucker,

131
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,500
51% son of a bitch.

132
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,370
And that seems to suit,
let me pretty well

133
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,890
and I'm not exactly sure how those
numbers would break out for Tony,

134
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,630
but I do know this,

135
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Tony a fratty is 100% frogman
always was and always will be.

136
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,130
Tony, thanks for everything.
I'll see you on the other side.

137
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,820
BTF Jocko.

138
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,270
And with that Tony,

139
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,610
thanks for coming on the show.

140
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,430
Thanks a lot brother. Kinda forgot about
that. Yeah. And that was, that was good.

141
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:14,710
And the guy, we're talking about
reddit pretty good too. And yeah,

142
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,470
I didn't have like a
big ceremony or nothing.

143
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,130
He just went out the nylon and we get
all gummed up and that was about it. But,

144
00:10:22,131 --> 00:10:22,840
uh,

145
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,050
I do, I appreciate it man. Yeah,
it's good to see you brother.

146
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,990
It's good seeing you too.
And you know, actually, uh,

147
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,270
when I told people that you
were coming on the show,

148
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,170
Yo people actually know who you
are from the lift to tell. Oh yeah.

149
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,290
And uh, Lafe Lafe spit on here.
We talked about you, you know,

150
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,080
told some stories and shit. And so, uh,

151
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,710
but a bunch of people had a
bunch of questions and you know,

152
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:49,240
I figured we try and get
through some of them.

153
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,400
We won't be able to answer
all the ones that I got,

154
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,020
but I picked out some of them and uh,

155
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:58,480
let you take a look and pick
out some of them. So, well,
I mean, first and foremost,

156
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,500
people just want to know kind of who the
hell are you and where'd you come from?

157
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,980
As funny a few years back, like, uh,

158
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,110
we're all in Arizona and I took a bunch
of the guys in the platoon over to my

159
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:16,640
parents' house. No, we had SAPA
and everyday is a wicked fun.

160
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,440
Jeremy Pulls me aside and he's like,
you're actually have parents.

161
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,220
I thought you were born round or a
rock somewhere in the desert. I'm like,

162
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,500
shut up. You know, that
was pretty funny. Now I'm,

163
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,330
I'm from New Hampshire and uh,
all right.

164
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,200
It's just probably like you just,
yeah,

165
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,670
it's not so much wanting to be a seal.
I just want to be something different.

166
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,930
You know? I could have went like a biker
gang or something just as easy, you know,

167
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,090
you know,
I figured if this,

168
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,480
I have a pretty good chance of staying
out of the clinic, you know, this way.

169
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:54,250
But not always,
but a few times,

170
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,750
you know,
that's fair.

171
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,700
But it teams just suited me because
everybody's the same. Everybody,

172
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,860
you know,
every where you look,

173
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,820
guys are doing what you would do
and they act how you would act.

174
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:10,860
And it's not always great.
But you know, so you,

175
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,890
you got recruited though by some of the
boys, like over in the Pi, didn't you?

176
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,260
Yeah, I mean, I wanted be abuse you,

177
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:22,261
but I wasn't like thousand percent now
and I was in the Philippines and I was

178
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:26,080
like, all right, I gotta
do that. That's it.

179
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,870
So I went and got a screening test
over there in Subic Bay and you know,

180
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,380
I smoked it and I then, you know, they
didn't have this long pipeline back then.

181
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:36,790
I got there on a Friday,

182
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,410
we've got all gummed up and shaved their
heads on Sunday and we started Monday.

183
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,520
There was not that was it just
okay, go. Well actually I know, uh,

184
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,470
I was talking to the old master chief
that actually was the guy that recruited

185
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:53,570
you and told you you need
to be a team guy. And me,

186
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,400
I was talking to her the other day when
you were down at his house on the phone.

187
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,690
Yeah. But uh, yeah. And he was one
of my platoon chief says, you know,

188
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,063
but I told him,

189
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,270
I told him the best thing he ever did
for the teams was get you to enjoy the

190
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,710
that's he was laughing.
He probably probably like,

191
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,250
well definitely the best thing for you.

192
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:17,380
You know how saved your ass from all
kinds of try. Absolutely. But it's just,

193
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,930
you know,
it's the team's like between us,

194
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:24,760
we got like 46 years a team guy life.
And uh,

195
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,820
it's so hard to put in perspective.
If you don't all you talk, you know,

196
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:32,110
you've never been there. No people
like, people don't know that.

197
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:36,250
We don't call each other seals. Yeah. You
never say that. You never, nobody says,

198
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:40,000
when I joined the navy seals, I
was like, when I became a team guy,

199
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,210
I say that everyone just
like turned her head go.

200
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,500
It's come on really weird when you hear
a team guy referred to being a navy seal

201
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,040
actually makes you think,
well wait, wait a second. Who,

202
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,230
this guy must not have
actually been in the class.

203
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,310
Are you in your immediate interrogation?
Like,

204
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,080
what would your Hancock behind your back?

205
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:02,580
Like I'm just gonna it's gonna hit him.

206
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,970
So I'd give his driver's license. A
black guy. I don't know where that,

207
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,270
I don't know where that comes from.
Like where we don't say it.

208
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,900
I guess maybe it's, I don't, when I
got the team water it was like, Oh,

209
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:17,080
you don't talk about it. Yeah. You don't
say it. No. I don't know. Stickers.

210
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:20,920
No t shirts. No. No. You don't
do any of that. I'm sure.

211
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:24,780
All the honorable punishable by death.
You don't, you don't say anything. Well,

212
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,710
we all thought we were going to Vietnam
the next day. He's like, oh my God.

213
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,450
And after awhile you're like, all
right. What's happening here? Yeah.

214
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,410
Good. All right man. Well, so that's,

215
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:46,240
Tony grew up in New England like me.
And you know, did you ever hear this?

216
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:50,690
That they spent a bunch of money
trying to figure out who's training?

217
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,550
The only, literally the
only thing they got was, uh,

218
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,590
guys that wrestled and guys
from New England and it
wasn't like a big difference.

219
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,543
But you know,

220
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:06,650
a normal person has a 26% chance of
making it through and someone from New

221
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,270
England had like a 37 or something like
a small uptick. I think. You know what?

222
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,980
I think also that
there's good people out on the country,

223
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,640
don't get me wrong, but New England
as a pretty strong work ethic,

224
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:22,790
you know what I mean? Yeah.
I've seen that a lot. A lot.

225
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,030
And not that other people
don't. Yeah, but all the guys,

226
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:28,790
mostly guys I moved from New England
and the teams that are pretty good work

227
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,280
ethic. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

228
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,700
I think it just cold to too. So that
doesn't help. That doesn't matter.

229
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:40,970
I think it does, cause I thought
guys from Florida in my class,

230
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:42,410
like dude's these kids from Florida,

231
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,940
there was a couple of kids from
Florida and they will, you know,

232
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,180
all loud and like they
were just big tough guys,

233
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:49,610
but they were already in the teams
basically in their own minds and they all

234
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:50,180
Kuwait,

235
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,660
I know well the first day of buds and
looking around some of these guys and

236
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:57,410
they're like, wow, holy crap,

237
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,650
these guys are like insane
shape and all this stuff.

238
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,240
I'm still hung over from the Pii,
you know,

239
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,250
and I, you know, I made it
and like they didn't, it's,

240
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,460
it's weird,
you know,

241
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:17,000
they just had this kid that quit buds and
then he went and jumped off of a hotel

242
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:20,170
down in San Diego, killed himself
and I looked at a picture of that.

243
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,500
He missed the pool or something.
No, there was no pool to jump into.

244
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,680
He killed himself and he did it right.
I succeeded.

245
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,350
But I was looking at him. I was
talking to, uh, one of the guy,

246
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,570
the guy that we know who's
an instructor over there.

247
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:35,390
And I was looking at a picture of
the dude and the dude was like,

248
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,210
distrapting guy,
all buff plot air.

249
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,800
It just looked like a total stud. And I
go, man, that kind of looked like a stud.

250
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:46,130
What happened? And then the
instructor guide said, dude,

251
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:50,570
they all look like that now.
Like everybody's just, you
know, it's a big deal. Hey,

252
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:52,250
I'm going to go on the seal teams,
I'm going to go on the seal teams.

253
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:54,710
And that's what they're saying.
So they're recruiting is really easy.

254
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:57,200
But the recruiting all these studs world,
but it doesn't matter.

255
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,090
The attrition rate stays the
same. Yeah, that's what you know,

256
00:17:00,091 --> 00:17:02,950
you know that the government
wants more and more teen guns.

257
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,430
It just ain't going to happen. No, it's
not. Not unless you lower the standards.

258
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:11,180
And if that happens, then we've all
not done our job. That's just terrible.

259
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,710
Awesome. All right, get some
of these questions here. Um,

260
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,630
it says here on the first podcast
with leaf, you discussed the story,

261
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,390
which Tony came up with a strategy for an
op and totally, totally food be better.

262
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,750
The brief would be better
coming from life. And it says,

263
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:31,010
where did you develop this humility
and this characteristic of not worrying

264
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:33,200
about individual credit
versus p team objectives.

265
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,290
So to rehash that story real
quick, it was real, we were out at,

266
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,580
we were out at the desert training
facility and we were just planning,

267
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:42,530
you plan something like you don't
want to do iteration training,

268
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:43,810
we just gotta go down and go to,

269
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,060
there was one just one of those and
they changed the target or something.

270
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,770
And you're like, okay, here's what
we need to do. Put guys over here,

271
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:52,590
putting Overwatch over here and walked
through online like this and lay like,

272
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,870
hey, sounds good to go. Why don't
you get the guys over and brief them?

273
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,030
And you said, hey sir, you know what,

274
00:17:57,031 --> 00:18:00,930
you go ahead and brief them that way it
sounds better coming from you and that'd

275
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:03,990
be the way to do it. And he was like,
well all right. You know, he was,

276
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,800
he was fired up and I, when I
saw you do that, I was like,

277
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,860
cause cause this is the thing,
and I forgot to mention this,

278
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,660
you and I have known each
other for a long time.

279
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:14,910
We both held for ad together and,

280
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,020
and we had the same friends and
we hung out at the same places,

281
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,650
but we were never in a platoon together.
Nope. We never in a platoon together.

282
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,120
It never worked together,

283
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,360
like directly together until
we were in tasking at bruiser.

284
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,110
So when I got denial and I
knew you reputation, which was,

285
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,700
which was rock solid,

286
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,760
but I don't trust anybody
about anybody size cus not yes.

287
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,940
So I, so I just, you know,

288
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:46,830
so I'm seeing you kind of for the first
time out there of actually working and

289
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,980
you know, that was a big indicator
to me. I was like, Damn, you know,

290
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:54,000
this guy is totally humble,
wants to make as officer look good,

291
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,610
wants to make, which is only
gonna make the platoon better.

292
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:59,970
It's only going to make everybody
better. So yeah, that was awesome.

293
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,490
And what a great attitude to have. And I
get asked that all the time. People get,

294
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,560
you know, my bosses is doing this
and what should I do? I'm like, well,

295
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,030
give them support. Try and help them.
Yeah. Try and make them look good.

296
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,400
But the thing is chewing away at people
is their ego of them walk the credit and

297
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:16,590
you see this up, do you mean you can
we see this all the time and the lips.

298
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,680
So anyways,
where did you realize that?

299
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:22,410
Did anybody teach you that
or where the hell did you,

300
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,910
how the hell did you know to do that?
I can read and watch people pretty good.

301
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,050
And I watched some guys who kind
of brought me up in the teams,

302
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,940
some of the guys we were talking about
earlier and I tried to kind of mimic

303
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:40,830
them, but then it kind of morphs into
your own shit, you know? Nope. And uh,

304
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,260
well yeah, the first thing is I was
just tired and my voice was gone.

305
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,300
I just wanted him to do it.
I'm just kidding.

306
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,050
So tired, so tired. But uh, yeah,

307
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:59,850
like get over their boss and do your job.
But I mean,

308
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:04,250
some of them guys in that, that
platoon, they were already my chums,

309
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,490
like Chris Kyle and Bob and Jeremy and
them guys who've been around a while and

310
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,010
they already know.

311
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,680
I put them through training and then land
warfare on an island. So they're there.

312
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,610
They know me, you know,
and up to that point,

313
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,080
that's when I was doing a lot of that
shit. And I'm like, no boss, you do it.

314
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:26,760
Because basically he's new to them,
not doing the teams,

315
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:30,310
but he was new and I figured he's got
to do this more and more and more. Yeah.

316
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,970
You know, and, and he did of course, you
know, life stepped up like, uh, like, uh,

317
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,680
you know,
gangbusters and just great officer.

318
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,310
But then beginning stages like,
all right,

319
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,290
I've already done this a million times. I
don't, I don't care. I'm good. You know,

320
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,940
you want my advice, but we'll come
on. Let's just get the ball rolling.

321
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,230
Nice to do it. And so if that answers the
question. Yeah, no, that, that was, uh,

322
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,270
and again,
that was always an attitude you had,

323
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,480
which was he never cared
about looking good yourself.

324
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:03,481
And part of that is you just had such a
good reputation in the teams that what

325
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:09,420
are you going to do with look even better?
Yeah, like again, another navy calmer

326
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,930
but, but you know a lot of people, so if
you're listening and you're wondering,

327
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,700
you know,
what makes,

328
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,360
what makes somebody a good like a
good NCO and it was a lot of marines,

329
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:24,430
a lot of soldiers listen to this.
What makes a good NCO?

330
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,530
You don't always have
to make yourself shine.

331
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,540
You don't always have to be the
guy that's the center of attention.

332
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,710
And as a matter of fact,

333
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,150
generally that shines through as being
a guy that wants to be the center of

334
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:38,050
attention instead of a guy that wants to
have a good bill tune and it's not like

335
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:42,840
it was doing it to make rank and
expect to make e five nevermind.

336
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,770
Senior chief.
Uh,

337
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,630
all right,
next question.

338
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,730
Please detail the way you were able to
use decentralized command when running

339
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:58,960
task unit bruiser and how it was
met through the other commanders.

340
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,780
So for those of you that don't know,

341
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:06,130
decentralized command means you're going
to let your subordinate leadership lead

342
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:10,960
and you're not going to
micromanage everybody. And
that's definitely what I did.

343
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,560
And I didn't micromanage well I should,
I should rephrase that.

344
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,680
We have people need to be micromanaged.
All micromanage them.

345
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,470
If they're jacked up,
I'm going to be all in them.

346
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,110
And exactly like you're talking about
with life in, with Seth and or with, uh,

347
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,980
the other platoon,
the Delta between commander.

348
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,610
I micromanage those guys like crazy when
we first got in because I'm just making

349
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:33,130
sure they were good to go just
because they work that experience.

350
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:37,230
I'm just like guys that don't trust
anybody when you don't know. Yeah.

351
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,380
And then,
uh,

352
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,380
but their goal was to just have them be
able to run on their own and make stuff

353
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:47,080
happen. Because I'll tell
you another thing, you can't,

354
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,110
you can't run everything yourself.
Nobody can know.

355
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,250
And so you got a decentralized command.

356
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,000
And that's what I did was I let
you know when we got on deployment,

357
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,160
I wasn't micromanaging anything. I was
barely, I was just kind of broad guidance,

358
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,930
you know? Right. Of cost and then,

359
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:09,160
and then you guys were running the
stuff and making things happen. I mean,

360
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,710
I would've loved to be on every operation,

361
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,070
but I physically couldn't because
we had multiple ops going on.

362
00:23:15,071 --> 00:23:17,860
We had to split forces.
So what are you going to do?

363
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,670
I've got no problems with anyone in that
group. The lowest guy running an op. Yup.

364
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,120
But you got,

365
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,890
you got to let you gotta let the boys
basically screw up because then you don't

366
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:32,410
know how they're gonna react.
Okay.

367
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:37,090
Do they just sit there and power moo
and then you've got to slap mortar or do

368
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:39,820
they, okay, here's what
you did wrong, Roger that.

369
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,470
And then immediately start
thinking how to fix it.

370
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:44,350
Cause everybody fucks up
everything. What's facing, I mean,

371
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,100
we were never always good at anything.
Stilling really good at much.

372
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,940
There's BTF through it all. And so it
doesn't seem like we made mistakes.

373
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,793
I mean really,

374
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,920
but leadership is funny because some
guys take to it like water and other guys

375
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:03,290
are scared to death of it. Yeah. You know,

376
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:06,440
lately I've been realizing that
because people always say, you know,

377
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,450
our leaders made or born and can you make
a person that's not a good leader into

378
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:14,900
a good leader? And I look
at it kind of like, um,

379
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,650
when you see these video games where
people have different strengths and

380
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:23,651
weaknesses and in a guy might be a strong
and high intellect and good agility

381
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,470
and I don't know, whatever
those games, hair posture. Yeah.

382
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,250
So with leadership at the same thing,
cause there's certain elements,

383
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:36,590
certain natural things that you can
have that make you a good leader,

384
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:41,310
for instance, is a real simple
one. Can you be loud in,

385
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,720
in the seal teams, if you
can't be loud, that's gonna be,

386
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:48,470
that's gonna be a problem. If you can't
just take control of a room and be like,

387
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,140
you know, hey everyone get in this
world. You know, you can't do that.

388
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:53,720
People can hear you. Then you've got
to find a way around that. Right.

389
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,470
Are You articulate?
Can you simplify things that are complex?

390
00:24:57,471 --> 00:25:00,590
There's all these little things that you
get ranked, you basically all ranked at,

391
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,320
and some guys have,

392
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:07,640
they were born low rankings and they
either find a way to make up for them,

393
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,740
they learn how to do them better or
they compensate by using somebody else.

394
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,600
You know, if like I wasn't
loud, I'd be like, Hey Tony,

395
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:18,240
tell everyone to get in here. Then
you can do it. Right. All right. Uh,

396
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:23,270
that makes total sense though.
If someone out there is a leader,

397
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,700
have been in a leadership position, you
know, exactly they talking about. Yup.

398
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,890
And then sometimes it's, you know, hey,

399
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:36,770
what's the problem? Oh really? What's
the problem? Whoa. Okay. Like you said,

400
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,160
good, good. All right. Now you've
identified, go work it out.

401
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,180
Don't sit around and cry about
it and just go do it, you know?

402
00:25:44,181 --> 00:25:46,820
And then you've got five minutes.
Yeah, yeah. We'll take care of it.

403
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,210
I think the other thing with
decentralized command, it's,

404
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,170
that's important is for everybody
didn't know what the limits are,

405
00:25:54,171 --> 00:25:58,550
like how far you can go and
right direction or another.
And I know that, you know,

406
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,010
like I was trusted you guys were
going to do the right thing. Well,

407
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:05,900
like you said early on in that workup,
you know, leadership at every level.

408
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,820
And even the junior guy,

409
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:12,260
it's his responsibility to keep me in
check if something's going wrong because

410
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:17,060
if I'm doing something stupid,
he's like, Hey Tony, what? Oh yeah.

411
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:21,560
Okay. I lost it there for a while cause
sometimes I'm old, sometimes I lose it.

412
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:24,100
And once in a while, you know,
and I'm not gonna apologize.

413
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:31,160
Yeah. Nice. Anything else
on decentralized command?

414
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,510
Well,
it's,

415
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:37,510
it's a lot easier if you start right from
the beginning trying to make everybody

416
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,820
understand decentralized command.
Cause that's the goal. Yeah.

417
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,310
It has to be the goal.
Someone like you,

418
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,510
you can't, you gotta be
somewhere else. You know, we,

419
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,090
we didn't want you on the
battlefield with this.

420
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,210
I wanted you on a battlefield with me
every time you where I was like, oh,

421
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:59,130
this is awesome. I mean, I really, really
needed you back where you are. Of course,

422
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,900
you know, and that is it. Everybody
had a wicked high level of confidence.

423
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:07,140
Just knowing that you were
back there taking care of
watching her back, you know,

424
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,370
and never sleeping and just
doing like 40 pull ups,

425
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,700
sweating and,
and trying to eat everything in the camp.

426
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,680
Yeah, yeah. It's a,

427
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:26,210
it the, the thing that you talk about as
far as getting everyone to know that and

428
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:29,690
understand that from the beginning
is, is for sure. Oh yeah.

429
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,590
I mean everybody's got to know that man,
you know,

430
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,520
I don't want like my favorite thing is
I go out on an operation with you guys

431
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,420
and not do anything. Now you would
just shoot around the shooter. Okay.

432
00:27:41,421 --> 00:27:43,400
I'm just in the train.
All the, you know, that's,

433
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:47,540
that's the way it should be because the
leaders are leading cause life is doing

434
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,820
his job. He's leading the
assembly's leaving things, the,

435
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,720
the breach team is doing their
stuff and I'm just like, okay, cool.

436
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,940
I'm basically an observer, you know,
now to a point. Yeah. And you're like,

437
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,550
all right,
I always the data,

438
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,030
but uh, but that's the
way you want it, you know?

439
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:09,020
And then when something does happen,
you can then handle it.

440
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,730
You can step in and go, okay, hey guys,
we need to back off over here, right?

441
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,600
This is, this is going wrong. And,
and that's the way it should be.

442
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:17,690
So if that's your goal though, is to
say, look, I want my leaders to lead.

443
00:28:17,691 --> 00:28:20,540
I don't want to be doing all their
job for them when, first of all,

444
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:23,090
that'll make them more confident.
It'll make them more capable.

445
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,110
And then when something does happen,
they, and they need your assistance.

446
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,510
You're not bogged down with something
else, you can step in and make it happen,

447
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,370
right?

448
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,370
Dick?
It's a take like Iraq or Afghanistan.

449
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:38,350
That's what combat vets coming back and
they talk about decentralized command.

450
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,610
It's important because if you're just
doing the same like army training and an

451
00:28:42,611 --> 00:28:46,540
army unit goes over there, what are
they going to do? Go, all right guys.

452
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:50,380
Now we're doing decentralized
command later, you know, you know,

453
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,650
until that happens, you know you've
got gotta now they come back, hey,

454
00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:56,770
we need to train like this. Yup. Here's
a lot of junior officers need to do.

455
00:28:56,771 --> 00:29:01,000
Here's our answer. You always need to do,
here's how are you fives or you fours,

456
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:04,880
you know, our privates, there's
what they need to do. Yep. Good.

457
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,710
All right, next up. Uh,

458
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,183
okay.

459
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:16,030
T talk about some failures in planning
leadership and how you built back up.

460
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,760
Yeah, we didn't, we had none of
that. Everything went perfect.

461
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,630
You're one of the things that
I think of winning and I,

462
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:30,330
I guess it was really a failure,
but we would

463
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:35,450
often times make a decision and then
in a day or in a week decide yeah,

464
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:38,460
that wasn't a good call.
Lean over to somebody else.

465
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,850
And I think a good example of that is how
we kind task organized and we split up

466
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:45,040
into different groups and be like,
okay, you guys are running this area,

467
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:48,070
you guys run in this area. And then
like two weeks later, actually no,

468
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:48,910
this area is not good.

469
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:50,560
We're gonna move the guys who
have joined them back together.

470
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,840
I always felt like everybody, especially
us in the leadership, you know,

471
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,310
we were all like, okay, cool.
Yeah, we just made a mistake.
We just move on. Let it,

472
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,430
not, not even a mistake, but you gotta
change. You gotta adapt. Yeah, you go,

473
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,760
you got to morph into something.
It's like if you're doing unilateral lots,

474
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,920
then it's kind of a no brainer.

475
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,550
If you go over there and all of a sudden
you know, all you working by yourself,

476
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,260
boom, boom, doing your missions, great.

477
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,490
But if you work in Split
forces in your training,

478
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:23,540
indigenous forces and you're doing
that, you have to have these, you know,

479
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:24,374
you have to,

480
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:28,070
it's not always easy to adjust for it
because it's like there's a world of

481
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:31,220
difference between Iraq and Afghanistan.
Like a world of difference.

482
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:35,840
I mean it's all kind of the same but
stuff I did in Iraq and Afghanistan,

483
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:38,870
you know, and vice versa, like,
whoa, can't do that. You know?

484
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:42,730
And even even stuff like the
weather, you know, talking don't,

485
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,430
all of a sudden it's snowing,
you know, and then the terrain,

486
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,560
like people think our axle does it.
I mean,

487
00:30:48,561 --> 00:30:50,540
there were some places where
they were like, in the jungle,

488
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:55,640
it's like we were in Nam, you know,
Cambodia crate shakes. And I'm like,

489
00:30:55,790 --> 00:31:00,140
well we wouldn't, you know,
okay, we're going to walk.
How many clicks? Yeah. Well,

490
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:05,141
when you're up do waist in mud and all
of a sudden that timeframe is totally

491
00:31:05,481 --> 00:31:08,570
off. Cause we didn't, you know,
made a mistake. I didn't really,

492
00:31:08,571 --> 00:31:10,730
really read the terrain,
you know,

493
00:31:10,731 --> 00:31:15,240
and ask about it and she has been
up there before and shit. But yeah.

494
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,570
But we just adapt and overcome.
Exactly.

495
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:20,930
I think that's a biggest learn from
your mistakes when it comes to failure.

496
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,780
It's just, okay, what do I do
now? Yeah. Good. Okay. Let's,
let's adapt and move on.

497
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,040
Yep. Alright. Um, next one.

498
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,920
I really want to hear you talk about
the battlefield and how it made you feel

499
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,320
and the type of situations
when the shit hits the fan.

500
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,903
Well,

501
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:53,190
I kind of questions pretty easy for
me how the battle field made me feel.

502
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,990
All I can say is that made me feel much
better than any other place than the

503
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,330
battlefield. You know what I mean? Yeah.

504
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:09,560
Cause everything makes sense on the
battlefield very either going forward or

505
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,540
getting going away or defending
our position or moving out. Yeah.

506
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,470
Out of that, what else is there?
Because all of them things,

507
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:21,880
even if you have men down
and people wanted, you still
gotta do them. Yeah. Well,

508
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:28,300
as I sit here and think about this,
so our optempo was very high,

509
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,870
meaning the operational type below.

510
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,380
For those of you that
don't know what that means,

511
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,400
it means like how often you're doing work
and the op tempo was very high and so,

512
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,230
but sometimes for whatever reason,

513
00:32:38,231 --> 00:32:42,920
let's say an operation would get cancelled
or pushback and all of a sudden Tony

514
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:47,840
would have been in camp for like
two days. Well, the second day,

515
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,830
like the first day he'd be, you know,
okay. He's coming up with plans,

516
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,591
looking at something else,

517
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:55,010
you know him and lay for trying to figure
something out to do. But then the SEC,

518
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,900
by the second day, he's just just starting
to get all frustrated place around.

519
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,240
Well, hey is this is just
stupid. Yeah. Oh, what's next?

520
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,140
We're going to go to like the big
base and like country music concert or

521
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:11,900
something so serious.

522
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:16,820
Like when I flew into a Canada.
Yeah. And he's guys like, Oh,

523
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:17,654
you just missed,

524
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,390
I can't remember what countries
did they go to concerts and stuff.

525
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:24,320
I'm eating rat shit stuff up in the
mountains, you know? I'm like, really?

526
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:28,460
We all of these people doing here?
Why aren't you a murderer and the bad guy?

527
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,420
God, yeah. So Tony,

528
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:36,190
you would get very frustrated after like
two days and then you just come in and

529
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:40,430
I'd say, okay dude, here, just gold
this area and go find something to do.

530
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:43,640
And then you'd go make a plan and
you'd leave for come back. All right,

531
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:45,590
we got something more. You
going to go get it. But you got,

532
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:50,390
you got to admit though, uh, you know,
time off is not such a good thing.

533
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:54,920
I mean, a couple day's break down now and
then, but you got to keep the boys busy.

534
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,350
Then they start thinking and
they start getting, you know,

535
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,900
but I mostly did it for me cause
I just wanted to get after.

536
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:09,080
Yeah, there's definitely, you can
smoke them, but uh, you're right.

537
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:12,470
If all of a sudden they're sitting around
all the time, they is, uh, what's that?

538
00:34:12,471 --> 00:34:13,250
Uh,

539
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,580
a body in motion tends to stay in motion
and a body at rest room since to stay

540
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:20,330
at rest of you start lagging and all of
a sudden you're going to go do an op and

541
00:34:20,331 --> 00:34:23,900
everyone's Kinda, there's resistance.
There's not, not, not verbal resistance,

542
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,300
just just like shrug the shoulders.

543
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:31,990
Just like a resistance of some unseen
resistance in the world that wants you to

544
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:36,820
slow down. But when the shit
hits the fan, you know, it's,

545
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:43,170
it's strange because it makes
me like a little calmer I think.

546
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,350
I mean, not always. I had the
first, first time I ever got shot,

547
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:52,610
I was a little jittery a little bit, but
you know, oh my God, what's going on?

548
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,750
Actually I knew what it was, you
know, it's not like, Ooh, what's that?

549
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,760
Actually I actually remember you were
a briefing, some of the guys when we,

550
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:05,420
when we were back and you were like,

551
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,170
um, you were like, Hey, you know what?
We didn't work on training. When, when I,

552
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:11,420
when we went through training and
we're getting ready to go to Ramadi,

553
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,040
we didn't work on, on, on this
right here. What's happening.

554
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,500
Yeah, there's this too. Oh Wow.
This is going to be cool. Yeah.

555
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:24,700
Till all that bad stuff starts.
Then there's screaming, yelling,

556
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:30,150
diving into shit, shooting and killing
them. But you know, it's Kinda,

557
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:35,030
it is fun. Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah.

558
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:38,370
I think the thing I've said on
here before is that the battlefield

559
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,930
and all these situations,

560
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:45,100
they just give you this clear focus in
life that nothing else gives you now.

561
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,240
Well, nothing that I've
found through this. Like, oh,

562
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:52,740
we're going to kill people are
going to get killed ourselves.

563
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,520
That's everything in the world.
Nothing else matters. No, that's it.

564
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,330
Just like sitting in camp,
watching TV. That doesn't matter.

565
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,380
Okay. You got your rest.
You okay? You good?

566
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,520
All right. Now let's go. Uh,

567
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,520
all right.
Next one.

568
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:19,580
Not to take away from the seriousness of
what you to have achieved in the seals,

569
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,790
but I would like Tony to tell a funny
story about Jocko and reason I put this

570
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,770
one in here. Uh, of course,

571
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:28,680
I don't like to hear any humor
or any laughter in the world,

572
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:33,090
but there was a bunch of people that,
that said this. So, uh, anyways,

573
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,020
I figured you might have a store here.
I got like,

574
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:42,600
like seriously, like a million,
like a million. I mean,

575
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:48,600
that story about you and your
roommate. Like you're, uh, you're like,

576
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,980
you guys live together in Coronado.
Yeah. You know what I'm talking about?

577
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:56,610
The big fella, you're like,
oh, it's over there, patty.

578
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:59,580
In one night we're getting gooned
up and you're like, you know,

579
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:01,930
what are our bill was from dominoes.

580
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,270
It's like $2,500 last month in a month.

581
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:10,470
But that was so funny. He had some
wicked good parties though. Yeah,

582
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:11,370
we did have some pretty good.

583
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,290
And then one time we were out at a
Niland and it's like two o'clock in the

584
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:19,920
morning and the guys are,
you know,

585
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,900
they're a retail, we call that after
you'd done do the work on the vehicles,

586
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,280
uh, post, you know, post off the vehicle,

587
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:30,990
stopping the vehicles and they're
all busy doing stuff. And, I mean,

588
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,040
I'd help out if I had to, but I
mean that's not my job. Yeah. So,

589
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,630
and they boys know what to do.

590
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,860
Jeremy had him great Lpo and uh,

591
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,240
we're sitting here,
me,

592
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,240
you and life and maybe one or the other
gos shooting the shit about something.

593
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:48,331
I mean,

594
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:52,830
it had to do at work because there's what
else is there and life was talking and

595
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:57,831
there's quiet kinda and you got your
am on one of the Humvees and all of a

596
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:01,440
sudden you're just out of no way. He
just kicked the dirt and you go, God,

597
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,940
you're like shaking your head and
clutching your fish. I'm like,

598
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:11,460
fuck you talking about. And he just like
looked at me and smiled and walked away.

599
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:14,640
Like, what? What, what is wrong with you?

600
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,330
Still haven't figured out what
was wrong with you. I know,

601
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,260
I remember he just went,
no,

602
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,040
I was actually getting frustrated that
there was a chance we might not go to

603
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:28,530
Iraq.
They didn't like,

604
00:38:28,531 --> 00:38:33,531
I was so scared and horrified of,

605
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,650
of that. It just, you know, and
I just was trying to control it,

606
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:42,120
but then it just kind of slipped out.
Oh, here's another quick one about Jacko.

607
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,540
I'm like,
I dunno,

608
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,940
we were there a couple of weeks and
Ramadi and we've just fallen into what

609
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:49,900
groove operating.

610
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:54,901
And One night I was in his office
cause like couldn't sleep or whatever.

611
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,690
And uh, he's like, look at this and
you show me, he shows me the computer.

612
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:06,490
He goes, this is from
my wife. Are you okay?

613
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,860
You've been gone three weeks
and we haven't heard anything

614
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,930
baby. I'm like, Chum, you better.

615
00:39:12,931 --> 00:39:16,740
You better email your wife or
she's going to fly over, kill you.

616
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,130
Yeah. Yeah. I uh hmm. Yeah,

617
00:39:20,131 --> 00:39:23,760
I talk about detachment a lot
and uh, sometimes, you know,

618
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,261
like I said,

619
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:28,900
sometimes you get over there and you
got all that shit going on and uh,

620
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,480
nothing else in the world matters.

621
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,980
But I didn't have anything going on
back here. Didn't matter to me at all.

622
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:40,880
Sorry. Uh, uh, to my wife
there, uh, for not she,

623
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:45,650
I'm sure she remembers that you in any
way you did though. You're like, okay,

624
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:48,470
I got it. Yeah. Uh, all right.

625
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,730
Here's one.

626
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:55,680
What made you realize one of your guys
was really good to go or was not up to

627
00:39:55,681 --> 00:39:58,050
standard?
Not necessarily big things,

628
00:39:58,051 --> 00:40:01,620
but micro actions or decisions that
set something off in your mind?

629
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,700
Well, I had a lot of guys work on
me over the years and, and I mean,

630
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:11,660
I really think that, you know,
all my brothers and the teams,

631
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,300
every one of them was good to go.
Even the guys that didn't get along with,

632
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:18,230
I'd still get my wife for him in a second,
doesn't matter.

633
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:24,550
But one thing that sticks out to me
was biggles but knows Brian job as,

634
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,660
you know, I don't, I guess I could
have been more nice or whatever,

635
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,100
but I'm like, man, you look
like you're fucking fat.

636
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,610
You better get in fucking shape where
I'm going, I'm going to fucking kill you.

637
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,460
I'm not going to like write you up.
I don't even know how to do that.

638
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,830
I'm going to, I'm going to just
physically kill you and man, you know,

639
00:40:45,831 --> 00:40:48,620
I didn't even know if he was in good
shape or not because some people you can't

640
00:40:48,621 --> 00:40:51,830
tell. Yeah. And they like look at that
guy and then he just knocks you out.

641
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:56,420
They have people that iron marshmallow.
Yeah. And man, that kid did. I mean,

642
00:40:56,421 --> 00:41:00,470
he really, really did. And like
all of a sudden I'm like, Chum,

643
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,540
I didn't say that. I was like, hmm.
I, you know, so that was like, yeah,

644
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,140
that was like my praise.
I, you know, yeah.

645
00:41:09,141 --> 00:41:13,120
Whatever you kind of praise from today on
the next one, on to the next thing now.

646
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,850
But I mean, that was
really good. You know,

647
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,780
I remember one of my guys,
uh,

648
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,490
lost a piece of equipment one time and
know all, I was kind of upset with him,

649
00:41:25,491 --> 00:41:29,580
but it just made me realize that,
you know,

650
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:34,160
if we're making a mistake, maybe it's not
this guy's fault, maybe it's my fault.

651
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,340
Maybe it's everyone's fault as, as a
team. Because at the end of the day,

652
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:41,480
it's all of us say maybe what
to take a day or two off,

653
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:47,210
you know, and that kind of help
and we handled it. But I mean,

654
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:51,800
and another one of my guys, he
uh, was Christmas when you left,

655
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,680
left a piece of equipment open
or didn't lock something or,

656
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,220
I mean it wasn't a big deal.
I could have corrected it right there,

657
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:03,020
but the guys had just taken
off on Christmas leave and
I was dead nowhere where

658
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:03,291
to go.

659
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:07,730
So I was drinking beers and the team area
and I just walked around checking shit

660
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:09,290
out and sure enough,

661
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,160
so I called the guy and he was like
three or 400 miles into his drive to a

662
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,130
western state for Christmas. And like,
he goes, oh, I'm sorry. I'm like, yeah,

663
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:23,240
no problem man. All right, so turn
around now and I'll be waiting for you.

664
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,580
Is Dead Silence on the phone
usually what? Yeah. Yeah.

665
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,500
So he drove all the way back
and I was standing there,

666
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:36,170
it's like four in the morning now.
And I was like,

667
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:41,510
I was pretty liquored up by then. And
just fuming, but, and he's like, Hey,

668
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:44,780
I'm sorry when lesson. Yup.
Okay. Have a good lead.

669
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:50,660
And I'm sure I'm positive he never did
that again. That'll do it, you know,

670
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:55,850
as kind of a dink move I guess. But you
know, I figured it was a thing to do.

671
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,660
He who suffers, remembers. Yeah.

672
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,290
Yeah. It's, it's

673
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:07,450
the, the, the, the seal teams when you're,

674
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,940
when you're just working
with guys all the time,

675
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,590
you definitely start to pick up
things. You can indicate, okay, yeah,

676
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:17,530
this guy's this guy stepping up. You
know? That's what I always noticed when,

677
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,780
when things are going sideways,

678
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,050
like in a training operation and you
see a guy that's starting to step up,

679
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,650
you know, that was always a good sign.
Absolutely. You know, like he's going to,

680
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:28,660
he's going to handle
something like sweet trained,

681
00:43:28,661 --> 00:43:31,780
decentralized command and that's where
you got to let guys make mistakes and

682
00:43:31,781 --> 00:43:33,970
screw things up because you know,
the less you know,

683
00:43:33,971 --> 00:43:36,910
the more you sweat and training,
the less you bleed in war.

684
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,080
No doubt about that one. All right. Um,

685
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,010
next one,
Tony,

686
00:43:44,011 --> 00:43:47,650
where their situations while in Iraq
when you disagreed with a leadership

687
00:43:47,651 --> 00:43:51,520
decision made by leaf or Jocko,
if so,

688
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:55,720
how did you express your disapproval
and were you successful in getting your

689
00:43:55,721 --> 00:43:56,560
point across?

690
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:02,720
Um, most of the time, 99% of the time, no,

691
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:03,920
I did not.
Uh,

692
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:08,720
there was one big one that I really
disagree with you guys on when my,

693
00:44:08,721 --> 00:44:09,440
uh,

694
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,150
my request to keep the entire troop there
for another year and said he couldn't

695
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:17,930
and I try, why not? And you're
like, we can't. And I'm like, why?

696
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,930
And I was really, really, really
angry about that. But yeah, I think,

697
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,053
I think this,

698
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,910
this question here is,
is,

699
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:31,530
is from someone that's thinking that
doesn't really understand how working,

700
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:36,450
you know, in the bottom line is, I'm not
coming down and going, all right men,

701
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,530
this is what I want you to do now. No,
we would just form our own operations.

702
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:41,011
Just all,

703
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,250
we're forming our own operations and
we're all kind of bouncing ideas off each

704
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:48,240
other. The best idea rises to the
top. I don't care who it came from.

705
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,940
I don't care if it came from me,
Tony from one of the new guys,

706
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:54,330
it doesn't matter to me where the idea
comes from or where the plan comes from.

707
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,760
I want the best idea to rise to the top.

708
00:44:56,761 --> 00:45:00,360
And that's one of the best things about
our troop was there was no one that was

709
00:45:00,361 --> 00:45:04,740
like trying to drive their own
personal point. I didn't care.

710
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,850
I literally didn't care. And I think
part of it is like you and me just said,

711
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:12,330
plan so many operations and he just, you
know, we just didn't care. It's like, oh,

712
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:15,300
that's cool. Yeah, yeah, that
sounds like a good plan. You know,

713
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:18,930
made me make this adjustment. Maybe make
that adjustment. Other than that, cool,

714
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:23,610
let's execute it. Yeah. So I think
that's a little bit different than, um,

715
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:27,630
than what people would envision as like,

716
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,890
I was law called Mander or,

717
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,760
or because we're just not
operating like that now.

718
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:37,110
This is why I've said to people very flat,
even though there's,

719
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:40,560
even though that the
military and the seal teams,

720
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,690
and there's definitely a hierarchy
or you'll structure, I mean,

721
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:46,920
that's the way it's organized. There's
a the troops and then there's, you know,

722
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,960
leading petty officers.
And then there's a platoon chief,

723
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:51,080
then there's a platoon
commander, then there's a, uh,

724
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:55,110
a troop commander or a task unit
commander and there's a, a team.

725
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,930
So there's a structure
there, customers. But the,

726
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:03,330
as far as how we actually come to plan
and stuff like that, there's, yeah,

727
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:07,650
I mean some guidance, but we're working
as a team to do that. And that's what,

728
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,020
and I would say it's not always like that.
In fact,

729
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:13,130
I know it's not always like that cause I
saw their platoons and other troops act

730
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,910
and do different ways.

731
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:18,780
But we did operations that came
from our commanding officer.

732
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:21,220
Seal team three came all the way down.
Yup.

733
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:26,040
And some of them were wicked good hop,
except they'd give the,

734
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,360
maybe the mission objective,

735
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:29,860
but they wouldn't be telling us
like go in here and all customers,

736
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:34,110
we would never, well that's not the
way it works. So I think that, uh,

737
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,140
I mean this situations,
when you disagreed with me,

738
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:40,470
it was probably in one hand you could
say never end. And the other hand,

739
00:46:40,471 --> 00:46:42,780
you could say a million times you were
like, no man, we shouldn't do that.

740
00:46:42,781 --> 00:46:45,450
And I'd be like, well, why not?
Oh, we should put the vehicles
in here. Oh, okay. Yeah.

741
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:48,780
That's a good point. Yeah.
So that's, that's how we
voiced it by saying, Oh yeah,

742
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:52,600
let's do this. So I was like,
oh, okay, cool. Yeah. That's
good. Sounds good though.

743
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:56,160
Big, big, big. Uh, what's that?

744
00:46:56,161 --> 00:47:00,630
Like a big soap opera leadership
struggle. No, not, not happening.

745
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:03,260
That never happened.
And uh,

746
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,030
so if you don't have that kind of
relationship with people, number one,

747
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:09,360
is it your own ego getting involved?
Because that's probably, that's,

748
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:12,910
that's a good indicator if you're
like, well, you know what though,

749
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,850
my subordinates just don't understand.
Oh really? Yeah. Really? Why not? Okay.

750
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:22,260
Why not suck as a leader
then just do it like good.

751
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,950
You know? Maybe, maybe if
you did better they wouldn't,

752
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:29,680
they wouldn't understand the mission.
So

753
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:35,250
pretty flat organization we had, at least
from a planning perspective. Yes sir.

754
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,290
All right.
If you had to pick

755
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,880
one driving characteristic that
separates a dominant Alpha team guy from

756
00:47:44,131 --> 00:47:46,260
everyone else,
what in the team?

757
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:51,710
What is it? Well, it's guys in
the teams, you got to know this,

758
00:47:51,711 --> 00:47:55,250
but a lot of people out there don't that
like pretty much everyone's an Alpha

759
00:47:55,251 --> 00:47:57,890
Male, you know? There you go. It's like

760
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:03,480
nobody gives up the argument ever,
you know? And usually it's, you know,

761
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,040
wrestling or fighting and he's
[inaudible] it always works itself out.

762
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:12,020
But I think, uh, one thing I we
were talking about is gimmicks.

763
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,230
Like a lot of people in the teams,
I call it a gimmick,

764
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,700
everybody's good at everything,
pretty much and does the job.

765
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,180
But some people are like just insane.

766
00:48:23,181 --> 00:48:26,270
Skydivers some guys are just
phenomenal rock climbers.

767
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:30,460
Some guys who just like
swimming, sons of guns, you know,

768
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:35,510
runners and wrestlers and
fist fighters and you know,

769
00:48:36,231 --> 00:48:38,930
some people just in the guns. I
mean that, that's their passion.

770
00:48:38,931 --> 00:48:43,580
Some people are just phenomenal
divers, you know? And I was,

771
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:48,260
I was always pretty good at
everything, but not great. You know,

772
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:51,500
I couldn't outrun everybody. I could
not fight everybody. I could not swim,

773
00:48:51,501 --> 00:48:56,180
everybody could know, shoot
everybody. And I just, I,

774
00:48:56,181 --> 00:49:01,181
I think mine was like tactics and
just being as hard as I could and it,

775
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:05,840
it, I had, I may have made it look easy,
but it was, and especially as I got older,

776
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,900
it's no fun being a team guy
when you're 44, you know,

777
00:49:09,901 --> 00:49:14,420
and you get up and be
like, all right. Yeah.

778
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:16,130
Okay.
Then I'm like,

779
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:20,470
I better retire. I'm done with
all this. But yeah, if that,

780
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:25,170
if that Kinda makes sense. Yeah. And
the other funny thing about that is, um,

781
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:26,470
because of the teams,

782
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:30,820
no team guy ever wants to give any
credit to a different team guy.

783
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,480
So if someone was like, Hey, you know
that, that guys are really good shot.

784
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:38,380
And then someone immediately by, yeah.
You don't know how to swim though. Yeah.

785
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,400
We used to talk about always just like,
someone's always really weird.

786
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:45,820
No one's good at everything.
Did you work? Did you,

787
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:50,680
and if they can't figure something out,
they'll be like, whatever. Fuck that guy.

788
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:58,100
They'll just walk away. Hey,
wait, wait. Yeah. Yeah. The, uh,

789
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,420
you know, one thing I'll say that is
pretty cool and I already brought this up.

790
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:02,650
Like one of the things that,

791
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:03,963
that

792
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:06,820
separate,
like w w when I worked,

793
00:50:06,821 --> 00:50:11,030
we've got first time I saw you like
being humble. I was like, man, that's,

794
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:14,810
that to me is the characteristic that
you can tell the guy is not just a good

795
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:17,630
team guy, but an awesome team guy when
he's humble about what's going on.

796
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,950
And when I was putting
guys through training,

797
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,860
and I know you saw this to the guys
that would come through training that

798
00:50:21,861 --> 00:50:24,350
thought they were all bad ass and
thought they couldn't do anything wrong,

799
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:27,470
they were always bad. Like they
never did a good job. Right. Right.

800
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,530
And then the guys that were
say, hey man, I'm, you know,

801
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:33,380
I'm looking forward to the training. I
know we need, we need to get tuned up and,

802
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,110
and uh, let you know, let me,
don't know what I can do better.

803
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:38,420
Those guys were there taking notes.
They always kicked ass.

804
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,720
They always do a good job.
Yeah.

805
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,630
So that being humble is a
well being humbled to is

806
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,730
I read a bunch of after action report,

807
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:54,170
you know in my tours over there about
different situations, different things.

808
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:57,140
And every time they were well
written by some guys, but it was,

809
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,720
you'll always carry this, you will always
do this. Never do this, always do that.

810
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:07,160
And I kinda took that into account when
I wrote it like a serious after action

811
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:09,020
report for that deployment.

812
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,860
I wish you would have saved it too is
it's pretty good. So first and foremost,

813
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,960
this is what worked for us in
these months, this environment,

814
00:51:17,961 --> 00:51:22,580
this temperature with this mission set
and what we had to do, don't use this as,

815
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:26,580
oh he said that. So I'm going to do it
every time. No, I mean use it as a guide.

816
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,550
Every,
everything that teams is a toolbox.

817
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,750
You pick it out when you need it and
you use it and you put it back away.

818
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:36,170
And if it sits in there 500 years,

819
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:39,560
it's still worth having because of timing.
Pull it out. You didn't really need it.

820
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,760
Yup. Yup. Next one

821
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:49,820
in the teams.
What were the biggest reputation?

822
00:51:49,821 --> 00:51:51,980
Builders or killers?

823
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:55,520
And for those of you who
don't know in the teams,

824
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:59,630
and I guess it's the same anywhere, but
it definitely is true in the teams, man,

825
00:51:59,631 --> 00:52:04,160
your reputation is, uh, is
everything. It's everything.

826
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:05,600
And people know who you are.

827
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,930
They know if you do something stupid
and they're like a really stupid,

828
00:52:08,931 --> 00:52:13,690
and the teams, as everybody knows,
everyone knows it forever. Yeah. Yeah.

829
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:16,460
Like, uh, if you have
an accidental discharge,

830
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:20,690
we meaning meaning if you shoot your
gun when you weren't supposed to,

831
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:25,610
and there may be some scenarios where
there's a little bit of leeway on that,

832
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:28,280
but if you just do it,
no dumps situation,

833
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:30,410
everybody's gonna know about it forever.
And it's just like,

834
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:32,360
you might as well just get a tattoo
on your forearm that says, Hey,

835
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:37,280
I had an AED on this date. Even
forehead, if you do something stupid,

836
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,390
you know, something that could get you
in trouble. Like just dumb. Yeah. You're,

837
00:52:42,391 --> 00:52:44,390
you're probably gonna just
everyone's going to know about it.

838
00:52:44,391 --> 00:52:46,610
They're always going to think about it.
If you get,

839
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:51,290
if you get fired from a position and
you happen to not get kicked out of the

840
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:55,680
teams, everybody's going to, everybody
knows it'll just get out. Yup.

841
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,170
Yeah. It's, it's,

842
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:01,550
it's a tough community when it comes
to reputation and so it's really,

843
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,740
it's wicked brutal. Like, yeah. You
know, every, it's like a small town.

844
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:10,940
Everybody knows everything even though
you're on other coasts. Yep. I mean,

845
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:15,530
I've done a lot of stupid shit in my
career and I was a jerk off and dumb,

846
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:19,760
dumb stuff and been an idiot and
everybody knows all that. Yeah. You know?

847
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:20,841
Yeah.
You know,

848
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:25,841
most of the stuff that you
did fortunately is kind of a,

849
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:31,320
is like on the okay side out of, I don't
know, I don't know how to explain this,

850
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:32,800
but like, oh, oh yeah, Tony,

851
00:53:32,801 --> 00:53:35,620
he got drunk and got in a
fight at this thing and you're
like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

852
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:40,080
It's almost made a big spectacle and too
big to do with the uniforms and stuff.

853
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,610
Wouldn't it have to do with like the
things that you kind of can't do or you

854
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:47,160
can't get away with her?
It'll affect your reputation in a bad way.

855
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:51,000
Wouldn't it have more to do with how
good of a team that you are and know what

856
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:53,580
you're right. You're just called
her. I know what it has to do with,

857
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,620
is it something that has that helped or
is it something that is operational or

858
00:53:58,621 --> 00:54:03,360
not? Yeah, operational.
Everybody knows like if you,

859
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:09,140
I mean even like you'll hear about a guy
that gets lost in buds in you or like

860
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:13,680
gets lost going through the initial
training when he got to the team,

861
00:54:13,681 --> 00:54:18,030
he gets on land on land navigation
and gets lost. It has to get rescued.

862
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,040
That's just going to stick
with you for ever like,

863
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,350
like I remember,
you know,

864
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,620
I remember getting like three briefs
about some guy that I was getting in a

865
00:54:28,621 --> 00:54:32,150
platoon about where this guy got
lost, how stupid it was. You know,

866
00:54:32,151 --> 00:54:34,980
there was a highway, he could have walked
the highway, you could hear the cars.

867
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,170
Everyone just made a
spectacle out of this kid.

868
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:40,110
I mean the kid got out because eventually
you go, man, I just get it out of this.

869
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:43,470
This is horrible. Everybody just
thinks I can't. And so yeah.

870
00:54:43,471 --> 00:54:48,450
So this question is actually is
actually a decent question because that

871
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,880
definitely does play a big thing.
So for me,

872
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:55,050
and it's the basis for a lot of
nicknames on the team. True, true,

873
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:00,330
true. Yeah. If you do something
that's um, excessively stupid or,

874
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:04,650
or just have bad luck, like one of
my favorite ones is Bush, you know,

875
00:55:04,651 --> 00:55:06,480
Bush Acos. Yeah. But he,

876
00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:09,440
he like was parachuting and when he first
got to the teams as a new guy and he

877
00:55:09,441 --> 00:55:12,510
and in his parachute and
he landed in, uh, in, uh,

878
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,300
what kind of Bush was just some kind
of a Bush with thorns and whatsapp.

879
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:21,090
Parachute got all tangled up and he got
stuck in there. The guys that's name,

880
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:26,340
he's great too.
He's an awesome Bush full of things.

881
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:29,490
There's team guys where you don't even
know what their real name was. Actually,

882
00:55:29,491 --> 00:55:33,360
I was kind of like that. Nobody knew what
my actual name was. Mine was just Jocko.

883
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:36,690
And that would just, that was my civilian
nickname that my parents gave me.

884
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,280
But the funniest was there was a guy,
and I'll just tell the story,

885
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,880
there was a guy and you know him cos I do,
but uh,

886
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:46,710
but anyways,

887
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:51,600
his name was Al and I was only,
yeah, I know. It was like,

888
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:55,290
you know, I knew it was Al and then
he was a heavy weapons instructor,

889
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:59,180
so we called him big owl and then we
called him big Al 50 cal and it was cow

890
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,700
bell golfing. I knew big outfit
decal for like eight years, right?

891
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:07,230
And one day I'm like, ah, you know,
we're talking and I were doing some,

892
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,050
we're going on a trip or I knew his name
because I was in a couple of platoons.

893
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,070
I do paperwork,
I finally get to Pittsburgh.

894
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,430
I finally gets a paperwork with him. This
guy was also a real quiet guy. I mean,

895
00:56:17,431 --> 00:56:19,860
real professional, real quiet.
He's off, didn't say much.

896
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,010
And one day I'm doing the
paperwork and I go, hey man,

897
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,880
I'm like looking at the list of
people that's going, I go, hey man,

898
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,760
I thought you were going on this trip with
us. And he's like, he's like, yeah, yeah,

899
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:31,060
I'm going. And I go, Oh, you're not
on the manifest here. And he goes, no.

900
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:35,080
And he comes over, he points out his name
and his name is Keith. Yeah. And I go,

901
00:56:35,081 --> 00:56:39,650
I go, I go, Bro. I go, well, your
name is Keith. I go, you want it?

902
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,660
That's a mistake. You don't want me
to get a change? And he goes, no, no,

903
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,670
that's my name. And I go, well,
I thought your name was al. I go,

904
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:50,030
is Al your middle name? And he goes,
he goes, no, Al's not my name at all.

905
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:52,870
And I go, I go, Whoa,
Whoa, what do you mean,

906
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:58,090
why does every single person call
you out? And he goes, well, he goes,

907
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:02,980
well, in my first platoon, I know I
was out doing something. It was night.

908
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,460
And I was, I would guess I was looking
around and moving my head a lot,

909
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:07,330
like an hour.

910
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:13,060
And so the guys started calling me
owl and then over the next platoon,

911
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:17,020
that changed from Al, just
Murphy into owl owl, the owl.

912
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:18,210
And then his name was out.

913
00:57:18,211 --> 00:57:20,830
And I literally would have told
you this guy's name was al.

914
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:24,520
And he never corrected. He just said,
you know, hey, whatever you call me, Al,

915
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:28,890
that's close enough.
So that BF or somebody named Amanda.

916
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,970
So that's big Al 50 cal.
Uh,

917
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:38,050
but you know what his reputation was.

918
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,250
Cause there was a
question about reputation.

919
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:41,740
His reputation was awesome
cause he was solid. He was a,

920
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:46,720
he was a former marine one
day. Uh, I was, he, no,

921
00:57:46,721 --> 00:57:51,280
that was two, nine, five. Oh okay.
Cool. Nine five was in Nicola. Uh, but,

922
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:55,590
but you know, solid reputation. So
for me, and I, I guess, I mean it's,

923
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:58,960
it's what you do operationally
is what builds your reputation.

924
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,440
And if you're a good shooter,
if you're not, you know,

925
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:07,150
shoot shooting like an idiot, I'm
not put, you know, if you can patrol,

926
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:11,630
well if you have good field craft, all
those things, they'll real things right.

927
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:13,240
It's kind of cool.
That's what's kind of cool.

928
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:15,710
That's one thing that's
in the teams that's,

929
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,760
that's hard for them to erase is what's
your real reputation as a real operator,

930
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:26,290
as an operator, team guy. That's the
thing that all these people that,

931
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:29,620
that kind of come and go in the
teams that it's, maybe it's not,

932
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:34,870
they're not real real team guys.
You can't fake that. You know?

933
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:39,100
And when guys get some guys
get shot blown up, you know,

934
00:58:39,101 --> 00:58:41,790
wounded and southern
can't operate anymore.

935
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,560
It's not like we throw them to the wolves,
they want to stay in the teams.

936
00:58:44,561 --> 00:58:49,240
We keep them and take care of them and
some become phenomenal instructors and

937
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,230
just go on and do great things. Yeah. I
had the, they were going to keep there if,

938
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,510
if Ryan job would want to stay, they
were going to keep them Acos. Yeah.

939
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:00,790
Oh you're blind. Cool. Yeah, I've
worked for great, great can lead PT.

940
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:03,040
You doesn't mean you can't listen
to me when I say go do this.

941
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:10,360
Yeah. Awesome. And then contrary to that,
obviously the killers are when you, uh,

942
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:13,880
when you screw up stuff operationally.

943
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,170
And the other thing is if you're an
arrogant, egotistical guy, you'd be,

944
00:59:17,171 --> 00:59:18,670
everyone's going to
hate you. That's, yeah.

945
00:59:18,671 --> 00:59:20,430
And you ain't gonna last
long because if you're,

946
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:24,650
cause there's some guys that are great
skill wise, they're great operators,

947
00:59:24,651 --> 00:59:28,880
but they're horrible to work with. They're
arrogant, they don't listen to anybody,

948
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:32,090
they're not humble. And those guys
will have a bad reputation too.

949
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:36,410
They got blinders on, they can't
open the, you know, and you got to,

950
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:41,060
if you want to evolve at all, they'll
stay alive, you know? Yup. Yup.

951
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:44,240
All right,
next one.

952
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:49,070
What makes a great NCO and for
those of you not in the military,

953
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,720
an Nco as a noncommissioned officer.

954
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:54,620
The military is broken
into two basic basic,

955
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,570
uh,
pathways of advancement and of existence.

956
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:03,650
There's officers who are like the managers
and the leaders and then there's the

957
01:00:03,651 --> 01:00:05,510
enlisted guys,
which are the grunts.

958
01:00:05,511 --> 01:00:07,190
But then as they get
promoted through the ranks,

959
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:11,570
you eventually become what's
called the senior enlisted advisor.

960
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:15,020
And if you don't,
if you think about Hollywood movies,

961
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:19,700
the way they always categorize these
two is you got the young junior officer

962
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:22,430
fresh and Vietnam fresh
out of the academy.

963
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:27,410
And then you got bused salty old gunnery
sergeant. That's the two. That's the two.

964
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:28,970
So the ends,
the NCO is the,

965
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,900
is the enlisted side of that and a Nco is,

966
01:00:32,901 --> 01:00:37,230
they always say is like the backbone of
the, of the Marine Corps, the NCO, the,

967
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:41,450
the chiefs run the seal teams is the, is
the statement, right? Because the chiefs,

968
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:44,450
the guys that chiefs in the guys,
that'll will be at a seal team,

969
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,880
especially in the old days,
be it a seal team for eight years.

970
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,610
So you are the continuity
and you get raised.

971
01:00:49,611 --> 01:00:54,611
So the question is what makes a great
NCO and who is or was the best Nco?

972
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:01,740
No. Well for me, what makes
a great NCO or chief is,

973
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:08,070
I don't think you can just do it.
I think it's a,

974
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,880
I'm not saying I'm a great NCO,

975
01:01:11,881 --> 01:01:16,881
but I did have great Nco who taught me a
lot and they brought me up and they put

976
01:01:17,791 --> 01:01:21,960
their foot square in my
rectum when I needed it.

977
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:27,960
And they also took their time to explain
things to me when they could see in my

978
01:01:27,961 --> 01:01:31,860
eyes. I was nodding my head yes,
but I was really, I didn't grasp it.

979
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:35,610
And they're like, I'm going to do it
this way. And they would work around my,

980
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:38,370
for lack of better word,
learning disabilities.

981
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,940
Cause I mean some of this stuff you
can't know when you're a new guy who just

982
01:01:41,941 --> 01:01:46,620
like, yo Yo yo, she borrowed the chief
and they're like, no, dummy, relax.

983
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:47,520
Here's how you're doing.

984
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:53,250
And that leadership style when a long
way with me and uh, I never forgot it.

985
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:58,800
You know,
who's the best Nco you had or ever known?

986
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:00,001
Man,

987
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:05,001
there's so many guys that it's not one
and I can't say their names because you

988
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:09,390
know, it's not cleared. I mean, but that's
a good thing about nicknames sometimes.

989
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:10,710
You know, I think, uh,

990
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:17,060
I'll have to say overall a mister fac
was probably the best one I ever had and

991
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:24,420
he was just an old school,
hot ass son of a bitch.

992
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,910
But he was fair as all hell.

993
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:32,610
He was fair and you always knew where
you stood with them. And I love that.

994
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,340
That's what I tried to do later on.
Like,

995
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:38,190
I didn't want to go hide,
hide,

996
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:42,620
hide and then totally taken
other direction and just
be like easy on the guy.

997
01:02:42,621 --> 01:02:44,730
So they like me,
you know I don't care.

998
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,490
And I thought that was much
easier in a better way,

999
01:02:47,491 --> 01:02:51,630
cause mission men as how
he should look at things.

1000
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,840
Put the mission first and
take care of your man.

1001
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:59,660
But sometimes if you have to sacrifice
men and you've got to like, okay,

1002
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:02,580
you got to die for this mission.
All right Roger, that you don't get.

1003
01:03:02,581 --> 01:03:05,970
I mean that's the way the military is.
That's what you get paid for. But yeah,

1004
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,500
Mr Fac was probably the best one for me.
Yeah.

1005
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:11,580
So that's another,

1006
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
when I talked about you and me coming
up in the teams and hanging out with the

1007
01:03:17,401 --> 01:03:18,510
same people and being the same,

1008
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:23,540
but we were going to plan together but
we did have the same guys that raised us.

1009
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:29,300
The same guys raised us both
and for sure Mr fat as you,

1010
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:34,110
you are calling him a was
a huge influence on me.

1011
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,330
I'm eating a huge influence on me.

1012
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:43,560
Everything I was or am it everything I
was in the teams like as far as being

1013
01:03:43,561 --> 01:03:45,270
professional and like,
hey, we're going to look.

1014
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:48,960
That all was taken from Fac I
hell of it was taken from him.

1015
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:53,961
I'm 100% neutral and the seriousness
that he put towards the job,

1016
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:55,861
like the,
the,

1017
01:03:55,861 --> 01:04:00,861
the gravity that he put towards the
job and the gravity to put towards the

1018
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:04,620
operational stuff that we just
talked about as far as, you know,

1019
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,990
the things that we said
makes up your reputation.

1020
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:11,640
That's what he cared about above anything
else. That's what he cared about.

1021
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,750
And so for sure working for
him and that's, that's again,

1022
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,600
that's why when we actually
started working together,

1023
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:20,970
and I'm just realizing this right now,
I mean I guess I made sense of it before,

1024
01:04:20,971 --> 01:04:22,920
but when we started working together,

1025
01:04:22,921 --> 01:04:25,950
that's why we had the same thoughts
and things. Everything was like,

1026
01:04:25,951 --> 01:04:29,010
of course we're going to do that. It's
like when we're bounding back one time,

1027
01:04:29,011 --> 01:04:32,430
somewhere in Iraq and just, we didn't
even have to say anything to each other.

1028
01:04:32,431 --> 01:04:36,240
We're just like cover
and move. Go, go, go.

1029
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:40,560
But one thing real quick, but
NCO, one of the best I ever had.

1030
01:04:40,561 --> 01:04:44,400
Another see daddy of mine and I can
say his name cause rest in peace.

1031
01:04:44,401 --> 01:04:49,020
Tim Farrell. Tim Farrell was a big,
big influence on my life. I mean,

1032
01:04:49,021 --> 01:04:52,500
he was who he was a wicked good operator.
I can't,

1033
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:54,760
I don't know anybody as a
tougher guy in the teams.

1034
01:04:55,370 --> 01:05:00,150
He's just a hard hitting guy and just,
he's a really good dude,

1035
01:05:00,151 --> 01:05:05,100
man. Really good guy. And he was awesome
at every, everything, everything. Yep.

1036
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:09,390
Yeah. Good. He was an
awesome at everything he did.

1037
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,450
He'd beat you at everything.

1038
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:15,900
He would beat guys in the swims and he
wasn't wearing fins and they were just

1039
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:20,470
incredible athlete. Yeah. Incredible
athletes in by the way use. He would,

1040
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,420
it's not like a guy that
was like, well, you know,

1041
01:05:22,421 --> 01:05:24,670
I didn't get my workout in
today's, no, no, no, no, no.

1042
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,490
He didn't care about anything
son of a gun. He was like, oh,

1043
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:33,100
just just get after it
yet. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1044
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:37,480
Tim Farrell for sure. It was a
great guy. What a frog man. He was.

1045
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:41,440
He certainly was.
All right.

1046
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:48,740
Anything about accuracy of fire
in combat versus volume of fire.

1047
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:52,680
And I'll tell you the reason I left
this one in here, Tony is a lot,

1048
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:56,790
lotta lot of soldiers and Marines and
team guys that I hear from all the time

1049
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:58,830
and they always are listening.

1050
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:03,150
And not only that at this point,
and I hate to say it,

1051
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:08,610
but in America are our police forces
need to start thinking about this kind of

1052
01:06:08,611 --> 01:06:11,630
stuff because there's bad stuff happen
in America where guys are getting in

1053
01:06:11,631 --> 01:06:14,040
legit. Yeah. Urban Warfare.

1054
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,930
And so talking about the accuracy
of fire versus the volume of fire.

1055
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:24,330
Well you know it's a double is a flip of
the coin on. Depends on the situation.

1056
01:06:24,331 --> 01:06:29,331
But I can tell you the number of times I
fired a rifle and assault rifle like an

1057
01:06:29,701 --> 01:06:33,200
m four m 14 and all that,
you know,

1058
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:38,070
sky on full auto is
big frigging goose egg.

1059
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:43,260
You know, I, I can't think of one
situation or if somebody said, okay Tony,

1060
01:06:43,261 --> 01:06:45,900
you're going in this room alone and
there's eight guys pointing guns at you.

1061
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:50,880
Well, okay, barrage that. But you
know, but sometimes, you know,

1062
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:53,820
volume of fire to get heads down,
if you're in the street,

1063
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:57,690
you got to get that fire. You got
to try to gain flyers, superiority.

1064
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:01,050
And if you don't have that, you
ain't really moving. And uh,

1065
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:02,700
so at that point you're now,

1066
01:07:02,701 --> 01:07:05,940
you're not doing all the things
you were taught breathing,

1067
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:10,290
you're just getting led down
in that direction. It's a
cover your ass, your ass.

1068
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,680
Well your buddy's ass so you
can move and they can move.

1069
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:15,653
MMM.

1070
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,570
But accuracy, firing, combat,
you know, in good situations,

1071
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:24,320
if you're under fire and you're putting
lead down range so you can move,

1072
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,370
it's real nice to have a supporting
element in an elevated position.

1073
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,560
They're the ones combining these two.

1074
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:36,320
And just as a pretty good example is
pretty nice knowing about four blocks from

1075
01:07:36,321 --> 01:07:41,230
you. You got Chris Kyle up there
talking to you on the radio. Hold on,

1076
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:46,070
let me see a guy fall. I like the
window with a gun. You're like,

1077
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:47,910
thanks brother.
Yeah,

1078
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:51,620
you're pretty confident walking down
the street and at that point, so

1079
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:55,270
yeah. Yeah. The, uh,

1080
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:00,470
the other thing is, I mean we
always have massive, you know,

1081
01:08:00,471 --> 01:08:04,800
fire power with mark 48, some are 46 is
to lay down the heavy volumes of fire.

1082
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:06,620
And that's the same thing.
Uh,

1083
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:11,820
Roger Hayden was saying in here the
other day who's another that mentored you

1084
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:14,940
and me growing up in the teams and uh,

1085
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:19,580
but he said that they
had for sixties in there,

1086
01:08:19,581 --> 01:08:22,190
14 man puts in like two stoners,

1087
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:26,360
three no for sixties and five stoners.

1088
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:32,330
That's, that's what he said. That was what
they carried. And uh, yeah, so, so eight,

1089
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,420
you know,
what's interesting to the point,

1090
01:08:35,421 --> 01:08:37,940
like we talked about
points or any but the guys,

1091
01:08:37,941 --> 01:08:42,890
like all of our guys are aaw owners put
sites, put the [inaudible] on there,

1092
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:46,250
on there. Oh yeah, yeah.
Which was partially for Pid,

1093
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:48,860
so they could tell who they're
shooting at, could see further,

1094
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:52,670
but also man accuracy. Yeah. It's
a four power scope. Yep. You know,

1095
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:55,580
and then at night it don't matter cause
you're using an app peel or a laser and

1096
01:08:55,581 --> 01:08:58,910
you're on nods. Anyway, so, so,

1097
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:01,610
and then one last thing is that you,
you know,

1098
01:09:01,611 --> 01:09:05,150
again now where you're talking
to a aimed at police officers,

1099
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:09,860
but also also guys in combat,
you don't have unlimited ammunition.

1100
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:13,200
So you gotta think about that to me.

1101
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:17,480
Me and my brother just had his
conversation and uh, you know,

1102
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:23,180
he was like, wow, I wish I
could, you know, concealed
weapon and carry, you know,

1103
01:09:23,181 --> 01:09:24,014
he's got,

1104
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:29,020
I got my revolver and he's got
like a six 86 stainless p or plus,

1105
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:32,370
you know, seven shot three
of 37. I wonder where he,

1106
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,540
he wanted the revolver. I told him what
to get. Yeah, that's it. That's the thing.

1107
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:39,770
He loves it, but he's like, you know,
Shit like when I'm concealed carry,

1108
01:09:39,771 --> 01:09:42,920
should I carry some speed
loaders? I'm like, well, chum,

1109
01:09:42,921 --> 01:09:46,370
is that always convenient
now? Well, you know what,

1110
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,730
you're not getting in a gun fight.
You're not,

1111
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,370
if you're getting somebody shooting,

1112
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:57,020
you either shoot him or do you put down
fire and you run. It's not your fight.

1113
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:00,170
If some of the Jack and your
Chi or whatever, and they
pull a gun, you shoot him.

1114
01:10:00,171 --> 01:10:04,700
Yes, but you know, it's a
nightclub shooting or something.

1115
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:08,630
You're blasting your way
out of there and that's it.

1116
01:10:08,631 --> 01:10:11,710
You're not going to sit there and you
don't have an unlimited ammo. Right.

1117
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:14,420
And even the teams we didn't,
that wasn't my biggest fear.

1118
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:19,640
I would hate to die of lack of shooting
back and then we'll just suck, you know.

1119
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:22,160
And we never really did run out.
We've got low,

1120
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:26,630
we've got low a few times but
never really run out. It's scary.

1121
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,080
That's why we kind of
train on, uh, you know,

1122
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:33,660
we did a lot of that where try to
set a standard, you can't, you know,

1123
01:10:33,661 --> 01:10:37,130
if you've got to shoot, you shoot. If
you run out then you go to your pistol.

1124
01:10:37,131 --> 01:10:39,610
If you run out of that and you go to
your grenades or whatever and then you'd

1125
01:10:39,611 --> 01:10:44,120
just BTF. But uh, but
we trained, you know,

1126
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:48,680
if you're in sustained fire
flights, like m gun is, you know,

1127
01:10:48,681 --> 01:10:50,870
after four mags,
you going to start slowing it down,

1128
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:52,970
start thinking about round
congress conservation.

1129
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:55,310
Same thing with the machine gunners.
Start slowing your rates,

1130
01:10:55,311 --> 01:10:59,750
fire down initial burst, initial volleys.
And then go down to like, you know,

1131
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,100
shorter bursts,

1132
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,910
more time looking at what you've seen
because if you're out there hanging with

1133
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:08,090
you guys, hanging, you know, and
you've got no rounds, then guess what?

1134
01:11:08,091 --> 01:11:11,840
It's run time and nobody wants to run.
That's just,

1135
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:13,540
just [inaudible].

1136
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,840
Awesome. All right, uh, next one.

1137
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,280
What is Tony's perspective as an enlisted,

1138
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:31,580
an older guy serving quotes
under you as a younger officer?

1139
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:36,150
So I don't know if this person actually
understands that we're about the same

1140
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:39,990
age and had been in the teams about
the same all the time. And um,

1141
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:45,020
we were more brothers than like
anything else. And then, uh,

1142
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:46,853
what was it like,

1143
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:51,870
what were you like to work for compared
to other guys that you were under? Well,

1144
01:11:51,871 --> 01:11:55,650
that first pat at first path is pretty
easy cause I remember you in life with

1145
01:11:55,651 --> 01:12:00,540
talking like we didn't know who this
y'all co guy was and I kind of was walking

1146
01:12:00,541 --> 01:12:01,374
by the office.

1147
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:06,390
It's like a movie where I stopped like
halfway through a step and I backed up

1148
01:12:06,391 --> 01:12:10,950
and I went, what did you guys say? Yeah,
this new Wa Gosh, screen commander,

1149
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:15,810
we don't know who he is, what's his
name if like Ah, Willink, Jocko, Jocko,

1150
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:19,080
Jocko or something like that.
I'm like, yeah, we're all set.

1151
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:21,190
And then they're all like,
you know,

1152
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:26,010
cause they're the two lieutenants Seth
in life and you're like following me into

1153
01:12:26,011 --> 01:12:30,100
the head and like, relax.
What about about this car?

1154
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:34,890
Let us like, we're good to go. I might,
we share, we're getting him. They're like,

1155
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:39,690
oh yeah, it's done. He's just
comment and you'd be like,
tomorrow. I'm like, Yup, Yup.

1156
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:43,680
All right, let me just tell you
something. Be squared away tomorrow.

1157
01:12:43,681 --> 01:12:47,560
And I started walking away, you know this
guy. And I was like, you know, is he,

1158
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,440
is he good to go? And I
just looked at, I went,

1159
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:55,110
I gave him that look like pulleys.
I know what I'm talking about.

1160
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,190
The squared away and you
better be on your game. Me,

1161
01:12:59,191 --> 01:13:03,690
I'm going to be hung over tomorrow
whenever I've known him forever. But that,

1162
01:13:03,691 --> 01:13:08,160
and uh, what were you like to
work for? What you were like,

1163
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:12,750
ah, this not even a question. It was
great. It was the best hour. I mean just,

1164
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:15,360
I don't know.
We think we think the same.

1165
01:13:15,361 --> 01:13:19,860
We were likeminded and uh,
we like,

1166
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:24,360
we like to work, we really, really love
their jobs and our men and our people,

1167
01:13:24,361 --> 01:13:28,440
you know, and I hate saying I love
my man, that sounds kind of whatever,

1168
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,660
but I, you know, I did,

1169
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:33,840
I really cared about the guys and that
was the best part of being a team guy.

1170
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:38,320
And I'm sure Jocko will back me up on
that. Absolutely. As your brothers. Yeah,

1171
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:42,240
there are no doubt about that.
No doubt about that at all.

1172
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,620
Um, all right, next one,

1173
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,520
please expound on the early days when
you and Tony were new guys in the tea.

1174
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:59,340
This is like a whole
nother podcast. Uh, okay,

1175
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:05,730
go ahead. Well, uh, I don't know,

1176
01:14:05,731 --> 01:14:10,010
it was kind of a different time
when we were in new guys. Like wait,

1177
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:11,980
my first platoon, we were involved, you

1178
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,780
know, like the first Gulf War and
I thought it was great, you know,

1179
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:19,820
we really didn't do much. My
petunias and, and you know,

1180
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,820
some of them guys over
there for six months.

1181
01:14:21,821 --> 01:14:26,350
Then the war started and it was like a
month or whatever and then it was done.

1182
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:31,030
Right. You know. But other
than that we, I think

1183
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,970
in the later stages in my career,
we didn't train as hard.

1184
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:38,620
But the deployment,

1185
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:43,650
I mean we still trained hide but the
deployments where a hider like more work

1186
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:46,103
and

1187
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:52,660
back then if you did a deployment
where it was like a training deployment

1188
01:14:52,661 --> 01:14:55,600
because there was no war going on, we
still had to deploy. If you don't realize,

1189
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:59,360
if there's no wars team guys are
still deploying to same optempo Yup.

1190
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:03,400
And cause we need constantly be around
the world in case something happens.

1191
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:04,983
And uh,

1192
01:15:07,290 --> 01:15:10,350
but we did a lot of like hard core shit.

1193
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,840
Like we did a lot more
reconnaissance work,

1194
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,660
which meant we didn't have vehicles.

1195
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:21,020
So we had lpcs which are leather personnel
carriers and boots and we'd hump in

1196
01:15:21,721 --> 01:15:26,721
like 25 clicks or whatever and we'd do
these ridiculous swims and he's long

1197
01:15:27,931 --> 01:15:32,130
dives and do all, I mean really like
long, like the hotter the better.

1198
01:15:32,131 --> 01:15:35,640
I mean you look at a team to,
to put it in perspective,

1199
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:41,100
you look at a team guy back then a lot
of them were a lot leaner, you know,

1200
01:15:41,101 --> 01:15:43,050
and they, we did a lot
more running. Swimming.

1201
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:48,170
You look at like a team area now you
go to the gym and it looks like ww MMA

1202
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:51,360
wrestlers, you know, I mean
they do. Everybody's like,

1203
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:55,200
like stronger and not cause
you got to carry more shit.

1204
01:15:55,201 --> 01:15:57,210
We do do a lot more direct action stuff.

1205
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:03,410
But also we did a lot of drinking and
partying and the file in San Diego.

1206
01:16:03,811 --> 01:16:07,950
We did, I know that. And
uh, we hung a lot together.

1207
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:12,870
Nobody was married, you know, I don't,
we had like 16 guys in my platoon.

1208
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,550
One was married and he was the
Lto. Yeah. Like no one was mad.

1209
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:20,580
We all hung out together all the time
and we all like lived in imperial beach.

1210
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:26,090
They're like Chulavista now people live
like 40 miles away and like everyone's

1211
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:29,400
married and owns a house. Nobody owned
the house. We didn't have any money.

1212
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:32,160
His boxes. Yeah, we, yeah,

1213
01:16:32,161 --> 01:16:36,570
we had a house like five guys in an
apartment was like one, one couch.

1214
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:38,700
It was just the disaster.

1215
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:40,403
Yeah. The, the,

1216
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:43,740
the guy that you were talking about
earlier that I lived in the corn auto with

1217
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:48,920
and uh, for quite some time we
had, we, in our house we had,

1218
01:16:48,921 --> 01:16:53,550
we only had one fork, so it'd
be like, it'd be like, hey man,

1219
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,840
are you almost done with the fork?

1220
01:16:55,590 --> 01:17:00,590
Cause I don't want to be out that
couldn't go to Vons and buy another four.

1221
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:04,770
[inaudible] you two gorillas.
That was,

1222
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,990
that was 27 when I,

1223
01:17:06,991 --> 01:17:10,400
when I remember one of the big things
I remember about checking team one was,

1224
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:15,080
was just not even looking people
in the eyes because he was this,

1225
01:17:15,081 --> 01:17:19,730
this reputation and in of just, you're
just going to get beat down. Yeah.

1226
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:22,730
Well you got hazed a lot. Yeah.
We got beat up. We got hazed.

1227
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:25,820
And you didn't,
you know,

1228
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:29,790
you didn't come in there thinking that
the world owed you anything at all. Yeah.

1229
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:34,760
No. The only thing they owed you was
an ass beating. And you know, uh,

1230
01:17:34,761 --> 01:17:36,890
we had some big monster
guys at the team too.

1231
01:17:36,891 --> 01:17:39,800
I remember I checked in and there
was this one guy who, you know,

1232
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:42,110
probably the biggest guy at team one.

1233
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:46,960
I'm not going to say his name again just
cause I don't want to Jay. Yeah, Jay. Um,

1234
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:48,750
I'm checking it, you know, I'm, I'm,

1235
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:52,190
I'm at the team and I'm doing over there
doing some pushups or something and I

1236
01:17:52,191 --> 01:17:56,480
see this guy come out of the gym. He's
literally, how tall is he? Six, six,

1237
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:59,780
six,
six 300 pounds.

1238
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:04,910
Monstrance he's completely covered
in tattoos and he's walking,

1239
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:09,350
it's about a 40 meter walk from the
back of the team, one building to the,

1240
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:13,700
to the area where we keep the outboard
motors and stuff. And he's walking,

1241
01:18:13,701 --> 01:18:15,140
he's lumbering,
right?

1242
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:20,150
He's a lumbering along and about 20 meters
into this hike he stops and he's got

1243
01:18:20,151 --> 01:18:25,060
a gallon of milk in his hand and
he just stops, like stops it,

1244
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:30,100
uncorked the milk and just sits there
and drinks after gallon of milk,

1245
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:33,040
slowly puts it back down
and puts the lid back on.

1246
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:36,380
And this lumber's the rest of the
way over. I'm like, good Lord,

1247
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:40,490
I hope that guy doesn't eat me.
I was like, kill me and eat me.

1248
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:45,050
And so that was, that was definitely the
team. One thing when I got the team one,

1249
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:50,051
I w everyone was just big bunch of tough
mean bass and they were getting ready

1250
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:55,390
to kick your ass at any time
on daily base. Yeah. And, and,

1251
01:18:55,500 --> 01:19:00,350
and I, I, you know, I think, you
know, nowadays there a war going on,

1252
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:01,130
you know?
Right.

1253
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:05,060
And so the guys have a different kind
of test ahead of them and that's cool.

1254
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:09,080
You know, that's different kind of tests
and it's a harder test and it's, it is,

1255
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:11,300
that's, that's what we, that's
what guys joined the teams for.

1256
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:15,410
So the young team guys that are coming
in freaking bad ass. Awesome. Absolutely.

1257
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:16,640
And I tell you what man,

1258
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:21,440
people say whatever about what they want
to say about the way millennials are

1259
01:19:21,441 --> 01:19:24,170
and all this stuff, man. I've been to
some hanging out with some team guys,

1260
01:19:24,171 --> 01:19:27,460
especially after some memorials and stuff.
These young frogman,

1261
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,390
they're bad ass,

1262
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:34,660
bad ass guys that are ready to die
or kill without question and uh,

1263
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:40,660
so respect and I'm so glad
to see where the team,

1264
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,910
the team's maintains that always.
Absolutely.

1265
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:46,790
All right.

1266
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,310
If Tony had to write
for the history books,

1267
01:19:52,311 --> 01:19:56,270
three top stories of shiny
example of BTF getting after it,

1268
01:19:56,630 --> 01:20:00,800
what would they be? Just
give me one. Give me one.

1269
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:07,320
Oh my God. Everything. There's so
many good. So many good ones. Um,

1270
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:13,500
it's hard to say just one
guy, you know, but, uh,

1271
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:20,820
I dunno.

1272
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:25,820
I'm one time when me and a dobber did
that like thousand yards center appeal.

1273
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:33,840
That was pretty hard to contain that it
didn't bother me. That was hard, man.

1274
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:37,980
I mean that was, that was
pretty hot. Like, I mean,

1275
01:20:37,981 --> 01:20:42,060
this is a tactic with two guys. There's
two of us bringing up the rear of this,

1276
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,390
this extraction, you know, actually yeah.

1277
01:20:45,391 --> 01:20:49,080
It wasn't extraction cause it was by foot.
Otherwise it had been an exfiltration,

1278
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:51,570
but we kind of took up the rear.

1279
01:20:51,571 --> 01:20:56,070
We started like covering moving and
them guys were just on a dead run.

1280
01:20:56,310 --> 01:21:00,330
But we had to stop, go, stop, go
for about like a mile or whatever.

1281
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:03,300
It was just terrible.
I mean,

1282
01:21:03,301 --> 01:21:07,260
I was sweating like a teamster man.
I mean I was just,

1283
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:12,830
and cause it was like eight o'clock in
the morning and it's like 110 degrees

1284
01:21:14,071 --> 01:21:17,070
out. That was, that was pretty
good. I was a pretty good one.

1285
01:21:17,071 --> 01:21:19,290
But I remember getting back
to the old days with that.

1286
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:23,730
We didn't say BTF back then,
but we used to do some horrendous humps,

1287
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:27,120
you know, humping to the civilian
world means like marching,

1288
01:21:27,121 --> 01:21:31,140
not marching but patrolling. And it'd
be like, Ooh, do you look at the map?

1289
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,820
And we don't, we, we didn't patrol in
the day. So it'd be like, all right,

1290
01:21:35,821 --> 01:21:38,430
it gets dark at like 19 hundy.

1291
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:42,540
I'm gonna move out about 1930 and it gets,

1292
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:47,160
I'm going to stop at about zero five
and we got to cover, I don't know,

1293
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:52,560
40 clicks. All right, let's go. And your
hundred pound rucksack, you're like,

1294
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:55,800
really? Okay, let's go. And you think, oh,

1295
01:21:55,801 --> 01:21:58,980
I couldn't have been a
plumber or something. I don't
know. I'd be a team guy.

1296
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:04,200
I couldn't have been like wanting to
call it. No, no, no. Yeah. You know,

1297
01:22:04,201 --> 01:22:06,810
and you were, you were kind of
talking about this earlier, but, uh,

1298
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:12,170
I remember times where you guys be out
in the field for two or three days and

1299
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:15,230
meanwhile while you're in the field,
we're spinning up another opera,

1300
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:18,360
not another target for
a direct action mission.

1301
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:22,890
And you guys get back and he'd be like,
Hey man, we've got to target for you.

1302
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:26,490
You're rolling out in two hours.
So you know,

1303
01:22:26,491 --> 01:22:28,020
you just go to your guys and be like,
all right guys,

1304
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:29,970
change your gear or had an outcome.

1305
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:33,600
You want to load vehicles in an hour and
30 minutes and you see guys just turn

1306
01:22:33,601 --> 01:22:38,220
and burn. Yup. Got Nobody
said, Oh really? No,

1307
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:41,280
just do it. You know? And Yeah, my whole,

1308
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:44,100
that platoon that I
had on that deployment,

1309
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:48,780
I mean I'm guys BTF I mean
especially like the sisters' kids,

1310
01:22:48,781 --> 01:22:51,660
those guys were, you
know, we had the new guys,

1311
01:22:51,661 --> 01:22:55,770
we had the older guys and then we hit
the middle guys, you know, and you know,

1312
01:22:56,420 --> 01:23:01,420
you know spazz and a squirrel
and Chucky those guys racks,

1313
01:23:03,811 --> 01:23:07,420
those guys are bad ass. I
mean they just, they didn't,

1314
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:12,160
they were the meat kind of of the platoon
and there were the ones that like had

1315
01:23:12,161 --> 01:23:14,320
to do like most of the work,
you know,

1316
01:23:14,321 --> 01:23:18,700
the new guys helped them and the other
older guys were more of leadership

1317
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:20,890
positions. Yeah. And they still work too.

1318
01:23:20,891 --> 01:23:24,220
But these guys worked and they just
said you got Roger to that and just got

1319
01:23:24,221 --> 01:23:24,700
after it.

1320
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:29,560
Good dudes after day
guarantee after day after day.

1321
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:33,850
I guarantee all of them guys and I
couldn't keep up with everyone after I

1322
01:23:33,851 --> 01:23:34,331
retired.

1323
01:23:34,331 --> 01:23:38,890
I guarantee all of them guys are doing
well in their careers because they're

1324
01:23:38,891 --> 01:23:43,330
fantastic. I, I do see them
and they are all kicking ass.

1325
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:45,010
Roger that and that's good for sir.

1326
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:47,103
Okay.

1327
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,220
How does Tony decide what strategies,

1328
01:23:51,221 --> 01:23:56,140
tactics to use on a mission against an
enemy? Curious about your thought process.

1329
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,930
Hmm.
Well,

1330
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:08,220
first of all, you gotta figure
out which one we're talking about.

1331
01:24:08,221 --> 01:24:13,221
My experience in the savages
that Lee Slade and killed shot.

1332
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:17,513
Ah,

1333
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:24,060
first of all, it's better to shoot someone
in the back. So you know, Olin, you know,

1334
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:28,180
an ambush where you can catch him
walking away from you is always the best.

1335
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:32,420
But front you just BTF and figured out.
Uh,

1336
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:36,070
we were talking about sung sue there.
You know the auto ward?

1337
01:24:37,470 --> 01:24:38,303
No,

1338
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:43,050
I thought, you know, he says if you know
yourself when your enemy, you don't, not,

1339
01:24:43,051 --> 01:24:46,070
not, no need to fear thousand
battles, whatever. Well,

1340
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:50,660
I know myself pretty damn good and I know
my group pretty damn good and I didn't

1341
01:24:50,661 --> 01:24:53,450
have time to read all that.
Stop and figure it out.

1342
01:24:53,451 --> 01:24:56,480
So I figured I'd just hate the enemy.
I'll just hate him.

1343
01:24:56,481 --> 01:25:01,481
And that hate will fuel my passion
to make the operation as best I can

1344
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:06,130
and work at the best I can and
learn from the mistakes that,

1345
01:25:06,131 --> 01:25:10,310
and that didn't work out. But
that's that kind of, when you,

1346
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:11,240
when you got that,

1347
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:15,890
it kind of pyramids down and everything
kind of works itself out, you know,

1348
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:20,060
and you can't be afraid to try
something different because,

1349
01:25:20,061 --> 01:25:23,690
and you can't be afraid to bounce it off
people. That's what's great about Jocko.

1350
01:25:23,691 --> 01:25:27,020
I would bounce something off of them, you
know, and he'd be like, Yep, that's good.

1351
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:30,980
All right, go now. Now wait a minute.
Cause he wouldn't let it go. You know,

1352
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:36,320
Kinda walk me through this
again, Roger, we're going to
do that, that, that, and uh,

1353
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,630
I would also really,

1354
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:43,100
when I let other people run operations
or I would work with other groups,

1355
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:49,070
I would, I would just kind of wait for
when they glanced over something and I go,

1356
01:25:49,071 --> 01:25:53,000
Whoa, wait a minute. Okay, go. Now what
are we going to do here? Well, you know,

1357
01:25:53,001 --> 01:25:56,060
we're just going to do this. I don't
know. I don't know what that means.

1358
01:25:56,061 --> 01:25:59,510
Please explain it to me. Well, and
they hadn't really thought about it.

1359
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:02,990
And that's the little glitch in the
mission plan that's gonna get you killed.

1360
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,100
[inaudible] but

1361
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:08,660
you can't, you know, you can't take a
lot of time to plan an ops sometimes.

1362
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:13,660
Sometimes it's like, all right, you know
what an assault here we're going to go,

1363
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:17,750
where are you going strong like cowboys
or we're going to go on the prowl,

1364
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:21,650
we're going to go into
surreptitious entry, be real
stealthy. Sometimes you can't,

1365
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:26,210
sometimes it calls for a straight
up punch him up, you know,

1366
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,330
just mix it up and BTF you know,

1367
01:26:29,331 --> 01:26:31,550
and that's easy to do cause you
don't get to plan much. Okay,

1368
01:26:31,551 --> 01:26:35,030
let's just go over there
and kill everybody. Show us
where they'd go. Yup. Yup.

1369
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:38,680
So I don't know if that answers
that question, but yeah,

1370
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,110
I think from my perspective,
I mean in a,

1371
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:45,080
you just kind of made it sound like big,
no big deal.

1372
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:49,880
But Tony was always pouring over
the imagery, looking at the maps,

1373
01:26:49,881 --> 01:26:52,370
trying to figure out which angle,
trying to figure out what the best spot,

1374
01:26:52,371 --> 01:26:54,110
trying to ask what he's
doing all the time.

1375
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:58,820
Just trying to analyze as much as
he could and make the best plan.

1376
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,800
And, and I think also Mandy,
the experience level, you know,

1377
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:08,330
cause like I said,
right? Even even pre war,

1378
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:13,450
pre nine 11 how many freaking ops did you
and I do training ops where we did all

1379
01:27:14,451 --> 01:27:17,540
this stuff to a thousand. Yeah.
It's just like over and over.

1380
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:19,640
And so by the time you get there,
it's really,

1381
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:24,720
even though these weren't combat
operations, you get a view.

1382
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,130
We learned a lot from them and there was
a little justments we had to make for

1383
01:27:28,131 --> 01:27:31,460
sure. But for the most part,
which you've learned how to do,

1384
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:35,240
what you learned how to do was you learn
how to take a group of guys and get

1385
01:27:35,241 --> 01:27:39,170
them to do something right. And
when you learn how to do that, okay,

1386
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:42,140
that that's then you okay,
you want us to do this? Cool.

1387
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:43,910
I'd have to take a group of guys
and get them to do something.

1388
01:27:43,911 --> 01:27:45,470
It doesn't matter what that thing is,

1389
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:50,580
I can get a group of guys to do something
and that's what's beneficial. Nope.

1390
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:53,720
That's what all that years of
experience helps you out with.

1391
01:27:53,721 --> 01:27:56,720
It doesn't necessarily help you.
I mean, it didn't help us with,

1392
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:01,100
with doing the specific mission that,
no, no cussing that cause you can't,

1393
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:03,080
can't cover everything.
No.

1394
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:08,140
I mean at that point I had three years
as an instructor and land warfare and it

1395
01:28:09,591 --> 01:28:13,410
was my eight ninth deployment,
the line I'd been, you know,

1396
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:18,380
eight platoons or whatever and
there's not much more. I was gonna,

1397
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:23,300
you know, learn from another six months
of training. I mean, it's pretty much,

1398
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:27,650
I mean, there's no real thing I was
going, wow, I've never done this before.

1399
01:28:27,651 --> 01:28:31,490
You know, like, yeah.
Okay. Yeah. All right.

1400
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:34,460
What was the most difficult
thing you ever did as a seal?

1401
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:37,460
When was the most fearful
moment in your life?

1402
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:44,180
Well, I get asked this a lot and
uh, tell you the truth is good.

1403
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:49,160
Nothing to do with, you know, the bombs
in the wars and the killing and stuff.

1404
01:28:49,161 --> 01:28:50,960
It's like I never,

1405
01:28:50,961 --> 01:28:55,640
ever batted an eye skydiving
or static climbing,

1406
01:28:55,641 --> 01:29:00,170
jumping into the water, jumping at
night, never bothered me one bit. No,

1407
01:29:00,230 --> 01:29:02,220
not at all.
Never even was scared

1408
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:05,850
at all. But I don't like getting
on the roof. You know what I mean?

1409
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:09,840
Like I hate being a 40 foot
ladder in a man lift. You know,

1410
01:29:09,841 --> 01:29:13,470
I worked for a landscaping
companies sometimes repping
the man lifts. Like, man,

1411
01:29:13,471 --> 01:29:15,900
this is kind of sucks and I'll admit it,

1412
01:29:15,901 --> 01:29:18,000
I'm a little bit afraid
of heights at that level.

1413
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:23,520
And rappelling off a building
one morning in Hong Kong,

1414
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:24,031
you know,

1415
01:29:24,031 --> 01:29:28,770
like a 60 story building
and we're repelling off and
then going through a window

1416
01:29:28,771 --> 01:29:32,040
and you've got to training,
you get to shoot these targets and stuff.

1417
01:29:32,041 --> 01:29:35,340
And I mean it's pretty cold,
but I didn't like it at all.

1418
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:40,410
And this morning it was windy
and the building's actually
moving and I look down,

1419
01:29:40,411 --> 01:29:43,260
I'm going on a repel, you
know, I'm edging over the side,

1420
01:29:43,261 --> 01:29:46,890
I'm an a on the top of this building and
the people look like raisins, you know,

1421
01:29:46,891 --> 01:29:50,330
down there. And I mean that
needle to say, I mean I,

1422
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:55,230
I gotta go to the bathroom and I'm
hung over and I was like, oh my God,

1423
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:57,453
but

1424
01:29:58,370 --> 01:30:02,050
I'd rather die than be called a pussy.
I'm going to do it not,

1425
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:05,330
but I'd rather die than be a plus.
So that was pretty much the,

1426
01:30:05,331 --> 01:30:07,820
I'll never forget that day.
It was terrible.

1427
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:13,970
The most fearful moment or the most
difficult thing you ever do as a seal.

1428
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:18,320
Retire without a doubt.

1429
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:22,820
100% retire.
And I'll leave it at that.

1430
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,433
Yeah,
I hear you.

1431
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:27,110
All right.

1432
01:30:28,030 --> 01:30:32,500
Tony's favorite piece of
kit and over Tony's career.

1433
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:37,600
What's, what piece of gear has advanced
the most not including night vision,

1434
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:39,910
which obviously improved up to a bunch.
Well,

1435
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:43,150
I'll get to my favorite piece of gear kit,
but uh,

1436
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:48,340
evolution of Kia gotta be, you know,
there's a couple of things, like I say,

1437
01:30:48,341 --> 01:30:52,810
boots, the boot thing is phenomenal.
We get such good gear and boots.

1438
01:30:52,811 --> 01:30:56,630
Now also, you got to look
at navigation. You know,

1439
01:30:57,620 --> 01:30:59,470
I remember the first gps is we,

1440
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:03,460
we used to call them giant pieces of
shit cause they were like the size of an

1441
01:31:03,461 --> 01:31:05,560
ammo crate. They're huge, they're huge.

1442
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:09,550
And they looked like a tele phone
from the Korean War, you know,

1443
01:31:10,330 --> 01:31:13,840
and uh, but nowadays they're
just bad ass, you know.

1444
01:31:13,841 --> 01:31:18,430
And it would global positioning systems,
I mean, and also communications. Yeah,

1445
01:31:18,730 --> 01:31:22,120
I mean your satellite communication
is absolutely fantastic.

1446
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:27,480
And everybody was in the military out
there when we had all the old kicks and

1447
01:31:29,741 --> 01:31:30,850
Diana pads.

1448
01:31:30,851 --> 01:31:35,410
And then if you remember that HF high
frequency and we did a lot of HF and

1449
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:39,790
stringing up antennas. I'm like, God,
it was terrible. Literally. Yeah.

1450
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:41,320
Literally stringing up,
you know,

1451
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:46,310
80 foot antennas so you could make a
communication shot to some other distant

1452
01:31:46,311 --> 01:31:50,980
station. I Morris Code literally
using Morris call. Yeah, absolutely.

1453
01:31:51,190 --> 01:31:53,590
Good Times.
But my favorite piece of Kit,

1454
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:58,310
I would have to say is anything
that you get in and drive,

1455
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:02,650
because back in the day we didn't, we
didn't use any mobility. Really. Yeah.

1456
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:06,700
Everything was on foot and it's
like holy Shit. That in the uh,

1457
01:32:07,330 --> 01:32:12,330
the 300 win mag sniper rifle suppressed
with a 22 power night for scope on it is

1458
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:18,790
a wicked good piece of kit.
Let me tell you what I mean.

1459
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:23,670
I can read your tee shirt at a
click. That's pretty good. Legit,

1460
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:26,560
legit.
All right,

1461
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:32,180
Tony, what is the number one quality
that allows a leader to lead men into

1462
01:32:32,270 --> 01:32:34,940
uncomfortable conditions and succeed?

1463
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:41,140
What's uncomfortable? I guess just
bad scenarios. Tufts situations.

1464
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:46,540
Well I think keep it in your
mind. Mission men, mission men.

1465
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:50,200
Look guys, you're not paid to sit
here and here's what we got to do.

1466
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:54,610
Let's go do it. Yes. Uh,

1467
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:59,020
it's socks sometimes is bad,
but mission man,

1468
01:32:59,021 --> 01:33:01,030
if you keep thinking that
that's what we're paid to do.

1469
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:05,510
The bottom line is you follow the orders
of the guy above you and we're team

1470
01:33:05,511 --> 01:33:09,790
guys so that line bleeds a lot.
It has a lot of waves in it,

1471
01:33:10,510 --> 01:33:14,380
you know, cause he'll be like,
hey, Tony would think what
to do. I don't know Jocko,

1472
01:33:14,381 --> 01:33:18,580
let's do this. All right, it sounds
good. But at any given time, if he goes,

1473
01:33:18,581 --> 01:33:21,760
Hey Tony, this is what we're
doing, Roger that. And that's it.

1474
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:23,710
Even if it means dying.

1475
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:28,420
Because if you lead by example and you're
humble and you're good to your guys

1476
01:33:28,421 --> 01:33:31,240
and you know your guys and you
let them know you, but you know,

1477
01:33:31,241 --> 01:33:34,930
wipe their ass and you don't take
any shit from them and they know you,

1478
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:35,943
they'll follow you.

1479
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:37,783
No,

1480
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:43,140
you're humble and you make mistakes,
admit it and move on. And I think that's a

1481
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:44,683
okay.

1482
01:33:45,230 --> 01:33:47,210
I know a few of my guys,

1483
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:50,630
probably most of them would
follow me wherever we want,

1484
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:53,033
you know?
And uh,

1485
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:56,480
I guess that's just cause I never changed.

1486
01:33:56,481 --> 01:34:01,070
They always knew what they're gonna
get from me. That's about it. Steady.

1487
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:03,120
Yeah. The other, uh,

1488
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:07,290
the other big thing is making sure
people understand why they're doing what

1489
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:10,920
they're doing. Cause
like Tony just said, man,

1490
01:34:10,921 --> 01:34:15,210
we were going to have discussions
about stuff and say, hey,

1491
01:34:15,211 --> 01:34:18,360
this is why, this is why. Well, this is
why I think we should do it this way.

1492
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:20,640
You know,
it's not just like go and do now.

1493
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:25,110
There are situations of
course where someone goes,
hey, go and execute this now.

1494
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:27,450
Hey, go hit that building.
Hey, take guys over there.

1495
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:30,390
There's times in combat where you got to
make those decisions and you've got to

1496
01:34:30,391 --> 01:34:33,620
make things happen and that's
when you've taught. That's what,

1497
01:34:33,690 --> 01:34:37,500
that's when the important things that
you just talked about having a Ma just

1498
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:41,790
trust. Like I, I just
had trust in my guys.

1499
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:44,040
They trusted me that if I was
telling him to do something,

1500
01:34:44,610 --> 01:34:47,970
it was the right thing to do.
And by the way, if I told Tony,

1501
01:34:47,971 --> 01:34:51,540
go take that building over there, and he
looked at me and said negative, not now.

1502
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:56,270
I knew he was saying that to me for
a reason. Yeah. In front of it. Yeah.

1503
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:58,130
There was a reason he was telling me that,

1504
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:00,770
and we're not going to
have that discussion.

1505
01:35:00,830 --> 01:35:03,320
Probably don't have time to do it
right. Right now. I'd say, okay,

1506
01:35:03,321 --> 01:35:07,970
then we gotta get Outta here and he can't.
Okay, Roger, Roger. And then we'd go.

1507
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:12,470
So man, having that trust,
building up that trust through,

1508
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:15,890
you know, the humility, the
relationship, all that stuff is,

1509
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:19,190
is how you end up with a tight unit.
And that's how you really,

1510
01:35:19,191 --> 01:35:20,024
that's how you lead.

1511
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:28,670
Tony, did you have the same
attitude towards death as Jocko?

1512
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:34,280
Where are you prepared to
die? Oh, was I prepared that?

1513
01:35:34,281 --> 01:35:39,000
Yes, in a second. Let's get
that over with right away. Uh,

1514
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:43,180
I really didn't have an attitude of
death except for you don't make another

1515
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:47,220
people die. The bad guys then I
didn't care about them. I didn't,

1516
01:35:47,970 --> 01:35:52,610
I guess ID humanized him in my mind so
it wouldn't bother me cause it, you know,

1517
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:55,200
cause they're just, they're
just, they're not people.

1518
01:35:55,201 --> 01:35:59,700
There's a target and you just
whack them and that's it. And uh,

1519
01:36:00,870 --> 01:36:05,250
I was, I was definitely prepared to
die and matter of fact, you know,

1520
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:10,470
I thought that would be like the end
of my career. I kind of, but, um,

1521
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,210
I thought it would be the
end of your career to,

1522
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:20,730
um, there was a couple guys in our
task unit. I was not scared of dying.

1523
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,910
There was a couple guys
in our tasking it that I,

1524
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:28,500
I did not think we're going to make
it because they were just like,

1525
01:36:29,031 --> 01:36:29,864
I was like,
Oh yeah,

1526
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:34,400
I'm going to be given a speech at his
funeral cause he's a fired up young kid

1527
01:36:34,401 --> 01:36:37,610
that does not care about, yeah.
Like just not the other way.

1528
01:36:37,611 --> 01:36:42,560
For those of you out there, like, Ooh,
like didn't do his job. He was like, yeah,

1529
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:45,530
no, like, like just guys that were so,

1530
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:50,120
so fired up that uh,
yeah.

1531
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:52,310
And like even our guys
that did get killed,

1532
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:55,580
there wasn't one of them where I thought,
oh,

1533
01:36:56,890 --> 01:36:57,880
he,
he's,

1534
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:04,030
he wasn't ready for that. Right?
Yeah, he will. Did he want it?

1535
01:37:04,031 --> 01:37:06,010
Of course those guys didn't want it.
I would love to have him here.

1536
01:37:06,011 --> 01:37:09,430
They would love to be here.
But at the moment of truth,

1537
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:15,480
they, they did what I would, I would
think they would, would've died. Right.

1538
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:17,580
None of them did I say,
oh, it's a shame or,

1539
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:20,940
or anything like that.

1540
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:26,000
Because those guys had those attitudes
of they were there. They were, they,

1541
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:29,430
they love their job.
They love doing their job.

1542
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:33,240
They believed in what they were doing and

1543
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:37,640
that that's the way it was.

1544
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:40,100
Yeah,
absolutely.

1545
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:44,493
All right.

1546
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:51,630
Tony's view on training, mentoring,
integrating new guys into the platoon.

1547
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:57,720
Yeah. I mean, I've been
on the LPO side of that.

1548
01:37:57,721 --> 01:37:59,880
I've been on the not new guy side of that.

1549
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:04,140
I've been on the new guy so that I've
been in the chief side of it. And, uh,

1550
01:38:06,450 --> 01:38:11,340
I usually told the guys, you know,
you're on time, be motivated because

1551
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:14,003
it's fun.

1552
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:19,440
For those of you that think like the
seal teams to me is a thousand times more

1553
01:38:19,441 --> 01:38:24,240
than I thought it would be. It's a
fucking blast. It's the best thing ever.

1554
01:38:24,241 --> 01:38:28,050
It's the best men's Club
in the world. And, uh,

1555
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:31,080
but like you said,
you're trying to build these guys,

1556
01:38:31,081 --> 01:38:34,590
have these guys build their own
reputation, you know, confidence.

1557
01:38:34,591 --> 01:38:39,120
Nobody has any confidence in the
first day at the team. Nobody, um,

1558
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:42,090
try to instill confidence in them.
And, uh, I used to tell him, you know,

1559
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:47,130
should be seen, not heard. Carry a pen and
paper beyond time and shut the fuck up.

1560
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:52,080
Nobody cares about any stories,
where you from or none of that crap,

1561
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:54,480
you know,
saint stripes

1562
01:38:56,580 --> 01:39:01,200
eventually that'll come out
in a year, you know. So just,

1563
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:05,220
just ask questions. If you
need to be on time, listen,

1564
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:07,620
do your job and uh,

1565
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:13,110
show the guys the right way to do things
and it's not the right way, you know,

1566
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:15,510
tell them how to know the difference.

1567
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:18,600
Show them how to know to do
what they did for me. You know,

1568
01:39:18,601 --> 01:39:22,260
and they look and you look in their eyes
and they're just like Roger, but no,

1569
01:39:22,261 --> 01:39:26,340
you don't get it. You have no
show me what I just said. Okay.

1570
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:31,480
Just say you don't understand. You know,
but that's about it was tried to be, uh,

1571
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:37,620
you know, fair with them. Direct.
That's about it. We'd by example,

1572
01:39:39,870 --> 01:39:44,220
one thing I want to say
there is about, uh, you know,

1573
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:48,560
talk about being steady.
We had a situation one time I was,

1574
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:52,170
I was a platoon chief and we're
working hide, wicked hard,

1575
01:39:52,290 --> 01:39:54,300
like going optempo was through the roof.

1576
01:39:54,301 --> 01:39:57,660
The battle rhythm was shot to hell
because it was just go, go, go, go, go.

1577
01:39:58,170 --> 01:39:59,670
And the guys are getting tired and stuff.

1578
01:39:59,671 --> 01:40:03,720
And we had a meeting about it and I
didn't say anything. And I'm like, yeah,

1579
01:40:03,721 --> 01:40:06,450
if we can just slow down a little bit,
you know? And I was like, okay. I mean,

1580
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:09,360
well Gitelman bitch. Cause
sometimes you go, go, go.

1581
01:40:09,361 --> 01:40:13,110
Like that thing's getting safe
and you start making mistakes.

1582
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:16,920
But we hadn't really made any
mistakes at that point. And I said,

1583
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:22,620
put it in perspective at this time,
like Dava some of them guys,

1584
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:27,090
like 2123 years old,
I was like 38 and I go,

1585
01:40:28,410 --> 01:40:30,990
I use the analogy like we used to say,

1586
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:33,540
you're only as fast as the
slowest guy in your patrol.

1587
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,270
Maybe the guy that's got more
weight carrying more equipment.

1588
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:40,140
So he sets the pace and I go, I'm
gonna go though. You agree with that?

1589
01:40:40,141 --> 01:40:41,120
And everyone's like, yeah, yeah.

1590
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:46,200
Well we'll take a break when the oldest
guy here gets tired and that's me and

1591
01:40:46,201 --> 01:40:51,180
I'm not tired enough, said, okay, Roger
that go to work. They're just like,

1592
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:54,190
yeah, Roger. So

1593
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:59,140
hopefully some of the new guys
learned something on that one. Yeah,

1594
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:05,830
yeah, no doubt about that. It's a
leading from the front, you know,

1595
01:41:06,710 --> 01:41:10,720
if, no doubt about it. All right.

1596
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:17,940
How does one put the high of war behind
him and his eat any and are you always

1597
01:41:19,631 --> 01:41:22,630
searching for it still in other things?

1598
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:31,350
Uh,
have I transitioned to civilian life?

1599
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:37,800
Kind of ish. A little. I just
don't like as well. I mean it's,

1600
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:41,460
it's terrible. Like there's
no action. I mean there's no,

1601
01:41:42,330 --> 01:41:46,470
you don't go in and who didn't like
going to work on a Monday morning? Yeah,

1602
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:49,870
it was the best. I mean,
and you know on that,

1603
01:41:49,990 --> 01:41:53,670
and by the way, you went to work on
Sunday, you went to work on Saturday?

1604
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:57,640
Just every, every, oh, like some of
the guys that the team will, Oh yeah,

1605
01:41:57,641 --> 01:42:00,400
it's a weekend. No, we'll be at the
team. We're going to be working out.

1606
01:42:00,401 --> 01:42:01,360
Then we were working on our gear.

1607
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:03,700
They're already grabs a beer and
then we're going to go out there.

1608
01:42:03,701 --> 01:42:05,740
We're going to wake up the next morning
and do the same thing on Sunday and they

1609
01:42:05,741 --> 01:42:08,390
were to come in on Monday.
That's what it is. Yeah.

1610
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:10,260
Because who cares about what
else are you going to do?

1611
01:42:10,350 --> 01:42:12,070
What else are you going to do?
Like, Oh, you go with your friends,

1612
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:16,690
with your friends. All my friends are
in the teens, so it gives you nothing.

1613
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:21,640
So, oh, see that's it. Go back to
whatever failed relationship I had.

1614
01:42:23,490 --> 01:42:27,300
Yeah. So, uh, that can
definitely be a little tricky.

1615
01:42:27,390 --> 01:42:31,380
Am I searching for another
things? Probably, you know, uh,

1616
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:35,460
I don't know.
I don't know.

1617
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:40,410
That's such a hard question
to put in perspective. I mean,

1618
01:42:40,411 --> 01:42:45,411
I live in New Hampshire now and I work
40 hours a week and I do all right.

1619
01:42:45,841 --> 01:42:49,110
But I don't, there's no, you know,

1620
01:42:49,111 --> 01:42:53,190
the magic in my life is like gone. I
mean, that was, that was the magic,

1621
01:42:53,191 --> 01:42:57,270
the glue that held me together as
the teams, you know, and, you know,

1622
01:42:58,050 --> 01:43:01,500
I got some good families back there,
you know, that, that helped me out.

1623
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:06,060
Like friends of mine, friends of my
family, and like the Murphy's, you know,

1624
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:10,430
the Daniels, the downs is, I mean,
there's just, it's, if, you know,

1625
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:15,060
if I don't get to people back
home's name, I'm sorry, but, uh,

1626
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:18,510
you, I got really good friends
that try to help me kind of,

1627
01:43:18,511 --> 01:43:21,420
but they just have no
idea. Like, you know,

1628
01:43:21,810 --> 01:43:25,660
there's one old team guy from back
there that's from the 70s, you know,

1629
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:28,740
and I talked to him and it's like Roger,
you know,

1630
01:43:28,741 --> 01:43:32,160
then there's a sergeant major
retired 30 meters back there,

1631
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,620
but it's a small town and it's like,
I drink a lot and you know,

1632
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:41,280
I work a lot too, so I'm kind of
functioning that way. But there's no,

1633
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:45,190
I dunno, I guess, I guess

1634
01:43:45,210 --> 01:43:49,820
I'm still looking for something, but
it's just the high wars, just like,

1635
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:52,970
I don't know, it's, I
think he could say it's

1636
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:59,870
the fucking best. It's like
the best thing ever, you know?

1637
01:43:59,871 --> 01:44:02,600
And once you get done with
a big firefight, like, yeah,

1638
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:05,990
you want to go back and like, can we
do that again? And again and again.

1639
01:44:05,991 --> 01:44:10,690
It was so much fun. I mean even, I mean,
it's socks. It's hard, but it's, it's,

1640
01:44:10,750 --> 01:44:14,810
it's great. I mean, I would
just, cause if you think about,

1641
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:17,800
like they say heroes, right? Tell me.

1642
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:22,220
The real heroes are then guys standing
up post out there with minimal training

1643
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:27,140
that don't want to be there and still
do their job and find American soldiers,

1644
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:31,820
sailors, marines, you know, airman,
whatever. For us, that's our profession.

1645
01:44:31,821 --> 01:44:35,060
Like, you know, that's like,
we didn't even want to go home.

1646
01:44:35,061 --> 01:44:40,010
It's like our blood in our guts. It's in
our DNA. That's where we want to be. So,

1647
01:44:40,011 --> 01:44:44,660
I mean, how do you, you don't just, you
do all that stuff for all those years,

1648
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:49,740
there's going to be side effects. You
know, there's gonna be, I don't care. I'm,

1649
01:44:49,741 --> 01:44:53,310
you know, I'm not going to go, I
don't go see a counselor or nothing.

1650
01:44:53,890 --> 01:44:58,760
Cause I think I'm strong enough that, you
know, I can handle it, but it's not easy.

1651
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:03,680
You know, it's like when
people, when people always
come up and they say, you know,

1652
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:05,750
thank you for serving.

1653
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:07,940
Yeah. They always say that.
I know, you know, say, Hey,

1654
01:45:07,941 --> 01:45:10,790
it was an honor to serve course,
but what I really want to say,

1655
01:45:10,791 --> 01:45:13,610
and sometimes if it's a deeper
conversation, I'm like totally fake me.

1656
01:45:13,611 --> 01:45:16,260
I feel guilty because you do enough.

1657
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:20,600
And like you guys paid me to do this.

1658
01:45:20,601 --> 01:45:21,830
Like what did you do
when you're a little kid?

1659
01:45:21,860 --> 01:45:25,070
I ran around the woods and played
military stuff and ray put camouflage,

1660
01:45:25,071 --> 01:45:29,300
put cold black cork on my face and
played with guns and beet shot BB guns.

1661
01:45:29,301 --> 01:45:31,160
And that's what I did
all the time as a kid.

1662
01:45:31,161 --> 01:45:35,420
And then I grew up and I turned 18 and
then they started paying me money to do

1663
01:45:35,421 --> 01:45:38,090
the same thing. And then they said,
oh, there's a bunch of bad guys.

1664
01:45:38,091 --> 01:45:42,920
You go kill them all. Okay there we'll
give you more money. And then, yeah, so,

1665
01:45:42,921 --> 01:45:45,890
so people say thank you and it's Sorta,
it definitely makes you feel like,

1666
01:45:45,891 --> 01:45:50,840
damn man, I got so lucky the
day I enlisted in the military,

1667
01:45:50,841 --> 01:45:54,500
I got so lucky because it was like,
you know,

1668
01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:58,370
it was like the square peg
found the square hole basically.

1669
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,420
And that's what a lot of team guys are
like and that's why when all of a sudden

1670
01:46:02,421 --> 01:46:05,510
this score, they go, okay, you can't
use that, that square hole anymore.

1671
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,160
They pull you out and
there's a triangle there.

1672
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:11,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Out.

1673
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:17,090
Yeah, it's so true. And they, the service
to me, I wanted, when I was eight,

1674
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:21,080
I listen when I was 17 when I, when
I was 18 got out when I was, what,

1675
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:25,730
45 44 whatever.
And it never lied to me.

1676
01:46:26,870 --> 01:46:29,570
They always paid me and they'll
pay me for the rest of my life.

1677
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:33,810
And everything they said was
true, do this. They go, oh,

1678
01:46:33,811 --> 01:46:38,660
the mood to use a bunch of
bullshit. There's little
things. But overall, you know,

1679
01:46:38,661 --> 01:46:40,280
I didn't have to like figure out,

1680
01:46:40,281 --> 01:46:45,281
figure out like a woman and it was all
wishy washy about shit and stuff and you

1681
01:46:46,821 --> 01:46:49,860
know, and all that's just part of
whatever, being a man and stuff.

1682
01:46:49,861 --> 01:46:54,300
But they never lied to me. It was
always just really, really good.

1683
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:59,430
Civilian Life's not like that. I mean, I
deal with people and for the most part,

1684
01:46:59,431 --> 01:47:01,290
everybody out there as a good person,
I believe.

1685
01:47:02,490 --> 01:47:06,030
But I get mad because of the
misuse of the military. Now.

1686
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:09,060
I mean it's so misuse.
It's crazy.

1687
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:15,460
Grab 200,000 bad-ass army soldiers and
Marines go over to where Isis is and

1688
01:47:18,621 --> 01:47:21,980
smoke these sons of bitches.
What are we waiting for?

1689
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:25,370
I don't get it cause, but on
the flip coin, people were like,

1690
01:47:25,670 --> 01:47:29,540
we get to pay the deficit because we
don't want our children to pay it. Yeah.

1691
01:47:29,541 --> 01:47:33,890
But do you want them to fight the war?
Let's go. We got the muscle right now.

1692
01:47:33,891 --> 01:47:35,660
I don't know what we're waiting for.
This is a crock of shit.

1693
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:39,770
Hopefully they'll change.
Hopefully we'll change.

1694
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:44,630
Uh, you know what? We'll
do one more question here.

1695
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:50,270
How do you keep your head in the game
when one of your squad is killed?

1696
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:53,973
Okay.

1697
01:47:54,070 --> 01:47:55,840
Yeah.
You know,

1698
01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:00,430
well,
I think for me,

1699
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:06,460
you have to treat it like
mission men in that order.

1700
01:48:06,970 --> 01:48:11,140
And to me that there's no use. You
know, the milk is on the floor.

1701
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:16,890
There's no use crying over it.
You know. Eod doesn't, you know,

1702
01:48:17,370 --> 01:48:19,530
diffuse a bomb that already went off.
Okay,

1703
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:24,030
well you gotta do is try not to
lose any more your man. Okay,

1704
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:27,270
now you just got to do the
mission with the dead guy.

1705
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:29,180
And I know that sounds maybe cruel.

1706
01:48:29,181 --> 01:48:32,160
So there ain't no time to sit
there and mourn or do any of that.

1707
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:37,110
You have to complete your op, you
have to do your mission, right. Um,

1708
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:40,350
there's plenty of time to mourn.

1709
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:44,130
There's front of the time to figure out
what went wrong or what didn't go wrong

1710
01:48:44,131 --> 01:48:47,070
or whatever happened when
you're back at the ops done.

1711
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:51,450
And that's why we train like that when
we train and we going through a building

1712
01:48:52,290 --> 01:48:55,230
and they put a guide down, you just
step over him, clear the house.

1713
01:48:55,230 --> 01:48:59,580
Cause you don't want to get no more than
one killed and you just have to do what

1714
01:48:59,581 --> 01:49:02,400
you've been trained to do.
And then the leadership position,

1715
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:07,740
it's very hard not to, you know,
you can train all your life,

1716
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:12,030
but when something happens like that,
it's very hard not to just go, oh my God,

1717
01:49:12,031 --> 01:49:14,310
I've got somebody killed. You
know what happened, what happened?

1718
01:49:14,311 --> 01:49:19,290
Cause I take it very personally because
it was one of my guys and I racked my

1719
01:49:19,291 --> 01:49:23,490
brain for a long time. And
then, uh, I figured out that,

1720
01:49:24,570 --> 01:49:28,200
well, you know, I just got to do
my job and be a leader, you know,

1721
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,510
and I can't let the rest of the guys down.

1722
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:33,300
I can't let myself down
and my team and my country.

1723
01:49:33,301 --> 01:49:36,570
So I got to do what I gotta do to get
Outta there and not get out of there,

1724
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:38,910
but complete the op
and then figure it out,

1725
01:49:38,911 --> 01:49:42,150
then take care of him as best we
can and have a lot of respect.

1726
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:48,310
And that's about the best way
I can answer that Bro. Yeah.

1727
01:49:48,311 --> 01:49:48,931
You know,
I,

1728
01:49:48,931 --> 01:49:53,890
I remember a pastor mark got
killed and he was obviously,

1729
01:49:53,891 --> 01:49:55,090
he was the first seal killed in Iraq.

1730
01:49:55,091 --> 01:49:59,380
He's the first guy that ever
worked for me that got killed. And

1731
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:04,900
I remember a couple of days went by,
we actually did the memorial ceremony,

1732
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,393
um,

1733
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:12,360
in like a couple days went by and I was
kinda trying to figure out what to say

1734
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:18,520
to the platoons specifically what
to say to your platoon. Right.

1735
01:50:19,810 --> 01:50:21,160
And I was sort of a,

1736
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:27,780
and I realized what I was doing right
when I was doing was the only thing I knew

1737
01:50:29,471 --> 01:50:32,110
how to do, which is work. Yep.

1738
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:36,370
And finally I remember I
was, I wrote, that's what I,

1739
01:50:36,371 --> 01:50:37,900
that's what I wrote down and be like,
look,

1740
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:42,580
mark came into your platoon and I said,

1741
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:45,373
hey,

1742
01:50:46,650 --> 01:50:50,240
mark is the best motherfucker
ever. Yeah. He will.

1743
01:50:50,610 --> 01:50:53,100
And My fucking soul is crushed right now.

1744
01:50:54,660 --> 01:50:57,900
And actually remember as I was talking,

1745
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:01,330
I started getting emotional

1746
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:03,313
and

1747
01:51:05,250 --> 01:51:08,700
I stopped and I was
getting a little choked up

1748
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:12,810
and I stopped talking.
I was just trying to get it together.

1749
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:18,390
And you were sitting there and
you're like, hey man, it's okay. Yup.

1750
01:51:18,810 --> 01:51:19,643
And I was like,

1751
01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:21,843
check,

1752
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:26,360
this is what I'm going to
do. I'm going to work. Yep.

1753
01:51:27,230 --> 01:51:30,350
And this is what we're going to do.
I'm going to work. We're going to work.

1754
01:51:30,410 --> 01:51:33,050
You know when that happened,
I was thinking about that.

1755
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:35,870
I,

1756
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:40,870
I never ever once shed one tear and I
started getting like concerned like do I

1757
01:51:42,771 --> 01:51:45,050
have anything they feelings at all.

1758
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:50,210
And then we came back from
that deployment. I remember
maybe, I don't know,

1759
01:51:50,570 --> 01:51:55,350
six months later, something, it may
not sound like it may shock you, but I,

1760
01:51:55,351 --> 01:51:59,300
I used to like cats. I used to like cats,
you know, you always seem like a cat guy.

1761
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:01,010
I like dogs too.
You know,

1762
01:52:01,011 --> 01:52:06,011
like just me and my girlfriend the time
had cats and my cat died and I bawled

1763
01:52:07,641 --> 01:52:11,630
like a little baby for like three hours.
And it just,

1764
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:15,500
I think it was just a point in me
waiting for him to come out, you know?

1765
01:52:15,501 --> 01:52:18,830
And it'd be like, okay, cause you're a
team guy around that stuff all the time.

1766
01:52:19,190 --> 01:52:23,600
People getting maimed shot,
killed and blown up and you know,

1767
01:52:23,601 --> 01:52:27,340
and then it kind of festers
in that I think, you know,

1768
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:31,970
it's kind of deep and stuff, but whatever.
I'm not really that deep of a person.

1769
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:36,680
And it just came out and I was like,
you know, that's kind of cool. Yeah.

1770
01:52:36,770 --> 01:52:39,080
So maybe I was just,
you know,

1771
01:52:39,081 --> 01:52:42,740
I took the like beehive
thing a little too, too,

1772
01:52:43,150 --> 01:52:45,200
too much.
Probably.

1773
01:52:48,950 --> 01:52:49,783
Well,

1774
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:55,060
I think that's about all
we've got for tonight and, uh,

1775

obviously the military guys and the
team guys and a team guys that are,

1787
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,960
you know, are bros that are like,
hey man, that was great. Oh yeah,

1788

I learned and that just gets me, uh,
that's why I'm doing this, man. Yeah.

1789
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:53,030
That's why I'm doing
this. And yeah, that's,

1790
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:56,840
that's what means the most to me and
having you on here obviously is, uh,

1791
01:53:57,140 --> 01:54:00,080
is phenomenal. So, um,

1792
01:54:00,530 --> 01:54:02,420

thanks for listening to the podcast.
Thanks for supporting it.

1794
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:10,040
If you do want to support
the podcast a little bit,

1795
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:16,250
Echo Charles, tell them
quickly had it do it. Actually,

1796
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:20,390
actually, I do have one more
question. Go ahead and win. Um,

1797
01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:25,500
you know how Kate, you're like a
hard guy and as put real simply in,

1798
01:54:25,501 --> 01:54:29,730
this might be kind of an ambiguous
question, but like that example,

1799
01:54:29,731 --> 01:54:32,760
you say it was real hot and
you're not even drinking water,

1800
01:54:32,761 --> 01:54:37,350
you're drinking coffee and Copenhagen.
Yeah. Example. Like, why is that?

1801
01:54:37,410 --> 01:54:40,050
You know how, because it's a
spectrum, right? Like a lot of people,

1802
01:54:40,051 --> 01:54:45,000
like some people, they can be big, they
can run, you know, 10 miles, no problem,

1803
01:54:45,001 --> 01:54:45,661
all this stuff,

1804
01:54:45,661 --> 01:54:49,410
but they get in certain kinds
of discomfort physically
or whatever they're done.

1805
01:54:49,950 --> 01:54:52,860
Or you get these big guys or whatever,
they'd missed one meal. They're done.

1806
01:54:53,530 --> 01:54:57,120
They're thoroughbreds. Yeah.
So you're like, are you like,

1807
01:54:58,110 --> 01:55:01,710
I was part of that crew in the teams,
like fist fought and drank a lot.

1808
01:55:01,711 --> 01:55:05,580
And so that kind of trained us like
being hung over and stuff. Like,

1809
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:09,150
I mean we would be like hung over and go
work and you work out for three hours.

1810
01:55:09,190 --> 01:55:13,980
Yeah. So these guys was, I knew guys
would like, they could never do that.

1811
01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:17,940
Right. So we're kind of like
bottom feeders, so on shit
got bad, we're like, eh,

1812
01:55:17,970 --> 01:55:18,760
whatever.

1813
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:22,360
Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll make it. I'm
not like that anymore. Like I work,

1814
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:26,210
I need to drink water because
I'm not used to it. I would,

1815
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:29,550
there was some kind of a genetic
component like, right. Like, like I,

1816
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:32,050
I freely admit, like I
don't sleep a lot. Right.

1817
01:55:32,350 --> 01:55:36,370
And I understand that it's not just cause
like I'm just toff it's cause there's

1818
01:55:36,371 --> 01:55:40,840
some genetic component in there that
doesn't require a lot of sleep and either.

1819
01:55:41,050 --> 01:55:45,030
And you know, I have one of my taught
told us before, like one of my daughters,

1820
01:55:45,730 --> 01:55:49,230
I'll go to bed at like 1130 she'll be
awake and then I'll wake up at four 31 and

1821
01:55:49,231 --> 01:55:52,850
she'll be awake. Like she's genetically,
she doesn't need a lot of seats.

1822
01:55:52,851 --> 01:55:54,660
So I know,
I'm Kinda like that too.

1823
01:55:55,410 --> 01:55:58,320
And there's just Fyi for Tony,

1824
01:55:58,321 --> 01:56:02,490
there's something genetic about
the water intake because I mean,

1825
01:56:02,491 --> 01:56:05,700
I did patrols and stuff
with you and you know,

1826
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:09,400
I mean I'm fairly hard,
but I need water, you know,

1827
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:13,350
I would need to carry more water
than you and you know, never,

1828
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:17,400
never would I be like a bitch about it.
Like,

1829
01:56:17,490 --> 01:56:19,830
but no. You know, I, I,

1830
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:24,690
I would need like twice as much water
as Tony would eat and I don't wait twice

1831
01:56:24,691 --> 01:56:25,171
as much.
I mean,

1832
01:56:25,171 --> 01:56:28,290
I'm whatever I may be for you 40
pounds heavier or something like that.

1833
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:32,670
But so there's some genetic component
that makes you need less water and makes

1834
01:56:32,671 --> 01:56:37,020
me need a decent amount
of water. So again,

1835
01:56:37,050 --> 01:56:41,750
also I spent a lot of time at nylon. Yeah,
yeah, for sure. You're acclimated to,

1836
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:44,940
I'm not like that now.
I need a lot of water.

1837
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:49,140
But even even overall above and
beyond just the water situation where,

1838
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:51,840
and you're like this tool that
we're kind of talking about this,

1839
01:56:51,841 --> 01:56:54,480
where do you think that,
you know,

1840
01:56:54,481 --> 01:56:58,270
like if you just sit around indoors
and after awhile you're like Bro,

1841
01:56:58,271 --> 01:57:01,140
I got to get out. Oh yeah. A lot
of people, they're not like that.

1842
01:57:01,150 --> 01:57:03,850
They're the opposite. There was like,
Dang, there's a lot going on outside.

1843
01:57:03,860 --> 01:57:08,310
I'd better stay indoors. Even big,
tough, strong guys. A of people.

1844
01:57:08,311 --> 01:57:10,830
I like that. Is it. And does it,

1845
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:15,760
does this kind of fall in line with
why you took to the team's sole? Yah,

1846
01:57:16,370 --> 01:57:20,970
absolutely. Echo now cause you're like
that too. And I'll tell you again,

1847
01:57:20,971 --> 01:57:23,430
going back to give credit
where credit's due, man.

1848
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:28,560
The people that we were raised by, the
same people in the teams and those guys,

1849
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:33,720
they didn't complain about anything.
They showed no weakness ever. Ever, ever.

1850
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:35,890
Nothing. Like, Oh, you're
tired. They would net,

1851
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:40,580
you'd never hear a guy say he was tired.
Ever. Never. No. No. Uh, you know, hurt,

1852
01:57:40,620 --> 01:57:45,480
doesn't matter. Um, uh, broken something.
No, just be quiet. Put tape on it.

1853
01:57:45,481 --> 01:57:48,930
Yeah. Shut up. Yeah. And that's, and
so when you're brought up that way,

1854
01:57:49,410 --> 01:57:51,770
and I mean it was blatantly
obvious when you've got the teams,

1855
01:57:52,030 --> 01:57:56,010
like if you just know there was no,
no, just don't complain about anything.

1856
01:57:56,160 --> 01:58:00,510
Just beat, just suck it up.
Oh, this sucks. Yeah. Don't
even admit that. It sucks.

1857
01:58:01,650 --> 01:58:04,260
Don't ever do that.
Yeah. And let's be quiet.

1858
01:58:04,290 --> 01:58:07,710
That's probably the best way to
explain it. Yeah. That and like,

1859
01:58:08,430 --> 01:58:11,850
I didn't have anything else put that.
Like I said, I wasn't the best shooter.

1860
01:58:11,851 --> 01:58:15,690
I wasn't the biggest guy, but
I had that, I always had that.

1861
01:58:16,650 --> 01:58:21,010
I remember one time we training and you
know how like after around it's done

1862
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:24,180
like a lot of people and I was one
of those people you just, yeah,

1863
01:58:24,181 --> 01:58:28,770
you just flop on your back and lay down
and get your arrests one. Yeah Bro.

1864
01:58:28,890 --> 01:58:32,550
One time, long time we'll take your
eyes off your enemies more or less.

1865
01:58:32,551 --> 01:58:34,740
The attitude. He was like,
you look a little tired.

1866
01:58:34,741 --> 01:58:38,670
They're almost like it was when you first
kind of started coaching me up a lot

1867
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,080
and you were like, you look a little tired
there, but it wasn't a joke. It was kind

1868
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:45,460
of like as if you really want it
to say bro, don't do that. Right.

1869
01:58:45,461 --> 01:58:48,730
They're like stand up. Walk though.
You're like showing weakness.

1870
01:58:48,731 --> 01:58:50,050
Like I don't like how you do that.

1871
01:58:50,051 --> 01:58:53,590
That was really the tone that was so
that makes a lot of sense right there.

1872
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:57,310
But that being said,
I think it goes,

1873
01:58:57,460 --> 01:59:02,460
I feel like he goes a little bit above
and beyond just having a skill or,

1874
01:59:02,491 --> 01:59:06,220
or being really good at being able
to tolerate pain. I feel like,

1875
01:59:06,250 --> 01:59:09,130
just like how you were saying, I think,
you know, a few weeks ago you were like,

1876
01:59:09,850 --> 01:59:14,110
there is, there is a word, a little bit
of pain to show on my life kind of thing.

1877
01:59:14,130 --> 01:59:18,510
Right, absolutely. But like in our
case, I think it can be cat or cat,

1878
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:22,330
our guys is that we are,
uh, we're lunatics. Yeah.

1879
01:59:22,331 --> 01:59:24,730
Like massive cause who wants who?
Nope.

1880
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:27,550
Looks there's be a frog man for 20.

1881
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:31,180
I mean that's just pushed
so hard on your body.

1882
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:37,240
But we are lucky. Lucky. But a guy like
Tim Farrell who you talked about earlier,

1883
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:41,430
I mean all them guys that we
talked about, Mr Fac, I mean he,

1884
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:46,180
how old was he when we were coming up
on the teams? He was 46, 47 years old.

1885
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:51,460
All broken, you know, broken
knees, broken ankles. Guess what?

1886
01:59:51,490 --> 01:59:54,730
Out there on a six and a half
mile run every single time.

1887
01:59:55,090 --> 01:59:59,410
And what were the complaints?
None. Not One. None ever. Just,

1888
01:59:59,411 --> 02:00:03,390
just crush everyone and just be
actually like, Eh, like Mr [inaudible],

1889
02:00:03,391 --> 02:00:06,460
he wouldn't, he wouldn't crush people
on the run, but you'd see them hobbling.

1890
02:00:06,690 --> 02:00:09,220
Yeah, our cross the finish
line and you'd be like,

1891
02:00:09,550 --> 02:00:14,260
that had to hurt so bad but he just, well
whatever. Yeah, put a little tape on it.

1892
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:19,320
Well I fell out of a helicopter and
broke my heel bone on Halloween day and I

1893
02:00:20,681 --> 02:00:24,490
deployed and well actually I
went over it before deploying it.

1894
02:00:24,540 --> 02:00:27,310
So I deployed in March. Yeah, I got,

1895
02:00:27,370 --> 02:00:31,750
I got hammered and I cut my cast off
with these bolt cutters and that wasn't a

1896
02:00:31,751 --> 02:00:36,610
good idea. And uh, I remember the master
chief and the command he'd, he'd be,

1897
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:40,170
he's like, you want to make sure
it was good to go to go overseas.

1898
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:42,820
Wouldn't be walking down
a hallway and I'd see him.

1899
02:00:42,821 --> 02:00:47,800
I'd walked perfectly and it hurts
so bad. He goes, how you doing?

1900
02:00:47,801 --> 02:00:51,310
I stand on shit. Shoot the
shit with them from it. Good,
good. Roger. All right. Hey,

1901
02:00:51,311 --> 02:00:54,180
I got to go. Go in the bathroom.
You'd go in the head and be like,

1902
02:00:56,520 --> 02:01:01,210
I mean I was still hobbling
when we deployed. It just,
it just kind of went away.

1903
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:06,010
There's no way I was missing that.
No Way.

1904
02:01:07,330 --> 02:01:11,650
I think most of us are like that maybe
to begin with when maybe taught like out

1905
02:01:11,651 --> 02:01:14,230
of it, cause you know, I mean
even in everyday person, if they,

1906
02:01:14,430 --> 02:01:17,130
they do something kind of hard
to work out or even, you know,

1907
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:19,810
something like people will,
recreation will be like,

1908
02:01:19,910 --> 02:01:22,060
I think going to run a marathon
or something like that.

1909
02:01:22,270 --> 02:01:24,580
So when they do something
hard or kind of painful,

1910
02:01:24,581 --> 02:01:26,830
some kind of adversity and it's done,
you feel good.

1911
02:01:26,831 --> 02:01:31,330
I think that's a natural
thing. Like people like, like
look my cool scar, you know,

1912
02:01:31,390 --> 02:01:34,030
that kind of thing.
But it kind of feels like,

1913
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:37,780
and kind of listening and stuff
as an outsider a little bit here,

1914
02:01:38,110 --> 02:01:42,380
it kind of seems like those shackles of
kind of being trained out of that just

1915
02:01:42,381 --> 02:01:45,680
didn't happen for you guys. And
guys like you, you know? Oh yeah,

1916
02:01:45,820 --> 02:01:49,010
maybe we got trained in the other
way quite yet. Or I think you,

1917
02:01:49,011 --> 02:01:53,950
you guys just held onto it,
you know? Absolutely. I could
just, yeah, yeah. There's,

1918
02:01:54,010 --> 02:01:54,843
there's no doubt.

1919
02:01:54,860 --> 02:01:58,730
And there's a bunch of bunch of
Badass frog men that are in the team.

1920
02:01:58,900 --> 02:02:03,140
That's all you, you know, you can go
talk to the marines. Army soldiers.

1921
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:08,160
Tough bastard. Kick nuts.
Okay. So when, when he's living
here, we're rolling. Do you,

1922
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:12,000
what's that thing that crow, it's like
this syndrome when you just worked out.

1923
02:02:12,490 --> 02:02:16,400
It's called beyond the Rab
Rhabdo rhabdomyolysis. Yeah.

1924
02:02:16,430 --> 02:02:19,870
So he gets that by the way. And
He, um, it's just from his role,

1925
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:22,730
his best friend growing up to him,
two of his best friends growing up.

1926
02:02:22,820 --> 02:02:26,530
Our team guys, I'll tell you, they are
later. Oh, nice. So He's, we're rolling.

1927
02:02:26,531 --> 02:02:29,270
Do you just said, and he's
like going every day. I'll
just, all day, he's like, man,

1928
02:02:29,380 --> 02:02:33,050
I'm just doing DJ and he's not, he's
kind of quiet, you know, he's like, oh,

1929
02:02:33,470 --> 02:02:36,260
we're all done. We've been done
hard day. Then like, you know,

1930
02:02:36,261 --> 02:02:38,840
the guys who showed up later, whatever,
they, they're still kind of, they're like,

1931
02:02:38,841 --> 02:02:43,450
hey, you want to all cake? And
I was like, okay, like that.
So he never says no. Okay.

1932
02:02:43,970 --> 02:02:47,810
The next week, like, I guess he had to
go to the doctor. What are the next week?

1933
02:02:47,811 --> 02:02:49,760
He's like, yeah, you have
that metal. Rhabdo like,

1934
02:02:49,761 --> 02:02:53,090
have you been doing a lot of physical
output? You know this? He's like, yeah,

1935
02:02:53,091 --> 02:02:58,010
can we can be spin shrieking. I know,
but that's exactly what I'm saying.

1936
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:02,690
But normally that stops
a guy in his tracks while
they're training and he's just

1937
02:03:02,691 --> 02:03:05,320
like, no, just keep training.
Someone else wants to try and go.

1938
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:09,530
I remember one time he said, I call
him kinda tired. I mean he said that,

1939
02:03:09,531 --> 02:03:13,520
but he didn't say I'm done rolling.
You look tired.

1940
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:20,220
I'm head. Yeah. Awesome.
That's awesome. Uh,

1941
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:24,670
all right. Any other questions from
Echo Charles? That's it. We can, um,

1942
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:27,500
we can go to support, you
know, let's wrap it up.

1943
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:31,980
How can they support if you want to
support this is how you can, you know,

1944
02:03:32,030 --> 02:03:35,930
we talk about getting after
it a lot from time to time

1945
02:03:38,190 --> 02:03:41,690
and supplementation is not a form
of weakness. Would you agree Tony?

1946
02:03:42,170 --> 02:03:43,940
I would agree. Right. Supplement, right.

1947
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:47,870
Best supplements because now that he's
supplements can be kind of whack on it.

1948
02:03:48,050 --> 02:03:51,650
Fortunately someone on Twitter
was asking me about, uh,

1949
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:55,430
shooting tech shroom tech, like, oh,
how does it work and all this stuff.

1950
02:03:55,790 --> 02:03:59,380
Here's the thing. This
is, I know that it helps,

1951
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:03,950
I've heard from a credible source
that it helps with oxygen utilization.

1952
02:04:03,951 --> 02:04:07,520
So you know, like high intensity that
that kind of goes prolonged or whatever.

1953
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:09,740
But you can read on it on the website,
they have all the,

1954
02:04:09,770 --> 02:04:11,570
like the actual literature,

1955
02:04:12,050 --> 02:04:15,110
like the tests and all this stuff on
all this stuff anyway, so it's legit.

1956
02:04:15,140 --> 02:04:17,600
We all know it's legit. I think that's
kind of common knowledge. By now.

1957
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:22,280
You can get 10% off if you want
supplements on it. Duck on. Slash Jocko.

1958
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:23,720
Let's go slash Jocko.

1959
02:04:27,020 --> 02:04:30,080
Get a worrier bar as
well. My, my suggestion,

1960
02:04:31,850 --> 02:04:36,140
not a good stuff on there.
Next Way Amazon slip,

1961
02:04:36,141 --> 02:04:40,800
you shop on Amazon. Like we all
do. Click through the website,

1962
02:04:40,801 --> 02:04:44,360
our website Jocko, podcast.com. There's a
little link there, little banner on the,

1963
02:04:44,730 --> 02:04:47,040
on the side and uh,
you know,

1964
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:51,780
go through Amazon or go to Amazon through
there and of course subscribe to the

1965
02:04:51,781 --> 02:04:56,781
podcast on iTunes and youtube doing
more videos to come by the way.

1966
02:04:57,310 --> 02:05:01,640
Yeah.
And of course Jocko store if you like.

1967
02:05:01,641 --> 02:05:04,920
Any shirts that we um, we have, we did it.

1968
02:05:04,921 --> 02:05:08,790
I think we expended a
lot of mental energy,

1969
02:05:08,940 --> 02:05:13,940
making sure that the shirts are good
to go as they say or as you would say,

1970
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:19,380
kind of dope. Dope, dope, dope meaning
not just either dope cause we said,

1971
02:05:19,381 --> 02:05:22,050
so we try to put different layers on them,
you know,

1972
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:25,380
and you know how it's not like it just
says hey I'm cool or I don't know,

1973
02:05:25,381 --> 02:05:26,640
whatever.
It's,

1974
02:05:26,810 --> 02:05:31,380
it says something and then there it means
something as well where if you didn't

1975
02:05:31,381 --> 02:05:33,870
know what it means, you just don't know.
That's one layer you don't know about it.

1976
02:05:33,930 --> 02:05:36,090
You know,
this one has a couple of layers,

1977
02:05:36,091 --> 02:05:39,780
sometimes three just saying they're not
just normal shit and their quality as

1978
02:05:39,781 --> 02:05:41,730
well.
Just saying they're good anyway.

1979
02:05:42,030 --> 02:05:45,270
You can judge for yourself as
far as how they look. Jocko,

1980
02:05:45,271 --> 02:05:47,330
store.com if you'd like.
I'm good.

1981
02:05:47,350 --> 02:05:51,570
Get a shirt support that way
or a mug or sticker, whichever.

1982
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:55,710
All rash guard or rash guard.
Yes. So new things, rash guard.

1983
02:05:55,711 --> 02:05:59,880
If you didn't know already,
rash guards are good biking,

1984
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:02,940
diving, swimming, surfing,

1985
02:06:02,970 --> 02:06:07,920
bodyboarding across fit any kind of
Olympic lifting where you need mobility's,

1986
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:10,860
it's actually better than cotton
shirts. They like, you know what I mean?

1987
02:06:12,390 --> 02:06:13,223
And Do Jitsu.

1988
02:06:14,130 --> 02:06:19,130
Last but not least to Andy did good
and today Andy on his fight represent,

1989
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:23,610
yeah. It wasn't a super fighter.
A bracket by the way. Oh,

1990
02:06:23,611 --> 02:06:26,730
I thought it was [inaudible] decision.
He'll hook.

1991
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:30,270
Dang Andy representing and uh,
yeah,

1992
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:34,220
he did in fact have trooper Russia.
See what we were talking about the 17,

1993
02:06:34,221 --> 02:06:38,790
what was 17 to 19% improvement
in performance. Yeah.

1994
02:06:38,950 --> 02:06:42,690
And Wow,
it my bro science like opinion.

1995
02:06:42,750 --> 02:06:46,030
I think that applies to all
physical activity. When you
were this rash guard. I,

1996
02:06:46,100 --> 02:06:48,880
I'm, I'm a believer and for
those of you that don't know, uh,

1997
02:06:50,490 --> 02:06:54,600

in Bro Science, I'm working on it

1998
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:59,430
and I'm, okay. So the new
stuff, uh, also we have patches.

platoon chief or Charlie patoot Nunez

2015
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:05,040
or Trump, that's the guy was
running it and making it happen. Uh,

2021
02:08:25,541 --> 02:08:30,340
get in the weeds on the tactics
of how to actually employ them.

2022
02:08:30,580 --> 02:08:31,570
It's one thing to know on,

2023
02:08:31,571 --> 02:08:35,620
but you got to know how to employ them
on the battlefield, on the street,

2024
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:39,490
in the business world or in life.

And finally to Tony.

2044
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:08,200
Thanks again my brother
for coming on the show.

2045
02:10:08,410 --> 02:10:12,250
Thanks for the years you put in training,

Thanks for always being there
to support me no matter what.

2048
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:24,760
No matter what.
Yes sir.

2049
02:10:26,170 --> 02:10:29,230
Thanks for what you did for me
for the task unit, for the teams,

2050
02:10:29,620 --> 02:10:33,370
for the navy and for the
United States of America.

2051
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:35,151
And you know,

2052
02:10:35,151 --> 02:10:40,151
Tony is one of the many veterans from
every war who remains in the shadows who

2053
02:10:43,101 --> 02:10:44,690
seeks no glory,

2054
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:50,380
who did what he did as his duty
for country and for his brothers

2055
02:10:54,410 --> 02:10:56,990
on his left and now on his right.

2056
02:10:58,220 --> 02:11:01,880
So to all of you veterans like Tony,

2058
02:11:05,630 --> 02:11:10,630
thanks to you warriors who have set the
example of how to serve and of course,

2059
02:11:15,860 --> 02:11:17,060
how to get after it.

2060
02:11:17,170 --> 02:11:18,003
Yeah.

2061
02:11:19,570 --> 02:11:21,520
