[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:08.620
JOSH WOODWARD: All right.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.190
Hi, everyone.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.420
Thank you for coming.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.180
My name is Josh, and
I'm a product manager

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.450
on the Next Billion
Users team at Google.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.250
And we're really
glad you're here.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.830
We want to basically
use this session

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.440
to tell you a little bit about
what we've been learning,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.470
building for the next billion
in places like India, Indonesia,

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.860
Brazil, and other
countries around the world.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.680
Before we get started,
just maybe a show of hands,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.710
who's flown in
from India for I/O?

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.330
Oh, awesome.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.880
I know it's very late
right now for you all,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.830
so we'll try to keep you up.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.010
Anybody from
Indonesia who's here?

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.420
OK, a couple, cool.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.340
Brazil?

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.540
Great.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.190
And I'm sure there's a lot of
other countries represented

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.689
too.

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:52.510
So thank you all for coming.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.660
What I wanted to do just
quickly by way of intro,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.618
before we interview some
of the folks on stage,

00:00:56.618 --> 00:00:58.950
is tell you a
little bit about how

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.120
this initiative and this focus
area for Google got started.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.800
Since the beginning,
Google has always

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.650
been interested in building
products for everyone.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.800
And what we realized,
looking around the world,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.480
is literally a
billion new people

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.400
come online for the first time.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.980
That changes how we think
about some of the ways

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.814
we develop products.

00:01:17.814 --> 00:01:19.188
And really, this
session, we want

00:01:19.188 --> 00:01:20.880
to share some of those
lessons with you.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.129
Some of the things we've got
right, some of the things

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:25.082
we got wrong, too.

00:01:25.082 --> 00:01:27.540
One thing that's changed is
how we think about our existing

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.470
products.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.380
If you think about YouTube,
or Search, or Maps, or Chrome,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.680
or any of the others.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.350
What we found is
a whole new crop

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.320
of user behaviors that are
becoming really common in

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.220
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.660
For example, today in India,
28% of the searches we see

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.610
are voice searches,
which is amazing.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.180
And it's growing, voice
is growing everywhere

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.087
around the world.

00:01:49.087 --> 00:01:50.670
Brings up really
interesting questions

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.220
about how you interact
with computing devices,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.110
localization, and others.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.410
We've also seen in Google
Maps, for example, our new Two

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.940
Wheeler mode feature.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.517
Really popular, and spreading
to other markets too.

00:02:02.517 --> 00:02:04.350
There's new modalities
we're having to solve

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.780
for transportation directions.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.360
That's a little bit about
how we've started thinking

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.470
about our existing products.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.240
But obviously, as smartphone
prices drop around the world,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.680
as connectivity becomes
more affordable,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.970
more people come online, and
it opens up brand new use cases

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.399
and problems to solve.

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:24.690
And that's really what our
three panelists up here have

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.010
been doing the last few years.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.620
So they're going to talk to
you a little bit about some

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.720
of the products we've
launched over the last six

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.870
to eight months, and a lot of
what's kind of gone into them,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.960
both from the engineering
side as well as the design

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.640
and research side.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.044
So what I'll do is just
introduce them briefly,

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:42.960
and then we'll get into
some of the questions.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.540
And at the very end, we've
got two mics in the room.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.998
If people want to come up,
we'll save some time at the end,

00:02:47.998 --> 00:02:49.300
you can ask a few questions.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.630
So first, just quick
intros down the row.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.660
I want to introduce
[? Pankesh. ?] [? Pankesh ?]

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.580
leads engineering
for Google Tez.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.130
Tez is our payments app in
India that we launched back

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.180
in September.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.650
And there's a whole
lot of stories

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.440
he can share about that
in just a few minutes.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.710
Up next, we have [? Davesh. ?]
[? Davesh ?] leads our Files Go

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.640
engineering team.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.760
Files Go is an app we
launched late last year, that

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.370
helps users free up
space on their phone,

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.650
find files really fast,
and also share files

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.440
offline when you're
nearby people.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.940
So some very
interesting engineering

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.270
that went into that product.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.561
And then finally, we have
[? Nithya. ?] [? Nithya ?] is

00:03:24.561 --> 00:03:26.310
on our research and design team.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.710
And she's worked on I think,
every product at this point

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.769
in some form or fashion.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.310
She's going to share
a lot of lessons

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.100
we've learned doing
research, both in the field,

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.380
but also we have a
lot of local teams

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.330
based around the
world that build

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.310
a lot of these products for us.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.650
Our kind of group, the
Next Billion Users group,

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.170
really thinks about how do we
staff people in these markets

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.920
so we can really watch these
trends as they're emerging.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.080
We also give a lot
of these small teams

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.350
a lot of latitude to go
after big repeating problems.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.809
We're an experimental group
trying out a lot of new things.

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.016
And of course, the three of
them will talk about some

00:04:00.016 --> 00:04:01.500
of the products we've launched.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.666
Without further ado, let's
start with [? Pankesh. ?]

00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:06.580
[? Pankesh, ?] maybe just give
us an overview of what Tez is,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.800
and we'll start there.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.841
[? PANKESH: ?] Yes, sure.

00:04:08.841 --> 00:04:11.610
Tez is mobile payments
app for India.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.030
And the word Tez
itself means fast

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.649
in Hindi and some other
regional languages.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:20.120
It's built on top of a new
inter-banking protocol.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.710
It's a real-time protocol
that was introduced

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.540
in India called up UPI.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.270
That stands for Universal
Payments Interface.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.210
And almost all Indian banks
have implemented this.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.950
It's 24/7, instant bank-to-bank
money transfer protocol.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.730
And what Tez does is it puts
a brand-new, very fresh user

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.460
experience on a variety
of payment use cases,

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.030
on top of this protocol.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.860
So a Tez user links
their bank account

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.970
with their Google account,
and UPI gives them

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.190
a payment address, which
is called a virtual payment

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.410
address.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.720
Per the protocol, this payment
address is inter-operable,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.050
so any service or
product that is using UPI

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.080
has to support this destination
addressing mechanism.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.090
And the neat thing is
that any payments that

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.020
are done from this address
or into this address

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.050
are done from the bank account,
or into the bank account

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.340
directly.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.470
It's different than
a digital wallet.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.720
And you don't have to load
up a digital wallet first

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.650
from your bank account, and
then transact from that wallet.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.200
The other neat thing is
that the council, which

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.240
maintains and runs
this protocol,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.710
has made these
transactions free of cost.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.140
There's a big push by the
government towards digitization

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.810
of payments.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.510
And so effectively, what
you have is instant,

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.070
24/7, free, kind of
like a wiring ability.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.150
Literally at your fingertips
on your smartphone.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.650
Why don't I show a demo
of some of these features?

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.540
OK.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.040
Well, we were having some Wi-Fi
issues earlier, as they usually

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.330
do with the demo.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.530
I have two phones here, if
I could get the volt vision.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.790
OK.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.260
So this volt vision
one is my phone,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.550
and I'm going to get into Tez.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.660
It uses the OS lock,
so we will get here.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.720
I'll do the same on--

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.630
sorry about the orientation--

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.350
we will do this also on
the phone on the left here.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.510
I will launch the Tez app--

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.450
again, use the OS
lock to open it.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.170
And now, we have
these two phones.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:46.590
And what you see right up
front is a circular button.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.850
And let me explain this.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.570
We call these cash
more payments.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:54.150
So imagine that a
user has this phone,

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.770
and they walk into a shop.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.960
And there's a merchant
behind the counter

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.450
who has their own phone.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.530
And so basically, two
phones are nearby--

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.640
and one of my phones is working
on India international roaming,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.100
so I hope that it works.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:15.510
But basically-- let's put
this into the receive mode,

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.240
and let's put it
into the pay mode,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.480
and see if the phone
discovers the other phone.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.480
So what should happen--
if WiFi was working--

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.910
was that one phone would be
discovered by the other phone.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:33.616
Let's see.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.920
Boom.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.560
So as you can see,
the phone on the left

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.270
has discovered the phone on
the right, which is my phone.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.720
So the user can tap to pay.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.960
And let's say I'm
buying some chai, which

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.265
costs a lot these days.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.200
I can put in a message,
I can proceed to pay.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.940
UPI mandates that
every transaction

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.830
is protected by a PIN.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:16.512
And for purposes of this demo
it will go through the bank's--

00:08:16.512 --> 00:08:19.140
the destination and the
receiver bank, and voila.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.900
And we're trying something
out when you get this.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.310
So that's how these
nearby payments work.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:31.470
What you can also see now, just
focusing on the Chromecast,

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.990
the phone on the left.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.520
You see these chat heads.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.850
And essentially, these
are profile pictures

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.710
of the payment peers.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.919
I can tap on someone--

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.580
let's say, this person--

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.900
and it will give me the
entire history of the payment

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.350
transactions that have happened
between me and this person.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.820
So that's really convenient.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.550
Now if you go down
further, you see

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.660
a section called Businesses.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.410
And that has providers,
like my phone provider,

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.000
my internet provider.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.396
And we recently integrated bill
payments on top of UPI as well.

00:09:06.396 --> 00:09:07.895
So every month, I
get a notification

00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:09.270
that hey, your bill is due.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.150
I tap it and it's
done in an instant.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.830
Likewise, you can check balance
and other such things as well.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.857
So that's kind of like a
quick overview of the app.

00:09:19.857 --> 00:09:20.690
JOSH WOODWARD: Nice.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.940
[? Pankesh, ?] can you tell
everyone a little bit more

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.350
about the cash mode, and
how you guys built that?

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:29.700
A little bit of the
back story there?

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.070
[? PANKESH: ?] So it started
with some user insights.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.850
And the key user insight
comes from the fact

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:40.040
that paying by cash is still
quite widespread in India

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.390
and other [? MBU ?] markets.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.500
And you know if you think
about it, paying by cash

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.970
has its benefits.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.609
It's like pseudo
private, anonymous,

00:09:49.609 --> 00:09:50.900
and it's just plain convenient.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.130
So when we wanted to do a
digital mode of payment,

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.620
we want it to have an
experience which is kind

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.460
of like cash in many senses.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.200
That's why we call it cash mode.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.834
And how it works is--

00:10:04.834 --> 00:10:06.500
actually, there are
various ways to make

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.750
these nearby or
proximity payments work.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:13.130
And like in the US, and various
parts of the world, generally

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.660
NFC has been the way to go.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.410
But phones in India, most
of them don't have NFC.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.860
So now you can use Wi-Fi, you
can use Bluetooth for pairing.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.440
Essentially, you're trying to
make two phones who have never

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.750
seen each other ever, don't
want to exchange explicitly

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.710
some addressing information,
to be connected to each other.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.750
So what we do is we
transmit information

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.600
for pairing on audio.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.900
Actually using ultrasound.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.940
Let me go into a
little bit more detail.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.410
What happens is, one
phone sends a short ID.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.780
It broadcasts a short ID,
identifying itself saying hey,

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.690
this is me, this is me.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.570
And this idea is
broadcast using what's

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:01.580
called DSSS, or Direct
Sequence Spread Spectrum.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.160
And it's a spread
spectrum technique.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.640
What it is doing is it's
multiplying the data signal

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.010
by pseudo random noise
spreading signal.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.910
And so what actually
happens is that on audio,

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.700
on an inaudible frequency--
nobody can hear it from a user

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.960
experience point of view,
that's very important--

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.020
what's been transported
is white noise

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.030
because of this pseudo
random noise spreading.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.530
And it's very
important for security

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.020
because then a snooper can
get access to the signal,

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.730
but not make sense out of it.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.580
However, the receiver
can use the same--

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.800
and multiply with
the signal that it

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.280
gets-- with the same
pseudo random noise code,

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.780
and recover the signal.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.780
So the receiver recovers
the ID, validates the ID,

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.270
and then does a sober look
up to figure it out, OK,

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.490
who does this ID belong to?

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.920
And the server sends
back more information,

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.410
which is relayed to
the receiving phone.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.050
Just like the other
phone got, OK, you're

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.490
paying to [? Pankesh, ?]
and so tap.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:57.950
That's the user confirmation.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.860
So that's how it works.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.940
I think it's been great
for us as you can imagine,

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.720
that there's lots of challenges
in making this work in terms

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.100
of tuning and configurations.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.750
There's receiver configuration,
broadcaster configuration,

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.820
there's various audio settings.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.150
To kind of give you some
statistics about this,

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.580
when we launched-- and Tez
launched in India in September

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.600
last year--

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.060
we tested about 200 devices
and hand-tuned them in our lab.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:32.810
And since then, we have
evolved this process of tuning,

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.550
and now it's a control
system, like feedback loop,

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.850
in which we just
adjust automatically

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.440
the parameters in the field.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.060
And observe how that goes.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.320
And to date, we have
nearly 6,000 unique devices

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.420
who have made a
successful cash mode

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:52.430
transaction, of which manually,
we only configured 200.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:55.220
So I think it was
extremely important to us

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.750
that we get the coverage that
we eventually ended up getting.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:03.205
And that's why we chose
audio, over say, NFC.

00:13:03.205 --> 00:13:04.580
JOSH WOODWARD:
Interesting, nice.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.500
Maybe one last question for you.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.270
Briefly, can you
share a little bit

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.650
about what you've
learned working

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:13.100
with a new app, a new
protocol, and UPI,

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.460
a lot of external partners?

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.770
And I think there's a
war story here, maybe?

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.800
PANKESH: This protocol is very
new, and a lot of the banks--

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.360
and we have the largest banks
in India as our partners,

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.370
and they were implementing
it new as well.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.210
So we literally broke
the bank when we

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.617
launched, with such a high QPS.

00:13:32.617 --> 00:13:34.700
But you know, when you're
building any distributed

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.530
system, whether
it's your components

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.490
or external
components, then you've

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.170
got some health monitoring
and various other kind

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.840
of high availability things.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.360
So what we do is a
couple of things,

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.690
just to give a
quick example each.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.630
User account creation time, when
this address has been created--

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:58.460
if one bank is down, then we
will go to the other bank.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.220
At the payment time,
however, you're

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.970
transferring from one Bank A
to Bank B. And what's important

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:09.260
is to not have the user in
what's called a stuck state.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.190
For that what we do is we build
ML predictive models to figure

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.440
out whether any of the
banks-- there's actually

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.680
five parties in a transaction,
the way the protocol defines

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.620
it-- and any of them, if
it is down, or almost done,

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.300
then we would rather bring
it up with the user, and say,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.590
hey, please try again.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.900
Rather than having the
risk of the transaction

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.830
kind of entering in a little bit
of a stuck state, where nobody

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.950
knows where the money has gone.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:33.860
JOSH WOODWARD: Nice.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:34.360
Great.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.280
Thank you for sharing.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.280
[? Davesh, ?] I want to
shift gears a little bit

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.930
and talk about Files Go.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.480
And maybe you can tell us
just briefly what it is.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.250
I think you'll want to
show us about it too.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.200
[? DAVESH: ?] Files Go is a
file and storage management app

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.810
built for [? MBU ?] markets
for mobile first users.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.160
It also supports
peer-to-peer sharing

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.390
using nearby technology.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.350
It doesn't use the internet.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.420
The way it all
started, we started

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.930
looking at what the users
in [? MBU ?] markets needed.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.540
And we realized first off that
mobile data in these markets

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.370
were very expensive.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.270
And what that meant was,
users in these markets

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.110
were not able to consume
content on their phones, which

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.940
was a primary or
only device for them.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.420
Most of the time
because of the expense.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.680
That's where the idea for
nearby sharing was born.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.310
Then as we were
researching more,

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.470
we realized that
once users got access

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:34.340
to more content which they
could get from their friends,

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.900
a lot of these phones have
very little internal storage.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.020
So users started
running out of storage

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.350
when they got content
from their friends.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.500
Because of that, we started
looking at storage management.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.150
The other problem
that we saw was

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.690
users were not able to find
the content on their phone

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.880
easily, because most
of the existing file

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:58.340
managers out there show a
folder [INAUDIBLE] view, which

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.250
is complicated for new
users who are coming

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.220
to the mobile first time, have
never used a laptop or desktop

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.936
computer before.

00:16:05.936 --> 00:16:08.060
So we decided to build
something that would be easy

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.190
for them to use, would
allow them to keep

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.800
their phones clean, and
allow them to get content

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.327
from their friends.

00:16:15.327 --> 00:16:16.160
JOSH WOODWARD: Cool.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.510
You want to show it?

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.770
[? DAVESH: ?] Let me show it.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.120
JOSH WOODWARD: One thing while
he's pulling up the demo--

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.970
I remember when this team
came back from field research.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:26.780
They spent a lot of time on
college campuses across India.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.500
And we found a stat
which was shocking--

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.990
one out of three
smartphone users in India

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.849
run out of storage, or see a
low storage warning, every day.

00:16:36.849 --> 00:16:38.390
So if you think
about that, something

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.030
like 80 million people
are constantly up

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.487
against the boundary of
running out of storage.

00:16:43.487 --> 00:16:45.320
Anyway, we'll switch
over to the Wolf Vision

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.600
and you can show how it works.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.250
[? DAVESH: ?] Is the
phone showing up?

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:49.041
JOSH WOODWARD: Yup.

00:16:53.334 --> 00:16:55.000
[? DAVESH: ?] So this
is a Files Go app.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.570
First stop, right
on top, we show

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.570
the storage available
on the phone

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.650
and what's the total storage.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.410
The cards that you see here
are personalized additions

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.790
for the users on what they
can clean up from the phone,

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.319
to free up storage.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.910
Let's go and take a look
at the large files card.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.440
These are all the large
files on the phone.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.369
Typically these are
videos that users shoot,

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:21.200
or the kind they get from their
friends, like movies and stuff.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.280
So with one click
delete, you can just

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.310
get it off this user card
back to 180 MB of data.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.000
Let's take a look at files.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.440
So one thing that
we saw was users

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.360
had a tough time trying to find
the content on their phone.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.540
We came up with the scheme of
categorizing the content based

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:45.940
on how it was acquired or how it
was associated in users' minds.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.650
For example, images.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:50.890
We don't show a folder view.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:54.170
You can see all images here,
and then the other tabs

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:59.140
show where the users think
the images came from.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.920
Similarly for videos.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.920
Again, it's
categorized in groups

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.370
that users can identify with.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.490
Right down here, you see two
buttons for send and receive.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.580
This is where users can
initiate the nearby sharing

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:18.130
mode to transfer content
to or from their friends.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.620
Interesting thing-- just like
[? Pankesh ?] talked about,

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.297
doing a nearby connection
sounds simplistic enough,

00:18:25.297 --> 00:18:27.130
but there's a bunch of
stuff involved there.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.990
Because there's a
wide variety of phones

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:30.610
out there in the market.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.630
We use a combination of
Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:39.670
Energy, Wi-Fi direct, Wi-Fi
hotspot type of technologies.

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.650
And based on the
two phones, we are

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:46.600
able to connect on Bluetooth and
negotiate their capabilities,

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.410
and create the fastest
connection possible.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:52.300
For example, if the two phones
both support 5 GHz band,

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.430
then we can connect
on 5 GHz, which

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:57.130
will result in a file
transfer rate of a GB

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:00.040
around 40 seconds, which
is pretty impressive.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.540
Which wouldn't have
happened if we'd

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.400
gone on the path of
just using Wi-Fi, which

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.350
is sort of the default path.

00:19:10.809 --> 00:19:12.600
The other thing that
I wanted to talk about

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.350
was the low-resolution
and memes.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.920
So one thing that we
noticed in our user research

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.370
again was that users
in these markets

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:26.100
used chat apps quite a bit, and
they receive a ton of content

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.600
from their friends.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.247
Most of which is good morning
messages, memes, jokes,

00:19:30.247 --> 00:19:32.580
which they don't want to
really keep because it fills up

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.170
their phone.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.910
At the same time,
they also receive

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.370
content from their friends
which they want to keep,

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:42.000
which might be pictures of each
other that they took on a trip

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.160
together.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.790
Which meant users were going
through going through all

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.720
these chat messages and
deleting stuff manually

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.720
by figuring out what was
useful and what was not.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.720
We decided to try
to tackle this,

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.430
and we came up with
this card that--

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.730
internally we use Google
Vision API, Vision Library,

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.740
to do text detection.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:09.180
And then add heuristics to that
to detect memes or images that

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.150
are not useful for the user
which they view only once.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:17.060
And these are some of the
things that get detected.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:21.360
And the user can use one
click again to delete it,

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.632
and they can keep the rest of
their useful messages in tact

00:20:24.632 --> 00:20:26.340
without having to go
through it manually.

00:20:29.237 --> 00:20:30.070
JOSH WOODWARD: Cool.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.110
One thing also-- just
to call out from this

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.810
that the team has seeing--
is that the average user,

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.140
the first time they use
the app, is freeing up

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.700
over a gig of storage.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.990
And so that little bubble
boy is dancing a lot when

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:46.120
storage space is freeing up.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.600
It's become a really
interesting daily

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.439
and weekly habit
people have gone into.

00:20:51.439 --> 00:20:53.980
Maybe one last question for you,
[? Davesh, ?] before we move

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.937
on [? to Nithya. ?] Can you tell
us a little bit about what you

00:20:56.937 --> 00:20:58.270
feel like you've learned so far?

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.320
This app has only been
out about four months.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.967
It launched at the
end of last year.

00:21:02.967 --> 00:21:05.050
[? DAVESH: ?] There's a
bunch of stuff we learned.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.170
The most interesting
for me was the fact

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.630
that this app is getting used
a whole lot in US and Europe,

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.460
which we did not expect
when we launched it.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.740
I recently read a book
by Vijay Govindarajan

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.190
called "Reverse
Innovation," which

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.190
talks a lot about building
products specifically

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.260
for these markets,
which you can then

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:29.620
bring back and [INAUDIBLE]
other markets which you did not

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:30.740
build the product for.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.730
And we are seeing
something similar

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.880
for Files Go, which
is very fulfilling.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.390
JOSH WOODWARD: Nice.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.424
I guess, Nithya, you
can take us home here

00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:41.590
with the last set of
questions, before we open it up

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.030
to everyone.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.580
Talk to us a little bit about
some of the thematic work

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.090
you've done, around
connectivity and access

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.660
with your sort of research
and design experience.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.160
[? NITHYA: ?] So
as part of Google's

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.730
mission of bringing the benefits
of the internet to everyone,

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.220
there are two main products.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.660
There's Google Station, which
provides high quality internet

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.110
access in the form of
public Wi-Fi and Datally,

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.830
which is a mobile application,
which helps users get

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.560
more value out of their data.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.546
So I'll talk about
Station first.

00:22:16.546 --> 00:22:22.010
Station was launched in 2016,
and is now in India, Indonesia,

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.550
and Mexico, in
hundreds of hotspots

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:29.620
like train stations, parks,
malls, and public venues.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:34.030
Thousands of users, people
come online for the first time

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.820
on the station network.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:40.930
Datally really helps make the
existing constrained internet

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:43.160
more manageable and accessible.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.880
So it provides
data transparency,

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.190
so that users can
understand where

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:52.090
their MBs and GBs are going
in their browsing activities.

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:54.430
It provides data
saving functionality,

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:59.080
which helps users get more
value, extend their data packs.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.860
And it also alerts users
to public Wi-Fi hotspots

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:07.030
when they're outside, so users
can be online more often.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.920
And the underlying
insight for Datally

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.190
is that many people
around the world

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.750
treat mobile data as money.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:17.690
Because it is expensive,
slow, and limited.

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:21.400
And as a result, users
resort to practices

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.800
like turning off mobile
data when they're not

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.060
using it to cut costs.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.090
Or hesitate to get
new applications,

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:31.000
or have fears around using
existing applications.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.090
So that limits their
participation online.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.330
And Datally provides
functionality to help

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.300
users ease into their
experience of getting

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.354
more value from the internet.

00:23:42.354 --> 00:23:44.020
JOSH WOODWARD: Can
you talk a little bit

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.330
about what we've learned
with these products,

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.610
now that they've been out,
and sort of the environment

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:51.130
that they've landed in?

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.600
[? PANKESH: ?] I can go
on for long about this,

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.960
but to simplify things--

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.470
there's people,
context, and devices.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:03.280
So with regards to people,
as internet access is

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.720
growing all over the
world, technology

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.250
is touching new societies.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.830
And a lot of the people
that are coming online

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.570
are increasingly diverse.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:17.770
So there's diverse literacies,
languages, aspirations,

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:21.940
income levels, professions,
geographic spread.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.330
And many of the
assumptions that we've

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:28.630
made around the first few
billion users need rethinking.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:31.030
So for example, it
may not hold true

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:36.040
that users are well educated,
or relatively wealthy,

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.050
or English-speaking, even.

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:41.830
Many people around
the next billion users

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.860
are not necessarily
English-speaking primarily,

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.580
but may prefer to use phone
UIs in English, because English

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:53.080
is seen as a language of
upward mobility and aspiration.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.210
So in terms of
design, how might we

00:24:55.210 --> 00:25:00.550
design interfaces
that help users

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.970
with the use of simplified
English and more visually rich

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:05.140
interfaces.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.170
With regards to context,
like I mentioned,

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:12.160
internet is often
intermittent and constrained.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.480
Roughly only 43% of the
world has access to LTE.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:21.130
So users are often on 2G and
3G, and sometimes even offline.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:22.660
So how do we think
about designing

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.490
for these constrained networks?

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:29.760
And treating offline as not an
error case, but as a normative

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.440
use case.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.356
We also have to think
about economic factors,

00:25:33.356 --> 00:25:35.730
like purchasing power, and,
like [? Pankesh ?] mentioned,

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:41.790
the prevalence of cash, and
social factors like gender

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:45.240
and the role of religion
in using technology.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.490
And then finally with
regards to devices.

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:51.510
Today, you can buy an
Android phone for $30 to $40.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.870
It is very likely to have
a small screen, low RAM,

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:59.220
low processing power, but it
is the first computing device

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.920
that many people have access to.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.810
And many of these
devices don't get

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:07.740
replaced as often as they
might here in the West,

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.560
because of cultures of
frugality and gift giving.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.830
So how might we think about
hardware and software design

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:16.685
for low-end devices?

00:26:16.685 --> 00:26:18.310
JOSH WOODWARD: Maybe
one last question,

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.920
because I'm sure we've
got a range of folks

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.253
from different backgrounds here.

00:26:21.253 --> 00:26:24.120
But on sort of
wearing your UX hat,

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.160
if you had to pass
along some research

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.080
and design tips
and tricks you've

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.210
learned along the way
over the last few years,

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.970
what would you
share with everyone?

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.700
[? NITHYA: ?] First I'll
alert you to our collection

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:40.580
of research and design
methods on design.google/nbu.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.740
You can find it--

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.770
it's part of the
Google Design web site.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:48.030
And we regularly share new
design and research methods,

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:52.690
as well as product stories,
in the behind the scenes look.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:54.760
With regards to research
and design innovations,

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.050
I'll talk about it through the
lens of a product lifecycle.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.429
When we start to
build a product,

00:26:59.429 --> 00:27:01.470
and we're trying to
understand the problem space,

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.380
and we want to create a
vision for the product--

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.520
we really want a
foundation of rich insights

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.720
and understanding of
people and the relationship

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.060
with technology and
the unmet needs.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.920
So here we've introduced
techniques like intercepts,

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.820
and the more traditional
ethnographic immersion.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.540
Intercepts are spot
interviews that

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.360
are done with people
in various contexts,

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.900
such as where they live, where
they commute, where they work,

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.900
where they have fun.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.770
And by doing several of these
we gather a firm understanding

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:39.190
of people in that context
and their use of technology.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:43.320
In Station, when we wanted
to build a Wi-Fi service

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.250
in train stations of India, we
spent a lot of time hanging out

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:48.210
in train stations.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:51.390
Talking to passengers,
talking to business owners,

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.610
riding trains ourselves
so we could understand

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.260
what that experience was like.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.420
And shadowing
passengers who were

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.250
embarking on these journeys.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.170
And really what we
wanted to understand

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.450
was who is in the station.

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:04.590
What are they doing?

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.050
What is the context
of using the Wi-Fi?

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:09.360
What is their
understanding of Wi-Fi?

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.240
And these insights led
up to design principles,

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.700
such as the service.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.830
The login service to
get onto the network

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.530
has to be really efficient
and quick because stations

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:23.370
are high-stress environments,
with a lot of stimulus.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.890
The service has to be
trustworthy and secure.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:27.720
We saw in our
research that women

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.380
were hesitant to give out
phone numbers to log on

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.310
to a public Wi-Fi
network, so we really

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.160
ensured that the
network was secure.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.000
And that because of the
heterogeneity of devices

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.680
in a train station--

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.140
this is really the cross-section
of the entire country--

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.800
the service was browser-based.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.930
It works as a
captive portal model,

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.550
and doesn't require
the installation

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:54.660
of any mobile application.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.450
An example of research
and design techniques

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.270
later on in product
development is when

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.950
the product is nearing launch.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.980
We've created a technique
called Trusted Testers Studies.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:10.080
These are large panels of
representative participants

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.600
who are recruited
to consensually make

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.570
use of the application
and provide feedbacks.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:19.830
And we collect qualitative
and quantitative data.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.680
We ran several of these
trusted testers studies

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.200
for Datally in various
parts of the Philippines,

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.440
where we had hundreds of
participants using Datally

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.000
for three to four months.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.090
That gave us a really
firm understanding of,

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:34.560
what are the core use cases?

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.894
What's the resident
value proposition?

00:29:36.894 --> 00:29:38.310
What are issues
that we're running

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.140
into that we need
to fix, before we

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.684
launch the product in mock-in?

00:29:41.684 --> 00:29:42.850
JOSH WOODWARD: That's great.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:43.360
Cool.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:43.860
That's it.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.580
Thank you all!

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:45.270
- Thank you.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.110
- Thanks.

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:50.550
