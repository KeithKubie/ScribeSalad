00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.240
In this video, we're going to
explore our linear optimization

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.710
model further.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.050
We're going to use it to
answer some "what if" questions

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.930
and to conduct some
sensitivity analysis.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.690
So here, we have
a spreadsheet that

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.890
is formatted very similarly
to the spreadsheets

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.460
that we've used in
Video 5 and Video 6.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.840
So we have the data up here,
we have the price-per-click,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.160
the click-through-rate, the
average price per display,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.640
the budgets, the
query estimates.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.310
Below those, we
have the variables.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.730
So we have the
cells corresponding

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.110
to the decision variables.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.410
We have the cell corresponding
to the objective.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.130
And to the right
of these, we have

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.670
cells that contain the values
of the decision variables

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.810
and a cell that contains
the value of the revenue

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.920
from our original
solution from Video 5.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.470
So what we're going to do is,
we're going to change our data,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.490
and we're going to see
how the solution changes

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.170
and how the objective value
changes and compare it

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.130
to our original solution.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.150
So as one of the questions
that we might consider, let's

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.080
consider the following question.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.390
What would happen if the
click-through-rate of AT&amp;T with

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.100
query one increased
from 0.10 to 0.5?

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.850
So to answer this
question, let's crawl up

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.720
in the spreadsheet until we
hit the click-through-rate.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.350
And let's change the
click-through-rate

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.960
from 0.1 to 0.5.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.870
Now, if we do this,
you may have noticed

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.000
that the average price per
display for AT&amp;T in query one

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
also changed.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.470
So of course, this makes sense,
because the average price

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.760
per display is just the
click-through-rate multiplied

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.210
by the price-per-click.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.979
And here, the way we've
set up the spreadsheet

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.410
is so that these
cells are exactly

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.490
the product of the
corresponding cells.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.920
So the cells that correspond
to the click-through-rate

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.140
and the price-per-click for that
respective query and advertiser

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.759
combination.

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.500
So our average price per display
has changed appropriately.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.960
And so now, we just scroll
down until we see our variables

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.820
and we see our objective.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.280
And let's click on Tools.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.370
Let's open up the Solver.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.900
And we have the Solver
configured the exact same way

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.530
from last time.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.530
So we don't need to
do anything here.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.250
And so now, all we
have to do is just

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.150
hit Solve and click on
Keep Result, and voila.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.290
We have a new solution.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.540
So now, several things have
changed with the solution,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.390
if you can see.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.980
So the first thing is that
the allocations have changed.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.970
So for instance, we allocate
query one and AT&amp;T 68 times.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.950
So we decide to show AT&amp;T's
ad with query one 68 times,

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.700
as opposed to the
original solution, where

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.630
we did it 40 times.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.829
And we can also see that AT&amp;T
is never shown in query two

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.040
or query three in
our new solution,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.030
whereas before, it was shown
40 times for query two and 80

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.550
times for query three.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.980
Similarly, we show T-Mobile
72 times with query one,

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.720
whereas before, we only
showed it 100 times.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.100
And we also showed
T-Mobile with query three

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.600
14 times, whereas
before, we didn't show it

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.300
at all with query three.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.750
And Verizon's allocations
say the same as before.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.800
In terms of the
revenue, our revenue

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.750
has gone up slightly from
$428 in the original solution

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.890
to $430 in the new solution.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.220
Now, this may seem
like a small amount.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.660
But actually, this is the most
that we can hope to achieve.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.770
And the reason for this
is, if we scroll down,

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.860
if we look at our budgets,
so the budget for AT&amp;T

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.280
is 170, for T-Mobile, 100,
and for Verizon, it's 160.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.340
If we add up these
values, you can

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.430
see that actually the sum
of these values is 430.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.220
Now, this isn't a coincidence.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.240
In fact, if you
think about it, this

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.650
makes sense, because what Google
earns from each advertiser

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.440
is exactly how much
that advertiser spends.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.850
And if the most that
each advertiser spends

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.710
is that advertiser's
budget, then the most

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.000
that Google could hope
to earn is in fact

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.600
the sum of these budgets.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.850
So in fact, we are attaining
the highest possible revenue

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.540
that we can hope to
attain in this case.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.480
So that was rather interesting.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.330
And now, let's change back
the click-through-rate

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.860
from 0.5 back to the
original value of 0.1.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.860
And let's answer
another question.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.620
So the question that
we'd now like to answer

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.910
is, what would happen if
AT&amp;T's budget increased

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.290
from 170 to 200?

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.820
So for example, AT&amp;T calls us
and tells us that actually they

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.040
can afford more advertisements.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.130
So how would that
change our solution?

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.740
Well, in this case, let's
just find AT&amp;T's budget data.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.260
So in this case, it
is the cell here.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.290
And let's change
it from 170 to 200.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.450
Now, let's scroll down to our
variables and our objective.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.500
And let's just set
them back to zero.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.700
And now, let's go to
Tools again, let's open up

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.460
the Solver, and let's hit Solve.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.270
We get 428, which is
actually the same objective

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.810
that we got from before.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.510
And let's just
click on Keep Result

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.790
and take a look at the solution.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.170
Now, interestingly,
this new solution

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.590
is actually exactly the
same as the old solution.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.790
So what happened here?

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.640
Why didn't this change anything?

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.930
Well, actually, if you recall
from the previous solution,

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.600
in the previous
solution, we actually

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.210
only used $168 of AT&amp;T's budget.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.820
And in the previous solution,
AT&amp;T's budget was $170.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.120
So in the previous
solution, we didn't actually

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.740
use up all of AT&amp;T's budget.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.980
And since this constraint
was not binding,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.620
then increasing this
constraint beyond 170--

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.100
so increasing the
budget from 170 to 200--

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.290
won't actually have an
effect on the solution.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.170
So this is why the
solution didn't change.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.970
And in fact, in this
case, we didn't really

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.610
need to change the data and
to solve the problem again,

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.390
we could've deduced
this from actually

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.110
looking at the budget values.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.260
So these are examples
of two questions

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.000
that we might consider
in this setting.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.550
And so this concludes
our exploration

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.190
of this problem in LibreOffice.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.000
In the next video, we'll
return to the slides,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.460
and we'll discuss
some ways that we

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.310
can extend the problem
beyond the formulation

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.220
that we've been
thinking about here.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.080
And we'll also summarize
what we've discussed so far.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.660
So see you in PowerPoint.
