So this happened to me in my last year of graduate school, when I was trying to

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.340
give a neuroscience presentation on an article I read. I knew the article

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.460
really well, but I hadn't slept at all the night before the presentation, I was

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.220
really stressed out with work and school, so I just wasn't thinking straight.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.780
And I get up there, I'm halfway through, then I just completely blank. I have

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.264
no idea what I'm talking about, I have to consult my notes. It was kind of

00:00:20.264 --> 00:00:23.452
embarrassing, but I got through it. Luckily my classmates were pretty nice

00:00:23.452 --> 00:00:26.270
about it, so don't feel alone if this has happened to you.
