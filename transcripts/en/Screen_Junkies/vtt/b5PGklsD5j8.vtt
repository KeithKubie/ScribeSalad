00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.769
It's the Sam cuz if this series ends up with Jacob blowing up the Ministry of Magic with a sharpie, I'm gonna be very upset

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.580
All your favorite characters from the first fantastic beasts are back like Newt Scamander

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.099

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.019
Don't say that master face maker Jacob. Who's

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.609
still making those faces and the dreamy Queenie who heroically

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.059
Hypnotizes and kidnaps her boyfriend. I'm curious when you were gonna wake me up after we had five kids, huh?

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.610
Well, at least she didn't join forces with wizard Hitler

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.750
But don't worry about anyone that the first movie established as the main characters of the series

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.989
Because this one spends most of its time with characters

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.530
You've never met or cared about

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.089

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.240
What?

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.980

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.540

Auditoriums and while overlooking mountains at a very swanky ski lodge all to unveil his master plan

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:55.329
To prevent World War two a power lust how long will it take before they're turning their weapons on us?

Wait, what so what you're saying? Is that wizard Hitler make some good points

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.760
P-one. Oh boy. Is there a Hogwarts Express off this franchisor?

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.170

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.749
Fantastically depressing and start hoping for a chosen one to show up and save this franchise
