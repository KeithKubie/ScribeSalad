00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.350
 
so here's a cool psychological study so

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360
so here's a cool psychological study so
 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.420
so here's a cool psychological study so
it's called the marshmallow test and

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430
it's called the marshmallow test and
 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.839
it's called the marshmallow test and
maybe it's even a reliable study even

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849
maybe it's even a reliable study even
 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:09.919
maybe it's even a reliable study even
though it was done by social

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929
though it was done by social
 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.850
though it was done by social
psychologists it's probably replicable

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860
psychologists it's probably replicable
 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.849
psychologists it's probably replicable
and it's a nice study so you take small

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859
and it's a nice study so you take small
 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.029
and it's a nice study so you take small
children and you bring them into a room

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039
children and you bring them into a room
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.189
children and you bring them into a room
and you put something that they would

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199
and you put something that they would
 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.609
and you put something that they would
like in front of them a marshmallow and

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619
like in front of them a marshmallow and
 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.830
like in front of them a marshmallow and
you then you torture them basically you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840
you then you torture them basically you
 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.410
you then you torture them basically you
say see that marshmallow and the kid

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420
say see that marshmallow and the kid
 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.600
say see that marshmallow and the kid
thinks yeah I see that marshmallow

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610
thinks yeah I see that marshmallow
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.510
thinks yeah I see that marshmallow
it's like you can have that marshmallow

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
it's like you can have that marshmallow
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.380
it's like you can have that marshmallow
right now or if you wait I think the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
right now or if you wait I think the
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.990
right now or if you wait I think the
experiment is ten minutes then you can

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
experiment is ten minutes then you can
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.479
experiment is ten minutes then you can
have two marshmallows and so that puts

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
have two marshmallows and so that puts
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.209
have two marshmallows and so that puts
the child in quite a conundrum because

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219
the child in quite a conundrum because
 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.190
the child in quite a conundrum because
they're being asked to trade an actual

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200
they're being asked to trade an actual
 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.549
they're being asked to trade an actual
concrete tangible marshmallow for two

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
concrete tangible marshmallow for two
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.150
concrete tangible marshmallow for two
hypothetical future marshmallows and

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160
hypothetical future marshmallows and
 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.740
hypothetical future marshmallows and
it's not that easy to conjure up a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750
it's not that easy to conjure up a
 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.290
it's not that easy to conjure up a
hypothetical future reality that has the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
hypothetical future reality that has the
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.860
hypothetical future reality that has the
same tangible significance as something

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
same tangible significance as something
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.230
same tangible significance as something
real right in front of you and so it's

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240
real right in front of you and so it's
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.910
real right in front of you and so it's
amazing thing that people can do that

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
amazing thing that people can do that
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.270
amazing thing that people can do that
and so then experimental leaves and some

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280
and so then experimental leaves and some
 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.039
and so then experimental leaves and some
children grab the marshmallow and just

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
children grab the marshmallow and just
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.219
children grab the marshmallow and just
you know chomp that thing down right now

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229
you know chomp that thing down right now
 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.640
you know chomp that thing down right now
other kids they videotaped kids while

other kids they videotaped kids while
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.960
other kids they videotaped kids while
they're waiting and they do all sorts of

they're waiting and they do all sorts of
 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.460
they're waiting and they do all sorts of
things they whistle they look at the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470
things they whistle they look at the
 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320

they're eyeing that marshmallow like a
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.810
they're eyeing that marshmallow like a

it's pretty interesting and and not only
 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.310

just like trait conscientiousness does

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810
just like trait conscientiousness does
 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.120
just like trait conscientiousness does
by the way because trait

time are the people who have high IQs

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570
time are the people who have high IQs
 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.840
time are the people who have high IQs
and who work hard and I would say that's

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850
and who work hard and I would say that's
 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.220

a pretty decent what would you call it

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230
a pretty decent what would you call it

it should and if you're trying to

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950
it should and if you're trying to
 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.580
it should and if you're trying to
extract resources from those who can

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590
extract resources from those who can

you would want to have happen is that

the hard-working smart people do better

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389
the hard-working smart people do better
 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.490
the hard-working smart people do better
hopefully if that's the case then

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500
hopefully if that's the case then
 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.150
hopefully if that's the case then
everyone does better hopefully
