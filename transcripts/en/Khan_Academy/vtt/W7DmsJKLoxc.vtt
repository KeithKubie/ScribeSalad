00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.570
 

00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.370
Welcome back.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.500
I actually recorded this video
earlier today, but then I

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.280
realized my microphone
wasn't plugged in.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.580
And I won't name names in
terms of who unplugged it.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.260
But anyway, back
to probability.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.160
My wife is giggling
mischievously.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.910
Anyway, so let's do a
slightly harder problem

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.650
than we did before.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.230
We were dealing with fair
coins, let's deal with

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.100
a slightly unfair coin.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.710
Let's say I have a coin and
it's-- actually instead of

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.330
unfair coin let's
do basketball.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.960
Let's say I'm shooting free
throws and I have a free

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.180
throw percentage of 80%.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.260
So when I shot a free throw,
8 out of 10 times, or 80%

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.610
of the time I will make it.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.890
But that also says that 20%
of time I will miss it.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.580
So given that, if I were to
take-- I don't know-- 5 free

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:54.590
throws, what is the probability
that I make at least 3

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.520
of the 5 free throws?

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.030
 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.680
Well, let's think of it this
way, what is the probability

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.840
of any particular combination
of making 3 out of the 5?

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.560
So what do I mean by that?

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.370
Let me pick a particular
combination.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.580
Let's say it's a basket,
basket, basket, and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.870
then I miss, miss.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.990
So that would be I
made 3 out of the 5.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.490
It could be-- I don't know--
basket, miss, basket,

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.570
miss, basket.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.760
And there's a bunch of them and
we'll actually try to figure

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.540
out how many of them there are.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.060
But what is the probability of
this particular combination?

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.950
Well, I have an 80% chance of
making this first basket.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.210
Times 80%.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.320
That's a times right there.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.670
Times 80%.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.420
And then what's my
probability of missing?

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.680
Well, that's 20%, right?

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.460
Times 0.2.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.790
times 0.2.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:03.170
So this sequels 0.8 to the
third power times 0.2 squared.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.480
What's the probability of
getting this exact combination?

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.650
Well, it's 0.8
times-- then I miss.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.110
There's a 20% chance of that.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.820
So times 0.2 times 0.8
times 0.2 times 0.8.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.190
We could rearrange this because
when you multiply numbers it

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.450
doesn't matter what order
you multiply them in.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.280
So this is the same thing
as 0.8 times 0.8 times

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.410
0.8 times 0.2 times 0.2.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.680
So this is also the same
thing as 0.8 to the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.836
third times 0.2 squared.

00:02:36.836 --> 00:02:39.790
 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.340
The probability of getting any
particular combination of 3

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.470
baskets and 2 misses is going
to be 0.8 to third

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.470
times 0.2 squared.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.750
Now what's the total
probability of

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.340
getting 3 out of 5?

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.720
Well, it's going to be the sum
of all of these combinations.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.380
You know, I could list them
all, but we hopefully now

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.520
are proficient enough in
combinatorics and combinations

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.470
to figure out how many
different ways, if we have 5

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.950
baskets and we're picking-- or
we have 5 shots and we're

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.530
picking 3 of them to be the
ones that are basket shots.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.180
So what do I mean?

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:21.670
So let's say my 5 shots-- you
know, I've shot 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.810
Out of these five, I'm
going to choose 3.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.140
So once again, I'm putting my
hat on as the god of

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.850
probability and I will choose 3
of these shots to be the ones

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.400
that happen to be the
ones that get made.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.030
So essentially, out of
5 I am choosing 3.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.400
5 choose 3.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.630
And what does that equal to?

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:52.520
That's 5 factorial over 3
factorial times 5 minus 3

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.850
factorial, so that's
2 factorial.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:04.980
And that equals 5 times 4 times
3 times 2 times 1 over 3 times

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.650
2 times 1 times 2 times 1.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.725
We can ignore all the 1's.

00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:09.220
Let's see.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.500
We get 3 times 2 times 1.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.480
3 times 2 times 1.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.490
We can cancel that.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.720
This 1 we can ignore, and
then this 2 and then

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.960
this turns into 2.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.130
So there are 10
possible combinations.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.980
These are two of them.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.710
You know, basket, basket,
basket, miss, miss.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.660
Basket, miss, basket,
miss, basket.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.760
And you know, it's a good
exercise for you to list

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.760
the other 8 of them.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.650
But using just the binomial
coefficient, and hopefully you

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.000
have an intuition of why that
works and I'd be happy to make

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.690
more videos if you feel that
that you need more explanation.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.220
But I made a couple.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.050
There are 10 combinations.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.220
So essentially, the probability
of getting exactly 3 out of 5

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.970
baskets, if I am an 80% free
throw shot, is going to

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.030
be-- switch colors.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:01.360
The probability of 3 out of 5
baskets is going to be equal to

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.720
the probability of each of the
combinations, which is 0.8 to

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.660
the third times 0.2 squared.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.020
I make 3, miss 2.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.150
And then, times the total
number of combinations.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.690
Each of these has a
probability of this much.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.650
And then there's 10 different
arrangements that I could make.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.050
There's 10 different ways of
getting 3 baskets and 2 misses.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.900
So times 10, and what
does that equal to?

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.320
Let me get my high-end
calculator here.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.800
So let's see what that is.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:53.860
That is 0.8 times 0.8 times 0.8
times 0.2 times 0.2 times 10.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.450
Equals 20.48.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:03.980
So it's essentially, a 20.48%
chance that I get exactly

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.076
3 out of 5 of the baskets.

00:06:06.076 --> 00:06:10.340
Now let's make it slightly
more interesting.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.980
Let's say I don't want it as a
probability of 3 out of the 5.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.050
And this is actually something
that probably, people

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.145
are more likely to ask.

00:06:16.145 --> 00:06:19.080
 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.260
What is the probability of
getting at least 3 baskets?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.350
 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.070
Well, if you think about it,
this is the probability.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.490
This is equal to the
probability of getting 3 out of

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.880
5 baskets, plus the probability
of getting exactly 4 out of 5

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.380
baskets, plus the probability
of getting exactly 5

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.992
out of 5 baskets.

00:06:43.992 --> 00:06:45.720
We already figured
this one out.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.390
That's 20.48%.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.170
So what's the probability of
getting 4 out of 5 baskets?

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:55.030
Well, once again, if we want
exactly 4 out of 5 baskets,

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:01.320
so an example could be-- I
don't know-- miss, basket,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.810
basket, basket, basket.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.010
What's the probability of
any one of the combinations

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.180
where I make 4 baskets?

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:14.170
Well, it's going to be 0.8 to
the fourth times-- and then I

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.730
have a 20% chance
that one miss.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.120
You know, it could have
been basket, miss,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.280
basket, basket, basket.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.560
That's also exactly 4, but
when you multiply them, the

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.590
probability of getting any
one of these particular

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.300
combinations is exactly this--
0.8 to the fourth times 0.2.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.980
 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.190
If I have 5 baskets, how many
ways can I pick 4 of them to be

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.870
the ones that I make if I'm
once again the god

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.460
of probability?

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:51.540
So this is going to be 0.8 to
the fourth times 0.2 times 0.2

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:56.330
times-- out of 5 baskets, I'm
choosing 4 that I'm

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.060
going to make.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.530
So this is the number of
combinations where I

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.870
get 4 out of the 5.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.600
So what is 5 choose 4?

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:09.210
That's 5 factorial over 4
factorial times 1 factorial.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.995
Well, that equals just 5.

00:08:10.995 --> 00:08:13.520
You can work that out.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.540
So let's just figure this out.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:24.340
This is going to be 0.8
times 0.8 times 0.8--

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.770
that's 3-- times 0.8.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.430
That equals-- did
I do that right?

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.476
Let's see.

00:08:32.476 --> 00:08:33.310
0.1.

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.600
Wait.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.280
0.8 times 0.8--
yeah, that's right.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.690
Times 0.2 times 5.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:51.510
 

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.310
So 40.96%.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:57.670
So this is 40.96%.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.500
So roughly, 41% chance that I
get exactly 4 out of 5 baskets.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.870
Which is interesting because
that's kind of my free

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:04.630
throw percentage.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.200
So it's almost a little less--
you know, 2/3 shot of kind of

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.660
hitting my free throw
percentage on the

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.110
mark on that time.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.020
And what's the probability
of getting 5 out of 5

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.760
Well, there's only one way
of getting 5 out of 5.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.550
You have to get all 5 of them.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:21.110
So this is 0.8 to
the fifth power.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.110
Let me get the calculator back.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:35.640
So it's 0.8 times 0.-- oh,
wait-- times 0.8 times 0.8

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:46.220
times 0.8 times 0.8
equals 0.3276.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.300
So 32.77% shot.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.330
And then we can add them
all up because we want the

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.130
probability of at least 3.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.610
So it's going to be that, the
probability of getting 5 out of

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.990
5, plus the probability of
getting 4 out of 5,

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:05.660
which is 0.4096.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.100
Plus, the probability
of getting 3 out of 5.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:16.830
So that's 0.2048
equals 0.94208.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:22.520
So 94.21-- roughly, rounding--
% chance, which makes sense.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.900
If I have an 80% free throw
percentage on any one shot, I

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.750
have a very high probability of
getting at least 3 out of 5

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.210
when I go to the
free throw line.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:33.590
Anyway, I'm all out of time.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.540
I'll see you in the next video.
