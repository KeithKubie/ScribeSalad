00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:06.869
Singer John Mayor has a song called "Daughters" that discusses the importance of fathers being there for their daughters.

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.968
Mayor wanted to emphasize the message that daughters have to be nurtured well in their childhoods.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.569
Because those actions will affect the relationships they have when they become adults.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.629
But, not every girl gets the treatment they hope for.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.420
But, not every girl gets the treatment they hope for.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.830
Some of them grew up with hardships and only understood the unstable, fragile love they received from the "person" they called their dad.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.579
Here's six types of unhealthy father/daughter relationships.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.750
Number one -  The Lost Father.
 The lost father is someone who is physically present in their daughter's lives, but abandons her emotionally.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.820
Number one -  The Lost Father.
 The lost father is someone who is physically present in their daughter's lives, but abandons her emotionally.

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.849
He never praises her daughter for her accomplishments,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.479
or notices the changes she's going through. As a result, daughters with a lost father often feel confused about their

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.019
self-identity and have trouble identifying their strengths and talents.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.520
They also typically suffer from low self-esteem issues, and usually look for the love and affection they crave in the romantic relationships

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:08.489
Number two -  The Abusive Father.
The abusive father often has unstable moods and exhibits unpredictable, destructive behavior.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.140
He usually has a hard time controlling his anger, and takes his stress out on his daughter... Which results in verbal, physical, or sexual abuse.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.150
The abusive father only cares about his own needs, and fails to treat his daughter right.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.140
Daughters of abusive fathers often grow up with no true identity.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.889
They are fearful, timid, and prefer not to be noticed by others.

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:37.019
In romantic relationships, daughters of abusive fathers expect to be mistreated by their partners, and struggle with vulnerability and intimacy.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.559
Number three - The Pampering Father.
 The pampering father is the opposite from the abusive father.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.820
Whereas the abusive father takes, the pampering father gives. He doesn't set healthy boundaries, and treats his daughter like a princess.

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:59.729
Consequently, she often grows up being manipulative, and self-absorbed. In romantic relationships, daughters of pampering fathers usually seek to be

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.368
served, and puts her needs first over their partner's.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.199
Pampering fathers have a hard time saying no, and allow their daughters to be spoiled.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.109
They worry about being mean and controlling and thus,

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.860
mistake their giving nature to be supportive... when they fail to teach their daughters to treat them with respect.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.060
Number four - The Toxic Father.
The toxic father creates a codependent relationship with his daughter.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.759
He often exercises helicopter parenting, and has a hard time letting go of his daughter as she grows up.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.580
Even when she's capable of taking care of herself,

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.880
he clips her wings off so she can rely on him for support...

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.749
The toxic father fails to teach his daughter the proper life skills

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.890
she needs to grow.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.330
He often domineers and makes decisions for her. Thinking "he knows what's best for her"

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.669
As a result, daughters of toxic fathers have a hard time living successful, independent lives.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.540
Number five - The Ruined Father.
The ruined father constantly relies on his daughter to survive.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.229
He may suffer from an addiction, severe depression, or be unemployed and meets his daughter by his side, in order to function.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.589
He often guilt trips his daughter into doing favors for him,

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.380
Which'll lead to bitterness and anger down the road, as she tries to make it out on her own -  without having to look out

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.809
for him. Daughters of ruined fathers tend to be selfless, and have a hard time setting healthy boundaries with others,

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.519
because they had to play the role of the caretaker all their lives. As they reach adulthood.

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:27.999
they may enter relationships where they end up babying, or giving their partner special treatment without receiving the same love and attention.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:35.589
Number six -  The Anguished Father.
The anguished father constantly lets his daughter down. As a result,

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.949
She reacts to his perceived faults, failures, and indifferences, with rebellious behavior and unhealthy lifestyle choices.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.369
Such as eating disorders, or risky sex, to demonstrate

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.540
what's bothering her. Daughter's of English fathers take part in unhealthy choices,

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.040
hoping that their self damage will influence their fathers to stop or quit their own bad habits.

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.039
They are willing to hurt themselves because they don't know how to address the concerns they have for them that will reach them.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.169
Although daughters of anguished fathers might feel like they are free to do as they please, in reality,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.989
they are actually trapped by the feeling they have towards their fathers, that are strongly expressed in their reactions and behavior.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.500
Which type of "unhealthy" father - daughter relationship do YOU resonate with?

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.779
We know how hard it is to talk about toxic family dynamics, and want to be a safe,
