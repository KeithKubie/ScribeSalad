00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
For much of human history, all of the societies
on Earth were poor.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.440
Poverty was the norm for everyone.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.600
But obviously, that’s not the case anymore.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.500
Just as you find stratification among socioeconomic
classes within a society, like the United States,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.160
across the world you also see a pattern of
global stratification, with inequalities in wealth
and power between societies.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.420
So what made some parts of the world develop
faster, economically speaking, than others?

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:35.100
[Theme Music]

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.980
How you explain the differences in socioeconomic
status among the world’s societies depends, of course,
on which paradigm you’re using to view the world.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.720
One of the two main explanations for global
stratification is modernization theory, and it comes
from the structural-functionalist approach.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.340
This theory frames global stratification as a
function of technological and cultural differences
between nations.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.260
And it specifically pinpoints two historical events
that contributed to Western Europe developing at
a faster rate than much of the rest of the world.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.880
The first event is known as the Columbian
Exchange.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:13.460
This refers to the spread of goods, technology,
education, and diseases between the Americas
and Europe after Columbus’s so-called discovery
of the Americas.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.760
And if you wanna learn more about that, we
did a whole World History episode about it.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.520
This exchange worked out pretty well for the
European countries.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.500
They gained agricultural staples like potatoes and
tomatoes, which contributed to population growth,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.700
and provided new opportunities for trade, while
also strengthening the power of the merchant class.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.100
But the Columbian Exchange worked out much less
well for Native Americans, whose populations were
ravaged by the diseases brought from Europe.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:44.840
It’s estimated that in the 150 years following Columbus’
first trip, over 80% of the Native American population
died due to diseases such as smallpox and measles.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.360
The second historical event is the Industrial
Revolution in the 18th and 19th century.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.840
We’ve mentioned this before, and there are
a couple World History episodes that you can
check out for more detail,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:02.860
but this is when new technologies like steam power
and mechanization allowed countries to replace human
labor with machines and increase productivity.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.060
The Industrial Revolution at first only benefited
the wealthy in Western countries.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.440
But industrial technology was so productive
that it gradually began to improve standards
of living for everyone.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.720
Countries that industrialized in the 18th
and 19th century saw massive improvements
in their standards of living.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.020
And countries that didn’t industrialize
lagged behind.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.140
The thing to note here is that Modernization
Theory rests on the idea that affluence could
have happened to anyone.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.360
But of course, it didn’t.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.220
So why didn’t the Industrial Revolution
take hold everywhere?

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.540
Well, modernization theory argues that the
tension between tradition and technological
change is the biggest barrier to growth.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.740
A society that’s more steeped in family systems and
traditions may be less willing to adopt new technologies,
and the new social systems that often accompany them.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.240
Why did Europe modernize?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.980
The answer goes back to Max Weber’s ideas
about the Protestant work ethic.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.400
The Protestant Reformation primed Europe
to take on a progress-oriented way of life,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.220
in which financial success was a sign of personal
virtue, and individualism replaced communalism.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.860
This is the perfect breeding ground for modernization.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.910
And according to American economist
Walt Rostow, modernization in the West took place
– as it always tends to – in four stages:

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:17.160
First, the Traditional Stage refers to societies that
are structured around small, local communities with
production typically getting done in family settings.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:25.520
Because these societies have limited resources
and technology, most of their time is spent laboring to
produce food, which creates a strict social hierarchy.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.660
Think Feudal Europe or early Chinese Dynasties.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.760
Tradition rules how a society functions:
What your parents do is what their parents did,
and what you’ll do when you grow up too.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.960
But as people begin to move beyond doing what’s
always been done, a society moves into Rostow’s
second stage, the Take-off Stage.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:50.460
Here, people begin to use their individual
talents to produce things beyond the necessities,
and this innovation creates new markets for trade.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.640
In turn, greater individualism takes hold,
and social status is more closely linked with
material wealth.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:03.520
Next, nations begin what Rostow called the Drive
to Technological Maturity, in which technological
growth of the earlier periods begins to bear fruit,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.440
in the form of population growth,
reductions in absolute poverty levels, and
more diverse job opportunities.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.320
Nations in this phase typically begin to push
for social change along with economic change,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.760
like implementing basic schooling for everyone,
and developing more democratic political systems.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.560
The last stage is known as High Mass Consumption
– when your country is big enough that production
becomes more about wants than needs.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.380
Many of these countries put social support
systems in place to insure that all of their
citizens have access to basic necessities.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.690
So, the TL; DR version of Modernization Theory
is that if you invest capital in better technologies,

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.580
they’ll eventually raise production enough
that there will be more wealth to go around,
and overall well-being will go up.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:53.220
And rich countries can help other countries that
are still growing by exporting their new technologies
in things like agriculture, machinery, and information
technology, as well as providing foreign aid.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.540
But critics of Modernization Theory argue that in
many ways, it’s just a new name for the idea that
capitalism is the only way for a country to develop.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.520
These critics point out that, even as
technology has improved throughout the world,
a lot of countries have been left behind.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.560
And they argue that Modernization Theory sweeps
a lot of historical factors under the rug when it
explains European and North American progress.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.600
Countries like the US and the UK industrialized
from a position of global strength, during a period
when there were no laws against slavery or
concerns about natural resource depletion.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.940
And some critics also point out that Rostow’s
markers are inherently Eurocentric, putting
an emphasis on economic progress.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.280
But that isn’t necessarily the only standard
to aspire to.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:38.060
After all, economic progress often includes downsides,
like the environmental damage done by industrialization
and the exploitation of cheap or free labor.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.920
Finally, critics of modernization theory also
see it as blaming the victim.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.960
In this view, the theory essentially blames poor
countries for not being willing to accept change,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:54.680
putting the fault on their cultural values and
traditions, rather than acknowledging that outside
forces might be holding back those countries.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.700
This is where the second theory of global
stratification comes in.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:04.840
Rather than focusing on what poor countries are
doing wrong, Dependency Theory theory focuses on how
poor countries have been wronged by richer nations.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:11.040
This model stems from the paradigm of conflict
theory, and it argues that the prospects of both wealthy
and poor countries are inextricably linked.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:19.440
This theory argues that in a world of finite
resources, we can’t understand why rich nations
are rich without realizing that those riches came
at the expense of another country being poor.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.420
In this view, global stratification starts
with colonialism – and it’s where we’ll
start today’s Thought Bubble.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:30.180
Starting in the 1500s, European explorers
spread throughout the Americas, Africa, and
Asia, claiming lands for Europe.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.880
At one point, Great Britain’s empire covered
about one-fourth of the world.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.500
The United States, which began as colonies themselves,
soon sprawled out through North America

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.940
and took control of Haiti, Puerto Rico,
Guam, the Philippines, the Hawaiian Islands,
and parts of Panama and Cuba.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.520
With colonialism came exploitation of both
natural and human resources.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.540
The transatlantic slave trade followed a triangular
route between Africa, the American and Caribbean
colonies, and Europe.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:04.520
Guns and factory-made goods were sent to Africa
in exchange for slaves, who were sent to the colonies
to produce goods like cotton and tobacco, which were
then sent back to Europe.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:12.340
As the slave trade died down in the mid-19th century,
the point of colonialism came to be less about human
resources and more about natural resources.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.480
But the colonial model kept going strong.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.900
In 1870, only 10% of Africa was colonized.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.180
But by 1940, only Ethiopia and Liberia were
not colonized.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:28.580
Under colonial regimes, European countries
took control of land and raw materials to
funnel wealth back to the West.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:36.360
Most colonies lasted until the 1960s, and
the last British colony, Hong Kong, was finally
granted independence in 1997.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.500
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:44.900
This history of colonialization is what inspired
American sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein’s model
of what he called the Capitalist World Economy.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.220
Wallerstein described high-income nations
as the “core” of the world economy.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:56.680
This core is the manufacturing base of the planet,
where resources funnel in, to become the technology
and wealth enjoyed by the Western world today.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:03.280
Low-income countries, meanwhile, are what
Wallerstein called the “periphery”, whose natural
resources and labor support the wealthier countries,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.760
first as colonies and now by working for
multinational corporations under neocolonialism.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:14.360
Middle-income countries, such as India or
Brazil, are considered the semi-periphery, due
to their closer ties to the global economic core.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:20.820
In Wallerstein’s model, the periphery remains
economically dependent on the core in a number
of ways, which tend to reinforce each other.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.140
First, poor nations tend to have few resources
to export to rich countries.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:30.820
But corporations can buy these raw materials cheaply
and then process and sell them in richer nations.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.180
As a result, the profits tend to bypass the
poor countries.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:41.100
Poor countries are also more likely to lack
industrial capacity, so they have to import expensive
manufactured goods from richer nations.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:46.160
And all of these unequal trade patterns lead to
poor nations owing lots of money to richer nations,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.240
creating debt that makes it hard
to invest in their own development.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:55.080
So, under Dependency Theory, the problem
is not that there isn’t enough global wealth;
it’s that we don’t distribute it well.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.620
But just as Modernization Theory had its critics,
so does Dependency Theory.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:06.120
Critics argue that the world economy isn’t
a zero-sum game – one country getting richer
doesn’t mean other countries get poorer.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:12.320
And innovation and technological growth can
spill over to other countries, improving all
nations’ well-being, not just the rich.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:18.160
Also, colonialism certainly left scars,
but it isn’t enough, on its own, to explain
today’s economic disparities.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:24.580
Some of the poorest countries in Africa, like
Ethiopia, were never colonized and had very
little contact with richer nations.

00:09:24.589 --> 00:09:29.520
Likewise, some former colonies, like Singapore
and Sri Lanka, now have flourishing economies.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:38.040
In direct contrast to what Dependency Theory
predicts, most evidence suggests that, nowadays,
foreign investment by richer nations helps, not
hurts, poorer countries.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.860
Dependency Theory is also very narrowly focused.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.149
It points the finger at the capitalist market
system as the sole cause of stratification,

00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:49.680
ignoring the role that things like culture and
political regimes play in impoverishing countries.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.880
There’s also no solution to global poverty
that comes out of dependency theory –

00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:00.520
most dependency theorists just urge poor
nations to cease all contact with rich nations
or argue for a kind of global socialism.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.120
But these ideas don’t acknowledge the
reality of the modern world economy –

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:09.410
making them not very useful for combating the
very real, very pressing problem of global poverty.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:15.260
The growth of the world economy and expansion
of world trade has coincided with rising standards
of living worldwide,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.300
with even the poorest
nations almost tripling in the last century.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:23.760
But with increased trade between countries,
trade agreements such as the North American
Free Trade Agreement

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:30.020
have become a major point of debate, pitting
the benefits of free trade against the costs to
jobs within a country’s borders.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:37.930
Questions about how to deal with global stratification
are certainly far from settled, but I can leave you with some good news: it’s getting better.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:47.800
The share of people globally living on less
than $1.25 per day has more than halved since
1981, going from 52% to 22% as of 2008.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.600
Today we learned about two theories of global
stratification.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.339
First, we discussed modernization theory and
Walt Rostow’s Four Stages of Modernization.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:11:01.840
We then talked about dependency theory, the
legacy of colonialism, and Immanuel Wallerstein’s
Capitalist World Economy Model.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.920
