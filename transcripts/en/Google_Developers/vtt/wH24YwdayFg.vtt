These days, knowing how to code is like having
a superpower. &nbsp;You can make almost anything

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.209
you can dream up. But there still isn't a
simple place for new coders to get started

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.799
building cool, real stuff for the web.

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.390
Maybe you've heard about Raspberry Pi.
It's a little machine that helps teach kids

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.480
how computers work.
We got to thinking -- Raspberry Pi could be

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.519
great for teaching how the web works, too.

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.109
So we built something for Raspberry Pi called
Coder. Download it, put it on an SD card,

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.840
plug it in, and it turns your Raspberry Pi
into a simple place to write code and a mini

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.750
web server to run it on -- everything you
need to get started making real web things

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.920
using the real languages of the web. It's
also a simple, cheap way to get a server into

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.550
a safe learning environment like a classroom
or living room.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.240
Coder is open source, because we know there
are tons of different ways of teaching...

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.760
AND learning. So everyone -- including you
-- can help make it better.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.370
This is just the beginning. A little download
for everyone to get started.
