[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.140
BRICE CHALLAMEL: So Kendrick,
you have an amazing life.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.680
You started selling caviar in
high-end places in Las Vegas.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.320
And now you propose shares
of Ample Food, which

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.470
is an organic brand of food
that is widely democratized

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.650
and distributed through
micro-investments

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.670
on a very sustainable platform,
leveraging blockchain.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.510
And you have a legal background.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.090
You are a former
fellow at Stanford Law.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.200
And you could, on
your spare time,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.725
but you don't want to say it
in front of everyone at Google,

00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:37.420
right?

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.600
So that's basically
a few things--

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.100
KENDRICK NGUYEN: I would say
I'm non-technical, particularly

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.390
in this room.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.240
BRICE CHALLAMEL:
So the first thing

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.240
I want to ask you-- because we
just used a lot of buzzwords

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.800
there in a very few sentences.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.010
It's a story of four dogs.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.300
So there is a dog from
AngelList, a dog from the tech,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.050
a dog from Wall Street,
and a street dog, right,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.300
or a normal dog.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.050
And the dog from
AngelList says, you know,

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.580
when I want more
money, what I do

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.100
is that I leverage
tokens from a blockchain

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.700
to do micro-investment
in startups.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.130
And the dog from tech says,
wait, wait, wait, wait,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.900
what's a micro-investment
in a startup?

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.270
And the dog from Wall
Street says, hold on,

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.970
what's a blockchain, right?

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.400
And the dog from the
street says, what's money,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.140
because he hasn't come up with
a lot of money in his life.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.470
So this is a-- you
know, I don't want it

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.630
to be a dog-eat-dog situation.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.240
I want us to understand every
dog's perspective in this.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.040
So how can you make it clear
to every perspective that we

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.357
can have on this what
you're doing exactly,

00:01:40.357 --> 00:01:41.940
and what your company--
because you're

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.770
an entrepreneur, a
founder of Republic,

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.290
which is a part of AngelList--
what your company does

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.320
and that every dog
would understand.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.260
KENDRICK NGUYEN: I
love that hypothetical.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.940
And I think when it
comes to investing,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.830
it's definitely not
dog-eat-dog, and it's

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.580
more like dog-feed-dog
world in this one sense.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.250
I think the easiest
way to look at money

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.250
is that it's a form of energy
and a medium of exchange.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.960
Today we use dollar here,
the pound in England.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.240
But anything can actually
be a medium of exchange.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.710
So you need money
to drive that energy

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.130
and grow an idea into a
business, condition necessary.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.330
The question is, how do you
get more people to do that?

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.230
And how do you break this
energy down to smaller pieces?

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.470
And if you can do that
through blockchain technology,

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.040
then you have that much
more energy directed

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.250
into this ecosystem,
and net-net, more ideas

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.630
will grow into more businesses.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.210
So the way I look
at investing is

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.160
that, if you manage to make
and to encourage everyone

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.980
to invest even a tiny amount of
money into this whole ecosystem

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.550
and direct that money to where
they believe the future should

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.380
be in terms of entrepreneurship,
and companies, and product,

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.860
then we're just going to have
that much more prosperous

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.407
of an ecosystem overall.

00:03:09.407 --> 00:03:11.490
BRICE CHALLAMEL: OK, so
the micro-investment part,

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.840
I get from this.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.170
How about the blockchain part?

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.910
Like, why would you use
blockchain for this?

00:03:20.418 --> 00:03:23.580
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Currently,
the reason why would take--

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.850
it would cost, probably,
about $20,000, $50,000 minimum

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.750
if you want to invest into
real estate, even a REIT,

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.780
is that the cost
of transferring--

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.380
of making it possible
for people to buy

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.720
a lot of-- a stake in a building
or a home would be so high.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.060
The cost of processing,
of validating,

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.700
of confirming your
interest, and when

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.290
you want to sell
that interest is

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.780
going to be equally burdensome.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.270
Blockchain technology--
one use case of it

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.940
is fractionalization
and automation.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.500
If you can break the "Mona
Lisa" down to a billion pieces,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.860
you can have a billion people
around the world owning

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.700
a piece of the "Mona Lisa."

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.010
Yes, it's only worth, probably,
a fraction of a dollar,

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.400
but you're owning a
piece of the "Mona Lisa."

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.329
And that's only able recently,
through blockchain technology,

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.899
that you can fractionalize
things to that degree,

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.330
and that it costs
next to nothing

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.200
to transfer a tiny fraction
of an asset between two

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.340
individuals.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.715
BRICE CHALLAMEL: I have a
feeling Leonardo da Vinci would

00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:34.650
have loved your idea,
right, and be very

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.250
interested in the mechanism.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.000
So what I get from this is
that this micro-investment,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.060
which is a form of
expression of crowdfunding,

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.240
but more organized, right,
more on a platform--

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.030
you're standing somewhere
between crowdfunding

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.860
and an IPO, right?

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.260
There is this middle
space that has not really

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.610
been invested-- if I might
use the word-- before in which

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.740
initiatives need money.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.840
And why wouldn't you
come at this earlier

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.150
than the formal IPO, which
return investment might not

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.800
be so high?

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.630
Because now there
is the technology--

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.400
and if I notice where, also--
the regulation for this.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.150
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Early
investing naturally

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.400
comes with higher risk
and much higher return.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.420
So I think most people
nowaday, in this ecosystem,

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.000
know that Uber is
about to file for IPO.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.710
People who are
buying in post-IPO--

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.590
pretty much anyone who's
not a millionaire--

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.280
will see a return or a
depreciation-- but, you know,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.490
2x, 3x, or 20% loss.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.360
Obviously, if you invested
$10 in-- or $100--

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.670
into Uber's very first
round on AngelList,

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.230
today, that's going to be worth
somewhere between $1.5 million

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.300
to $2 million on face value.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.580
So getting in early is
definitely a value proposition.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.110
But it wasn't legal until 2016.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.550
Up until two and
a half years ago,

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.590
you got to be a millionaire to
invest in private companies.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.780
And I'm glad that the world
is very different now.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.010
BRICE CHALLAMEL:
All right, and so

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.093
that's when your legal
background comes into play.

00:06:10.093 --> 00:06:12.570
Because you knew the
law had just changed,

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.070
and they'd opened a huge
new opportunity for people

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.570
to invest.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.430
Because they don't
need to have--

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.950
to be certified investors,
if I get this right.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.980
And so then, the
question is, how do we

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.000
organize this to work
efficiently for everyone,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.290
right?

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.220
Am I right in this?

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.387
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Absolutely.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.940
So obviously, the law
is there to make sure

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.750
that people aren't now they're
defrauding grandmas and people

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.750
with very little
dispensable income.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.380
Now on the other hand,
99% of the world--

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.600
of the United States--
wealthiest country

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.710
in the world--

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.760
99% of people have never
made a private investment.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.830
So they don't know what it is.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.960
Everyone had taken
a cab or a taxi--

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.240
almost everyone-- before Uber.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.780
So when they made it possible,
it was just a natural leap.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.940
What we're trying to
do is to get everyone

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.340
to do something that they
have never done before.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.630
So it's a much more
challenging journey

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.000
from the branding,
marketing exposure,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.590
as well as legal and business.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.420
BRICE CHALLAMEL: All right,
so I went to your platform

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.160
as part of the
preparation for this talk.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.710
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Thank you.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.650
BRICE CHALLAMEL: I discovered
the breadth of products

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:17.483
that you have there.

00:07:17.483 --> 00:07:21.360
It's amazing You go from
Ample Food, which I mentioned,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.030
to some more tech startups.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.430
Can you tell us, how do
you curate the properties?

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.580
Because I still want to know
that my dollars are invested

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.560
in a place that is kind
of safe are curated,

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.593
and I think you
provide that service.

00:07:33.593 --> 00:07:36.010
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Given that
AngelList is our institutional

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.930
co-founder, and our team has a
heritage back to the venture,

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.090
the VC lens--

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.370
so we do apply
some natural lens.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.440
Is there credibility?

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.660
Founders have domain expertise.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.400
On the other hand,
I fundamentally

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.920
believe that people
should invest

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.850
for any number of reasons.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.330
Maybe they just want to
support women founders.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.060
Maybe they want to get some
return back from that food

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.780
truck and not necessarily
1,000x in a tech company.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.850
So if the vision is to build
Amazon for private investing,

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.488
where you have
thousands and thousands

00:08:11.488 --> 00:08:13.530
of companies, and millions
and millions of people

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.950
participating, then
one of our core focus

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.130
is to present as many options--

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:24.570
credible, viable options-- as
possible, and let the crowd

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.760
follow their heart
and their head,

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.710
and make the decision
for themselves.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.930
BRICE CHALLAMEL: All right,
so I got a better idea

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.909
of what you do at Republic.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:35.669
You allow everyone to
make micro-investments,

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.500
even a few dollars,
without overheads,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.770
because the technology is
there, without legal constraint.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.720
Because the regulation
has changed.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.430
And there's this new highway
of potential investment open.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.790
However, my mother told me
never to gamble, you know?

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.030
And I don't know that
I've been such a good son.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.300
But what would you say
about the risk-reward?

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.130
And is this for everyone?

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.290
Or is this something that--

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.030
how do you reassure
me that you're not

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.165
about to create the next
subprime crisis with your idea?

00:09:06.165 --> 00:09:07.290
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Of course.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.660
You know, even when
it comes to gambling,

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.647
it's not so much that
you should never gamble.

00:09:11.647 --> 00:09:13.230
I think that people
should do whatever

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.120
it is that they
want to do if they

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.970
are fully aware of the
risks and the consequences.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.060
So you know that
gambling, likely,

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.950
is going to result in
total loss of money,

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.060
but you have a lot
of fun doing it.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.870
And you can afford that $50 at
a slot machine, by all mean,

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.260
in my opinion, you should do it.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.180
Obviously, the risk of
gambling is very high.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.260
Now when it comes to
early-stage investing,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.150
the risk is still
high-- not as high.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.680
But every single year,
about $100 billion

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.690
are being spent at a casino--

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.470
not by millionaires, mostly
by non-accredited people--

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.520
another $80 billion
into lottery tickets.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.760
Can you imagine what the world
would be-- what Silicon Valley,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.330
and the US, and the world,
at large, would be--

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:06.310
if 10% of that $180 billion
per year would get invested--

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:10.720
or gambled, informally--
into new innovations

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.288
that has that opportunity
to change our world?

00:10:13.288 --> 00:10:14.830
BRICE CHALLAMEL: So
basically, you're

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:19.538
saying the micro-investment
is worth the risk.

00:10:19.538 --> 00:10:20.580
What do you have to lose?

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.460
It's a few dollars.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.710
What is the average amount
of people-- that people

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.240
spend on your platform?

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.820
KENDRICK NGUYEN:
If I may take the--

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.280
answer one question
about money, this

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.790
is more like my personal view.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:34.230
BRICE CHALLAMEL: Please.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.730
KENDRICK NGUYEN: I
think, generally,

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.140
from what I observe,
how people spend fall

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.180
into three categories.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.240
One is the basic
necessity, you know,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.060
putting food on the table,
buying toothpaste, feeding

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.260
your kids if you have kids.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
The second one is for
enjoyment, for value.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.380
You know, you go out
and buy a nicer jacket

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.520
you don't necessarily need.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.590
You take a kite surfing lesson.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:01.710
And the third one is for growing
that capital that will enable

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.230
you to do number one and two.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.500
So obviously, don't
spend any money

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.110
that you absolutely
need to feed yourself

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.990
and your family in the
casino, or in investing,

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.520
for that matter.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.510
When it comes to
micro-investing $100, $500--

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.880
investing, not
buying a product--

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.450
I think it's a blend
between two and three.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.330
It is quite
satisfying, if I really

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.570
believe in that food truck
founder, and her food,

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.760
and her resilience
day in and day out.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.350
And she decides to fundraise
to build a Mexican restaurant.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.900
And I invest $200 into it.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.680
You know, if she doesn't make
it, I'm still rooting for her.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.110
Now if I'm investing
$200,000 into it,

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:50.290
I probably want to know that
I can get the money back,

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.920
or that she would do so well
that I could make two or three

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.130
times as much.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.875
But when it comes
to micro-investing,

00:11:55.875 --> 00:11:57.270
you're going to be--

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.780
you will be able to
let people gamble,

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:05.370
or make informed decision, and
have fun between two and three.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.570
BRICE CHALLAMEL: How is it
different from crowdfunding?

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.810
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Let me
give a very quick definition

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:11.477
of crowdfunding.

00:12:11.477 --> 00:12:12.558
BRICE CHALLAMEL: Please.

00:12:12.558 --> 00:12:14.350
KENDRICK NGUYEN:
Kickstarter and Indiegogo,

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.040
whereby you go on and buy a
product that hasn't been made,

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.600
that's generation
one of crowdfunding.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.570
And that's back in 2008 or so.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.950
Then you have, 2011,
AngelList came into the mix.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:32.080
That allowed millionaires to
co-invest into tech deals.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.090
So that's the second wave of it.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.560
And when Republic
launched in 2016,

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.880
that allows anyone, anywhere,
of any income and net worth

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.230
invest as little as $10
or $20 into businesses,

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:48.550
that's crowd-investing,
still crowdfunding.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.590
I think all of us can
agree that there's

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:56.110
a different psychological
attachment when you invest when

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.780
you have an interest
in something

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.300
compared to buying a product.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.660
I used to work for the guy
who founded SKYY Vodka.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.910
And I don't think there's a
difference between Absolut

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.040
Vodka and SKYY Vodka.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:14.590
But if you, Bryce, had made a
$50 investment into Absolut,

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.130
when you go out to the bar
with me at the end of the day,

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.300
you're going to buy
me Absolut shots.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.270
You're going to serve
up that kind of--

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.780
that brand of vodka over
the holidays and July 4th.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.990
So that notion of
engagement, of commitment,

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.060
of having skin in
the game, I think,

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.900
is what going to drive crowd
investing into a new trend.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.570
And indeed, that's the
underlying foundation

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.080
of a token economy,
of using tokens

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.640
to incentivize participants.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.640
BRICE CHALLAMEL: All
right, so what I understand

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.780
is that crowdfunding might be
more before there's a product.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.770
Micro-investment is at the early
stage when there is something,

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.485
and you know what
you're investing into.

00:13:55.485 --> 00:13:57.360
But you still have
attachment, because you're

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.907
such an early
contributor to this

00:13:59.907 --> 00:14:01.990
that you want to serve
that vodka to your friends,

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.480
or that strawberry juice.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.855
KENDRICK NGUYEN: And that you
potentially get that return

00:14:05.855 --> 00:14:08.110
in share in that
outsized growth.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.700
BRICE CHALLAMEL:
Because this is more

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.783
a return on
investment perspective

00:14:11.783 --> 00:14:13.450
than the crowdfunding,
which may be just

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.240
you're buying something,
really, and paying for it.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.680
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Correct.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.660
BRICE CHALLAMEL: And
it's still early enough

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.720
before there will
be a stock exchange

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.153
play that you have
the huge reward

00:14:25.153 --> 00:14:27.070
curve if you are investing
in the right thing,

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.233
and that your passion and your
gut goes along with the market.

00:14:30.233 --> 00:14:31.150
KENDRICK NGUYEN: 100%.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.500
BRICE CHALLAMEL: All right.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.680
So thank you for all
these explanations.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.720
It's already very,
very interesting.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.730
Now I would like to go
on the step further.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:45.310
Because you are in the
middle of a lot of trends,

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:48.920
and each of them collide in
what we're doing right now.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.850
How do you see the
future of investment?

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.930
So let's say that Republic
is the present of investment,

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.460
because I can go,
today, on Repulic.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.990
It's republic.co, right?

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.990
So it's for everyone
who wants to--

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.300
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Not
dot-com, dot-co, dot-C-O.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.370
BRICE CHALLAMEL:
Dot-co, not dot-com--

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:04.360
all right.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.400
You got rid of the M, all right?

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.120
And so republic.co--
and what your platform,

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.060
and how it works and operates--

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.070
so I understand the past.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.790
I understand the present,
and this very new initiative

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.060
and interesting way to see it.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.163
How do you-- what are
you going to launch?

00:15:23.163 --> 00:15:24.330
What are you dreaming about?

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.010
How do you foresee the future?

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.262
What is your take on
the future investment?

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:30.720
KENDRICK NGUYEN:
First, let me just

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.400
share one tidbit about the
present and the funding

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.760
landscape.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.130
I don't know how many
people, even here, at Google

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:44.790
and in the heart of Silicon
Valley, realize that 50%--

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:50.530
5-0-- of all venture capital
go to businesses in California.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:55.320
Another 50% go to
just social apps.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.320
African-American founders--
African-American women

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.280
founders--

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.510
are responsible for $30 billion
worth of revenue businesses

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.060
founded by
African-American founders,

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.250
are responsible for tens
of billions of dollars.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:12.520
And statistically, 0% get
funded on certain years.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:17.070
So if we can agree that
good ideas exist everywhere,

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.730
that no community,
no city, no heritage

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:25.800
has a monopoly on
innovations that, if funded,

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.160
can mature into the Google,
the Apple of the world

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.460
10 and 20 years from
now, then there's

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.320
a lot of work to get done.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.200
So now to answer your
question, what's the future,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:44.690
I think the future is, indeed,
that if not 80% or 90%,

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:50.840
then 50%, 60%, 70% of adults
would look at micro-investing

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.290
$10 and $20 at a time as a way--

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:55.310
as a new way--

00:16:55.310 --> 00:17:00.260
as a new spending behavior
similar to, or adding onto,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.180
whatever else
they've been doing.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.030
Think of it as a
social engagement,

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.670
almost like
recycling, but adding

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:12.569
on to that potential
for growing the capital,

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:14.530
the savings that you have.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.540
And I think-- there's
no question in my mind

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.210
that Amazon for
private investing

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.280
will be the future,
that people will

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.069
be investing as
easily, and quickly,

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:28.160
and cheaply as buying
a product on Amazon.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.640
And once we get there, I think
we can eradicate global poverty

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.780
once and for all.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.720
Because investing in a new
day and age, when technology

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.780
reduces, not
increases, jobs, how

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.110
do you lower the income gap?

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.920
By allowing people to
invest $10, $20, $30,

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:54.290
and have that opportunity
to get a major distribution

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.270
and realize their potential
in different ways.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.270
BRICE CHALLAMEL: Wow,
it's a pretty bold vision.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.722
Thank you for sharing it.

00:18:00.722 --> 00:18:02.180
One thing that I
forgot to ask you,

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:06.050
how do you make money
for Republic out of this?

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:09.253
How do-- how does your
system operate financially?

00:18:09.253 --> 00:18:11.420
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Well,
currently-- full disclosure--

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.720
we're about three years out.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.480
And we definitely
are not making money.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.450
We are completely
venture-backed, losing--

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:18.650
we're very much in the red.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.190
Hopefully, one day,
we'll be making money.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:25.460
But we have a cash commissioned
out of the amount being raised

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.330
as well as a small interest
in every single company

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.450
that successfully
raises on Republic.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.300
So in a way, if one
of the companies that

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.370
had raised on
Republic, in 10 years,

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:42.500
does an IPO at the
size of Uber or Airbnb,

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.530
then Republic
would do very well.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.930
Now, we're going
through an initiative

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.890
that we aim to tokenize
our future revenue

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:56.180
and give them back to every
user, and investor, and partner

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:02.630
on Republic so that, if and when
we get that major distribution,

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.950
all the hundreds of thousands
of early believers in Republic

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.170
can benefit in that
as well monetary-wise.

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:10.670
BRICE CHALLAMEL:
So if I'm investing

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.710
in Ample Food and
Republic, I'm also

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.570
somehow investing in Republic.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.880
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Correct--
so currently, not yet.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.280
Currently, if you
invest in Ample Food,

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.190
and if they get bought out
for 10x, and you invest $100,

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.080
give or take, you're going
to get about $1,000 back.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.810
But very soon, we
will be giving--

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:34.160
for making an investment on
Ample Food, or in any project--

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.740
let's say 100 Republic tokens--

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.430
each token, at 1
point, will represent

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:44.037
a portion of future income
that Republic takes in.

00:19:44.037 --> 00:19:44.870
BRICE CHALLAMEL: OK.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.130
KENDRICK NGUYEN: So that--

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:50.900
imagine back when-- in the
early day, when Amazon just

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.780
had 10 companies
on the platform,

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:58.280
and they had given out a
billion tiny little slivers,

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.160
and each sliver
represent revenue

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.430
from each of the company, at
the time, it may not mean much.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.427
But now, 20 years later,
it can be very substantial.

00:20:07.427 --> 00:20:09.260
BRICE CHALLAMEL: So
that's very interesting.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.080
Because what I understand from
this is that this way for you

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.630
to monetize your
services, for one thing,

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:18.410
tells us that you have skin
in the game of the companies

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.930
that are on your platform,
that you believe in them enough

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.600
that you took a small
share yourselves.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.600
And the system also
allows you to create

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:31.700
the transaction system that is
completely zero-cost, right?

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.720
Like if I have a share of
any company on your platform,

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.660
and in five years, they are
really doing super well,

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.480
I can divide my token
in as many as I want,

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.750
because it's
infinitely dividable--

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.250
I don't know how you say.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.900
You can infinity divide it--

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.210
and then transfer this
to anyone, globally,

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:52.850
in the world without
any overhead or expense.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:54.350
Am I right in
understanding this?

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:59.240
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Yes, how
much, or into how many pieces

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.420
you break it down, and
who to grant it to,

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.700
that's the realm
of token economics.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.070
And there are different ways
of incentivizing people.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.980
But absolutely, back
when Google was still

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:16.670
a private company, an employee
holding 1,000 shares--

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:20.640
in order for her to
transfer it to her sister,

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.685
say, in Singapore,
first, you got

00:21:24.685 --> 00:21:27.300
to get the consent
of the company.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.420
Then you have to go
through the transfer agent.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:33.440
Then you have to sign, probably,
about four sets of documents,

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.480
both counterparties signing.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.080
The company would need to do
a background check [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.500
on the sister.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.390
And that's why that
process is so inefficient,

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:47.260
that transfer of private
securities, even today,

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.970
is heavily, heavily limited.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:54.800
Blockchain technology and
the new application of it,

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.230
in the months and
the years to come,

00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:02.030
will make that process even
more seamless than public stock

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.070
trading today.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.320
And I think, again,
it will just bring

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:11.330
more of that energy that
feed into these budding

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.615
companies around the world.

00:22:13.615 --> 00:22:15.740
BRICE CHALLAMEL: And I want
to talk about the offer

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:16.770
side of the equation.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.610
So we were [INAUDIBLE] we
talked about how you orchestrate

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:24.150
the platform and what
liberated this initiative

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:27.290
on the basis of technology
and regulation changing.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:30.500
We talked about the part of
the people who need funds.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.890
We talked a little bit about
the part of the investors.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.590
Let's say, tomorrow, I want
to monetize something that has

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.370
never been monetized before.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.130
So let's take an
example that, at Google,

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.780
we talk about a lot--
or we hear about a lot--

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:43.910
which is our data.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.980
People say to me, all the
time, how about my data?

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.470
It has value, you know?

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.030
And you use that value.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.560
And there's a huge conversation.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.050
Because I think they gain
value against that value

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.550
from using the
services for free.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:56.758
KENDRICK NGUYEN: And it has--

00:22:56.758 --> 00:23:00.300
it's a topic from DC, to Europe,
down to the private citizens,

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:00.800
right?

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.710
BRICE CHALLAMEL: Yes,
and right now, it's

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:05.750
a very top-of-mind topic
for everyone, especially

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:06.600
in this day and age.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.230
So let's say,
tomorrow, populations

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.378
wanted to monetize
their data, right,

00:23:11.378 --> 00:23:12.920
that they would say,
all right, let's

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:18.740
create a platform together
to put our data together.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.410
Maybe individually, my
data is not worth so much.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.300
But maybe as part of--

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.470
I don't know-- my income
level on the West Coast--

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.320
or I'm French, so as part of
the French community living

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:30.850
abroad--

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:32.990
or any identity,
maybe some companies

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:36.170
would be interested in
purchasing some of my data.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.750
Could I use a platform
like Republic,

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:42.830
and the new regulation, and
the arrival of blockchain

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.880
to somehow put my data,
willingly, knowingly

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.250
on the market and decide how my
data is going to be purchased,

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.710
traded, bought, and so on,
in a way that I feel to be

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.445
transparent and empowered?

00:23:53.445 --> 00:23:55.070
KENDRICK NGUYEN:
Absolutely-- certainly

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.760
not on Republic today,
because we're currently

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.900
more of an investment platform.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.230
But there are two elements
of blockchain technology

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:07.850
that would, in my opinion,
solve, in major ways,

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:11.520
or in meaningful ways,
the data privacy concern.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.140
One is that security,
but decentralized so

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:19.430
that you don't have to worry
about a central party holding

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:22.040
all relevant information
getting hacked.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.780
And so that, in
and by of itself,

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.570
does ease the security concern.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:30.350
And the second one--
one of the main--

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:34.880
using, probably, my own
psychological attachment

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.110
or assessment of this
particular data question--

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.440
and I think that even though,
yes, I agree to the terms--

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.440
but I didn't know why
that I was consenting

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.250
to providing all of these
personal information and data

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.800
to a couple central parties.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.660
And I'm certainly
not feeling like I'm

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.750
being incentivized by it.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.960
If you apply a token
economy around it

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:05.090
and enable people
to make money when--

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:09.950
or share in that
economic value of data

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.310
and a choice to opt
out, I think you're

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:16.950
going to get so much
opting in that, net-net,

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.170
it benefits everyone.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:21.380
And it still serves
that same purpose

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.610
of using data to analyze,
to produce, and put out

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.745
better products that
serve human, at large,

00:25:28.745 --> 00:25:29.900
as a community.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.830
BRICE CHALLAMEL:
All right, so I took

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.622
a very extreme case,
because it's very deep

00:25:32.622 --> 00:25:34.650
materialized, people's data.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.190
But what I understand from
this discussion up to now

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:41.210
is that the shift in
paradigm that you're here

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:46.460
to talk to us about is both
democratizing the investment,

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.490
and what is being
proposed for investment,

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.340
and creating this new
space in which people,

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.840
for the price of
a lottery ticket,

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.290
could actually apply
value to their values,

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.810
value to their commitments,
participate to things that

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.960
are already there and that are
already started and visible,

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.570
and gain the traction
of early investment,

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:08.540
and that this is probably
going to profoundly reshape

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.240
the way we create
monetization out

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.130
of various elements
of investment

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:16.850
that, today, are still
believed to be very restricted

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.980
to a system with a cost base,

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.123
with knowledge and
expertise, and that maybe,

00:26:21.123 --> 00:26:23.540
tomorrow, all these things are
going to fly out the window

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.190
and will be available for a lot
of people, truly democratized.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:28.920
KENDRICK NGUYEN: 100%.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.940
I think the next Facebook--

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.930
the first investors
in the next Facebook

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.870
should not be
[INAUDIBLE] of the world,

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:43.370
but be the 500 door
maids of the founders.

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:45.390
Hopefully, it doesn't
have to be a Harvard.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.440
It can be a women's
college out of Pakistan,

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.090
and that the next
wave of founders

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:53.570
can be a single mom in
Ecuador reading about it

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:57.080
and putting in $10 and
$20, and that by the time

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.770
the banks and the venture
funds, or whatnot, get in,

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:02.870
everyone else get in
more and more, and that

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.860
when there's an IPO
event like the one that's

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.880
going to produce 100,000
millionaires in the Bay Area,

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.070
that they're going to
be hundreds of thousands

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.590
of people benefiting
all at the same time.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:21.410
So I think the last wave of
venture capital, the last 30

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.060
years it's produced--

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.900
has lifted 1.3
billion people out

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.920
of abject poverty in the world.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.770
We've been living in the most--

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.620
in a better time
than ever before.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:37.670
But much of the fruits of
it, in terms of wealth,

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.910
has gone back to the wealthiest
and the institutions.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:46.580
If we can encourage everyone
and make it possible,

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:53.210
a small amount, for everyone
to buy in, I think the world,

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:57.740
20 years from now, will probably
be almost like sci-fi fiction

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.710
with very little--

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.500
you know, the wealth is
just across the board.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.540
And the standard of
living can be lifted

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.790
from all corners of the world.

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:07.957
BRICE CHALLAMEL: All right,
well, thank you so much.

00:28:07.957 --> 00:28:09.130
This was very enlightening.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.630
I loved both preparing
this with you

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.250
and having this conversation.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:16.340
Time for us to open to
the rest of the audience.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.150
Any question, any
comment, anything

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.430
you would like to
ask Kendrick, please.

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.910
AUDIENCE: So I went
to the platform,

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:28.150
and there is one thing
I don't understand here.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:32.740
When I invest a certain amount,
do I get equity in the company?

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:36.450
Do I own 2% of that startup now?

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:38.270
Or how, exactly, does that work?

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.110
KENDRICK NGUYEN: So each of
the deals on the investment--

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.390
and thank you so
much for joining.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.970
Each of the deals
on the platform

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:47.800
has its own set of terms.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.540
Some of the companies are
already venture-backed.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.690
They've raised tens of
millions of dollars.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:54.580
And now they just
want to bring--

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.460
provide an opportunity for their
customers and fans to get it.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.060
So typically, it
would say a valuation.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.070
For example, the
document would say

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:06.970
that you're investing
$1,000, and at the company's

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.790
valuation of $10 million.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:12.850
So usually, with investing,
what that means is that,

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:17.650
later on, if Google buys
that company at $100 million,

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:21.670
then you would get
100x, give or take,

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.110
on your own personal investment.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.920
So in a way, yes,
it's skin in the game.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:27.940
It's buying in.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:32.020
It's not sha-- there's a range
of distinction between shares,

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:36.010
and stock, and debt, and
save, and convertible notes.

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:38.380
But the general thesis
is very much the same,

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.990
that if the company
does well, you

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:44.080
will do well
proportionally so as well,

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.590
to contrast against buying
a product or making a loan

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:50.530
and get a fixed return back.

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.440
So sharing in that success
and that growth, I think,

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:59.080
is a psychological
satisfaction and validation

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.538
that a lot of people in
tech have experienced.

00:30:02.538 --> 00:30:04.580
BRICE CHALLAMEL: Has that
answered your question?

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.350
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.350
BRICE CHALLAMEL: And to
be very clear for anyone

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:08.670
who hears this--

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.680
because we all understand
the concept of share

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.080
and being a shareholder--

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.230
when I invest through
Republic, what am I?

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:17.795
And what do I have?

00:30:17.795 --> 00:30:18.670
How do you call this?

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:19.380
What is it?

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.460
KENDRICK NGUYEN:
You're an investor.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:20.940
BRICE CHALLAMEL: OK.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.398
KENDRICK NGUYEN:
But in most cases,

00:30:22.398 --> 00:30:24.540
you're not a shareholder yet.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.070
You're just an
investor to make it

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:29.100
simple for the company
and the founders.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.610
So in fintech, it's
a confluence of law

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.070
and regulations on the
one hand, and innovation

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.490
on the other hand.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:40.110
So you have a set of laws that
was written some 80 years ago,

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.960
at a time when the
world we live in

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.300
wasn't even on anyone's mind.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:49.800
And how to apply these rules to
make it possible for a world,

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.880
now, that you can have a million
investors at a very early stage

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.560
into it?

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.500
Because of that need,
the new instruments

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:02.160
like convertible notes,
like the save, et cetera--

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.630
but you're an investor.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:06.210
Shareholder or not
is far less material.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:10.060
But typically, at one point,
you will become a shareholder.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:12.030
And then you get paid
out and cashed out.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:12.790
BRICE CHALLAMEL: All right, so--

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:14.040
and what will be that point?

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.552
Like, when do you make the
shift from being an investor

00:31:17.552 --> 00:31:18.510
to being a shareholder?

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.720
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Yep, so the
instrument that we created

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.300
to make it possible for
founders and companies

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.090
to deal with so many
people is that, if,

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:30.850
and when, they experience
a "liquidity event,"

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:34.260
meaning a merger or
acquisition or going IPO,

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:37.723
then they will convert
everyone into shareholders.

00:31:37.723 --> 00:31:39.390
And then, because you
are a shareholder,

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.490
you get paid out
or get cashed out,

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:42.705
and then leave the company.

00:31:42.705 --> 00:31:43.830
BRICE CHALLAMEL: All right.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.288
KENDRICK NGUYEN:
Because otherwise,

00:31:45.288 --> 00:31:49.280
if you keep 10 million
shareholders on the cap table,

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.800
the cost of administering
it is exceedingly high

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.623
to comply with corporate laws.

00:31:54.623 --> 00:31:56.040
BRICE CHALLAMEL:
All right, very--

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.240
thank you so much
for the question.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.282
Very, very good question.

00:31:58.282 --> 00:32:00.480
And thank you so much
for your detailed answer.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.550
AUDIENCE: I have a question on
ICO, Initial Coin Offerings.

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:07.570
Many startups are doing
that in the last few years.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:10.890
And frankly, most of
them are just scams.

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:14.500
You know, they issue a coin, and
get $10 million, $20 million,

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.070
and they're not doing anything.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:22.200
Then SEC start regulating
that for bigger ICOs.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.260
So what's your view on
the smaller ones which

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.900
are still happening
in Silicon Valley,

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.850
and sometimes, in one world?

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:33.270
KENDRICK NGUYEN: I think
that's a great question.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:37.770
You know when-- the
ICO boom in 2017,

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:44.820
in 2016, it gave all of us
at Republic warm and fuzzy

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:49.890
feelings all over, because it's
a true, real-life validation

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.850
of our model in the future,
where thousands of individuals,

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:57.480
and not venture capitalists,
finance random projects

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.000
and companies, not
here in Silicon Valley,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
not out of Google, but can be
out of Singapore or wherever.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:12.030
So crowd-investing, in its best
form, was ICO back in 2016.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:15.480
Now it was done in
a non-compliant way

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.290
with US securities law.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:19.320
So the law caught on.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.620
And so now you apply laws and
regulations, many of which

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.940
are meant to prevent frauds
and scams perpetuated

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.860
on the investing public.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.180
But it does come with
bells and whistles.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.330
So it makes it a little
bit more difficult

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.070
for people to participate--

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.050
know your customer,
anti-money-laundering,

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:38.000
and whatnot.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.260
So you're seeing, in many
ways, a healthy contraction

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:46.080
of that type of
financial product.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:50.520
But at Republic, we're trying
to make that compliant and easy

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:55.410
and get back to one point when
a credible project can raise

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:58.860
$10 million, $20 million
without having to go and pound

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.620
the pavement on Sand Hill
Road because she happens

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.230
to be not living in America
and not economically

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:06.040
possible to do that.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:10.320
So I'm very optimistic about
blockchain technologies

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.310
and startups that are built,
or leverage that technology

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:15.900
in the long run.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.673
And Republic itself is
applying some of that as well.

00:34:18.673 --> 00:34:20.340
BRICE CHALLAMEL: Oh,
and I wanted, also,

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.760
to highlight something.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.810
And I will just let
you answer to this.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:27.360
But you could say, at
Republic, we do this,

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.840
and Republic could be only
you in a garage in Palo Alto.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.510
Or it could be a bigger team.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.010
So can you tell us
a little bit more

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:38.550
about under the hood, like your
organization, how many people

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:40.052
you are, where
they are located--

00:34:40.052 --> 00:34:40.969
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Yes--

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:42.150
BRICE CHALLAMEL:
And [INAUDIBLE]??

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:43.480
KENDRICK NGUYEN: --definitely.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.670
I was general counsel
for AngelList.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:49.110
And we spun out and set
up shop in New York.

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:51.780
Because that's the seat
of the capital market.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.810
And most people still have
never invested privately.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.300
So our team are
probably slightly

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.850
different than a lot of true
tech startup in the valley,

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:02.730
but we're pretty
equal, purposely

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:07.020
so, between engineering,
business, and then obviously,

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.330
compliance being an
investment company.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:12.120
There are about 50 of us.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.860
Most of us are in New York.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.960
There's a small office
in San Francisco.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.090
Among the team, there's
seven former attorneys

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:23.310
turned business or engineer
to navigate this confluence

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:25.440
of legal and innovation.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.860
And we have a mildly
distributed team.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.070
But there's still a core
team based out of New York.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:33.885
BRICE CHALLAMEL:
All right, and here,

00:35:33.885 --> 00:35:36.570
what I meant to get from
you, which I do get,

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:39.540
is that this is
not just you or two

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.273
or three people in a garage.

00:35:41.273 --> 00:35:44.443
This is solidly enough
organized already

00:35:44.443 --> 00:35:46.860
that you have some very serious
people in every department

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.412
of this making sure that this
work is sustainable, and is

00:35:49.412 --> 00:35:51.120
efficient, and compliant,
and everything.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.037
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Oh,
absolutely, because we're

00:35:53.037 --> 00:35:57.090
so heavily regulated for
touching retail investor.

00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:00.060
I think we've been audited
something like a dozen times

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.650
by FINRA and the SEC in
two and a half years.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:05.760
That's why we have so
many lawyers in-house.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.990
We have, on the
business bench, people

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:12.510
who have background experience
at BlackRock, at McKinsey.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.670
One of our founding
advisors founded

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:18.330
the Malala Fund, whose work
got Malala the Nobel Peace

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:21.990
Prize-- so influencers
and what have you,

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:26.645
Jason Kidd, the athlete, is a--
and Chamillionaire, the rapper,

00:36:26.645 --> 00:36:30.550
are both advisors and
influencers for us.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:34.170
So to do, and to
build on, this vision,

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:35.730
it takes more than a village.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.090
It takes partnership
and the goodwill

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.480
of people across all
different sectors of society.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.980
AUDIENCE: I know
that it's very hard

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.850
to determine a
valuation of a company,

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:48.070
particularly very early on.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:50.010
So what is Republic's
involvement

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:54.310
in valuing a company
before they create

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:55.660
an offering on your site?

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:59.320
And how will that scale as
you have thousands or millions

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.903
of companies on your platform?

00:37:01.903 --> 00:37:03.820
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Thanks
again for the question

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.730
on valuation and due diligence.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.080
So in the past two and a
half years, we've gotten,

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.990
I think, by now, almost
5,000 applications.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:12.970
And we've done
due diligence on--

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:16.000
depending on the level of due
diligence, but on all of them.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.110
And we've launched less
than 5% on Republic.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:24.160
When it comes to valuation,
there's actually no real math,

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.600
particularly for
an early company.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.450
Your valuation is
whatever investors

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:30.220
are willing to invest in you.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:35.860
So we typically look at if
they have raised money before,

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.380
then use that as a
potential point of data.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:42.290
If they have never
raised money before,

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:45.820
then we want to make sure
that it is at least in line

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.280
with the current ecosystem.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.370
To give you an example,
YC startups typically

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:54.310
raise at about $10
million, $15 million

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:59.140
in valuation pre-product,
pre-market, just two dudes.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:02.770
In New York, the same
team, out of New York City,

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:06.820
would be probably 25%,
30% less in valuation.

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.100
Because venture
capitalists in New York

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:12.200
aren't just as willing
to fund a company

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.160
that's valued at $15
million pre-market.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.280
So applying all of
these relative lens

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.100
that we pass a reasonableness--

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.920
and it's still up to the
founders to do their work,

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.460
and convince investors, and
strangers, and families,

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.125
and friends to make
that investment.

00:38:30.125 --> 00:38:31.500
AUDIENCE: Kendrick,
what are some

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.890
of the challenges of
expanding these investment

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:39.838
opportunities to international
markets outside of the US?

00:38:39.838 --> 00:38:41.130
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Thanks, Colby.

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:44.130
On our platform
today, the companies

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:46.170
have to be based
in the US for now,

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:48.600
even though we have partnership
with different platforms

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.835
in other continents.

00:38:49.835 --> 00:38:51.210
But we have
investors from, like,

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:56.640
30 or 40 countries around the
world investing on Republic.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.010
Going back to a
rather trite statement

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.860
that good ideas
exist everywhere,

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.230
I really look forward
to the day where

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:09.330
people here and in New York,
at lunchtime, go on it,

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:12.340
look at a bunch of companies
in Africa or Latin America,

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:16.320
and dish out a small amount,
and happen to build and make

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:20.380
meaningful businesses that
create jobs in those regions.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.320
So the future is
very much global

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.518
when it comes to
entrepreneurship.

00:39:24.518 --> 00:39:26.310
AUDIENCE: So you talk
about micro-investing

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:29.340
and invest $20 or
$30 per company.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:32.040
But given the high risk
of early-stage startups,

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.400
one has to invest many more,
say, 100, 200 companies,

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.270
to average that rates in return.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:39.540
So how do you think the
average John Doe can

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:42.420
manage such a large portfolio?

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.760
KENDRICK NGUYEN: When it
comes to the very high risk

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.830
of angel investing,
the name of the game

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:49.140
is diversification,
as you mentioned.

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:52.830
So on AngelList, as an
example, the minimum amount

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:55.080
usually is higher than $1,000.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.900
But that lowest has
got to be $1,000.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:02.700
That's a lot of money for
most people in this world.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.100
If you can reduce
that down to $100

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.880
and allow $10 investment
into 10 companies,

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.823
that changes the
landscape of things.

00:40:10.823 --> 00:40:13.240
And hopefully, at one point,
we can even bring it down to,

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.070
like, $5 and $2.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:17.610
My family immigrated
here from Vietnam.

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:19.380
And I remember, when
we first moved here,

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.110
my mom used to send
back, like, $100

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.450
a month to a couple
of her sisters.

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:28.110
The transaction fee on that
transaction was, I think,

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:33.810
$13 or $14 to the sister in
a larger city and, like, $17

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:38.770
to someone in a smaller
town, which is absurd.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:41.190
But it was-- that's what
everyone lived with.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:43.230
Now, in a day,
given that Vietnam

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:45.938
is a very warm to
crypto technology,

00:40:45.938 --> 00:40:47.355
you can make the
same transaction,

00:40:47.355 --> 00:40:49.770
and the fee will be
less than a dollar.

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:52.020
So-- and we're two--

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.540
we're like 2:00 AM
into this new day.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:57.750
So I have no doubt that
a couple years ago,

00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:00.840
a person with a $50 saving--

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.960
not the money that she needs
to put food on the table--

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.130
would be able to deploy that
$50 into 10 or 20 companies

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:10.740
and still potentially get a
meaningful return out of it,

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.540
net-net down the road.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.610
AUDIENCE: Is this
micro-transaction model really

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.943
better than the AngelList
syndicate model where you have

00:41:16.943 --> 00:41:20.850
some professional that goes
in and vets the invest--

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.763
the companies a
little better first?

00:41:22.763 --> 00:41:24.930
Because we know that even
some of the best investors

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:29.610
don't actually succeed
better than the S&amp;P 500.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:32.460
KENDRICK NGUYEN: The question
about venture validation

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.250
and elite investor
investing is addressed

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:36.720
in two different ways.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.910
Just because you
allow micro-investing,

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:42.150
it doesn't mean that you
wouldn't have that validation.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:46.890
So I think 27% or 28% of
the companies on Republic

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:51.220
had been venture-backed, so
already went through that lens.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:55.650
Now on the other hand, the
problem with venture investing

00:41:55.650 --> 00:42:00.240
is that a fund, like Sequoia,
would only pick startups that

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.300
they think, potentially,
can yield them--

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.190
the proverbial "unicorn"--

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:07.860
50x, at the very least, 20x.

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:09.670
5x-- not interesting.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:10.560
It's not enough.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.200
That fits into their
economic model.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.870
If you have two
founders building

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:20.580
a business in East Oakland, they
will never be more than a $20

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.420
million company.

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:27.720
But that creates 500 jobs for
single moms in East Oakland.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.210
And you happen to
just want to support

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:34.740
that particular business
and get 2x or 3x back.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:38.970
Currently, you don't have
that avenue on AngelList

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:40.740
or with any venture fund.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.140
So if you [INAUDIBLE]
entrepreneurship and investing,

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.580
it has to be--

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:48.770
Silicon Valley has done a lot
of good, but that's like V2.

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:51.120
We now are ready
for that next stage

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.780
that people have a say in
the type of businesses that

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.000
get financed and that will
create a world that we'll

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.800
be living in 10 years from now.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.050
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned that Republic

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.515
will take a portion
of the companies that

00:43:05.515 --> 00:43:06.390
are on your platform.

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:07.515
Can you share what that is?

00:43:07.515 --> 00:43:09.630
And is that consistent
for each company?

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:10.505
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Yes.

00:43:10.505 --> 00:43:14.100
So currently, I'm just going to
use a very specific use case.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:19.220
So there's a company that
raised on Republic when we first

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.860
launched six months
out, and now she

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.820
has gone on to raise
additional capital from VC.

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:29.360
The founder, a Latina
mom who was working

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.090
for a corporate-- in
corporate for a grocery

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:34.700
chain, doesn't have a
technical background,

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:38.660
doesn't fit the lens of someone
who would get venture backing.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.840
And she just needed
that $50,000, $60,000

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:46.610
to build out the first
model, hire an engineer

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:48.620
and a businessperson, and grow.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.290
So we were like, all
right, we think that she's

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:52.910
incredible and resilient.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:55.190
And her experience
saving money is

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:57.240
so relevant to
building a business.

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.700
So we launched a campaign.

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.580
And she raised about $80,000.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:05.630
A lot of it was financed by
Latino-American professionals

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:08.030
in the Bay Area and beyond.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:13.040
Out of that $80,000,
the time and money

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.320
that we've deployed
into it was probably--

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:19.340
I'm going to guess-- $20,000,
it being the very first project.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:24.350
But the math is that we get 6%
out of the amount successfully

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:27.200
raised, so 6% of $80,000.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:32.030
Plus, we get a security
interest in her company

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:34.280
worth 2% of the amount raised--

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:39.630
so in this case, $1,600
worth of her equity.

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:44.580
If she-- she's building an
employment training platform

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:49.110
that trains very low-level
employees to mid-level

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:50.660
management--

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:54.110
the shopping bag,
cashier at Safeway

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:57.910
and Lucky into
assistant manager.

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:00.630
If she somehow becomes
the LinkedIn of the world,

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:02.260
that 1.6--

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:06.692
that one $1,600 stake that we
have may be worth millions.

00:45:06.692 --> 00:45:08.150
And if that's the
case, we're going

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:10.253
to send that back
to investors onward.

00:45:10.253 --> 00:45:12.670
BRICE CHALLAMEL: Thank you so
much, Kendrick, for joining.

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:14.295
And I want to thank
you for two things.

00:45:14.295 --> 00:45:16.780
The first thing
is sharing with us

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.930
your knowledge, and
your experience,

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:23.920
and your company's
history, and life,

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.080
and mission, which
was very interesting.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.580
And the other thing,
also, is I want

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:29.083
to thank you for
sharing your story,

00:45:29.083 --> 00:45:30.250
because it's very inspiring.

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:35.800
You, coming from Vietnam,
having grown to be a Stanford--

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.100
fellow at Stanford Law,
becoming an entrepreneur,

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.950
connecting back to the world,
giving it back to the world--

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:45.230
As you know, at Google, we
really embrace diversity.

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:47.207
We want not only
diversity, but inclusion.

00:45:47.207 --> 00:45:49.040
Like, it's not only
you're in the nightclub,

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.740
but you're invited to
dance, right-- so inclusion.

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:56.210
And everything you say
spins a positive light

00:45:56.210 --> 00:46:01.090
on the world, on how it's doing,
and how it's going to become,

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:03.190
and on these values
that we hold very dear.

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:05.140
And you're a living
example of those values,

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:08.240
connecting technology
to good business,

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.180
to good value and
initiatives from people,

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.930
respecting-- what we
call here, respecting

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:16.340
the opportunity, and all this in
great ethics and transparency.

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.918
So thank you for all of this.

00:46:17.918 --> 00:46:19.210
This was a pleasure having you.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:20.968
I'm so thrilled to
have had you today.

00:46:20.968 --> 00:46:22.510
And I'm looking
forward to everything

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:24.940
that's going to happen for
Republic in the coming years.

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:26.920
And I want to wish you the
best of success with this.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.790
KENDRICK NGUYEN: Thank
you so much, Bryce.

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:29.082
It's truly an honor to be here.

00:46:29.082 --> 00:46:31.468
And I want to thank everybody
at Google for having me.

00:46:31.468 --> 00:46:32.260
I think the model--

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:32.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.700
--of do good is something
that's close to my heart.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.210
Google was the first company
that put do good together

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:40.340
with profit.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.730
And that's what gave
rise to Republic.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:44.350
And you know, on
the personal level,

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:45.820
it's, incrementally,
we do what we

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:48.958
can to live up to something
that you guys have perpetuated

00:46:48.958 --> 00:46:50.000
all throughout the globe.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.010
So thank you so much.

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:51.910
BRICE CHALLAMEL:
All right, pleasure.

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:52.390
Thank you very much.

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:53.223
Thank you very much.

00:46:53.223 --> 00:46:56.340
[APPLAUSE]
