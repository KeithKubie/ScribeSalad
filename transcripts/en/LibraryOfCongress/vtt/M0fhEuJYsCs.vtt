00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.380
&gt;&gt; The Law Library of Congress
holds a collection of trials

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.250
in its rare book collection.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.350
This particular trial was a
sensation and is often thought

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.960
of as the trial of the
century for the 19th century.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.290
Morris Cohen's Bibliogragy

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.780
of Early American Law lists
several reports of this case.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.670
This particular one was
published by R.M. De Witt as one

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.410
of Dewitt's Special Reports

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.530
and is reported by
Felix G. Fontaine.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.570
It started when the wife of Rep.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.870
Daniel Sickles, Teresa
Sickles, had an affair

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.080
with Philip Barton Key.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.440
Philip Key was the son
of Francis Scott Key,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.690
who you may know as the author
of the Star Spangled Banner.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.010
It has been said that all
of Washington society knew

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.230
of his wife's affair
except for Sickles,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.930
until one day he received a
mysterious note signed "R.P.G."

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.300
that revealed the affair and
how Key contacted Teresa.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.170
Sickles confronted Teresa

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.750
and made her write a
handwritten confession

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.400
that was later published.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.460
As Sickles and his friends
were discussing what to do

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.500
about the situation, they
spotted Key signaling Teresa

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.110
from the street with
his handkerchief.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.470
Sickles confronted
Key in the street.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.560
Armed with two derringers
and a revolver,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.460
Sickles fired upon Key,
but only grazed him.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.090
Key reached into his own
coat for a means of defense,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.660
but found only opera glasses,
which he threw at Sickles.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.280
Key wrestled with Sickles,
and Sickles dropped his gun.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.950
Freeing himself from Key's grip,
Sickles produced another gun,

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.220
and Key began to stumble
backwards, crying,

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.490
"Don't shoot me,
don't murder me!"

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.240
Sickles fired, striking
Key in the groin.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.910
Key fell, and Sickles
drove a point-blank shot

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.560
into Key's chest.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.990
Finally, Sickles put
a gun to Key's head

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.460
and pulled the trigger,
but the gun misfired.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.330
A group of men arrived
on the scene,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.630
and Sickles was led away
while Key lay dying.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.030
It would seem Sickles would
almost certainly be convicted

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.080
of murder, but he was defended
by a team of prominent lawyers,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.320
including the future Secretary
of War, Edwin Stanton.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.940
The defense successfully argued
that Sickles was in a state

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.240
of temporary insanity.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.830
Sickles later served as a
Union General at the Battle

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.940
of Gettysburg where he
was struck by cannon fire,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.480
resulting in the
amputation of his leg.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.900
Sickles' leg is periodically
displayed at the National Museum

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.480
of Health and Medicine.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.090
&gt;&gt; This has been a
presentation of the Library

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.670
of Congress, visit
