00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.930
Now that we have a
decent understanding

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.429
of how to figure out how many
significant figures we're even

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:06.780
dealing with, let's
think about a situation

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.150
where significant figures
will or might become relevant.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.870
So let's say that I
have a carpet here.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.860
And using maybe a
meter stick, I'm

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.130
able to measure the carpet
to the nearest centimeter.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.160
And so I get the carpet as--
to the nearest centimeter,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.760
I get it to being 1.69 meters.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.390
So this 9, obviously, this
is to the nearest centimeter.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.840
This 9/100 of a meter is the
same thing as 9 centimeters.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.180
And let's say I'm able
to measure the width here

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.754
as 2.09 meters.

00:00:44.754 --> 00:00:46.485
I use the same meter stick.

00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:47.860
And you were to
ask me, Sal, what

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.990
is the area of your carpet?

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.320
And so I'd just do the
straight-up calculation.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.980
The area is just going to be
the length times the width,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.530
so it would be 1.69
meters times 2.09 meters.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.670
And we could do this by
hand, but let me just get

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.210
the calculator out just to make
things move along a little bit

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.060
faster.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.620
And so we have 1.69 times 2.09.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.330
And that gives us 3.5321.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.370
Let me write that down-- 3.5321.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.880
So let me write
this in a new color.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.180
So this gives us
3.5321, and we have

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.230
a meters times a
meters, which gives us

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.710
meters squared or square meters.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.620
And so I might very
proudly tell you,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.880
hey, the area here is
3.5321 square meters.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.200
And the problem here
is that when I give you

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.987
this thing that has
all of these numbers

00:01:49.987 --> 00:01:52.195
behind the decimal point
and all of these what we now

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:53.700
know to be significant
figures, it

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.190
implies that I had a really
precise way of measuring

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.690
the area.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.060
Well, in reality, I only
was able to measure the area

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.090
to the nearest centimeter.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.860
So the way we would
do this so that I

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.550
don't make it look
like my measurement

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.110
is more precise
than it really is.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.240
Or this calculation that's
derived from my measurements--

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.110
I make sure that it has no more
significant figures than either

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.010
of the numbers
that I multiplied.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.650
So in this situation, I have
three significant figures here.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.750
And over here, I have
three significant figures.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.740
And so in general, when
you multiply or divide,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:41.890
the significant figures in your
product or-- I always forget.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.608
There's the divisor,
there's the dividend,

00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:46.985
and there's the quotient.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.680
The significant figures in your
product or your quotient cannot

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.331
be any more than the least
number of significant digits

00:02:58.331 --> 00:03:00.580
in whatever you are using
to come up with that product

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.440
or quotient.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.250
So over here, both of these
have three significant figures.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.700
So I can only have three
significant figures

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.189
in my product.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.730
If this had three
significant figures

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.410
and this had two
significant figures,

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.580
I could have only have
two significant figures

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.680
in my product.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.520
So in order to be
kind of legit here,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.090
I have to round this to
three significant figures.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.370
So I'm going to round to
the nearest hundredth here.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.200
And so this 2 we'll round down.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.330
So this gets us to
3.53 meters squared.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.770
And now we're cool with
the significant figures.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.360
Let's do another
situation with division.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.680
Let's say that I'm laying
tiles down in my bathroom.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.170
And so the diagram
will look very similar.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:03.229
And I measure the width of
my bathroom to be-- I'll

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:04.020
do it in feet, now.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.012
So let's say it is 10.1 feet.

00:04:09.012 --> 00:04:11.470
And this is the precision that
I'm able to measure it with.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.460
So I'm able to measure it to
the nearest tenth of a foot.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:22.880
And let's say that the length
of my floor-- I'll just make up

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.420
a number-- is 12 point--
and for whatever reason,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.090
I was able to measure this with
slightly higher precision, so

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.400
12.07 feet.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.140
And let's say that I have tiles.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.930
And the tile has an area--
so someone else measured it

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.920
for me.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:54.756
Let's say that the area of
this tile is 1.07 feet squared.

00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:56.462
And this was just
measured for me.

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:59.770
And I want to do is I want
to figure out how many tiles

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.280
can fit on this bathroom floor.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.710
So what I would do
is I would figure out

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.230
the area of this bathroom
floor and then divide

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.330
by the area of the tiles.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:17.910
And so the area of the
bathroom floor, so floor area

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:25.570
is going to be equal to
10.1 feet times 12.07 feet.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:31.690
And so that will give
us-- let's calculate it.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.065
It is 10.1 times 12.07 feet.

00:05:37.065 --> 00:05:42.370
So it gives us 121.907.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.150
So this is equal to-- let
me scroll over a little bit

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.790
to the right.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.740
I could go a little
bit more to the right.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:56.580
This is equal to 121.907
feet squared, or square feet.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.660
Now, we're not done
with our calculation.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.410
But there might be a
temptation right here

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.490
to say, look, I had four
significant figures over here.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.900
I have three significant
figures over here.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.890
There would be a temptation to
say, look, my area should not

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.830
have more than three
significant figures.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.770
And that temptation
would be OK if this

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.940
is all you were looking
for, if the final answer

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.650
you were looking for was
the area of the floor.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.720
But we're not done
with our calculation.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.680
We want to figure out
how many of these tiles

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.614
will fit into this area.

00:06:25.614 --> 00:06:27.030
And so the general
rule of thumb--

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.530
because you don't want
to lose information.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.360
The general rule
of thumb is don't

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.430
round to significant
figures until you

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.120
are done with your calculation,
especially if you're just

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.490
doing a bunch of
multiplying and dividing.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.680
Because otherwise,
if you round here,

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.620
you actually will introduce
more error into your calculation

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.500
than you'd want to.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.250
So what you do is you keep it
as kind of the full number.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.509
Now you do the division.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:50.550
So let's do the division.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:57.920
So the tiles per floor-- I
guess we could say my bathroom,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:04.540
or tiles in the bathroom,
tiles fitting in bathroom,

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.180
in the floor of this bathroom.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.640
It would be the area of the
bathroom, so 121.907 feet

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.120
squared, divided by the
area of the tile, divided

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.180
by 1.07 feet squared.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.460
And once again, let me
get the calculator out.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:29.680
And so we have 121.907
divided by 1.07.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.500
And you get this crazy thing
with all of these digits.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.320
But this is going to
be our final answer,

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.970
so here we do care about
significant figures.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.790
So tiles fitting
in the bathroom,

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.160
we get something that
actually just keeps going.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.620
Let me write this
in a new color.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:49.760
We get 113.931775701--
and it actually

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.941
just keeps going-- feet squared.

00:07:51.941 --> 00:07:53.440
And since this is
the final answer--

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.700
we care about how many tiles
will fit onto this bathroom

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.924
floor-- now the significant
figures come into play.

00:07:59.924 --> 00:08:01.340
And the way to
think about this is

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.090
I have four significant
figures over here.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.720
I have two significant
figures over here.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.400
I have three significant
figures over here.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:15.720
And since we did just a bunch
of multiplying and dividing,

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.250
we have to have the minimum.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.280
Whatever is the minimum
significant figures

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.780
of the things that
we computed with,

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.520
that's how many
significant figures

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.950
we can have in our final answer.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:24.950
Oh, and let me make this clear.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.366
This isn't two significant
figures, this is three-- the 1,

00:08:27.366 --> 00:08:28.350
the 0, and the 1.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:33.980
So our final answer can only
have three significant figures.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.919
So we need to round
to the nearest foot.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:42.120
The next digit over is a 9,
so we're going to round up.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.480
So this will get us to 114.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.450
Actually, the units here
aren't in square feet.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:48.910
This is in tiles.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.660
This is feet divided
by feet, and so this

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.490
is going to be 114 tiles.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.290
Obviously, it's not going
to be exactly 114 tiles.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:03.040
But based on the precision of
the measurements we've done,

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.499
we can say 114 tiles.

00:09:04.499 --> 00:09:06.290
Now, what I have just
showed you right here

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.187
is when we multiply
and divide measurements

00:09:09.187 --> 00:09:11.270
that have a certain number
of significant figures.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.055
The general rule of
thumb is whatever

00:09:13.055 --> 00:09:15.370
is the minimum number of
significant figures in any

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.744
of the numbers
you've calculated,

00:09:16.744 --> 00:09:19.390
that's how many significant
figures-- or the least number

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.050
is the number of significant
figures in your final quotient

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.060
or product or answer.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.184
When you do addition
and subtraction,

00:09:26.184 --> 00:09:27.350
it's a little bit different.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.770
And we'll cover that
in the next video.
