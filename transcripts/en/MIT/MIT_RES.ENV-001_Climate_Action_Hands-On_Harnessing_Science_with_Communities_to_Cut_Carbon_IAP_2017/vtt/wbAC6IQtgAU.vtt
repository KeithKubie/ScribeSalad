00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.437
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: The more
we can measure volume,

00:00:25.437 --> 00:00:28.510
the more we'll be able to follow
the recent law we got passed

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.840
that says they have to
prioritize the highest

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.807
volume for climate hazard.

00:00:33.807 --> 00:00:34.640
So that's a new law.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.185
They never got to do it, so
now they need the information,

00:00:38.185 --> 00:00:41.623
and they've never
gotten [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:41.623 --> 00:00:42.790
cared about explosion risk.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.110
The president of Eversource
Gas in the meeting recently, he

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.877
was very talkative,
and he started

00:00:48.877 --> 00:00:50.460
talking about how
there's new research

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.762
and development in natural gas
restructure in the US period.

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:54.470
They don't do it.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.080
No one else does it-- that
they go to France, England,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.194
and Germany, because they
invest in R&amp;D for this field,

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:02.610
and they find out
what's going on.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.776
And they're way ahead of us.

00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:07.670
They're way ahead
of us over there,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.220
which was really
interesting to me to hear.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.665
And they, in that
room, there was

00:01:14.665 --> 00:01:16.940
no doubt they have no
idea what the problem is.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.220
They don't measure it.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.390
They don't document it.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.660
And from what we
can tell so far,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.030
there's no acceptable
norm on how to measure it.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.510
So there is these two really
kind of kludgy methods to me,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.705
and then there's--

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:34.900
I mean, we're trying to
invent a method that's

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.650
actually the utilities
can go out and do.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.796
Because the guys on the
ground have to do it.

00:01:39.796 --> 00:01:41.670
DAVID OLIVER: You know
what's kind of funny--

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.503
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: Yeah?

00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:44.440
DAVID OLIVER: --is
that you can find it

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.540
when it's, you know, sort of
naturally occurring and worth

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.278
something to us, but we
can't find it when it's

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:52.740
going through our own system.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.797
It's sad.

00:01:54.797 --> 00:01:56.380
And it's three feet
below the surface.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.046
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: Piece
of data on volume--

00:01:58.046 --> 00:02:00.030
did you tell them about
the Harvard study?

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.690
AUDREY SCHULMAN:
Yeah, I did earlier.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.070
So we know how much there is
from the top down from the,

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.570
you know--

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.850
in the atmosphere, we know
how much gas there is,

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.072
but we don't know where the
most-- you know, that 5%--

00:02:11.072 --> 00:02:14.380
5% to 7% of the
worst gas leaks are.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.000
So this is-- we have to
come up with a method to--

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.695
when they're about
to repair the leak--

00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:23.070
after they've pinpointed what
they think is a high-volume

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.029
leak, how do we--

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.870
SPEAKER 1: Verify that
that's a [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.250
SPEAKER 2: Do we have on that
global thing, gas in, gas out?

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.486
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:39.407
Over time, by--

00:02:39.407 --> 00:02:41.240
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: It doesn't
match the outside.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.906
SPEAKER 2: Well, of
course it shouldn't.

00:02:42.906 --> 00:02:45.680
Leakage is def-- but how is
that changing all the time?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.980
AUDREY SCHULMAN: So the
utilities have crappy data.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.980
They have crappy meters.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.180
They have crappy everything.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.320
So they have no-- so your meter
at your house is not a very

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.100
good, you know,
temperature changes--

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.080
SPEAKER 2: It's
right, plus or minus

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.926
x, where x is too big a number.

00:02:59.926 --> 00:03:02.140
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah, the
margin of error is huge.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.260
What this is-- just
to give the idea

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.760
that we've come up
with after months

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.115
of working with the utilities
and ripping information out

00:03:09.115 --> 00:03:13.420
of them is to use these
two instruments when

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.210
they-- so they pinpointed--
so this is that point

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.460
that they pinpointed the
high volume-- what they think

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.960
is a high-volume leak.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.340
And in order to do that, they
drill holes in the streets.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.240
So they found using this
instrument and another one--

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.200
they found that there's
gas in the area.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.170
And they stuck this, with a
probe on it, into the soil,

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.850
and they found sort of the leak
extent, the area in the ground

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.860
that has a lot of gas in it.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.590
And then they drill
holes in the streets.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.170
So maybe, let's say, it
goes from 21 Smith street

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.300
to 25 Smith street,
and then they

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.356
drill holes in the street
along there and use this again.

00:03:53.356 --> 00:03:54.980
They put the probe
in each of the holes

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.000
in the street over the pipe.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Should I draw a picture?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.865
Does this--

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:03.490
SPEAKER 3: They don't drill into
the pipe-- just over the pipe.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.781
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Over the pipe.

00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:07.090
And they stick this probe
in and find out where

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.818
the highest percent of gas is.

00:04:09.818 --> 00:04:14.260
DAVID OLIVER: So they're working
with a map of the pipes, right?

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.850
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: They usually have
a printed out, like, sketchy

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.539
little map with a line,
and it's approximate.

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:21.990
I've watched them do it.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.220
It's close.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.210
They kind of know
where their pipe is.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.310
AUDREY SCHULMAN: They
drill holes in the street.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.360
They take this thing-- and
stick the probe in those holes

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.460
and find out where the
highest gas is-- the highest

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.240
percentage of gas is.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.430
And so, then they
excavate at that point,

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.584
because they assume the
leak was right there.

00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:45.500
SPEAKER 3: And they
admitted how often they're

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.877
right when they do that?

00:04:46.877 --> 00:04:48.960
AUDREY SCHULMAN: They do
not share any information

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.930
at all of any kind.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.704
SPEAKER 3: All right,
the latest theory--

00:04:51.704 --> 00:04:54.120
AUDREY SCHULMAN: They believe
this method works very well,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.664
but anybody who's
looked at streets,

00:04:56.664 --> 00:04:58.330
you'll see lots of,
like patches, right,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.890
when at any time, they--
so sometimes they screw up.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.570
How often?

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.360
We don't know.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.334
SPEAKER 2: Go look at
the [INAUDIBLE] wells.

00:05:04.334 --> 00:05:05.238
Just go look at it.

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:08.504
They just repainted
it, and it's already--

00:05:08.504 --> 00:05:10.170
AUDREY SCHULMAN: So
if they're confused.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.110
If say, this is
100%, this is 100%,

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.110
this is 100%, they
don't where the leak is,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.770
what they do is they use this.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.960
They stick that in down
into the hole that they've--

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.180
one of these holes.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.800
They put a compressor
in this side,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.010
and they open this valve--

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.680
so, already, I
guess it is open--

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.450
so that 80 pounds per
square inch of air

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.490
is being blown across here.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.390
This is a hollow tube, so it
sucks air up really quickly.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.900
And this plunger
gets pushed down,

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.134
so that it's sealed
to the street.

00:05:51.134 --> 00:05:52.050
Does that makes sense?

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.367
SPEAKER 3: Mhm.

00:05:53.367 --> 00:05:55.200
AUDREY SCHULMAN: So air
is being pulled out,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.760
you know, really quickly.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.540
It's a vacuum-- drags all
the gas out of the ground,

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.985
and that way, they
vacuum all the gas out

00:06:02.985 --> 00:06:05.490
from this entire area.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.430
And then they use the
CGI again to this thing

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.810
to see where the gas is
coming back up fastest,

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.315
and that's where they
excavate to fix the leak.

00:06:15.315 --> 00:06:16.190
Does that make sense?

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.470
SPEAKER 3: Yes, I get it.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.900
AUDREY SCHULMAN:
So we want to use

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.180
this tool in a different way
to find how big the leak is.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.070
So instead, once
they pin the leak--

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.120
once they found the leak, we
want to take this and put it

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.140
in the ground.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.670
Again, attach a regulate--
a compressor here,

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:42.780
blow the air out, and put a
combustible gas indicator here

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.740
to see what the percentage
is of gas coming out of it.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.360
By doing that, we will know how
much the flow-through, right--

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.580
because it's 80 pounds per
square inch coming out of here,

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.180
and we'll know the
percentage of gas.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.060
And using that, we can get
a rough idea of how much,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.840
how big the leak is, how
much gas is coming out

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.170
and how quickly.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.034
Does that make sense?

00:07:07.034 --> 00:07:07.950
SPEAKER 4: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:08.695
AUDREY SCHULMAN:
This is a purger.

00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:10.260
We only learned
about it on Friday.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.681
I am so excited to have it here.

00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:14.142
SPEAKER 5: It's
called a diffuser.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:15.225
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Diffuser.

00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:20.020
DAVID OLIVER: The message
that you described

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.120
sounds like it will
tell you roughly

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.416
how much gas was trapped in the
area that you were evacuating,

00:07:28.416 --> 00:07:32.810
which might not be adjacent
to the leak-- it could travel

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.950
and then get trapped.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.340
AUDREY SCHULMAN: So you have
to wait for a steady state

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:35.849
reading.

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:36.640
DAVID OLIVER: True.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.960
AUDREY SCHULMAN: So
the gas will pocket up

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.230
underneath the pavement,
because gas is lighter than air.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.170
And so, you will get
a sort of pool of gas

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.830
right up against the pavement,
and for the first few minutes,

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.920
you're going to pull
out that residual--

00:07:51.920 --> 00:08:00.740
SPEAKER 2: So don't you also
[INAUDIBLE] nature of that

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.550
substance--

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.777
sand, clay, dirt.

00:08:04.777 --> 00:08:05.860
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Aha, yes.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.297
Whether it's wet, whether
it's dry, and yes,

00:08:09.297 --> 00:08:10.130
the temperature is--

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.504
SPEAKER 2: --what the nature
is of that diffusing material.

00:08:13.504 --> 00:08:17.124
AUDREY SCHULMAN: To get an exact
measurement, yes, we would.

00:08:17.124 --> 00:08:19.900
But the high-volume leaks
are 10 times bigger--

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.237
more bigger than that the
low-volume leaks, so got to--

00:08:23.237 --> 00:08:24.820
SPEAKER 2: So that
shouldn't matter --

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.986
AUDREY SCHULMAN: So you've
got an order of magnitude

00:08:26.986 --> 00:08:29.490
difference, so all that
stuff hopefully will be--

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.700
I mean, we'll have to find out.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.760
But I think this
method will work enough

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.020
to get us in the ball
field, so that we can say,

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.248
high volume, not
high volume, higher--

00:08:38.248 --> 00:08:40.039
you know, we just want
to bucket the leaks,

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.130
basically, categorize them.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.100
DAVID OLIVER: I got a question.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.960
So they're fixing--
they're trying

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:52.080
to fix what will be categorized
as high-volume, right?

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.211
They're not trying to fix
everything that they find,

00:08:55.211 --> 00:08:55.710
right?

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.251
AUDREY SCHULMAN:
Right, this law that

00:08:57.251 --> 00:09:00.459
got passed is simply to
fix the high-volume leaks.

00:09:00.459 --> 00:09:01.250
DAVID OLIVER: Yeah.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.950
But, you know, when they go
and they do their testing,

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.750
and they get a
series of readings,

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.210
they basically guess
where they think

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.120
the high volume
is, fix that joint,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.443
and then they forget about
what's 12 feet that way

00:09:19.443 --> 00:09:20.892
and 12 feet that way.

00:09:23.435 --> 00:09:24.310
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yes.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.930
You mean there could
be another leak?

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:26.570
Is that what you're--

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.611
DAVID OLIVER: Well, sure.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.780
I mean, in the case of
they picked the wrong one,

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.636
and there's still a
high-volume leak there--

00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:37.170
and it's that that doesn't
get found until maybe they

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.929
come back to the same spot.

00:09:39.929 --> 00:09:40.970
SPEAKER 2: Well, back up.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.400
How do they determine?

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.980
Is there another step once
they picked the highest volume

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.240
and dug to the ground?

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.010
I've watched them--
a physical test

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:56.980
of identifying a real leak--
you know, pipe, gas spewing out

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.580
at the actual leak
once it's uncovered.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.580
Is that a standard
process, or do they--

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.100
to your own point, there
may only be one leak.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.148
There's a physical
identification of the leak

00:10:09.148 --> 00:10:11.096
once they've decided
to take action.

00:10:11.096 --> 00:10:11.970
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yes.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.840
But we can--

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.050
SPEAKER 2: There could
be five or six of them.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.660
AUDREY SCHULMAN: We have
to assume they somewhat

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.868
know their job, so they can--

00:10:16.868 --> 00:10:19.120
they'll find the leak,
and they'll fix it.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.010
And afterwards--
and a lot of these

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:26.950
might be weak complexes,
which means many leaks

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:31.390
along the way in which case
the whole area, that 21 to 25

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.010
Smith street is a
leak complex, and they

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:35.540
have to fix all those leaks.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.330
So they should use this method
to measure the emissions off

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.930
of each one of those
sub-leaks and then add them up

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.420
into one high-volume leak.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.980
So the utilities
use the word leak

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.920
in a very different
way than we do,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.340
which is like leak location.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.400
So then we will be adding
up all the emissions, which

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.720
means that this method
should not suck the gas out

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.050
of more than one leak.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.760
Or if it does, we will
have to figure out how to--

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.820
DAVID OLIVER: Yeah,
I think it might.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.500
I would imagine that if
you have gas pooling,

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.800
or you have multiple
leaks, there's

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.744
going to be some
connection between them?

00:11:16.744 --> 00:11:17.660
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.368
DAVID OLIVER: So if
you create a volume--

00:11:19.368 --> 00:11:22.134
a vacuum here, it's going to
start pulling from the other.

00:11:22.134 --> 00:11:23.050
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.150
So one of the things
we possibly can do

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.000
is there's going to be somewhere
it's just going to be one leak,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.950
and using that data,
we can figure out

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.940
what the average leak is.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.760
And therefore, when we have a
leak location, a leak complex,

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.890
we can hopefully
figure out how much

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.180
overage there is--
how much excess gas

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.790
we're pulling in
from the others.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.380
Yeah, so the things
I think we need--

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.790
I think we need two things.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.090
One is some sort of
regulator to step this down,

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.195
so the compressor
coming in at 80 PSI in.

00:11:53.195 --> 00:11:55.570
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: Well, the other
thing is this says 80 PSI,

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.872
but the guys in the truck
say their compressor is 120.

00:11:57.872 --> 00:11:59.110
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.880
So some sort of--

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.960
DAVID OLIVER: [INAUDIBLE] crank
it up all the way up though.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.001
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: And so,
how do we make sure what--

00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:05.650
because if we don't
know pressure.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.390
AUDREY SCHULMAN: If we don't
have the known rate of speed

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.900
across here, the data's crap.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:16.300
And we also don't want to vacuum
up higher than the operating

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.940
pressure of the pipe.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:18.483
So the pipe--

00:12:18.483 --> 00:12:18.811
DAVID OLIVER:
Because then you'll

00:12:18.811 --> 00:12:20.120
just draw it out of the pipe?

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:20.330
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Right.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.788
And it will be
increasing the leak,

00:12:21.788 --> 00:12:24.400
and it will be
crappy data again.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.300
Does that make sense?

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.133
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: Yeah.

00:12:26.133 --> 00:12:27.610
AUDREY SCHULMAN:
So these pipes can

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:32.800
be anywhere from 0.5, that
we're going to be working with,

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.490
to 60 PSI, so 120 times--

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.556
so that's a difficult
problem on its own.

00:12:39.556 --> 00:12:40.930
So we need some
sort of regulator

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.460
that will not
increase-- you know,

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:46.280
that probably is
going to at 0.5 PSI,

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.060
so we have to step
this down enormously.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.390
So that's one problem, and
I don't know if that's true.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.200
So I am not a scientist,
so anybody who wants to--

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.784
DAVID OLIVER: Yeah,
I mean, putting

00:12:56.784 --> 00:12:58.200
80 PSI on that
doesn't mean you're

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.350
going to create an 80 PSI--

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:04.830
a negative 80 PSI
vacuum, but there

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.087
is a correlation [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:06.087 --> 00:13:08.170
AUDREY SCHULMAN: OK, so
what's the regulator here?

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.870
How far do we have
to step it down?

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.620
What regulator, I
need the doohickey

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:16.029
that goes here to be able to
step it down in a correct--

00:13:16.029 --> 00:13:17.570
you know, in a way
that it will not--

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:19.236
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: We
need to control this--

00:13:19.236 --> 00:13:21.580
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah, and
preferably just one setting,

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.280
because these guys are going to
be like, you just turn it on.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.330
Just do it.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.149
You know, I got to go for lunch.

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:28.690
DAVID OLIVER: Without
modifying this?

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:29.860
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yes,
without modifying it.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.443
So it's going to be
another doohickey.

00:13:31.443 --> 00:13:34.660
They're going to take this off,
put the other doohickey in,

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.940
and crank it on.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.320
DAVID OLIVER: Because if
they're-- yeah, if they're--

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:44.890
if you measure PSI
here, then you're

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:49.564
getting sort of a direct
reading of the vacuum

00:13:49.564 --> 00:13:50.730
that you're creating, right?

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:51.330
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.540
So there is this
valve, but we don't

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.790
know if this valve is working.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:54.780
DAVID OLIVER: Yeah.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.970
But, I mean, if you take the
80 PSI that you're putting in,

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:05.020
you can calculate what that
vacuum should be, so, you know,

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:10.120
that could be simply a
lookup chart or something

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.120
like that for them.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.360
AUDREY SCHULMAN:
Yeah, we got have it--

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.818
you know, the whole thing is
to make it so simple they just

00:14:14.818 --> 00:14:17.370
write down one number in
the end-- error-proof,

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.890
and you got to imagine.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:20.770
You've seen the contractors
out there, right?

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.430
This is not of their interest.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.180
They are doing this
unwillingly, so we

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.740
have to come up with a super,
super simple method that

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.949
can just bucket the leaks.

00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:29.365
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: So
there seem to be

00:14:29.365 --> 00:14:32.290
two techniques in the literature
for volume measurement of gas.

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:36.580
One is the chamber method, which
is a closed sample and measured

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.290
over time to get flow
rate, and the other one

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:43.212
is the flow rate, which is
the rate of air movement--

00:14:43.212 --> 00:14:44.670
you know the speed
of air movement,

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.970
and then you take
one point sample.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.060
So the idea of
this, we're actually

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.611
going to be doing
the chamber method

00:14:51.611 --> 00:14:54.700
on the leaks in the street.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.860
It's error proof.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.921
And the idea of this is to try
to get the flow-rate method

00:14:59.921 --> 00:15:05.110
measurement, so maybe we will
also take some capsules that--

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.110
AUDREY SCHULMAN: They're
not going to go for it.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.693
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: They're
very concerned.

00:15:08.693 --> 00:15:10.350
They're very risk-averse.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:14.232
They're very concerned
about any capturing of gas.

00:15:14.232 --> 00:15:15.940
AUDREY SCHULMAN: I
meant I can't tell you

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.390
how unusual it is that they
are willing to do this.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.762
This alone is a
stunning step forward.

00:15:22.762 --> 00:15:24.970
DAVID OLIVER: Are these guys
employees of the utility

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.819
companies or subcontractors?

00:15:26.819 --> 00:15:28.110
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Probably both.

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.960
DAVID OLIVER: OK.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.570
Is there a possibility of
kind of developing somebody--

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.530
I mean, developing a core
of trained professionals who

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.989
would then contract with the
utility companies who do this?

00:15:37.989 --> 00:15:40.405
AUDREY SCHULMAN: So we're going
to do a training basically

00:15:40.405 --> 00:15:42.810
with the utilities to teach
them how to do the technique,

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.979
but first we need to come
up with the exact technique.

00:15:45.979 --> 00:15:48.270
And that's like in three
weeks, so we're on a deadline.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.670
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: And we're
trying to figure out a way

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.086
to incentivize it for the guys.

00:15:51.086 --> 00:15:53.085
We've been talking to
them, and actually they're

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:54.555
not all the same age.

00:15:54.555 --> 00:15:55.430
There's a wide array.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:59.028
Some of them are actually pretty
interested, so to be fair.

00:16:08.395 --> 00:16:11.353
It seems like we have three
different ideas so far.

00:16:11.353 --> 00:16:14.311
Does that make sense?

00:16:14.311 --> 00:16:21.043
We have the one we
just said at sensor--

00:16:21.043 --> 00:16:24.424
what are we calling this
part of the doohickey?

00:16:24.424 --> 00:16:25.390
Inlet.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:26.839
DAVID OLIVER: Inlet--

00:16:26.839 --> 00:16:30.703
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: --into inlet two.

00:16:30.703 --> 00:16:41.010
Two is no sensor used pressure
to pressure, and 3 is attach--

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.565
SPEAKER 2:
Sensor-dependent output.

00:16:45.565 --> 00:16:48.690
ZEYNEB MAGAVI:
--sensor to output.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:53.967
OK, so each of these
definitely have pros and cons.

00:16:53.967 --> 00:16:55.954
That's where we're at, right?

00:16:55.954 --> 00:16:56.620
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.450
DAVID OLIVER: Number
two is also doing

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.290
the sort of baseline
measurements, correct?

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.665
SPEAKER 2: Yeah,
that's the pros,

00:17:01.665 --> 00:17:03.850
and we don't know if two works.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.369
I would argue that
if two works, that

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:10.940
meets your operational issues
better than anything else,

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:11.680
because you--

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.055
all you're asking
them is to read

00:17:13.055 --> 00:17:17.880
this meter That's the change
in process, basically.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.099
DAVID OLIVER: The
good thing about one

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:25.450
is that they see something that
may alarm them, as opposed to--

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.720
well, actually, if they do
enough for the calculations,

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.790
and they may see the
pressure reading, and say,

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.001
oh, something's wrong.

00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:34.250
But if they see something
new that says, ooh, problem.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:35.870
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, no,
I'm with you, but--

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:36.720
DAVID OLIVER: The
red light goes on.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.094
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: Should we go
through a new pros and cons?

00:17:39.094 --> 00:17:40.510
SPEAKER 2: It might
be worthwhile.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:41.440
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: Or is
this the kind of thing

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.565
where maybe we should just
test all of the options.

00:17:43.565 --> 00:17:44.550
Like, work them out.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.130
Break into a group
and work out what

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.460
we would need to do to test it.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.960
DAVID OLIVER: Or,
you know, you said

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:55.285
the pressure variation in
the pipes is 0.5 PSI to--

00:17:55.285 --> 00:17:56.410
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: To 60 PSI.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.954
DAVID OLIVER: --to 60, jeese.

00:17:57.954 --> 00:17:59.620
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: And
that's just the pipes

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.880
that we need them working on.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.270
DAVID OLIVER: Don't
be standard or OK.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.160
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: So that's
one of the reasons why

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.320
this is a hard problem.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.220
That's why I want
to step this down,

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.150
so that we don't
ever, like, pull

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.722
the gas out of the pipe faster
than the leak would normally

00:18:15.722 --> 00:18:16.722
be.

00:18:16.722 --> 00:18:18.680
AUDREY SCHULMAN: So should
we break into groups

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.250
to look at these
three possible methods

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.680
and sort of come up with
some of the questions,

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.770
the experiments
that need to happen,

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.206
the products associated?

00:18:28.206 --> 00:18:29.580
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: A
next-steps list?

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.496
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah.

00:18:36.717 --> 00:18:38.800
DAVID OLIVER: First of
all, they can control that.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.760
They can control
the input pressure,

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.900
so they can control
the pressure drawn,

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.000
and there is ton of
resistance in the soil.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.192
So in order to do that, you
would have to really crank up

00:18:49.192 --> 00:18:49.900
the pressurized--

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:50.150
SPEAKER 2: I don't know.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.430
I'm just--

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:51.490
DAVID OLIVER: I
don't-- you know--

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:52.910
SPEAKER 2: I don't know if I'm
even in the right ballpark.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.090
DAVID OLIVER: I think there is
so much resistance in the soil.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.550
SPEAKER 2: If there's enough
resistance, it's not a crack,

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:57.480
and then I don't care.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.939
But if it is, if it's close--

00:18:58.939 --> 00:19:00.438
DAVID OLIVER: Maybe
it's dried sand.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.210
The other thing that's going
to happen is where you have

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.863
a leak, you're normally going to
have some diffusion in the soil

00:19:09.863 --> 00:19:13.364
so they're going to be finding
wherever their path of least

00:19:13.364 --> 00:19:16.265
resistance is, but then you
introduce a vacuum where

00:19:16.265 --> 00:19:20.360
it's-- you're going to want
to draw the gas towards that?

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.735
Whether the leak is
here, or it's over there.

00:19:22.735 --> 00:19:23.610
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: Right.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:28.378
So maybe the distance between
the leak and our drill hole

00:19:28.378 --> 00:19:33.218
doesn't matter,
and maybe it does.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.760
Sorry, if I made it--

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.749
SPEAKER 2: What is clear about
this is this all eminently

00:19:42.749 --> 00:19:43.248
testable.

00:19:43.248 --> 00:19:45.210
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: Yes.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.043
SPEAKER 2: This is all
experimental research

00:19:47.043 --> 00:19:49.514
and try it and--

00:19:49.514 --> 00:19:51.520
but it doesn't sound
like you have [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.410
DAVID OLIVER: So to do these--

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.966
SPEAKER 2: That's a plus.

00:19:55.966 --> 00:19:58.336
AUDREY SCHULMAN: So there
are, like, the Gas Technology

00:19:58.336 --> 00:20:02.390
Institute that's [INAUDIBLE] and
there's the Montreal Research

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.920
Institute?

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.440
ZEYNEB MAGAVI: And they have
a buried pipe in the ground.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.590
You can turn the valve flow.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.131
AUDREY SCHULMAN:
But that costs money

00:20:07.131 --> 00:20:08.763
to do that in place
and test things.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:15.504
Whereas, you know, a
small non-profit --.
