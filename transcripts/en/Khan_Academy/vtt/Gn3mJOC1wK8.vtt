00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.850
- [Instructor] Find the
general indefinite integral.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.670
And so we have the integral of two x dx.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.760
Which of the graphs shown below,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.970
which of the graphs below shows

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.750
several members of the family?

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.140
So if we're talking about,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.140
so if we're taking the
integral of two x dx,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.020
we're talking about the
antiderivative of two x.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.800
And what's that going to be?

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.070
Well, it's going to be two x

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.090
to the second power.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.690
'Cause this was two x to the first power,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.590
so we increment the exponent to two.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.680
And then we divide by that
newly incremented exponent,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.720
so this is going to be x squared.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.440
And you might have done that
on your own, you said, okay,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.060
I know that the derivative
of x squared is two x,

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.800
so the antiderivative
of two x is x squared.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.670
But we aren't quite done yet.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.960
Because remember,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.340
this isn't the only
antiderivative of this.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.450
We could add any constant here.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.180
If we add some constant here

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.860
and we take the derivative
of it, we still get two x.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.670
Because the derivative of a
constant with respect to x,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.530
it's not changing with respect to x,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.600
so its derivative is zero.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.500
So the antiderivatives, I
guess you could say here,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440
take this form,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.090
take the form of x squared plus C.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.430
Now what does that mean visually?

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.730
So,

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.060
let me draw, I can draw
a neater version of that.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.780
So slightly better.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.630
So if that's my y-axis

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.483
and this is my x-axis,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.370
we know what y equals
x squared looks like.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.550
Y equals x squared looks like,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.693
I'll just draw the general shape.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.483
So y equals x squared looks like this.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.810
Now, what happens

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.660
if I add a C?

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.890
Let's say if I add,

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.590
let's say y is equal
to x squared plus two.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.120
And two is a valid C, so we could say,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.970
so let me write this down.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.450
This right over here is
y is equal to x squared.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.240
But remember, and I
guess you could say that,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.510
in this case, our C is zero.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.680
But what if our C was some positive value?

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.330
So let's say it is y

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.200
is equal to x squared

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.370
plus, I don't know, y is
equal to x squared plus five.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.710
Well, then we're going to have
a y-intercept here at five,

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.870
so essentially we're just
gonna shift up the graph

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.520
by our constant right over
here, which is positive five.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.420
So we shift up by positive five,

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.150
and we will get something
that looks like this.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.980
We just shifted it up.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.690
Now, you might be saying, okay,

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.720
well, that kind of looks like
this choice right over here.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.410
But this choice also,

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.150
also has some choices

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.180
that start down here, that
we're adding a constant.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.660
But you remember, this
constant can be any constant.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.500
It could be a negative value.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.340
So in this case, C is five.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.430
In this case, C is zero.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.770
But C could also be negative five.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.840
So C could also be negative five.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.710
So if we wanted to do y is equal

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.680
to x squared plus negative five,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.530
which is really x squared minus five,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.090
then the graph would look like this.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.240
It would shift x squared down,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.130
down by five.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.160
So this one is shifted up by five.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.180
This one is shifted down by five.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.850
So you would shift by the constant.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.600
If it's a positive
constant, you're going up.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.200
If it's a negative constant,
you are going down.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.380
So B is definitely

00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:38.440
the class of solutions to
this indefinite integral.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.530
You take any, any of the functions

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.910
that are represented by these graphs,

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.450
you take their derivative,
you're going to get two x.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.610
Or another way to think about it,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.350
the antiderivative of
this or the integral,

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.220
the indefinite integral of two x dx

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.720
is gonna be x squared plus C,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.020
which would be represented
by things that look like,

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.880
so essentially things,

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.330
essentially y equals x
squared shifted up or down.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.530
So I could keep drawing
over and over again.
