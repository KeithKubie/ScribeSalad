00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.330
We're on problem 99.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.990
And I like these that don't have
a lot of words in them. m

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.140
does not equal n.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.080
We have to prove that.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.110
Is it true that m does
not equal n?

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:20.460
Statement number 1 says that
m plus n is less than 0.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.690
Well, let's see, what
does this tell us?

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.490
This just tells us that m
is less than negative n.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.800
It still doesn't tell
us anything.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.810
Maybe negative n is-- well,
let's say, if m is equal to n,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.380
which is equal to negative
10, then this

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.580
would hold true, right?

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.290
Because negative 10 plus
negative 10 is minus 20, which

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.580
is less than 0.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.490
So this still doesn't
prove anything.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.070
Or, of course, I could have
two different numbers.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.780
I could have m being minus
5, and n being minus 1.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.300
And when you add them together
you get minus 6,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.410
both less than 0.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.280
So it still doesn't tell us
anything about whether m does

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.860
not equal n.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.440
Statement two.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.460
m times n is less than 0.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.640
Now, this is interesting.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.350
m times n is less than 0.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.250
So that tells us that one is
positive and one is negative.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.170
The only way you can multiply
two numbers and get something

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:34.130
less than 0 is one positive
and one negative.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.170
And it doesn't say equal 0, so
they both can't equal 0.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.105
And so, when you multiply two
numbers and you get a negative

00:01:39.105 --> 00:01:41.270
number, they have to be
different numbers, because one

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.430
has to be positive and one
has to be negative.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.520
Try it out with as many
things as you want.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.670
But you know from your basic
negative multiplication rules

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.460
that the only way to get a
negative as a product of two

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.840
numbers is one positive,
one negative.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.860
So this is all we need to know
to know that m and n are

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.520
different, because one's
positive and one's negative.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.890
I said that about five times.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.750
Problem 100.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.460
And you didn't need
statement one.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.140
Problem 100.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.960
When a player in a certain game
tossed a coin a number of

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.840
times, four more heads
than tails resulted.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.620
So heads is equal
to tails plus 4.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.440
Heads or tails resulted
each time the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.510
player tossed the coin.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.470
Fair enough.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.070
How many times did
heads result?

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.440
So essentially the problem
description just tells us that

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.780
heads is equal to
tails plus 4.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.750
And that heads plus tails is
just all of the tosses.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.140
So statement number one
says, the player

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.080
tossed the coin 24 times.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.000
So that's what I just said.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.770
Heads plus tails
is equal to 24.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.190
And so this is enough
information by itself to know

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.030
how many times did
heads result.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.640
Because we could rewrite this
top equation as heads minus

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.040
tails is equal to 4.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.580
And if you wanted to solve
it, you'd get 2

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.870
heads is equal to 28.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.140
Heads is equal to 14.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.900
All of that would have been a
waste of time as soon as you

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.930
saw that you had two linear
equations and two unknowns.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.083
You could have said, oh, I have
enough information to

00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:08.460
solve for any of
the variables.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.830
This is a 4.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.280
So statement one by
itself is enough.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.360
Statement two.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.970
The players received 3 points
each time heads resulted and 1

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.510
point each time tails
resulted, for

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.710
a total of 52 points.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.990
So he got 3 points for every
head-- that's how many points

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.450
he got for all the heads-- plus
1 point for each tail.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.750
So that's how many points he
got for all the tails.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.010
And that equals 52.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.870
So once again, this is providing
us with another

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.450
linear equation.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.420
So now we have two linear
equations with two unknowns.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.050
I'm not even looking at what
they gave us in statement one.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.030
So just using these two, we
have enough information to

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.250
solve the problem.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.450
You can do it the
exact same way.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.480
This is what you learned
in algebra 1.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.290
So, each statement independently
is sufficient to

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.310
solve the problem.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.060
Problem 101.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.920
We've already done 100
problems. 101.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.270
Once you get going, these
get kind of fun.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:14.320
If s is the infinite sequence--
OK, so it's like s1

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.930
is equal to 9.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.550
s2 is equal to 99.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.130
s3 is equal to three 9's.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.090
I get it.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.010
And the kth s is equal to
10 to the k minus 1.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.630
This is the third one.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.210
10 to the third is
1000 minus 1.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.790
10 squared is 100 minus 1.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:39.020
Right.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.260
So it all works.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.740
All right, that's what
they told us.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.485
Is every term in s divisible
by the prime number, p?

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.440
Well, it depends what p is.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.290
And frankly, if just the first
term is divisible by p, all of

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.770
them are going to be
divisible by p.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.920
Why is that?

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.120
Because all of the terms
are divisible by the

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.170
first term, or 9.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.100
So if p goes into 9, it's going
to go into all of these

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.170
terms, because 9 goes
into all of them.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.520
So we just have to say,
does p go into 9?

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.830
It's a much simpler way of
thinking about the problem.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.500
Statement number one says,
p is greater than 2.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.110
So does every prime number
greater than 2 go into 9?

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.470
Well, no.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.060
5, 7.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.440
These don't go into 9.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.400
3 goes into 9.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.690
So we still don't know whether
p goes into 9.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.720
Statement two.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.790
At least one term in
the sequence, s, is

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.355
divisible by p.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.540
If we knew that it was this
term, if we knew that the

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.780
first term was divisible by
p, we would be all set.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.950
But we don't know whether it's
just the first term.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.510
For example, p could be 11.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.010
What if p is 11?

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.700
If p is 11, then it goes
into this term.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.060
It goes into the 99.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.430
But it won't go into
the first term.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.410
It won't go into 9.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.850
So 11 is an example where it
holds for case two, but it

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.360
doesn't hold for the
whole question.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.140
It's not divisible
into every term.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.030
Or we could say that if p was
equal to 3-- well, of course,

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.030
that'll go into everyone.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.570
So statement two by itself
actually doesn't help us any.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.940
And actually, both of these
numbers satisfy both

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.860
statements.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.810
And so, if you pick 11,
it doesn't work.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.600
If you pick 3, it does work.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.190
So both statements combined
still do not give us enough

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.440
information.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.890
Problem 102.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.200
I have got to do some drawing.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.650
OK, so I have a quadrilateral
here.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.060
Let's see.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.810
That's RU.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.625
And then go up there.

00:07:08.625 --> 00:07:10.950
And then go flat to there.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.560
And then come down like that.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.690
And then they draw
an altitude here.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.490
All righty.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.190
OK, so this an R.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.140
This is a W.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.920
This is a U.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.600
A T.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.750
And an S.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.690
They're saying the height
of this is 60 meters.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.410
This length is 45 meters.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.170
And they're saying this
right here, this

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.450
length is 15 meters.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.400
Fair enough.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.110
Quadrilateral RSTU, shown above,
is a site plan for a

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:50.760
parking lot, in which side RU is
parallel to side ST. OK, so

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.010
this and this are parallel.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.460
What is the area of
the parking lot?

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.970
So, immediately I can figure
out the area of

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:00.740
this triangle, right?

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.940
Base times height, times 1/2.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.670
So I can figure out this
area immediately.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:11.040
I can immediately figure out
this square region right here.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.260
Because I know it's 60 by 45.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.130
And so the question is, can I
figure out this triangular

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.890
region right here?

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.850
Well, I don't know what
this distance is.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.870
If I knew what this distance
is, then I could say base

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.940
times 60, times 1/2, and
figure this out.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.920
So this right here
is what matters.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.410
That's the crux of the
issue right there.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:34.679
So statement number one tells
us that RU is 80 meters.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.679
RU is equal to 80.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.720
I think this gets
us there, right?

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:45.340
Because think about it, if this
whole thing is 80 meters,

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.350
I can figure out that.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.250
How can I figure out that?

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.710
Because I have 15 here.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.930
I have this length is 45.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:55.710
So this length is going to
be 80 minus 45, minus 15.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:56.140
And what is that?

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:56.660
60.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.550
So 80 minus 60.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.450
So this will be 20.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.700
And so just with statement one,
I can figure out this

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.180
length right here.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.920
And I'm done because this
triangle is this base times

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.390
this height, times 1/2.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.640
This rectangle is this base
times this height.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.000
And then this triangle is
20 times 60, times 1/2.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.980
So I have enough information
to figure out the area just

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.200
with statement one.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.830
Now statement two.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:35.370
TU is equal to 20 square
roots of 10 meters.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.740
Well, this is enough
information, too.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.280
Think about it.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.900
This is a right triangle
right here.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.450
This height is 60.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.720
And remember, if we can figure
out-- let me switch colors--

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.260
if we figure out the base,
we're going to be set.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.830
So we could do Pythagorean
Theorem.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:53.100
So we could say, the based
squared plus 60 squared is

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.000
equal to this number squared.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.690
And that number squared
is what?

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.920
400 times 10.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.000
So it's 4,000.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.030
So you get B squared is equal
to 4,000 minus 3,600, which

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.470
equals 400.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.360
So B is equal to 20 again.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.220
So this actually also gives you
the information that this

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.510
base right here is
equal to 20.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.430
And then, like I showed in the
previous statement, that's all

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.070
you need to figure out
the area of the

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.550
entire parking lot.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.230
So statement two alone
is also sufficient.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.370
So either of these statements
alone are sufficient to tell

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.780
us the area of the
parking lot.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.610
See you in the next video.
