so anxiety is rooted in biology it's
 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.610
so anxiety is rooted in biology it's
evolutionarily based in that we have our

evolutionarily based in that we have our
 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.580
evolutionarily based in that we have our
own fight-or-flight responses some of it

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590
own fight-or-flight responses some of it
 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.880
own fight-or-flight responses some of it
is very old and triggered from the deep

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890
is very old and triggered from the deep
 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.590

part the fight-or-flight response and
 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.420
part the fight-or-flight response and
then some of it comes from the cortex

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430
then some of it comes from the cortex
 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.460
then some of it comes from the cortex
which evolved much later and that's

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
which evolved much later and that's
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.009

ourselves in two states of anxiety where

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
ourselves in two states of anxiety where
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.530
ourselves in two states of anxiety where
we are fraught and not knowing what to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
we are fraught and not knowing what to
 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.109
we are fraught and not knowing what to
do and we actually get stuck with

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119
do and we actually get stuck with
 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.780
do and we actually get stuck with
anxiety and so we're tense and irritable

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790
anxiety and so we're tense and irritable
 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.199
anxiety and so we're tense and irritable
and upset so what makes the difference

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209
and upset so what makes the difference
 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.260
and upset so what makes the difference
between everyday anxiety which we all

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
between everyday anxiety which we all
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.730

behind you and you don't know who it is
 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.560
behind you and you don't know who it is
it's kind of normal but if you let that

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570
it's kind of normal but if you let that
 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.120
it's kind of normal but if you let that
happen to you when you're sitting alone

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130
happen to you when you're sitting alone
 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.000
happen to you when you're sitting alone
at home and you start having panic then

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010
at home and you start having panic then
 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.370
at home and you start having panic then
that gets out of control and worried

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380
that gets out of control and worried
 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.620
that gets out of control and worried
about what to do in the future is normal

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630
about what to do in the future is normal
 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.660
about what to do in the future is normal
for all of us but if we can't move our

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670
for all of us but if we can't move our
 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.150
for all of us but if we can't move our
minds off of that and on to what do I

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160
minds off of that and on to what do I
 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.740
minds off of that and on to what do I
need to take care of here and let me

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750
need to take care of here and let me
 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.660
need to take care of here and let me
enjoy my family while we're doing this

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670
enjoy my family while we're doing this
 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.950
enjoy my family while we're doing this
thing and activity and I'll

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960
thing and activity and I'll
 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.170
thing and activity and I'll
problem-solve that later then that

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180
problem-solve that later then that
 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.360
problem-solve that later then that
becomes a problem and that may become an

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370
becomes a problem and that may become an
 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.630

1990s all the way through to now is it
 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.040
1990s all the way through to now is it
sort of was the age of anxiety in terms

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050
sort of was the age of anxiety in terms
 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.370
sort of was the age of anxiety in terms
of mental health treatment development

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380
of mental health treatment development
 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.210
of mental health treatment development
the 1990s opened up lots of treatment

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220
the 1990s opened up lots of treatment
 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.860
the 1990s opened up lots of treatment
funded here in the United States by the

National Institutes of mental health and
then also in other other countries did

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530
then also in other other countries did
 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.490
then also in other other countries did
similar things where cognitive

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500
similar things where cognitive
 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.450
similar things where cognitive
behavioral therapy became the most

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460
behavioral therapy became the most
 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.780
behavioral therapy became the most
tested and developed treatment and found

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790
tested and developed treatment and found
 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.940
tested and developed treatment and found
to be the most effective psychological

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950
to be the most effective psychological

behavioral therapy is great for that so

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820
behavioral therapy is great for that so
 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.130
behavioral therapy is great for that so
we put a lot of work into that

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140
we put a lot of work into that
 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.990
we put a lot of work into that
developing these treatments and

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000
developing these treatments and
 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.120
developing these treatments and
perfecting them and then also there are

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130
perfecting them and then also there are
 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.450
perfecting them and then also there are
great medications actually that were

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460
great medications actually that were
 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.130
great medications actually that were
developed through that time the

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140
developed through that time the
 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.290
developed through that time the
combination of the two treatments works

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300
combination of the two treatments works
 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.750
combination of the two treatments works
best for many people who are debilitated

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760
best for many people who are debilitated
 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.150
best for many people who are debilitated
by anxiety but these treatments are

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160
by anxiety but these treatments are
 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.810
by anxiety but these treatments are
excellent and they are available but not

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820
excellent and they are available but not
 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.940
excellent and they are available but not
widespread so this is where again

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950
widespread so this is where again
 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.790
widespread so this is where again
technology comes in because technology

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800
technology comes in because technology
 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.860
technology comes in because technology
has allowed us to put some of the skills

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870
has allowed us to put some of the skills
 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.039
has allowed us to put some of the skills
training and some of the aspects of

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049
training and some of the aspects of
 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.840
training and some of the aspects of
cognitive behavior therapy into apps

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850
cognitive behavior therapy into apps
 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.449
cognitive behavior therapy into apps
into online programs and such that then

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459
into online programs and such that then
 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.659
into online programs and such that then
can reach hard to reach individuals and

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669
can reach hard to reach individuals and
 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.140
can reach hard to reach individuals and
people who don't have access to serve

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150
 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.300
there's some very exciting work being

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310
there's some very exciting work being
 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.020
there's some very exciting work being
done today throughout the country and

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030
done today throughout the country and
 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.280
done today throughout the country and
around the world in terms of anxiety

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290
around the world in terms of anxiety
 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.800
around the world in terms of anxiety
research looking at in different ways

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810
research looking at in different ways
 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.220
research looking at in different ways
what aspects of the brain are working

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230
what aspects of the brain are working
 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.920
what aspects of the brain are working
with the amygdala and the cortex in

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930
with the amygdala and the cortex in
 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.780
with the amygdala and the cortex in
terms of turning anxiety on when it

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790
terms of turning anxiety on when it
 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.120
terms of turning anxiety on when it
doesn't need to keeping it going what

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130
doesn't need to keeping it going what
 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.150
doesn't need to keeping it going what
are the triggers for anxiety on all

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160
are the triggers for anxiety on all
 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.250
are the triggers for anxiety on all
different levels from genetic all the

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260
different levels from genetic all the
 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.870
different levels from genetic all the
way through to what's in the environment

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880
way through to what's in the environment
 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.730
way through to what's in the environment
and then helping to sharpen our

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740
and then helping to sharpen our
 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.940
and then helping to sharpen our
treatments and to direct themselves to

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950
treatments and to direct themselves to
 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.090
treatments and to direct themselves to
those mechanisms and tamp down those

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100
those mechanisms and tamp down those
 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.370
those mechanisms and tamp down those
mechanisms so that can help a person

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380
mechanisms so that can help a person
 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.070
mechanisms so that can help a person
probably earlier in the cycle of anxiety

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080
probably earlier in the cycle of anxiety
 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.500
probably earlier in the cycle of anxiety
earlier in life and such and to manage

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510
earlier in life and such and to manage
 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.290
earlier in life and such and to manage
so neuroscience is coming on with all

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300
so neuroscience is coming on with all
 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.740
so neuroscience is coming on with all
sorts of ways of looking at what are

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750
sorts of ways of looking at what are
 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.230
sorts of ways of looking at what are
some new technologies and including

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240
some new technologies and including
 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.420
some new technologies and including
different types of computer apps and

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430
different types of computer apps and
 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.740
different types of computer apps and
stuff that target anxiety processes and

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750
stuff that target anxiety processes and
 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.420
stuff that target anxiety processes and
then there are also ways of

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430
then there are also ways of
 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.670
then there are also ways of
disseminating treatments and reaching

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680
disseminating treatments and reaching
 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.100
disseminating treatments and reaching
people that we are working with so I

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110
people that we are working with so I
 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.740
people that we are working with so I
think the big exciting part of what

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750
think the big exciting part of what
 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.150
think the big exciting part of what
we're seeing over the next 10 to 20

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160
we're seeing over the next 10 to 20
 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.920
we're seeing over the next 10 to 20
years is going to be much more

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930
years is going to be much more
 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.420
years is going to be much more
dissemination of more targeted and I

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430
dissemination of more targeted and I
 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.040
dissemination of more targeted and I
think more effective treatments for

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050
think more effective treatments for
 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.140
think more effective treatments for
people that are going to be coming on

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150
people that are going to be coming on
 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.430
people that are going to be coming on
board and going to be disseminated

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440
board and going to be disseminated
 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.740
board and going to be disseminated
through many different means not just

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750
through many different means not just
 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.690
through many different means not just
through the your local therapist like me

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700
through the your local therapist like me
 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.670
through the your local therapist like me
but also through many different types of

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680
but also through many different types of
 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.140
but also through many different types of
technologies that are going to be made

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150
technologies that are going to be made
 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.670
technologies that are going to be made
available

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680
