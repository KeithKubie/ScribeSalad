00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.303
- We've talked a lot about cells in general,

00:00:02.303 --> 00:00:03.766
but what I thought I would do in this video

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.947
is focus on plant cells, and in particular

00:00:06.947 --> 00:00:11.521
focus on the cell walls of plant cells.

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:13.113
So this right over here, this is a

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:15.192
drawing of a plant cell.

00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:16.818
And the thing that might jump out

00:00:16.818 --> 00:00:18.176
at you immediately is instead of

00:00:18.176 --> 00:00:21.113
drawing it as just kind of a roundish shape

00:00:21.113 --> 00:00:22.576
like that, the way I've drawn a lot of

00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:24.758
other cells, I've drawn this as kind of

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.732
a cubic structure, or a rectangular prism,

00:00:26.732 --> 00:00:28.364
and that's because plant cells

00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:30.686
can have a structure like that.

00:00:30.686 --> 00:00:31.731
And so the next question is, well,

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.531
what gives them that shape?

00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:35.853
What allows them to form that, kind of,

00:00:35.853 --> 00:00:38.047
cubic rectangular prism shape?

00:00:38.047 --> 00:00:41.587
And the answer is, it's the cell wall.

00:00:41.587 --> 00:00:45.035
So this is the cell wall.

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:46.428
So let's make sure we can orient

00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:48.472
ourselves properly in this picture.

00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:51.385
So clearly, if I didn't have this cut-out,

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:52.953
all I would be seeing is the outside.

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:54.810
All I would be seeing is the cell wall.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.331
But we've cut it out, and we can see

00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:57.190
the different layers.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.908
We have the cell wall on the outside.

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:01.729
Right below that, right below that

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.807
we have the cellular membrane,

00:01:03.807 --> 00:01:05.514
or the plasma membrane.

00:01:05.514 --> 00:01:10.424
So that's the cellular membrane.

00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:14.292
Cellular membrane, right under that.

00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:15.870
And then under that, the cellular membrane

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.656
is containing the cytoplasm.

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:20.058
And inside of the cytoplasm

00:01:20.058 --> 00:01:21.240
we have all sorts of things.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.540
This big thing that is taking up

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.550
a lot of the volume inside of this plant cell,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.186
that's a vacuole, which we have described

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:30.400
in other videos.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.166
Vacuole.

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.687
It's the combination of this

00:01:32.687 --> 00:01:34.567
internal pressure, things like the vacuole

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:35.833
and, just frankly, the pressure

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:37.934
from all of the fluid inside the cell

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:40.476
pushing outwards, plus the cell wall

00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:41.811
kind of holding it all in.

00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:43.854
That's what gives plants their structure.

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:46.408
That's why a plant is able to grow,

00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:48.133
and be upright.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.763
A plant is able to grow and be upright.

00:01:49.763 --> 00:01:52.154
So that's my drawing of a plant.

00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:53.279
I actually have a plant in my room

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.662
that I'm looking at right now,

00:01:54.662 --> 00:01:56.878
and it's able to grow and be upright.

00:01:56.878 --> 00:01:59.177
And so you have the cell wall,

00:01:59.177 --> 00:02:00.361
you have the cellular membrane,

00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:02.160
you have the other organelles,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.472
I have some chloroplasts here,

00:02:03.472 --> 00:02:06.340
key for photosynthesis, our good friends

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.037
mitochondria.

00:02:07.037 --> 00:02:08.663
We have our nuclear membrane,

00:02:08.663 --> 00:02:09.614
or I should say this yellow thing

00:02:09.614 --> 00:02:11.076
is the inner nuclear membrane.

00:02:11.076 --> 00:02:12.272
It has the DNA inside.

00:02:12.272 --> 00:02:14.409
Then you have the endoplasmic reticulum,

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:15.604
kind of containing that.

00:02:15.604 --> 00:02:18.125
The rough ER, containing the ribosomes

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:19.795
or having the ribosomes on the membrane.

00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:22.379
The smooth ER, not having the ribosomes.

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.517
Golgi apparatus, so that's a little bit

00:02:23.517 --> 00:02:24.260
of a review.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.744
But our focus here is on the cell wall.

00:02:26.744 --> 00:02:28.021
So let's go back to that.

00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:30.645
So if we zoom in on this, if we zoom in

00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:32.003
on the cell wall right over here, we can

00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:35.412
look at this diagram.

00:02:35.412 --> 00:02:37.165
And over here, it might be a little bit

00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:38.129
surprising to you.

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.893
Because when I've always imagined

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:43.190
a wall, a cell wall, I imagine something

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.850
like a brick wall.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.545
Something that's impenetrable.

00:02:46.545 --> 00:02:47.903
But this drawing shows us

00:02:47.903 --> 00:02:48.534
something different.

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:51.273
And just to be clear what's going on here,

00:02:51.273 --> 00:02:54.524
so this is our cellular membrane --

00:02:54.524 --> 00:02:55.662
sorry I wrote cellular membrane,

00:02:55.662 --> 00:02:57.542
so right over here I have my

00:02:57.542 --> 00:02:59.167
lipid bi-layer.

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:00.920
And then right on top of that,

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.464
I have the cell wall.

00:03:02.464 --> 00:03:04.020
But you see, it isn't just a thick,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.564
like a brick wall, like something

00:03:05.564 --> 00:03:06.342
that is impenetrable.

00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:08.722
You see you have all these polysaccharide

00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:10.823
fibers running across it.

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:12.483
So you have things like cellulose,

00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:15.687
which we saw as a polymer of glucose,

00:03:15.687 --> 00:03:16.767
arranged in a certain way.

00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:19.460
Hemi-cellulose, which has different types

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.747
of monomers associated with it.

00:03:21.747 --> 00:03:22.943
We have pectin, which is another

00:03:22.943 --> 00:03:23.779
polysaccharaide.

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.508
And all of these things -- you've actually

00:03:25.508 --> 00:03:27.726
probably eaten, if not today probably in the

00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:28.979
last week, when we talk about fiber

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:32.125
in your diet, you're talking about things

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:33.785
like the cellulose and the pectin.

00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:35.167
Things that your body can't digest.

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:36.665
When you eat a plant you're getting it,

00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:38.487
because you're eating their cell walls.

00:03:38.487 --> 00:03:40.797
And it does cool things, like

00:03:40.797 --> 00:03:42.283
slows the absorption of glucose in your

00:03:42.283 --> 00:03:43.026
intestines.

00:03:43.026 --> 00:03:44.965
It absorbs water, so I guess you could say

00:03:44.965 --> 00:03:47.844
things pass a little bit easier.

00:03:47.844 --> 00:03:50.479
But the key thing here is this isn't

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.060
a wall.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.604
This actually allows --

00:03:52.604 --> 00:03:53.161
Or, it is a wall,

00:03:53.161 --> 00:03:53.881
It's officially the cell wall.

00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:56.481
But it's not a thick, impenetrable wall

00:03:56.481 --> 00:03:57.236
like you might associate the wall

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:59.279
of the room that you're in.

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:00.684
You can see that it has space

00:04:00.684 --> 00:04:02.657
for small molecules to flow.

00:04:02.657 --> 00:04:04.445
And it's really more like a mesh,

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:05.559
or like a fabric.

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:07.254
And so the cellular membrane

00:04:07.254 --> 00:04:10.876
actually has access to the fluid,

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:12.757
and to the molecules, that are

00:04:12.757 --> 00:04:14.417
between the cells.

00:04:14.417 --> 00:04:15.601
And so just to be clear what we're

00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:16.182
looking at.

00:04:16.182 --> 00:04:18.120
This layer right here, this cellular membrane,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.618
that's the lipid bi-layer.

00:04:19.618 --> 00:04:22.218
This right over here, this is the

00:04:22.218 --> 00:04:24.459
cell wall.

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:25.573
I'll do that in a different color.

00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:29.114
That is the cell wall.

00:04:29.114 --> 00:04:30.554
And then right above the cell wall,

00:04:30.554 --> 00:04:32.353
that's the space between the cells,

00:04:32.353 --> 00:04:35.297
which we cell the middle lamella.

00:04:35.297 --> 00:04:36.814
So the space between the cells

00:04:36.814 --> 00:04:39.960
we call the middle lamella.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.456
So this also is, right over here, is also

00:04:42.456 --> 00:04:45.753
the middle lamella.

00:04:45.753 --> 00:04:47.576
So all of that is interesting, but you might say,

00:04:47.576 --> 00:04:49.073
"Okay, well, how hard is a cell?

00:04:49.073 --> 00:04:51.395
I get that it's a mesh, but clearly the cells,

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:54.216
the plants are able to stand upright.

00:04:54.216 --> 00:04:55.934
Is that because the cell wall provides

00:04:55.934 --> 00:04:57.316
all of that rigidity?"

00:04:57.316 --> 00:04:59.417
And the answer is, kind of.

00:04:59.417 --> 00:05:00.879
The cell wall is like this mesh.

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.598
It helps the cells have their shape.

00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:04.455
But if you stop watering a plant,

00:05:04.455 --> 00:05:07.938
you're going to see it kind of

00:05:07.938 --> 00:05:08.862
wilt over.

00:05:08.862 --> 00:05:11.339
And that's because part of its ability

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:13.313
to stand up is from the internal pressure

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.137
of the cells.

00:05:14.137 --> 00:05:16.470
But also part of its shape is the actual

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.875
cell wall.

00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:18.839
Now, some of you might be saying,

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.011
"Well I've seen plants that are much,

00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:21.079
much more rigid than this plant

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:22.170
that you've just drawn.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.610
What about things like trees?

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.829
What about wood?

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:26.345
Wood seems very rigid.

00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:27.750
In fact, so rigid that we can build

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.304
actual walls out of wood."

00:05:30.304 --> 00:05:32.463
And the answer there is these

00:05:32.463 --> 00:05:34.669
more mature plants, actually once the cell

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.142
has stopped growing and you have your

00:05:37.142 --> 00:05:40.021
cell wall, more layers of cellulose and

00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:41.867
other molecules can be built to form

00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:43.945
what's called a secondary cell wall.

00:05:43.945 --> 00:05:45.303
So this could be viewed as a primary

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:45.860
cell wall.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.381
And then a thicker, secondary cell wall

00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:48.890
could be built, which gives much,

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.666
much more rigidity.

00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:52.117
And so when you look at wood,

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:53.151
what gives wood its structure,

00:05:53.151 --> 00:05:54.277
even if you were to take out all of the

00:05:54.277 --> 00:05:55.728
water, even if you were to dehydrate

00:05:55.728 --> 00:05:57.736
the wood, it's still going to have

00:05:57.736 --> 00:05:59.710
its rigidity, because the cellulose layers

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.836
and the other molecules that are

00:06:00.836 --> 00:06:02.252
so thick that it's able to have its

00:06:02.252 --> 00:06:04.446
rigid form.

00:06:04.446 --> 00:06:05.596
Now that last thing I want to talk about.

00:06:05.596 --> 00:06:06.873
We've already seen that the

00:06:06.873 --> 00:06:08.486
cellular membrane has access to

00:06:08.486 --> 00:06:11.655
the molecules floating around between

00:06:11.655 --> 00:06:14.349
cells, but there's actually also

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.493
direct tunnels between adjacent plant cells.

00:06:18.493 --> 00:06:21.105
And those direct tunnels I've drawn here

00:06:21.105 --> 00:06:22.313
on this, outside of the cell walls

00:06:22.313 --> 00:06:24.460
these little yellow circles, these are

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.236
plasmodesmata.

00:06:26.236 --> 00:06:29.371
These are plasmodesmata.

00:06:29.371 --> 00:06:30.613
To get a better understanding of what

00:06:30.613 --> 00:06:32.737
they're like, imagine this is one cell.

00:06:32.737 --> 00:06:35.059
So I'm writing here Cell 1.

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:37.021
And let's say this is Cell 2.

00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:38.019
Cell 2 right over here.

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:39.041
And I have a cross-section.

00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:43.116
You see the plasmodesmata are these

00:06:43.116 --> 00:06:46.030
tunnels that form between not just the

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.201
membrane of the cell wall and the

00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:49.536
plasmodesmata.

00:06:49.536 --> 00:06:51.254
It forms between the two cells.

00:06:51.254 --> 00:06:52.391
And so you can actually have a

00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:54.771
flow of cytosol and small molecules

00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:58.892
directly between these two cells.

00:06:58.892 --> 00:07:00.030
And if you want to get a little bit more

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.412
involved in the structure, you have this

00:07:01.412 --> 00:07:04.871
kind of smooth endoplasmic reticulum pipe

00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:05.498
going through it.

00:07:05.498 --> 00:07:06.775
But I want to make it very clear.

00:07:06.775 --> 00:07:08.574
'Cause a lot of times when you

00:07:08.574 --> 00:07:10.234
study biology it's all explained,

00:07:10.234 --> 00:07:11.593
it seems all neat and clean and textbook.

00:07:11.593 --> 00:07:13.369
But people are still studying exactly

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:15.470
why do we have these things?

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.687
What are they necessary?

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:19.870
What gets transported across these things,

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.553
and how are they able to transport,

00:07:21.553 --> 00:07:22.853
and under what conditions are they?

00:07:22.853 --> 00:07:24.467
So all of these areas, when you were to

00:07:24.467 --> 00:07:25.907
kind of dig one layer deeper

00:07:25.907 --> 00:07:27.590
than frankly I'm talking about,

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.389
you're getting into an area of

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:30.655
active research.

00:07:30.655 --> 00:07:32.315
So anyway, hopefully this whole thing

00:07:32.315 --> 00:07:34.091
gives you a little bit more appreciation

00:07:34.091 --> 00:07:35.589
for the wood around you, the

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:36.773
plants, the house plants around you,

00:07:36.773 --> 00:07:39.547
and even the salad that you might have

00:07:39.547 --> 00:07:41.547
for lunch.
