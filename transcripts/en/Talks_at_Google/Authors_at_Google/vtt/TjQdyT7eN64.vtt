00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.565
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:07.440
MICHAEL R. VIRARDI: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.870
Thank you for being present.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.670
Happy women's day to all
the ladies in the audience.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.940
And it is a pleasure and an
honor being here at Google.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.250
It was always on
the 25th of December

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.990
that my late father Rolando used
to recite the exact same story

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.790
year in and year out to my elder
brother Giovanni and myself.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.670
It wasn't one of
his own stories.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.250
It didn't stem from
his own experiences.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.140
But it was a story
that was related

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.420
to him by a former
mentor of his, Dr. Rossi,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.020
when my father used to work at
the Cyprus embassy in London.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.710
The story was about a former
Undersecretary of Defense

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.570
and that former Undersecretary
of Defense was invited,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.210
for the second year running,
at the same conference.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.980
As he took up the podium, he
was holding a styrofoam cup

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.810
with coffee in his hand.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.230
And before he started speaking,
he went off script, took a sip,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.290
smiled, turned, looked
at the audience and said,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.400
I want to talk to you
about this styrofoam cup.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.010
Last year, I was the
Undersecretary of Defense.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.260
I flew here business class.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.000
A limousine was waiting
for me at the airport

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.160
to drive me to my hotel.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.510
They already checked me in.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.050
The next day, there was
another limousine waiting

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.830
to bring me to this venue.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.900
They escorted me
to the green room,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.400
and the green room
is the room where

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.930
all speakers meet and prepare
before they take the stage.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.330
And when I asked for
something to drink,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.080
they brought me coffee
in a ceramic cup.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.875
This year, I'm no longer the
Undersecretary of Defense.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.950
I came.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.810
I flew economy class.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.700
I took a taxi from the airport
all the way to my hotel.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.020
I checked myself in
and it took 15 minutes.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.840
The next day, I took another
taxi to come to this venue.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.530
And because I couldn't remember
where the green room was,

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.790
I asked them to escort me, and
they gave me mere directions

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.340
how to get there.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.650
Then I asked for
something to drink.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.840
And they showed me
the vending machine.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.460
And they said take
a styrofoam cup,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.690
and serve yourself
whatever you like.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.390
He turns, looks at
the audience and says,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.400
we all deserve a styrofoam cup.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.860
The ceramic cup was
never meant for us.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.560
It was meant for the position
that I was holding at the time.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.960
So as you gain fame, as you
gain fortune, positions,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.890
or possessions, people
will open up doors for you.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.170
They will refer to
you as sir and madam.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.910
They will bring gifts.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.560
And when you ask for
something to drink,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.760
they will bring your coffee
or your tea in a ceramic cup.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.110
But because time
doesn't stand still,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.590
we all deserve a styrofoam cup.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.090
And as the former
Undersecretary of Defense

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.285
found out the hard way, we, too,
should be alerted to the fact

00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:46.510
and to the possibility
that we might not

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.690
be our current position
or our possessions.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.020
Who we really are, as
today's title suggests,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.010
which is Finding
Your Inner Compass,

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.950
is that internal compass,
when you strip away

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.240
positions or possessions
that will guide you

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.560
through challenging and
difficult moments in business

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.400
and in life.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.310
Today, my dear friends, I will
relay five personal stories.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.890
And each story carries
a valuable lesson.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.670
That's the lessons that power
my internal compass and helped

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.500
me navigate through
the professional

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.890
and the personal world.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.710
I hope that by the
end of this speech,

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.430
these same stories and
the underlying messages

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.140
from these stories will help
power your internal compass

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.020
and help you navigate
better in your life.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.540
So they make the road
more smooth in order

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.250
to reach for that elusive
word, which is called success.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.770
Three disclaimers to make--

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.200
each and every lesson
starts with the letter H,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.760
as you will see from each story.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.330
Second disclaimer--
there are no PowerPoints.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.060
Unlike 95% of my
keynote speaking,

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.550
there are no PowerPoints.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.610
Because I do not
believe that a slide

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.780
can depict internal
compasses and values, as well

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.060
as a vivid story which
carries an underlying message.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.390
And disclaimer number three--

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.220
the third story, which
happened 13 years ago in 2006,

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.460
I've never ever before
said this story in front

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.410
of a professional audience.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.500
I only once
mentioned this story,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.420
and that was on the
9th of October 2018

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.450
as I was lecturing at University
College London in front

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.530
of 300 students.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.730
So let's begin.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.800
And let me take
you back to 1997.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.200
That was the year that
I completed my studies

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.730
in the United Kingdom.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.770
I'd done my BA and
my master's degree.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.570
And like any good Cypriot boy
who has a flourishing business,

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.430
I went back to the
island, back to Cyprus

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.763
to work for the family business.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.392
All newcomers at
our family business,

00:06:20.392 --> 00:06:22.600
which was called Virardi--
it's still called Virardi,

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.420
we deal with catering
equipment and tabletop supplies

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.180
for the HoReCa industry, the
HoReCa industry is hotels,

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.720
restaurants, and
catering institutions--

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.000
had to go through
an induction course.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.190
And that induction
course started

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.490
from my late father's office.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.530
And I, too, had to go
through the same procedure.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.400
That was what I
called my PhD degree.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.130
Only it didn't last five years.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.800
It lasted five minutes.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.140
My father gave me two
valuable pieces of advice.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.640
For the first piece of advice,
my father took a pencil.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.690
And he took a sharpener.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:15.880
And he said, Michael,
I've sharpened your edge.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.900
I paid your [INAUDIBLE] and
I paid for your tuition.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.870
But if you leave a pencil
standing on its own,

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.090
it will fall.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.330
Go out there, son,
and find the hand

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.880
that will keep you standing.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.410
The hand that will
keep you standing

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.070
was an analogy for the
mentors in my life,

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.380
for the trusted
advisors, the likes

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.530
of your former colleague
[INAUDIBLE] was escorting me

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.090
here, all the mistakes
that I've done in my life

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.090
and all the failures
that I've encountered.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.060
Because as the saying
goes, when you lose,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.080
don't lose the lesson.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.790
And I owe a very big thank
you to all the people

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:08.780
who turned me down and all those
who believed in me to hire me.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:13.030
And as I was making my way
out of my father's office,

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.080
he gave me the second
piece of advice.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.730
He said, son, I see
something in you.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:24.230
My feeling is that you will do
well in life 10, 15 years down

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.410
the road.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:30.740
And when you do well, when you
gain positions and possessions,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.409
if, for any reason
you think that there

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:37.850
is one person that you don't
need them because you've either

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.480
outgrown them or getting
a better position,

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.450
that's the day--

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.520
and as an inexperienced
professional, young

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.980
professional, I rushed
to fill in the sentence--

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.870
and I said, that's the
day that I made it, Dad?

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.360
He said no.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.800
That's the day that
you lost it all, son.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.280
So the first H in our first
story, my dear friends,

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.510
is H for being humble.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:09.460
Understanding that as you
rise up the hierarchy ladder,

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:16.040
as you taste success,
always remain humble,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.920
because we are not our
current successors.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.140
We are not our trophies.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.170
We are not our positions
or our possessions.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:30.700
Which leads me to the second
story that happened in 1998.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.780
I was one year into
the family business.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.320
And lo and behold, the company
that my dad told me to take

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.290
care of, which was Carlisle
Food Service Products--

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.430
it's the tumblers where you
have your juice here at Google,

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.270
Carlisle Food Service Products--

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.270
we won the first European award.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.930
So the Americans told us to
fly all the way to Charlotte,

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:56.840
together with my brother,
all expenses paid,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.360
to get our award.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.040
And we were lucky,
because there were

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.410
seven days of celebrations.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:06.070
And on the last day,
Jeffrey Gitomer,

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.710
one of the best sales
consultants in the United

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.360
States, came to speak to us.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.020
For all those who know me,
I cannot stand still for 10

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.530
minutes.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:23.460
I stayed riveted on my chair
for six consecutive hours.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.730
As soon as Jeffrey
Gitomer finished his talk,

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:31.230
I ran up to him and I said,
Mr. Gitomer, congratulations.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.990
How can I become like you, sir?

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.380
And he turned, looked at
me, and said, it's easy

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.060
and it's difficult.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.990
And as a Cypriot, I
said, what's easy?

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.790
He said study on
your chosen topic,

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:53.540
whichever topic that is,
for two hours every day,

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.550
except weekends.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.670
In five years, you will be
recognized in your country--

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.610
in 10 years, worldwide.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.420
I said, sir, I'll start today.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.380
I bought his books.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.890
At the time, he had only
two books, "The Sales Bible"

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.190
and "Customer
Satisfaction is Worthless,

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.680
Customer Loyalty is Priceless."

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:22.900
I even bought his cassettes--
not DVDs, not CDs, not USBs,

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.560
but cassettes.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.460
And I was listening to
Jeffrey Gitomer's cassettes

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:33.230
in my car, which was sales
messages coming out, driving

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.930
from one town of
Cyprus to the next,

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.660
promoting Carlisle Food
Service Products and all

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.590
the other products
that we had at Virardi.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.150
And I was weeping in my car,
listening to the messages.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.830
And I have a feeling
that people looking

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.305
from the outside thought that
I was going to a funeral.

00:11:48.305 --> 00:11:50.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.350
I still remember my favorite
tape, my favorite cassette.

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:59.220
It was "101.5
Rules for Success."

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.070
Let me tell you my
favorite rule for success.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.860
It was the 101.5.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.810
You're given a bucket of
water and a bucket of cement.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.420
You can either build
a stepping stone

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.440
toward success or
a stumbling block.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.855
The choice is yours.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.470
And he was right.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.310
Even the great author
Malcolm Gladwell in his book

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.900
"Outliers", he said
the exact same thing.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.060
He popularized a
notion that wasn't his,

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.030
but it was the 10,000 hours.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.360
Malcolm Gladwell said that if
you want to achieve something,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.240
you need to put those
10,000 hours in.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:46.370
Even the Beatles were unknown
for seven consecutive years

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:51.410
as they played music in what
was eastern Germany at the time.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.930
And it was after they hit
that mark, the 10,000 hour

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:57.470
mark, that people started
to recognize them.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:01.010
Even great criminals,
as it says in the book,

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:04.340
need 10,000 hours to
perfect their craft.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:17.960
So my dear friends, the
second H is H for hard work.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.280
I know you work at a
technology company.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.870
And I know that intelligent
work is also important.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:29.390
But hard work takes precedence
over intelligent work.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.010
I guess what I'm
saying to you is,

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.000
sacrifice something today so
you can gain something better

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.680
tomorrow.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.320
Which leads us to
the third story,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.270
which I've never
before said in front

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.130
of a professional audience.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.300
You can cut the camera now.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.010
I'm joking.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:52.530
2006, as a good Cypriot boy
who was working at the family

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.930
business, getting a bit older--

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.650
by the way, I am 46, even
though I look 45, just

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.600
for your information--

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.010
it was time to get married.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:08.470
700,000 inhabitants on
the island of Cyprus.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:12.190
We invited 4,000 to the wedding.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.210
And it was almost 1%.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.090
And the night
before the wedding,

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:23.660
I found out that my
wife was cheating on me.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.160
Yes.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.990
I know, you say such
a good looking guy,

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.100
and she's cheating on you.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.970
Can you believe that?

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.100
I had the same feeling.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:34.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.710
So what did I do?

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.570
I had to think for a while.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.820
And then I called
everything off.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.800
My mother was crying.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.930
My late grandmother
was hysterical.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.240
What will happen
to the family name?

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.950
What will happen to our image?

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.463
What will happen to your image?

00:14:50.463 --> 00:14:51.630
What will happen to my life?

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.130
I told them.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:00.050
The only person who hasn't
spoken, like always,

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:03.140
and waited and
waited, was my dad.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.450
So he comes up to me,
and he says Michael,

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.850
let's go to the front veranda.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.850
The front veranda
in my parents' home

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.940
was where the bad
news were delivered.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.630
The back veranda was where
the good news were delivered.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.750
So I go to the front veranda.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.160
He puts his hand
on my shoulders.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.870
And he says, son.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.000
You have guts.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.920
Actually, the word
he used wasn't guts.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.870
But for this speech
at Google, it's guts.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:43.405
When I die, he continued
on, I'm very happy.

00:15:43.405 --> 00:15:44.780
And I will die
peacefully knowing

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.380
that I can leave the company
to your brother Giovanni, who

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:52.400
has the wisdom and the
patience, and also to you, son,

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.780
who has guts.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:16:00.590
So my dear friends, the
third H is H for honesty.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.650
And I'm not talking about
honesty from the other person.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.630
Because you cannot control that.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.850
It's being honest
with yourselves.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:12.650
To take the hard decisions,
even if it pains you at the time

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.210
that you're taking
those decisions.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.670
And we move on to
the fourth story.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:27.340
One year after not proceeding
with the wedding, 2007,

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.460
now I had to find the guts to
go tell my dad that I wanted

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.130
to leave the company and
pursue what you see me

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:37.420
now doing, giving keynotes,
training, development,

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.960
and consulting.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.860
I go up to my dad.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.300
I explain what I wanted to do.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.320
He says, son, let's go
to the front veranda.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.950
We go to the front veranda.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.600
He said Michael,
you can go your way.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.280
I'm sure you will succeed.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:58.050
But if you leave,
Virardi will close down.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:01.110
He bought himself 1,100 days.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:06.400
I stayed at the family business
for another three years.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.089
And when the time
passed, I went back.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.010
My father was a true gentleman.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.829
He said son, you
will do very well.

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:17.720
But I would like to
give you some advice.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.930
Go your own way, but I would
like to give you some advice.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.410
This is where the
fourth H comes in.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.800
Always be helpful.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.850
Deliver value first
or deliver value

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.650
without expecting
anything in return.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.170
And he gave me two
pieces of advice

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.150
that I will never forget.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:43.130
The first piece of advice was
that when you meet prospects

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:46.130
and they ask you
to give quotations,

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.850
never merely write a quotation.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.680
Write a self-help book.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.400
Give them so much value that
they can see their vision.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.700
Give them so much
material and value

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.950
so they can bring it to life.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:05.270
If they decide to come with you,
your prize will seem minute.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.910
If they opt to go
with your competitors,

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.198
at least you have
built a stepping stone

00:18:11.198 --> 00:18:12.115
towards their success.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.260
And my father was right.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.330
And I still do it
up until today.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.970
Even recently when a
company from New York

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:28.080
contacted me to do a
culture enhancement project,

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.070
which involved
strengthening the team,

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.030
and it had a 360
degree evaluation

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.240
which means that those
managers were evaluated

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.590
by the top management, by their
peers, by their subordinates,

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.000
and by customers--

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.490
I didn't just write a quotation.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:50.340
I even sent a five page PDF with
all the questions, everything

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.120
that I was intending to ask.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.380
And if I don't get
the job, I still

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.080
know that I added a
value to that company.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.440
And if I do get the
job, they can come back

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.648
and alter some
questions, change some,

00:19:03.648 --> 00:19:04.940
and even give me some feedback.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.260
What my father was telling
me is be a trusted advisor,

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.210
not a salesperson.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.290
And I guess what
I'm telling you is

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:20.670
transform your thinking from
what can I get from you to

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:23.580
how can I serve you.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.180
And the second piece of
advice he gave me that day

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.440
was that, Michael, you
will never be the smartest

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.950
person in the room.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.550
And my dad had foresight.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.740
Even though he
died 19 months ago,

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.000
he never knew I was
coming to Google.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.270
So this guy had foresight.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.260
And it's true, my dear friends.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.490
Even if you are one in a
million, in a 7 billion

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:52.750
population, there are another
7,000 people exactly like you.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.060
Why should they hire you?

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.300
Recently I was at
Singularity University.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.920
I took a course there.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.740
And they have the
same philosophy.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:07.750
They were telling us that
engineers, the brightest

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.200
minds, scientists, were
trying to fold protein three

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.880
dimensionally.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.640
And they were trying
for 15 years non-stop,

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.950
and they never managed it.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.560
They opened up.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.250
They open sourced it.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:29.510
And in 10 days only, a wife
from the Midwest folded protein.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.560
So the experts are
the nonexperts.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.810
The experts sometimes are
outside your organization.

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.740
And it is not a coincidence
that in the book

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:49.880
of how Google works, it says
on page 175, default to open.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.100
So if you cannot be the
smartest person in the room,

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.920
you can be something else.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.930
In my case, I opted
to be the promptest.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:20:59.900
And I have a rule.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.490
If you go into my
website, you will

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:07.310
see that I reply back to my
messages with the rule 7, 7, 7.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.550
I reply back in 7 seconds,
if I'm not doing anything.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:12.260
I reply immediately.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.120
In seven minutes, if
I'm doing something,

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.340
I want to finish
it and then reply.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.640
Or in seven hours, which is
the duration of a workshop.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.370
I finish the workshop
and then I reply back.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:26.030
I'm not telling you to do
that within this framework.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:31.400
But expand it, if you like, to
14, 14, 14, or 21 seconds, 21

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.650
minutes, or 21 hours.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:39.710
But refrain from staying
at the 24 hour rule, which

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.740
was invented when there were
telephones plugged on the wall

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.430
and not smart devices.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.430
And when they were--

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:50.000
at that time, people
were more backward.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.730
So my dear friends, the
fourth H is to be helpful.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:01.590
Which leads us to the fifth and
final H. And for this story,

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:06.410
I need to take you to 9/11/2011.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.720
That was the day that
I married the woman

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.220
of my dreams, the lady that
puts a smile on a daily face--

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.830
on a [INAUDIBLE] on my face--

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.200
and that's Christine.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:23.810
And on the 28th of January
2013, she delivered the greatest

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.920
present in our lives, and that's
our six-year-old Rolando, who

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.290
wanted to accompany
me on this trip

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:34.700
to meet the people behind
his favorite platform

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:38.870
and that is YouTube,
because thanks to you,

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.510
he observes-- he
meticulously observes

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:45.110
Cristiano Ronaldo's soccer
moves on a daily-- sorry--

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.175
hourly basis.

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.900
So when we were going to
get married with Christine,

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.060
Christine went to
her grandfather,

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.960
who passed away recently, who
was married to his childhood

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.190
sweetheart for 68 years.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:04.478
And she asked for advice
for a happy marriage.

00:23:04.478 --> 00:23:06.770
And her grandfather was very
happy to give that advice.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:07.170
I don't know.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.962
Maybe he was worried
that I would walk away

00:23:08.962 --> 00:23:11.450
from this wedding, as well.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.460
And he said to her,
Christine, do you

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:18.200
know what's the secret to a
happy and a long-term wedding?

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.410
And Christine said, what's
the secret, Grandfather?

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:29.730
He said give 100% to your spouse
and expect zero in return.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:35.910
If your husband to be gives
100% and expects zero in return,

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:40.710
then you increase your chances
of having a happy wedding.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.360
Think about it, my friends.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.000
It also applies to
all the other Hs.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.300
Give 100% to your marriage
or to your relationships,

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.490
and expect zero in return.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.960
Give 100% to hard work
and intelligence work.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.790
Be 100% honest, first and
foremost, with yourselves.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:04.170
Even if it pains you at the time
you take the decision, take it.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.860
If you're wrong, admit
it and apologize.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:15.060
Be 100% helpful by offering
value to others first.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:19.500
And be 100% humble, not because
you will need someone further

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.560
down the line in your
career, but because it

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.440
is the right thing to do.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.300
So if you're wondering by
now, what's the fifth H?

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:34.210
The fifth H is H for heart.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.050
Open your heart
and pour your heart

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.820
in everything and
anything that you do,

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.690
because it's only in this
way that you can move away

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:46.410
from positions and possessions,
and you move closer

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.840
to your true North.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.440
And by true North, I mean
that internal compass

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.430
that is helping you to
navigate through life.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.120
After all, my dear
friends, it is that compass

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:05.430
that represents who you are as
human beings at your deepest

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:06.007
level.

00:25:06.007 --> 00:25:06.840
Thank you very much.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.816
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.670
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much
for being here today with us.

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:25.080
Personally the talk
talked to my heart.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.235
And I think you
represented a few

00:25:27.235 --> 00:25:29.050
of the values we
have in the company,

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:33.340
like put the user first,
be humble, take risks.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.540
So it's nice remembering
again and again.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:37.737
I have a few questions.

00:25:37.737 --> 00:25:38.695
MICHAEL R. VIRARDI: OK.

00:25:38.695 --> 00:25:39.390
Ask one, then.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.780
AUDIENCE: My first
question is about mentors.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.162
Do you want to tell
us who were a few

00:25:47.162 --> 00:25:49.490
of your mentors along the way?

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:53.430
And my question is, how
do you find mentors?

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:57.700
Is it something that comes in
your life or you seek for them?

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.580
MICHAEL R. VIRARDI:
Excellent question--

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.350
I had many mentors.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.660
And mentors do not have age.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.690
If I'm going to be giving
a speech on technology,

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:10.460
I rush to find younger
people, older people.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.540
It depends-- the people
who are well-versed.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.330
My father was my
first ever mentor.

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:19.770
I had mentors from my university
days, my college professors.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:23.910
I even meet people on the road,
which I keep in touch, always.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:28.080
But you cannot find a mentor
if you are not ready to receive

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.620
a mentor in your life
and to receive advice.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:35.100
And I hope I have answered
your question in this way.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.060
AUDIENCE: Definitely.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:42.090
And can I ask it seems like the
father role model in your life,

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:45.010
it really played
an important role.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.610
Have you kept, I
don't know, his wisdom

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.340
in one sentence maybe
or something you want

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.000
to share with us about this?

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.450
It seems like a very
precious relationship.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.940
MICHAEL R. VIRARDI: It was a
very precious relationship.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:03.540
My father died on the
22nd of August 2017.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.420
And at that time
that he died, he

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.810
was wearing his
Virardi T-shirt which

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.020
said customer service first.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.780
So my father always
believed that you

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.890
should serve your customer.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.810
And that customer is also
the internal customer.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:22.980
And the way you treat
your internal customers

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.900
is the way that your
internal customers will

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.980
serve your external customers.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.710
So at the end of
the day, my father

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:30.930
wasn't focused on the
price of the products.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.042
He wasn't focused so
much on the quality,

00:27:33.042 --> 00:27:34.500
even though he
believed in quality,

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.080
that's why we imported
a lot of German things.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.090
But he believed in people.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.740
And he believed
in helping people.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.050
Give first, and then
you will receive.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
thank you very

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.120
much for this inspiring speech.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.820
In your second story,
you were talking

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.220
about the advice
you got to follow,

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.700
to practice two hours
of a certain topic

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.360
to become very good at it.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.170
And you immediately said,
OK, I'm going to start today.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.170
I know exactly
what this topic is.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.030
Now in my situation,
I'm 30 years old now--

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:07.920
or 29, actually.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.130
MICHAEL R. VIRARDI:
Like me, 46, 45.

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:16.000
AUDIENCE: Exactly--
I don't know yet

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.450
which is the precise topic that
I want to focus on that drives

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:21.820
me for the next 15 years.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:28.260
And I also believe that this is
kind of a generational thing.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.330
So what advice
would you give to us

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:36.330
to find this topic where you
have your passion and the topic

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:40.430
that follows you and
that basically drives you

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.220
over the next 10 to 15 years?

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.470
MICHAEL R. VIRARDI: I was 29--

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:45.970
that's a great
question, by the way.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:49.410
I was 29 years old when
I found my passion, when

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.450
I saw Jeffrey Gitomer on stage.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:52.510
I was mesmerized.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:54.060
I went up to him
and I asked him.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.100
Before that, I was working
for the family business.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.280
And even though I was
enjoying it very much,

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.210
I felt it like you
are feeling it now.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:03.570
That it might be this
or something else.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.320
What I will say to you is,
whatever you're doing now,

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.710
give it your best.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.020
As Muhammad Ali once said, if
you are sweeping the floors,

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.160
sweep it to the best
of your abilities.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.460
Give it your best, because
somebody is watching.

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.680
My late father always
told me to keep

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.050
a note for everyone I meet.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:24.482
What did I like, what I
didn't like, because even--

00:29:24.482 --> 00:29:25.940
I'm not saying
about your manager--

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.840
but even if your manager
doesn't appreciate what you do,

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.950
which is not the case,
but I'm just saying it--

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:35.940
so why are you laughing, guys?

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.950
Somebody else is watching.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:39.450
And whilst you're
doing what you are

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:42.110
doing to the best
of your abilities,

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:45.630
an opportunity will
knock the door.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.750
So be conscientious,
do what you do,

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.560
continue being knowledgeable.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.950
Put in those hours in
what you're doing now.

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:55.710
But you have to be
honest with yourselves.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:58.080
If this doesn't
inspire you, you need

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.810
to take the painful decision
and do something else.

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:03.900
And I'm not only talking
about relationships.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.610
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
ask-- you mentioned

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:09.540
that you had kind of understood
three years before you

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:13.480
left the company that you
wanted to change career paths.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.280
So how did you find the
courage to actually leave

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:21.452
after three years and just
go off and do your own thing?

00:30:21.452 --> 00:30:22.910
MICHAEL R. VIRARDI:
If there scared

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:26.870
means that I had the
courage, yes, then I

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:30.110
believed I was preparing
myself for 10 years

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:33.630
to find the courage to
go and do what I'm doing.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:37.310
And from the day that I
decided to go on my own,

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.710
I had to believe in
myself first and foremost.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:43.100
I took my father's
advice on board.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.180
And I was adamant.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.370
Even though-- and
I will tell you--

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:49.980
when I went for my first gig
and they asked me, Michael,

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.430
how much do you
charge for a speech?

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:58.430
At that time, at that time,
it was 1,500 Cyprus pounds.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:03.740
And the guy said excuse me,
1,500 pounds for a one hour

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:04.940
speech.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.120
Do you know how much your
competitors are charging?

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.290
And he told me two names which
had 30 years of experience

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:14.480
and they were
charging 500 pounds.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.150
Why should I pay
you 1,500 pounds?

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:20.120
And you don't even
have experience.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.620
And I said, sir, I was
preparing for 10 years.

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.713
And if you don't like it, I
will give you your money back.

00:31:26.713 --> 00:31:28.130
And he threw me
out of the office.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:32.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:36.260
But the next year, somebody
else believed in me.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:41.920
I kept the 1,500 ceiling
and they gave me a chance.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.780
It went on to YouTube,
which is owned,

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.990
I think you know which
company, by Google.

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:50.320
And thanks to Google,
I commanded my pricing.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.870
And thanks to the
performance on stage--

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:56.830
because my father told me, if
you are going on your own son,

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:58.627
don't put your prices low.

00:31:58.627 --> 00:32:00.460
Because if you are very
good at what you do,

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.440
it will never go up high.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.660
Or it will take 10
years to go up here.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.220
Put your prices high.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.070
Deliver more value
than expected.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:10.600
You'll get a lot of rejections.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.738
But you will get a
chance, eventually.

00:32:13.738 --> 00:32:16.030
And if you are wondering
where will you find the money,

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:18.070
you can do two
jobs until you find

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:21.537
the money to go for your dream.

00:32:21.537 --> 00:32:23.620
AUDIENCE: So you're talking
about really believing

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:28.000
in yourself and continuing
on, as well training yourself

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.550
and learning and
educating yourself.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:31.780
And then going for it?

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:32.780
MICHAEL R. VIRARDI: Yes.

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.523
But I'm a little bit against
the secret and its philosophy

00:32:35.523 --> 00:32:36.940
that think about
it, it will come.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.220
Think about-- no,
work and it will come.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.880
Put in those hours
and it will come.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:48.040
And always keep
your bridges open.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.002
My late father used to tell me
always send a Christmas card.

00:32:51.002 --> 00:32:52.960
At that time, they were
sending Christmas card.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.910
But always send
a Christmas card.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:59.500
Always connect with the people
that you meet on the road.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.710
Because your network will
determine your net worth

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:06.412
at the end of the day,
not only your abilities.

00:33:06.412 --> 00:33:08.620
AUDIENCE: And I have one
more question, if that's OK?

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:12.500
You spoke about the
true North of yourself.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:16.330
So if you do not mind, speaking
to us about that a bit more.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:19.930
MICHAEL R. VIRARDI: I will
speak about my true North.

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:24.420
Beyond possessions,
beyond positions,

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.000
I agree with my father
that you need to be humble.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.670
Because what else
is there to be?

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:34.890
And I find my true
North when I hug my son,

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:36.840
or when I'm with my wife.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.710
And I think what powers
everything is the word trust.

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:43.540
If you trust people
who are in your life,

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:47.610
you have less tension
and more trust

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:50.130
to go forward and do
what you need to do.

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:52.740
You even have allies
within your company,

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.260
within your relationship,
inside your flat,

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.700
or inside your house.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:00.060
You need allies, because no
man or woman is an island.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.780
You cannot do it alone.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:03.800
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.490
I have one more question.

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:07.760
How do we learn and
navigate around failures?

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:13.480
MICHAEL R. VIRARDI: I also
said before that when you lose,

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.920
don't lose the lesson.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.889
A failure is a
chance to understand.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:21.520
For me, when I used to work at
the Virardi family business,

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.219
I always asked, where
did you find us?

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:27.219
For you guys, you know
where did they find you.

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:29.170
It's called Google
AdWords and the rest.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:32.980
But I used to ask, and
when I fail at something,

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.400
which what is failure?

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.719
If you stand up,
you're still standing.

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:42.699
You need to ask what went
wrong, contemplate, think,

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:44.620
look at your offer again.

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:48.100
Talk to people, even to the
people who consider you,

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.540
in inverted commas, a failure.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.389
So the best way is asking.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:54.909
Like great
contingency is placing

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:56.942
the questions, more questions.

00:34:56.942 --> 00:34:58.150
Questions are very important.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.453
You judge a man or
a woman or a person

00:35:00.453 --> 00:35:01.870
by the quality of
their questions,

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:03.453
not by the quality
of their answers.

00:35:03.453 --> 00:35:04.870
That's how you
deal with failure--

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:08.155
with lots of questions.

00:35:08.155 --> 00:35:10.030
AUDIENCE: Thank you very
much for the speech.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.363
MICHAEL R. VIRARDI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:11.363 --> 00:35:14.920
AUDIENCE: I was focusing on the
part, your rule of the 7, 7, 7,

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:18.270
and then also the 10,000
hours that you put in.

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:20.260
And I mean, you were
working full time

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:21.640
for the family business.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.680
On top of that, you
put in 10,000 hours.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.250
And now you're traveling around
the world giving speeches,

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.970
and you still reply
[INAUDIBLE] 7, 7, 7.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:31.970
How do you do that?

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:34.303
MICHAEL R. VIRARDI: You can
test it tonight if you like.

00:35:34.303 --> 00:35:35.290
Yes?

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:36.880
I fly Emirates.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:42.160
There is Wi-Fi connection
if I'm going transatlantic.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:47.780
Yes, I do it because
if you're prompt,

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.430
people attribute
more things to you.

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:50.420
That you are reliable.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.010
That you are dependable.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.470
That you are the one
they should work with.

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:57.350
And it's also a
differentiator on its own.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:59.570
Marilyn asked me, how do
you deal with failures?

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:03.200
I also should turn the
question on its head.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.910
How do you deal with success?

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:09.500
I ask, why did the
American [INAUDIBLE],,

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.150
why did Microsoft hire me?

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:12.380
I asked them.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.020
And you know what's the answer
I get most of the times?

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.460
It's not because
you are the best.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.370
Because I said earlier, if
you are one in a million

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:22.100
in a 7 billion population,
there are another 7,000 people

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.155
like you which they're
very good and they

00:36:24.155 --> 00:36:26.180
may have a lower price.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:30.050
90% told me because you
are prompt, Michael.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:31.730
Because you are reliable.

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:34.220
Because we were in a hurry
to set it up, and I knew

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.870
I could count on you.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:37.760
There are other
things, of course.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.920
You shouldn't stand up here
and talk about theories

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.510
that you don't believe in.

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.700
You shouldn't talk about
other people's stories

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:48.573
except if that's an example
that you want to aim for,

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:49.740
to be truthful and the rest.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:53.000
So I do it because
it's also in my favor,

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.290
because most people won't do it.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:57.230
Imagine if somebody
walks into your house

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:59.630
and you don't greet them
because you're busy.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:00.980
It's impolite.

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.860
Somebody is walking into
your electronic house,

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.070
and they're knocking the door.

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:09.770
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much
for the speech, Mr. Virardi.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:13.133
How would you define success?

00:37:13.133 --> 00:37:14.800
MICHAEL R. VIRARDI:
Excellent question--

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:19.220
that's why I use the
word elusive for success.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.430
It cannot be defined.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:24.310
And it cannot be so broad
to include all of us.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:29.530
Success is a different thing
for every different person.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.150
If you ask me what success--

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:34.780
success is Christine
and Rolando.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:38.380
Success, for me, is
to live by the values

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.870
that my father instilled in
me, and my mother, of course.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:43.930
Success is to wake
up in the morning

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:47.450
and be happy doing what you're
doing, love what you're doing.

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:49.810
And if you're not happy with
it, I'm not saying quit.

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:52.960
But find a way to
be happy doing it.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.600
And be honest enough
if you are not.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.070
If it's after six years,
it really pains you?

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.350
Find the strength to move on.

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:04.150
That's success.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:07.300
Because some people tell me,
Michael, you are a freelancer.

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.500
Sometimes you might
not work as hard.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.000
No.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.640
I work hard to see
a vision and to go

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:17.770
after that vision
with no guarantees.

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:19.470
So for me that was success.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:21.610
For you it might
be something else.

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:23.040
But it's elusive.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.940
As they say in
theater, you are as

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.400
good as your last performance.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.940
And in my job, you are as good
as your last speech or training

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.518
session.

00:38:34.518 --> 00:38:36.060
AUDIENCE: I want to
talk a little bit

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.755
about your public
speaking career

00:38:37.755 --> 00:38:40.380
and acknowledge that about half
the people in the Google Dublin

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:43.600
office don't have English
as their first language.

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.533
So it's a challenge to
speak, but even more so

00:38:45.533 --> 00:38:47.200
when English is not
your first language.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.740
So can you tell us a little
bit about how you ramped up

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:50.850
your communication skills?

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:51.683
How do you practice?

00:38:51.683 --> 00:38:52.480
What are your tips?

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.730
MICHAEL R. VIRARDI: Excellent.

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:54.230
Very good.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.790
Because we are also addressing
this on the online program

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:59.790
that is coming out.

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.500
There was once a
great football player

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.090
by the name of
Milenko Spoljaric.

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:06.810
He used to play for my
team in Cyprus, Apollon.

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:11.560
Milenko was a very talented
player, extremely talented.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.470
He never played in Europe.

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:15.240
He never played
in the big league

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.270
because he was very slow.

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:19.250
And he gave me a
piece of advice.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:22.680
If you're a slow player,
pass the ball faster.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:26.850
The ball travels much
faster than if you dribble.

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:29.100
So if you are not
a native speaker,

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.680
it's not the fancy words.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:36.120
Keep it short, keep it simple,
and practice, practice,

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.245
practice, practice.

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:42.290
Perfect practice makes perfect.

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:43.300
So try it again.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.172
And keep it simple.

00:39:44.172 --> 00:39:46.630
Even with my mentees-- when
they come for coaching sessions

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:49.840
one on one, even if that
is-- even if they're

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.820
in their native
language is English,

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.280
I always tell them,
keep it short.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.660
Keep it simple.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.060
They gave me 45 minutes,
one hour to speak,

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.070
I spoke 30 minutes.

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.230
You shouldn't be
keeping it too long.

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.290
If the people get the gist
of what you want to say,

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:06.580
it's not the fancy words.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.160
And think about it, which
is your favorite politician?

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:14.350
My feeling is it's not someone
who uses language that you

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:17.060
cannot resonate
with or understand.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:21.370
But it's someone who
speaks to your heart.

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:22.150
Keep it short.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.110
Keep it simple.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:25.650
And practice.

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:26.680
Thank you very much.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.972
It was a pleasure and an honor.

00:40:27.972 --> 00:40:30.410
