00:00:01.341 --> 00:00:02.590
MALE SPEAKER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.360
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.725
This is part of our
Great Talks series.

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:10.355
If you'd like to learn
more, go to go/greattalks,

00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:11.910
and we could add
you to our alias

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.160
and give you more invites
to events such as this.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.080
I'd like to introduce
you to Max Boot.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.020
He's also a contributor to
"New York Times," "Los Angeles

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.550
Times," and he recently wrote a
book called "Invisible Armies,"

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.130
about the epic history
of guerrilla warfare.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.940
So without further ado, could
we please give Max a warm Google

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:31.440
welcome?

00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:36.670
MAX BOOT: Thank you very much.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.795
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:37.795 --> 00:00:39.900
Normally, I'm more
used to speaking

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.490
to military audiences who
are just a tiny bit more

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.040
regimented.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.080
But I like the informality here.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.050
It's just kind of
cool to see the place.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.030
And anyway, I'm
delighted to speak

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.550
about this little book,
or not-so-little book,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.135
which if I could just borrow
Exhibit A right here, which

00:00:56.135 --> 00:00:58.430
this gentleman is kindly--
I assume you bought it.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.190
You didn't steal it, right?

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I paid my $5.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.221
MAX BOOT: OK.

00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:01.051
You paid your $5.

00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:02.050
That's actually a steal.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.910
But this modest little tome,
which thankfully doesn't

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.480
weigh as much in
the paperback as it

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.950
did in the hardcover edition.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.230
I tried to do something
very audacious and possibly

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.470
foolhardy, which was to cover
5,000 years of guerrilla

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.470
warfare history between two hard
cover and now two soft covers.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.690
What I'm going to do here
today is even more audacious

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.230
and possibly even
more for foolhardy.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.730
Because what I'm
going to try to do,

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.750
right here before
your very eyes,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.360
is to summarize 5,000 years
of guerrilla warfare history

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.887
in about the next 25 minutes.

00:01:39.887 --> 00:01:41.720
Now, for those of you
who are better at math

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.970
than I am, and I assume that
since this is Google that

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.780
means pretty much
everybody here,

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.970
that works out to, what,
about 200 years a minute,

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.370
something like that.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.900
So fasten your seat belts
if you got any seat belts.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.810
We're going to go for a very
rapid historical journey

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.890
into a subject which I think
has a great deal of relevance

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.070
as you pay attention to what's
going on in the world today.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.540
Now, the question I get asked
most often about guerrilla

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.039
warfare is, what was
the first guerrilla war?

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.550
And that actually turns
out to be a question which

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.870
is very hard to answer,
especially when my clicker is

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.854
not working.

00:02:15.854 --> 00:02:17.520
It's really almost
impossible to answer.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.100
There we go.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.350
Thank you

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.264
Because, in fact, guerrilla
warfare is as old as mankind.

00:02:23.264 --> 00:02:24.680
There's a myth
that it was somehow

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.990
invented by the
Vietnamese or the Chinese

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.040
or somebody in the 20th century.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.900
In fact, guerrilla warfare
is as old as mankind,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.560
because tribal warfare is
essentially guerrilla warfare.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.910
Tribes don't engage in the kind
of face-to-face frontal battle

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.200
which has been said
to characterize

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.600
the Western way of war
or conventional warfare

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.760
since at least the days
of the Greek Hoplites.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.750
They don't stand there
and batter each other

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.020
into submissions.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.010
Tribes prefer to engage
in hit and run raids,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.770
launching a foray
into enemy territory,

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.020
into a neighboring
tribe's territory,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.420
shooting some fire
arrows, raping, pillaging,

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.470
and then making their
escape before the warriors

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.670
of the other tribe can
make their appearance.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.590
This is the oldest
form of warfare.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.050
It's been around as long as
mankind has been on this earth.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.230
And it is essentially
guerrilla warfare.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.680
So guerrilla warfare long
predates conventional warfare.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.400
In fact, conventional war is
a relatively recent invention.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.790
It only arose about
3,000 BC in Mesopotamia

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.090
when you have the rise
of the first city-states.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.150
Because by definition, you
can't have conventional armies

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.740
without a state
structure to support it.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.070
You need somebody to
provide the tax base.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.390
You need a hierarchy.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.040
You need uniforms.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.620
All the cool things are
we associate with armies?

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.140
Those are provided by states.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.080
It needs a formal
structure to support it.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.850
And that formal
structure only came

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.820
into being about
5,000 years ago.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.430
But even when you had the
rise of the first city-states

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.290
in Mesopotamia, most of their
adversaries, most of the people

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.000
they were fighting, were
not other city-states.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.590
Most of their wars were against
nomadic raiders from without

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.269
and rebels from within.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.570
In other words, essentially
guerrilla warfare.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.450
So we need to really
change the way

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.220
that we think about
this entire subject.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.636
And that's part
of what I'm trying

00:04:25.636 --> 00:04:26.860
to accomplish with this book.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.580
Because our mental categories
are all screwed up.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.650
We talk about unconventional
warfare, irregular warfare,

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.300
as if there's something
wrong with it,

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.120
as if this is not the way
you're supposed to fight,

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.840
as if you're actually
supposed to fight

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.464
in this conventional
way where you have

00:04:41.464 --> 00:04:43.540
these massive
armies with uniforms

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.630
maneuvering on an
empty plain somewhere.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.560
No.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.490
Those kinds of conventional
wars have always

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.430
been the exception,
not the norm.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.540
All the more so in
the modern world,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.390
which I'll come to in a
minute, but throughout history,

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.730
unconventional, irregular
war has been the norm.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.990
It is simply war.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.700
This is the way war
has been fought.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.590
So we need to change the way
we think about this subject.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.730
It's not just the US Army
in Iraq and Afghanistan

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.520
that's had to deal with
guerrillas in the past decade

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.250
or so.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.170
This is been a challenge
which has confronted

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.420
every great military force
throughout history, including

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.540
the greatest military force in
antiquity, the Roman legions.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.250
Pretty formidable, even when
not led by Russell Crowe.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.300
But we know that despite Russell
Crowe's inspired leadership,

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.360
Rome ultimately did fall.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.765
And why did Rome fall?

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.820
That's the fall of Rome.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.390
Rome, like the United States,
was a superpower without peer.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.660
It did not have other superpower
rivals on its borders.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.710
And yet it was
surrounded by enemies,

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.450
those whom the Romans
fondly called barbarians.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.150
And who were the barbarians?

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.280
They were not conventional
military forces

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.090
like the Roman legions.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.240
They were irregulars, who by and
large fought as, essentially,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.520
raiders or guerrillas.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.440
In fact, the downfall
of the Roman Empire

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.610
was brought about
by the invasion

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.600
into Western Europe
around 370 AD by the Huns,

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.180
led of course by their
fearsome leader, Attila.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.810
Let me just read to you,
and you may well laugh.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.307
By the way, nobody
actually knows

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:32.640
what Attila the Hun looked like.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.514
There's not a single
portrait from real life.

00:06:34.514 --> 00:06:38.560
This is a fanciful
19th century invention.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.880
But we do know a little bit
about the way the Huns fought.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.280
And let me just read you
a very brief description

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.130
from a Roman writer
in the fourth century.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.580
He wrote of the Huns, "They are
very quick in their operations,

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.390
of exceeding speed and fond
of surprising their enemies.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.275
They suddenly
disperse, then reunite.

00:06:56.275 --> 00:06:59.170
And again, after having
inflicted vast loss

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.740
upon the enemy,
scatter themselves

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.960
over the whole plain in
irregular formations,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.960
always avoiding a fort
or an entrenchment."

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.992
Now, I would submit
to you, that's

00:07:10.992 --> 00:07:12.950
a pretty good description
of guerrilla warfare,

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.265
whether practiced in the
fifth century by the Huns

00:07:17.265 --> 00:07:20.180
or as practiced today
by so many guerrilla

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.170
groups or terrorist
groups around the world,

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.250
from Syria to Afghanistan to
Iraq and to many other places.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.370
That pattern of
hit and run raids,

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.940
of not standing still, of
not having front lines,

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.550
those are the characteristics
of guerrilla warfare

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.440
no matter how it's
been practiced

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.160
through the centuries.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.950
Now, by stressing the
continuity and guerrilla

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.800
warfare over the
millennia, I don't

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.080
mean to suggest that
nothing has changed.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.330
In fact, there have been
some significant changes.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.000
The biggest changes of all,
to my mind, what really

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.390
distinguishes modern guerrilla
warfare or modern terrorism

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.330
from ancient guerrilla
warfare is really

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.970
the rise of
politics, propaganda,

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.170
public opinion-- the three Ps.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.350
These are all characteristics
of modern, irregular conflicts.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.345
And they were not very
important in the kind

00:08:09.345 --> 00:08:12.250
of ancient guerrilla
warfare fought by the Huns.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.880
The conflict which really
symbolizes the transition

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.020
from ancient to
modern, to my mind,

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.650
is our very own
revolution, which

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.970
was fought, we should
recall, not just with muskets

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.270
and swords but also
with broadsides,

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:29.870
like Thomas Payne's famous
bestseller, "Common Sense."

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.049
When we think about the battles
of the American Revolution,

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:37.700
we tend to think about battles
like Lexington and Concord,

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.640
where the Read Coats are very
chagrined to find these Yankee

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.020
rascals slithering around
on their bellies and firing

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.770
at them from behind
trees and rocks

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.400
and doing all sorts
of other things

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.260
that were considered to
be not quite cricket.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.320
They were, in fact,
using guerrilla warfare.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.110
And that was certainly
a significant part

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.820
of the American Revolution.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.050
But ultimately, it was not
where the American Revolution

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.076
was decided.

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:04.450
The way I remember
the Revolution

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.470
being taught in school-- and
I'm old enough that it in my day

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.590
the Revolution was
still taught in school.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.740
I seem to recall that
the narrative essentially

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:17.260
ends around the Battle
of Yorktown in 1781,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:22.520
when Lord Cornwallis surrendered
about 7,000 regulars to General

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.430
Washington.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.430
That was the last major battle
of the American Revolution.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.269
But it did not have to
be the last major battle.

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:32.060
And this is a point
that I think is usually

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.160
missing from accounts of
the War of Independence.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.120
Because in fact, even
after Yorktown, even

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.210
after Saratoga before
that, the British empire

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.920
was still the mightiest
military force in the world.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.780
They still had tens of thousands
of troops in North America,

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.980
tens of thousands more in
other parts of the empire.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.780
And they could have
hired tens of thousands

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.870
more mercenaries from
the German states

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.950
as they had previously done.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.680
I can assure you that
if our ancestors,

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.070
if the founding fathers had been
fighting not the British empire

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.850
but the Roman Empire,
the story would not

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.170
have had a happy ending.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.080
Because the Romans did not
take defeat sitting down.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.277
They did not give up.

00:10:13.277 --> 00:10:15.110
Almost certainly, they
would have come back,

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.150
and Washington,
Jefferson, Adams,

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.940
and the other
founding fathers would

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:23.050
have been crucified,
quite literally.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.130
The fact that this
did not happen

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.670
is because of an institution
that the Romans did not

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.780
have to worry much
about, a parliament.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.260
In fact, I would argue to
you that the turning point,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
the decisive point of
the American Revolution

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.660
did not occur at Saratoga or
Yorktown or any other battle

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:41.960
in North America.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.390
It actually happened
in the House of Commons

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:53.290
in 1782, where on February 28,
1782, a decisive vote was held.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:57.220
By a very thin
margin, 234 to 215--

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.630
it was that close--
the House of Commons

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:04.360
voted to discontinue offensive
operations in North America.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.730
This was a stinging blow to Lord
North and his hard line Tory

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.480
ministry.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.190
It in fact led to the
downfall of Lord North

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.630
and the rise of a Whig
ministry under Lord Rockingham

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.660
that was committed
to conciliation

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.440
with their American brethren.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.900
Now, it's hard to overstate
how incredibly important.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.950
this event was.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.250
Because here you had this
great power, the superpower

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.250
of its day, that had the
capacity to keep fighting,

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:37.550
but chose not to do so
because its public opinion had

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.360
turned against the war.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.250
This was not something that
happened in centuries past.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.350
But it's happened quite a
few times in centuries since,

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.340
most recently in Vietnam.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:53.620
It's exactly what the fighters
that we face in Afghanistan

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.590
are trying to achieve.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.730
They know they can't
defeat us on a battlefield,

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.920
all they're trying to do is to
change American public opinion

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.180
to lead to a pull
of American forces.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.400
And guess what?

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.690
I think they're probably
going to be successful.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.590
This is a strategy
that really dates back

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.320
to our own War of Independence.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.590
And it's one that has influenced
generation after generation

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:19.650
of insurgent
strategists ever since,

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:24.030
including this gentleman, who
was the foremost guerrilla

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.700
strategist of the 20th century.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:32.230
Mao Tse-tung wrote, in 1938,
one of the great classics

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.200
of guerrilla
warfare, which I hope

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.990
is on all of your
nightstand tables

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.710
and you study it
religiously every night,

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.320
a little volume called
"On Protracted War," which

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.860
can be found, of course, in
his "Little Red Book," which

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.400
I'm sure all of you have.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:54.500
What Mao wrote and produced was
a document telling his troops

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.360
how to fight a much more
powerful, entrenched adversary.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.330
And some of the advice he
offered included the following.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.390
He said that people
are like water,

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.810
and the Army is like fish.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.510
He stressed the need to keep
the closest possible relations

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.830
with the common people.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.250
He told his troops, "Be
courteous and polite.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.890
Pay for all articles.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.010
Establish latrines a safe
distance from people's houses."

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.460
And so forth and so on.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.980
Why was Mao offering
this advice?

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.340
Was it because he was a
soft-hearted humanitarian who

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.990
really have the welfare
of the people at heart?

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:30.430
I don't think so.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.940
Morally, I would argue,
there was probably

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.000
very little to distinguish
Mao from someone

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.310
like Attila the Hun.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.500
And yet Mao was
telling his troops

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.440
to behave in a very
different way from the way

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.840
that the Huns had behaved
more than 1,000 years earlier.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.100
Why was that?

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.700
Because Mao understood
that the nature of warfare

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.680
had changed in the
modern age, that you

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.560
could no longer fight this
nomadic style of warfare

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.080
that the Huns had
pursued in ancient times.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.530
In the modern era, you had to
take account of public opinion,

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:03.600
whether you liked it or not.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.610
In order to create a
force powerful enough

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.630
to overthrow an entrenched
government like the Kuomintang,

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:12.032
you had to be able
to control base areas

00:14:12.032 --> 00:14:14.240
where you could tax the
people, where you could train

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.448
your troops, where you could
spread propaganda, where

00:14:16.448 --> 00:14:18.480
you could do everything
necessary to raise

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.400
a powerful military force.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.650
And to do that, you had to keep
the people on your side, which

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.740
is why he gave very
strict instructions on how

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:31.210
his troops should behave
with the common people.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.470
That's an indication of how
much more powerful and pertinent

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.940
public opinion is
today than it was

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.920
in the early days of
guerrilla warfare.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.310
Of course, public opinion
is even more important

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.750
when it comes to
terrorism, which

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.960
the anarchists of
the 19th century

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.430
defined as propaganda
by the deed.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.430
That's because terrorists have
very little military power,

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:56.870
even less than guerrillas.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:01.020
They cannot possibly hope
to topple an existing regime

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.000
by force.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.280
The most they can
hope to do is to stage

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.550
a few spectacular attacks
like this one, which

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.680
they know will
generate headlines

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.580
and they hope will lead to
a change in public opinion

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:17.670
and to move the public policy
in a direction that they favor.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.510
Which is by the way why
there was almost no terrorism

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.104
before the second half
of the 19th century.

00:15:23.104 --> 00:15:25.520
Because there was no way for
them to get their message out

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.550
before the rise
of the mass media,

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.910
which was enabled by
high- speed printing

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.560
presses, the telegraph,
and, of course, later,

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.440
radio, television, the
internet, satellite TV.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.630
All these media are tailor
made for terrorists,

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.050
because essentially what
they're trying to do

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.450
is to stage acts that
will create publicity.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.680
And so they have a way
to get their story out.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.190
This is something that
the foremost terrorists

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.100
the modern times recognized.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.420
Osama bin Laden once wrote that
the media war is as much as 90%

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.380
of the whole in the
waging of jihad.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.550
That's how much
importance he ascribed

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:07.450
to this particular
method of fighting.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.760
I would argue that the rising
power of public opinion

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.540
helps to explain one of
the interesting trends

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.450
that I uncovered in the
course of my book research.

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.680
Most of that book is just
a straight out narrative

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.820
of 5,000 years of history built
around colorful and exciting

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.480
personalities, like Michael
Collins, Orde Wingate, TE

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.010
Lawrence, and many others.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.540
But at the end of
the book, I make,

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.140
what is for me, a very
rare foray, in fact,

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.550
a unique foray, into the
realm of social science.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.960
Because I compiled at
the end of the book

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:45.140
a database of insurgencies
since 1775 coded for outcome.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.270
And what does that
database show?

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:51.880
It shows that rebels have
been getting more successful.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.450
Prior to 1945, insurgents
were winning about 20%

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.950
of their campaigns.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:02.990
Since 1945, they've been winning
about 40% of their campaigns.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.460
Now, what accounts for
that rising success rate?

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.260
Part of it is due to the spread
of ever more powerful weaponry,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.089
which I'll talk
about in a minute.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.700
But I would argue to
you the largest factor

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.780
is simply the rising
power of public opinion.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.099
That's kind of the trump
card that insurgents have.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:23.900
That's a way that they can
influence a much more powerful

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.770
adversary and convince
them to stop fighting,

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.220
even if they have not been
beaten on the battlefield.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.930
And by the way, this
is not only an issue

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.800
for democracies like ours,
although it obviously is.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.600
In the modern world, it's an
issue for dictatorships, too.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.250
Just ask Muammar Gaddafi.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.260
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.410
You can't ask Gaddafi,
because he's dead.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.580
And why is he dead?

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.810
Because he tried to put down an
uprising in the tried and true

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.800
fashion of dictators everywhere
throughout history, fire

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.840
and sword, killing
people left and right.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.640
It didn't work, however.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.020
Why didn't it work?

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.775
Because in the modern age, his
atrocities, or the atrocities

00:18:01.775 --> 00:18:03.520
he was about to
carry out, received

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.000
international publicity
and mobilized a coalition

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.490
of outside states led
by the United States

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:10.500
to come in and help the rebels.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.900
And that ultimately led to
Gaddafi's death and downfall.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.890
That's an example of how
public opinion matters

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.550
in the modern age, even
for countries where

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.330
they don't have elected regimes.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.380
But it really matters
for countries like ours

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.020
or Israel or Britain
or others, where

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.780
you do have elected governments.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.910
So this has been a game changer
in the realm of guerrilla

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:33.410
warfare.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.650
And it's really been a huge
advantage for insurgents.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.770
But, having said
that, I don't think we

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.630
should go too far in
the other direction.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.410
And certainly
after World War II,

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:46.780
there was a tendency
to deify guerrillas

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.900
as these 10-foot-tall
superhumans who could not

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.130
possibly be defeated
by military force.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.000
A lot of that was a result of
the well publicized success

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.290
of a few high-profile insurgents
like Mao Tse-tung, Ho Chi

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.400
Minh, Fidel Castro.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.520
But let's not lose sight
of the larger picture.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.780
Remember the statistic I cited
to you just a minute ago.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.890
Even if in the post-'45 era
insurgents are winning 40%

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:18.270
percent of their campaigns,
what's the flip side of that?

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.430
Obviously, they're
still losing 60%.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.830
They're still more
likely than not to fail.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.290
And to illustrate that
part of the story,

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:31.080
let me cite to you the example
of a man whose picture once

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.359
adorned every dorm room
wall on the planet,

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:35.650
and actually probably still
adorns every dorm room wall

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.335
at my alma mater, which is Cal.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:44.030
How did Che Guevara become
such an idol of youth

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.600
and such a boon for makers
of t-shirts and posters?

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.160
It wasn't just because
he had a great beret.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.380
It was because of the success
that he and hi friend Fidel

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:58.120
Castro had in the 1950s in
overthrowing the Batista regime

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.290
in Cuba, which indeed was
a very impressive campaign,

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:06.110
because you had a few hundred
rebels in the mountains of Cuba

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.490
without a lot of heavy
weaponry and without,

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.610
by the way, great hygiene,
and lots of beards.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.460
But they were
fighting a regime that

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.310
was supported by the
United States, Batista, who

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:19.655
had an army of something like
20,000 men, who had tanks, who

00:20:19.655 --> 00:20:21.815
had airplanes, who
had naval ships, all

00:20:21.815 --> 00:20:23.730
of the paraphernalia
of modern warfare.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:28.210
And so the fact that Fidel
and Che and their crew

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.190
managed to march into Havana
seems pretty impressive.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.890
And it was pretty impressive.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.730
But it becomes
more understandable

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:37.800
if you look a little closer and
you understand that by the time

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.310
he fell at the end
of the 1950s, Batista

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.440
had lost all legitimacy.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.640
He was widely despised by
all sectors of Cuban society,

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.035
even the chamber of commerce
had turned against him.

00:20:52.035 --> 00:20:54.160
Now that's a bad sign, when
the chamber of commerce

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.310
turns against an
existing regime.

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.410
And so that's why
it was possible

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:02.464
that this corrupt, unpopular,
illegitimate, unelected ruler--

00:21:02.464 --> 00:21:03.880
that's why it was
possible for him

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.250
to be overthrown by a relatively
small band of fighters.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.070
But like many victorious
generals over the centuries,

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.420
Che suffered from a
severe case of hubris.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.690
He imagined he could
replicate elsewhere

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:19.160
the success that he
had had in Cuba, which

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:23.360
is why in 1966 he
went to Bolivia.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.900
And that's Che right there,
the very bearded gentleman

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:31.300
in the lower part of the photo,
trying to foment a revolution.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.460
But in Bolivia he found a
very different situation

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.700
from the one that had
confronted him in Cuba.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.080
Because, in fact, the leader
of Bolivia at the time

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.460
was not this unpopular,
unelected autocrat.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.875
Bolivia actually had a popular
left-wing elected president,

00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:49.370
who had already instituted
land reform, which

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:51.880
was the chief
Marxist calling card.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.610
Whereas by contrast,

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.610
Che came in with a
handful of outsiders,

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.270
not a Bolivian among them.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.626
They didn't even speak the
local Indian languages.

00:22:00.626 --> 00:22:02.000
In fact, I think
it's fair to say

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.920
that during his time in
Bolivia, Che's favorite,

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.110
closest friend was
his mule Chico.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:13.610
So it's not a great surprise
that before long, he

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.340
was hunted down by these
guys, Bolivian army rangers

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:20.344
advised by US Army Special
forces and the CIA.

00:22:20.344 --> 00:22:22.260
And this was the end of
the great Che Guevara,

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:26.430
his corpse being
poked by his enemies.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.020
Now, I would submit
to you that even

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.680
if an insurgent as
legendary as Che Guevara

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.880
could ultimately be hunted
down, defeated, and killed,

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.270
there is no insurgency so
strong it could not be defeated.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:41.300
The question is, how?

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.410
Well, we are very
lucky in this regard

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.170
that two of the great
powers of Europe

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.180
conducted, for our
benefit, a controlled

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:52.500
experiment in
counterinsurgency in the 1950s.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.450
On the one hand, you had
the French in Algeria

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:59.030
from 1954 to 1962.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.650
On the other hand, you
had the British in Malaya

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.720
from 1948 to 1960.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.710
And they fought in
very different styles.

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:11.290
The French really exemplified
the fire and sword,

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:15.060
the heavy-handed mailed fist
approach to counterinsurgency,

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.780
whereas the British
approach in Malaya

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.980
was more emblematic of what
came to be known as the Hearts

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.640
and Minds school of
counter insurgency.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.640
Now let me explain a little
bit more about what that means.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.940
If you want to find out what
the French did in Algeria,

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.945
you don't have to stand
here and listen to me.

00:23:34.945 --> 00:23:37.070
You should go home and
rent, if you haven't already

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.540
done so, that wonderful movie,
"The Battle of Algiers,"

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.610
which is actually a very
accurate depiction of what

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:49.060
happened during the battle
in Algiers in the late 1950s.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.890
At that time, the
Algerian insurgents

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.560
were setting off
bombs in Algiers,

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.040
the capital of Algeria.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.740
And they were killing civilians,
including European civilians.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.260
The local security forces
seemed helpless to stop

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.570
this wave of terror.

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:06.130
And so in desperation,
the French authorities

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:09.460
turned to the elite of the
French army, the 10th Parachute

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.960
Division under
General Jacques Massu.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.530
The paratroopers swiftly
marched into the kasbah,

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:18.140
the native quarter of
Algiers, and began rounding up

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.780
tens of thousands of young
men for interrogation

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.890
to find out who were
the terrorists lurking

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:25.790
in their midst.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.530
Now we know what happened in
these interrogation centers,

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:32.830
in part because of the testimony
of this man, Henri Alleg,

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.700
who was not himself Algerian.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.130
He was actually
French, a French Jew,

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.830
but he was also a communist, and
he ran a Republican newspaper

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.500
in Algiers, which
was crime enough

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.390
to get him arrested
by the paratroopers.

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.400
And he later wrote a short
book describing his ordeal.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.200
We're all familiar with
ancient instruments of torture,

00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.370
like the rack or
the iron maiden.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.060
Well, Henri Alleg
was introduced to

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.940
a new and modern and
fiendish form of torture,

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:09.470
are known as the gegene, which
was simply a hand-crank dynamo

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.230
originally developed to
power field telephones.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:15.280
And it had a couple of clips,
which you can see on the right,

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.210
and a handle you could turn.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.200
And the faster you
turned that handle,

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.310
the more electricity comes out.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.550
This was a favorite
instrument of interrogation

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:27.450
used by the French
security forces in Algeria.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.880
Henri Alleg described
what happened to him

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.120
when he was dragged into
an interrogation center.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:39.810
And he first had the
clips applied to his ear

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:40.940
and to his finger.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.250
He wrote, "A flash of lightning
exploded next to my ear.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.170
And I felt my heart
racing in my breast.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.300
I struggled, screaming."

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.960
Then, when he still would not
tell the paratroopers what

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.740
they wanted to hear, they took
one of the clips off is ear

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.270
and attached it to his penis.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:00.060
He wrote that his "body
shook with nervous shocks,

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:03.020
getting stronger in intensity."

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.050
And still, he was tough,
this newspaper editor.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.380
He still would not tell them
what they wanted to know.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.040
And so they took him down
off the interrogation table,

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.670
they beat him, and they
dragged him into another room

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:18.140
where he experienced
another form of torture

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.870
that they called the
[? touillot ?], what

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.990
we know better as waterboarding.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:24.850
He wrote, "I had the
impression of drowning

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:29.360
and a terrible agony of death
itself took possession of me."

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.900
After this ordeal, he was
tossed into a cell, still naked,

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.370
left to spend the night
on a barbed wire mattress,

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:38.510
listening to the screams
and thuds of other detainees

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.275
getting similar treatment in
this interrogation facility.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:47.570
It's sometimes said that
torture doesn't work.

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:48.760
Don't you believe it.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.920
At least in the case of
Algeria, it was very tactically

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.060
effective, because using
such brutal methods

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.820
of interrogation, the
French paratroopers

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.660
cracked the entire terrorist
infrastructure in Algiers

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.800
in a matter of months.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.650
By the end of
1957, no more bombs

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:05.900
were going off in Algiers.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.935
And so the French generals
and the paratroopers

00:27:09.935 --> 00:27:11.560
could congratulate
themselves that they

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.460
had won their war on terror.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.505
Or had they?

00:27:15.505 --> 00:27:17.960
Well, as we know with
the benefit of hindsight,

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.510
they want a short-term
tactical victory

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:24.380
at the cost of long-term,
strategic defeat.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.090
Because there was no
way to conceal what

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:31.360
was going on in this city not
far from the shores of Europe.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.590
Some people who were
tortured, like Henri Alleg,

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:36.490
came forward to
tell their story.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.610
And gradually the
new seeped out.

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.510
And as the people in France
began to read headlines

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:44.480
about what their security forces
were doing in their name, how

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.810
their own army was acting
just like the Gestapo,

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.892
support for the war
effort plummeted.

00:27:49.892 --> 00:27:52.350
And not just in France, but
all around the world, including

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.410
in the United States,
where John F. Kennedy made

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:59.450
a memorable speech against the
French war effort in Algeria.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:02.870
As a result of that, de Gaulle,
by then President of France,

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.294
realized that it
was going to cost

00:28:04.294 --> 00:28:05.835
too much to try to
hold onto Algeria.

00:28:05.835 --> 00:28:10.600
And so in 1962, he granted
Algeria its independence.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.670
And pretty much all of
the European settlers

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:16.000
had to leave or
risk being killed.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.150
This was a shattering
defeat for France.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:20.320
And it's an illustration
of the dangers

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.370
of being overly heavy
handed in your approach

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.540
to counterinsurgency,
because that can backfire,

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.130
as it in fact did for
the French in Algeria.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:31.770
Now, as it happens, on the
other side of the world,

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:34.480
the British were trying
a very different approach

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.800
to counterinsurgency in Malaya.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:42.270
Gerald Templer took over as
commander of British forces

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:47.500
and as governor general
in Malaya in 1952.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.270
When he arrived, he found
a very dire situation.

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:54.290
The Malayan races Liberation
Army, the communist group

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:57.250
that was fighting British
rule, was blowing up trains.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.660
They were attacking
rubber plantations.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:03.960
They were in the midst
of a wave of terror

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.690
that many feared would
drive the British out.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.640
In fact, the very car,
the very Rolls Royce

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.480
in which General Templer drove
from the airport in Kuala

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.690
Lumpur to government
house, the very car

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:16.780
was riddled with bullets.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.760
Because just a few
months previously,

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.180
his predecessor, the
previous governor general,

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.420
had been assassinated
in that very vehicle.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.285
That must have been
a sobering ride.

00:29:26.285 --> 00:29:28.910
And it would have been very easy
if, under those circumstances,

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:32.480
Templer decided that he had
no choice but to terrorize

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.620
the population
into acquiescence.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.090
But that's not what he
did, because he understood

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:40.860
that the key to victory was not
in terrorizing the population,

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.760
but in controlling
the population.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.780
And so how did he go about
controlling the population?

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.220
Well, he undertook a
number of initiatives,

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.110
including the creation of
these new villages where

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.140
many of the Chinese
squatters, who

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.150
were at the heart of the
rebellion, were relocated.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:59.660
Because Templar understood
that these Chinese squatters

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.440
who had no citizenship,
no land rights, little

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.090
in the way of livelihood,
they were prime recruits

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:08.170
for communist agitators.

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:13.470
And so to take away the
manpower base of the insurgency,

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:16.460
the British moved large
numbers of these squatters

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.170
into these fortified
new villages

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:21.930
where they had access to
clean water, schools, fields

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:23.435
to till, hospitals.

00:30:23.435 --> 00:30:25.310
And oh, by the way, they
were also surrounded

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:28.880
by guards and barbed
wire to prevent

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.750
them physically from
supporting the insurgency.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.300
The British did
other things as well.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:38.340
For example, they sent aircraft
over fly rebel held areas.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.730
Not the bomb them,
but to drop leaflets

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.310
calling on them to surrender.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.240
Some of them were even
equipped with loudspeakers

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.610
that would call out individual
rebels on the ground

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:52.080
by name, which was a very
spooky and effective tactic.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.080
The British also sent SAS teams.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.640
Once they had pinpointed
the rebel locations

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.500
to execute very precise raids
that did not hurt civilians,

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.840
but would wind up
rounding up the leadership

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.850
of the insurgency.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:09.750
They even imported headhunters
from Borneo to act as trackers.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.940
But at the end of the day,
what Templer understood

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.860
was that the war was going to
be won or lost among the people.

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.730
And Templer is famous
for two sayings, which

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:23.490
still characterize his
school of counterinsurgency.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:26.730
He said, "The shooting side
of the business is only 25%

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:27.750
of the trouble.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:29.910
And the other 75%
lies in getting

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:32.000
the people the
country behind us."

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.510
He also said, "The answer lies
not in pouring more troops

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.560
into the jungles, but
in the hearts and minds

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.520
of the people."

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.692
There's that famous phrase.

00:31:40.692 --> 00:31:42.400
That's where it first
became popular, was

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.690
when Templer used it.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.760
And it's often been misused
to think that somehow

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.360
the counterinsurgency
forces are in a battle

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.567
to win the love and
affection of the population.

00:31:52.567 --> 00:31:55.150
That's kind of how we approach
things in Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.480
where we showered
tens of billions

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.560
of goodies on the populace,
with water treatment

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.360
plants, hospitals, schools,
all sorts of great stuff

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.910
to get them to love us
and reject the insurgency.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:11.180
Well, as it turns out,
that doesn't really work.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.529
Because while people may
like having schools or water

00:32:13.529 --> 00:32:15.070
treatment plants or
whatever, they're

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:17.700
not going to support you if
they're going to get killed.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:21.880
There has to be basic security
before any of that other stuff

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.100
can come into play.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.000
And that's something
that Templer understood,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.480
that you had to have security.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.640
But he also understood
that you would not

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.300
have ultimate and lasting
security unless there

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.200
was a reason for the people
to support the government.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.330
He understood you could
not keep the populace down

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:38.850
at bayonet point indefinitely.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:40.600
And so he had to
give them a reason

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.540
to support the
British war effort.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.410
And so what did he do?

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:46.550
He basically made a deal
with the people of Malaya.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:49.510
He said, if you support
us, the British,

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:51.540
against this
communist uprising, we

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.519
will grant you, the people
of Malaya, independence.

00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:57.560
Now, that was something
that the Malayans wanted.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.130
It gave them a reason
to support the British.

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:01.950
I mean, it seems
like a no-brainer.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.210
And yet, at the very same
time, the French in Algeria

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.890
were trying to make
the Algerians fight

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:11.430
for a continuation of
French colonial role.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.760
No wonder they lost.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.060
By contrast, the strategy that
Templer employed in Malaya,

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:20.720
of providing security while
at the same time providing

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.360
legitimacy, that has
really characterized

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.780
most successful
counterinsurgency efforts

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.670
in the modern world, whether
in Northern Ireland, Colombia,

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.860
Iraq, or elsewhere.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.290
Now, the final part
of my presentation,

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.620
I want to do
something important,

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.820
which is to answer the
question some of you may have,

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.360
I know a question a lot of
people in Washington have,

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.925
which is, so what?

00:33:43.925 --> 00:33:45.810
Why does any of
this stuff matter?

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:48.310
I mean, if you listen to a lot
of people inside the Beltway,

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:50.350
they'll tell you
counterinsurgency

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:51.610
is so yesterday.

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:53.200
Been there, done
that, didn't like it.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.730
We moved on to something else.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:55.926
We're out of Iraq.

00:33:55.926 --> 00:33:57.300
We're getting out
of Afghanistan.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.140
We're not going to
get involved in Syria.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.846
We're pivoting to the Pacific.

00:34:00.846 --> 00:34:02.220
We're not going
to do these kinds

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:05.320
of ankle biter,
brushfire type of wars.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.330
We're going to get ready for
the big one against China

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:10.639
or somebody else.

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.780
Well, that's the
thinking of the day.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:17.630
The problem is reality
doesn't necessarily cooperate.

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.399
I mean, it would be wonderful
if our enemies fought us

00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:21.940
in exactly the way
that we preferred.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:25.440
It would be great if
every enemy that we

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.610
face would put a big
tank army out there

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:30.000
in the desert with a
big "hit me" sign on it.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.179
We know how to do
that kind of war.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:35.690
Unfortunately, we can't count
on every single adversary being

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:39.199
quite as obliging
as Saddam Hussein.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:41.198
Most of the world has
gotten the message.

00:34:41.198 --> 00:34:42.989
You're not going to
get too far by fighting

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:45.380
the American armed
forces in the open field.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:47.340
And so therefore,
they've resorted

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.050
to other ways of
fighting us that

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:51.380
have proven more
successful, essentially

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.590
to using guerrilla
and terrorist tactics.

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:56.570
That has a much higher
percentage chance

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:58.590
of prevailing against
the superpower.

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.300
That's why we've seen so much
of it in the last few decades.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.300
That's why we're going
to see a lot more of it.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:08.320
It's not going away, as the
terrible attack on the Boston

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.970
Marathon should remind us.

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:11.850
It's not just the
threat in distant lands,

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:14.170
it's a threat
right here at home.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:16.300
In fact, one of the
really disturbing trends

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:20.970
in the last 100 years
suggest that attacks

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:22.430
like the one at
the Boston Marathon

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:26.190
or even the terrible attack
of 9/11, that may only

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:29.470
be a small taste of what we
have to fear in the future.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.370
Because one of the big
trends in the last 100 years

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:34.100
is that the amount
of destructive power

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.330
available to the
individual is increasing.

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:38.500
I mean, think about it.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.110
A century ago,
when Western armies

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.020
were campaigning
against guerrillas

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.612
on the plains of the Midwest,
for example, or in Africa

00:35:45.612 --> 00:35:48.070
or elsewhere, their enemies
were usually armed with nothing

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:53.090
more than bows and arrows,
maybe a few muskets or rifles.

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:56.590
Today, by contrast, there is no
corner of the world so remote

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:58.550
that every young man
doesn't have access

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:03.530
to an AK-47 or rocket-propelled
grenade, explosives,

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:06.260
all these very simple,
low-tech infantry weapons,

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.700
which have nevertheless
taken a terrible toll

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:13.020
among American troops
in Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.110
And what might the future bring?

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.650
Well, I don't mean to
seem unduly alarmist,

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:20.460
but we do have to contemplate
the possibility that terrorists

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.540
get their hands on weapons
of mass destruction.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.220
That's a pretty
terrifying scenario,

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:28.070
because I'm very much concerned
that George Clooney may not

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:30.660
be there to save us
in the nick of time.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:33.640
And what happens if George
Clooney is not there?

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.410
Well, let me leave you
with one slide here, which

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:40.180
is from a magazine that
I'm sure all of you

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:43.460
read and probably have
piled up in your basements.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.000
This is of course the
International Journal

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.670
of Health Geographics, the 2007
issue, if it jogs your memory.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:54.380
This was a study that was done
by a team of scientists of what

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.990
would happen if various-sized
nuclear devices were set off

00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:59.956
in various American cities.

00:36:59.956 --> 00:37:01.330
I don't want to
unduly alarm you,

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:03.940
so I'm not showing you what
would happen to where you live,

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.860
I'm showing you all what
would happen to where I live,

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.520
because I happen to
live in Manhattan, right

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.800
about the mid-center there.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:17.010
This is a chart that illustrates
a possible 20-kiloton device

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:18.870
exploding in lower Manhattan.

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:22.150
A 20-kiloton device, I would
add, is not very powerful.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:24.620
It's about the same
size as the bombs that

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.990
leveled Hiroshima
and Nagasaki in 1945.

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:29.730
It's a relatively
primitive weapon

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:31.582
by the standards
of atomic weapons.

00:37:31.582 --> 00:37:33.540
And yet, what would be
the consequence of this?

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:37.150
Well, as you can see, anybody
who lives south of Yonkers

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.800
is going to be in deep trouble.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.170
The study actually
estimates that something

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:45.130
like more than 600,000 people
would be killed and 1.6 million

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:46.510
would be injured.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:49.280
That's a pretty sobering
thing to think about.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.360
But that is, in fact,
the potential future

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.280
of low-intensity conflict.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.130
I don't mean to be
overly alarmist here,

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:58.810
and I certainly
don't mean to suggest

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.820
this is going to
happen tomorrow.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:01.820
I hope it never happens.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.190
But we have to consider
the terrible possibility

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:07.360
that it could happen, or
something similar could happen.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.880
And that's why we cannot
afford to ignore low-intensity

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.985
conflict.

00:38:11.985 --> 00:38:13.860
We can pretend that it's
not an issue for us.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.540
We can pretend it's going away.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:16.220
But it's not.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:17.190
It's going to be here.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.220
It's always been here,
always will be here.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.280
And the threat is
only getting worse.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.120
That's why I think it's all the
more imperative to understand

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.950
the history, to understand
the doctrine and the potential

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:28.035
of this kind of warfare.

00:38:28.035 --> 00:38:29.410
And that's why I
wrote this book.

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:34.380
And I hope by reading it people
can understand a little bit

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.690
better the nature of the
dominant military threat

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.290
that we face going
forward, which

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:41.730
is identical to the dominant
military threat we've

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:43.720
faced in centuries past.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.325
So with that, let me
stop talking at you.

00:38:46.325 --> 00:38:48.200
And I assume we have
time for some questions.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.658
Or hope we have
time for questions.

00:38:55.014 --> 00:38:57.060
AUDIENCE: Can you say
if there's a correlation

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:02.002
between-- on the
one hand, you say

00:39:02.002 --> 00:39:03.710
guerrilla warfare is
much more successful

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.420
because of the rise of media.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:09.910
Is there a correlation
between the reigning powers

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:14.260
having less control or less
dominance over their economies

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:14.830
as well?

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.790
So what I mean by that is,
like, if everybody was already

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:21.140
involved in the army, like
if you had mass conscription,

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:24.300
then there was nobody
else left to win over.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.970
It's a lot harder to
win over a soldier

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:28.140
than it is to win over
an unaffected a person.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.380
Whereas today,
our volunteer army

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.370
is a very small
percentage of the US.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.510
And so you can win
over the population,

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:38.010
because they're not
necessarily part

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:40.462
of the war effort against it.

00:39:40.462 --> 00:39:41.920
And they also have
a lot more money

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.003
and they can actually speak
out against government

00:39:44.003 --> 00:39:46.890
then maybe serfs could
have in the 1500s.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.924
Is there anything to
suggest that that's true?

00:39:49.924 --> 00:39:51.340
MAX BOOT: It's an
intriguing idea.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.270
But just off the
top of my head, I'm

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:55.540
not instantly convinced
of that analysis.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.300
Because when you
think about it, look

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.230
at what happened with
the Bolshevik Revolution

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:01.770
in Russia, for example.

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:04.760
A lot of what occurred
among disaffected soldiers

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.120
and sailors who were
mutinying against the tsar

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.645
because they were on the
losing end of a conflict.

00:40:09.645 --> 00:40:12.270
Or if you look at what happened
in Vietnam, which was the worst

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:14.480
military defeat in our history.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.730
The reason why that occurred
is because public opinion

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:17.879
turned against the war.

00:40:17.879 --> 00:40:19.920
And a lot of the reason
why public opinion turned

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.190
against the war was because
we had a large conscript army.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:29.330
And so lots of young
men and their families

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:31.510
were afraid that were going
to be drafted and sent

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:33.310
to Vietnam, which
they didn't want to.

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:35.320
And that really
was what generated

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.770
a lot of the momentum for
the anti-war movement, which

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:41.080
I think ultimately resulted
in America's departure

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.880
from Southeast Asia.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.120
And so in that case,
having a large army

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.690
backfired and actually
made it easier

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:49.900
to rally public opinion
against the war.

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:53.860
In general, I would say that
successful counterinsurgency

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.060
campaigns over the centuries,
including dating back

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.880
to Roman times,
tend to be conducted

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.720
by relatively small,
professional, all-volunteer

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.230
forces.

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:03.830
In fact, that was
a lot of the reason

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:06.210
why the Roman army in the
first century moved away

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:09.300
from being an army
of citizen soldiers

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.980
called away from their
farms for a fighting season

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:15.470
and moved towards being a
professional force made up

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:18.500
essentially of mercenaries,
professional soldiers,

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.540
because these kinds of
campaigns take so long.

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:26.060
In fact, the average
insurgency in my analysis

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:29.190
in the post-1945 period takes
about 10 years to defeat.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:30.780
It's a very long time.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.780
And it's hard to
imagine calling away

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.850
draftees for a campaign
of that duration.

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.610
It's also a very inglorious
and tough type of fighting.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:40.287
And so historically, the kind
of force which has always

00:41:40.287 --> 00:41:42.120
done the best at that
kind of warfare, tends

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.950
to be a volunteer force,
which doesn't mind campaigning

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:47.480
for year after year
on distant frontiers,

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.140
like for example the US
Army fighting Indians

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.420
throughout the 19th century.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.270
Sir?

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:57.490
AUDIENCE: I think it's guerrilla
warfare month at Google,

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:00.490
because on Wednesday I'm
hosting David Kilcullen here.

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:01.320
MAX BOOT: Oh, good.

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.000
AUDIENCE: I haven't
finished his book yet, but--

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.430
MAX BOOT: Give Dave my regards.

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:08.290
AUDIENCE: --I believe his
thesis is that urban guerrilla

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:11.589
warfare will be a much, much
larger factor in the future.

00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:13.380
I'm almost done with
your book, by the way,

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:16.320
but it's on Kindle so I
can get you to sign it.

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.650
But do you agree with his
thesis about urban warfare?

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:22.050
MAX BOOT: I would say that
it's probably the case, simply

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:26.170
because insurgents typically
operate among the people.

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:28.710
And people in the modern world
increasingly live in cities,

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:32.550
including these huge,
dysfunctional cities

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:36.410
throughout the Third World,
which can become prime breeding

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:37.980
grounds for uprisings.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.200
The only caveat I
would issue, however,

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.450
is that historically,
urban insurgencies

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:43.550
have not been successful.

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:45.570
It's actually very
hard for me to think

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:48.000
of any examples of
urban insurgencies

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:48.850
that have succeeded.

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:52.410
Most of them like, the
Paris Commune in 1871,

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:53.920
wind up going down in bloodshed.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:58.380
Or more recently, in 2007,
2008, US and Iraqi troops

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.430
took back Baghdad
from al Qaeda in Iraq

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:05.640
and from the [INAUDIBLE]
and assorted other fighters.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.090
It's very hard.

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:09.560
The problem is that in
cities, traditionally,

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.270
it's very hard to have the kind
of organization and training

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:15.380
that you need to have an
effective fighting force,

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.010
because you're always
surrounded by other people.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:19.800
So I mean, just think
about, like, where

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.383
would you go to
practice marksmanship,

00:43:21.383 --> 00:43:23.530
for example, without somebody
finding out about it?

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:24.679
How would you make bombs?

00:43:24.679 --> 00:43:26.220
I mean, you could
do it, but you have

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.636
to be very
surreptitious about it.

00:43:27.636 --> 00:43:30.530
Whereas, historically, most
successful guerrilla movements

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:32.488
have operated in the
countryside, where they're

00:43:32.488 --> 00:43:35.150
able to control actual
chunks of territory,

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:36.810
what they call
liberated territory.

00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:39.520
And there they're essentially
able to have their own shadow

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:44.350
government and to build up
a force that in the Maoist

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:48.425
conception gradually encircles
the cities and takes power.

00:43:48.425 --> 00:43:50.300
Traditionally, in urban
areas what you've had

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.740
is revolutions or coup d'etats
or people power uprisings,

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:58.135
like in the Philippines
in 1986, or the uprising

00:43:58.135 --> 00:44:01.270
you had against Mubarak,
for example, in Egypt.

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:06.945
Whereas actual protracted
insurgencies have,

00:44:06.945 --> 00:44:08.570
maybe Dave will
contradict me, but it's

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:10.236
hard for me off the
top my head to think

00:44:10.236 --> 00:44:13.320
of a single, actual,
successful urban insurgency

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.310
throughout history.

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:15.750
But that doesn't mean
it's not going to happen.

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:18.020
And it doesn't mean that even
if they're not successful

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:19.760
that insurgents are still
going to fight in the cities.

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.890
They will, because that's
where the people are.

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.680
And that's where you'll
see battles in the future.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.060
No doubt about it.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:29.660
AUDIENCE: What do you think
drives the duration of never

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.260
ending conflicts like
that, of Colombia.

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:34.380
What are your thoughts
on what should

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.050
be the authorities' strategy?

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:38.890
MAX BOOT: Well, I
would say that there

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:41.940
is one commonality
among all countries that

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.175
have protracted insurgencies.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.970
It's not a population
youth bulge.

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:53.090
It's not scarcity of water.

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:56.340
It's not a particular
religious group.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.400
It's not having
certain pocket number

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.120
of people in urban versus
rural areas, whatever.

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:04.340
All these factors that
people cite-- largely BS,

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:06.520
because there's a lot
of counterexamples.

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.430
I think the one
universal defining

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:11.920
trait of all countries that
have protracted insurgencies

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.320
is bad government.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.210
That's what drives
an insurgency.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:18.370
Because if you have an
effective government

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:20.580
that response to the
needs of the people,

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.230
you have Switzerland.

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:25.110
You have countries where
it's unimaginable to have

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:26.610
an effective uprising.

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:28.150
If you look at
actual uprisings that

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:32.070
are occurring in places like
Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria,

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:37.540
Somalia, Libya, Congo,
many other places,

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:38.880
what do they all have in common?

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.720
The government sucks.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.240
That's what they have in common.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.097
The government cannot provide
for the welfare and well being

00:45:46.097 --> 00:45:46.680
of the people.

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.888
It cannot protect the people.

00:45:47.888 --> 00:45:49.690
It cannot deliver
basic services.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:52.440
And that's what creates an
opening for people to rise up.

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.270
Now, sometimes,
you have uprisings

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:56.035
that are driven by
ethnic antagonisms.

00:45:56.035 --> 00:45:57.910
But even there, I would
argue, bad government

00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:59.240
is at the heart of the problem.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.880
Because what you
have is a government

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.490
that does not
respond to the needs

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:05.554
of a particular ethnic,
religious, or sectarian group.

00:46:05.554 --> 00:46:07.470
And so they feel alienated
from the government

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:10.110
and decide to break off and
try to form their own country.

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:12.410
But that's the common factor.

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:14.471
Colombia, where I visited
a number of times,

00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:16.220
has actually been one
of the great success

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.710
stories in counterinsurgency,
because FARC

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:20.430
is a really a shadow of itself.

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:22.960
Over the course the
last decade, starting

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.130
under the inspired leadership
of President Uribe,

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:27.950
the Colombian armed
forces and police

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:30.320
have done a tremendous
job of instituting

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.290
this population-centered
counter-insurgency strategy,

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:34.990
which is really
beating back the FARC.

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:38.320
But to the extent that
FARC is still breathing--

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.580
and they're negotiating now,
so they may end the war.

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.050
But to the extent that
FARC is still a factor,

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:45.310
it's because out there in
the hinterlands of Colombia,

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:46.834
there is not
effective government.

00:46:46.834 --> 00:46:48.375
That the central
government in Bogota

00:46:48.375 --> 00:46:50.470
has never controlled
all the rural areas.

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:53.210
And that's what allows narco
traffickers and FARC, who

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:56.120
are often working together, to
continue operating out there.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.620
And the challenge
for the government

00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:00.070
is how to provide effective
governance in those areas,

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:03.604
because it's ultimately
going to be governance.

00:47:03.604 --> 00:47:05.020
While you've got
to have security,

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:06.394
you also have to
have governance.

00:47:06.394 --> 00:47:07.540
Those two go hand in hand.

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.970
So you basically have to be
able to have representatives

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:13.052
of the government out
there 24/7 responding

00:47:13.052 --> 00:47:15.010
to the needs of the people
and protecting them.

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.020
And until they can
do that, there's

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.219
going to be space for an
insurgency to continue.

00:47:19.219 --> 00:47:19.760
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.660
Thanks for the talk.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.970
I wanted to talk about Syria.

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:28.520
After 10-odd years of war
in Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.770
there's a really big
push to not-- people

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:33.230
don't want to intervene, right?

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:35.580
And at the same
time, you saw what

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.580
I would have to judge as
a relatively successful

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:42.170
intervention in Libya,
just in terms of air power.

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:44.920
And I was wondering
what your thoughts are

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.540
on not having boots
on the ground,

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.660
or just limiting something to
an air strike, and how effective

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.890
that can be in countries,
particularly Syria,

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:56.640
and what's different
in Syria versus Libya.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.362
MAX BOOT: We tend to
veer from interventionism

00:47:59.362 --> 00:48:00.320
to non-interventionism.

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:01.850
And obviously, in
the last decade,

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:03.347
we were pretty interventionist.

00:48:03.347 --> 00:48:05.430
And most people weren't
that happy with the result

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:08.190
in Iraq and Afghanistan,
which of course included,

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:12.400
unfortunately, thousands
of soldiers killed and tens

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.790
of thousands wounded.

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:17.450
And so the result of that is
we want to stay out of Syria.

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:21.900
Well, we saw in the case
of Iraq and Afghanistan

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.690
how our intervention
can backfire and produce

00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:25.876
some negative consequences.

00:48:25.876 --> 00:48:27.250
But in the case
of Syria, I think

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:29.690
we're seeing how our
non-intervention can also

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:32.630
backfire and produce
negative consequences.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:34.140
And the situation
there is about as

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:37.030
dire as can be imagined,
with over 100,000 people

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:40.880
having been killed and another
5,000 or so dying every month.

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.480
And from our
strategic standpoint,

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:46.020
I think it's a very dangerous
situation, because it's

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.014
easy for people to
say, we don't really

00:48:48.014 --> 00:48:49.180
want to support either side.

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:52.340
On one side, you've got Assad
and the Iranians and Hezbollah.

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:54.980
On the other side, on
the popular conception,

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:56.740
you've got a bunch
al Qaeda groups.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.890
Now, in reality, the
intelligence estimates

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:02.070
are that the al Qaeda-affiliated
groups are only about 20%

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:03.070
of the insurgency.

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.472
But they are significant factor.

00:49:04.472 --> 00:49:05.680
There's no question about it.

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:08.459
And so a lot of people are
basically saying, well,

00:49:08.459 --> 00:49:09.750
why should we help either side?

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:13.600
And I think that's essentially
President Obama's position.

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:16.580
The problem with that analysis
is by not helping either side,

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.950
by not doing anything
to get involved,

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:20.950
we're basically
allowing those two sides

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:22.750
to carve up Syria between them.

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:26.850
On the one hand, you have
this Hezbollah stronghold.

00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:30.610
On the other hand, you have
this al Qaeda stronghold

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:32.430
in northern Syria
and crossing over

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:36.460
into Iraq and Anbar province.

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.430
To my mind, that's
about as bad an outcome

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:39.680
as you could possibly imagine.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:42.220
Because both Hezbollah and
the Iranians and the Qods

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:44.220
force, their our enemies.

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.144
Al Qaeda is obviously
our enemies.

00:49:46.144 --> 00:49:47.560
And so both groups
are going to be

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:51.360
able to use Syrian territory
to organize and possibly

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.410
to export jihadists
around the world.

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:56.500
Because this has become a
magnet for jihadist fighters

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.940
in the way that Afghanistan and
Iraq have been in years past.

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:03.080
So this is a terrible outcome.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.760
And I believed from
the very beginning

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.450
that we should have
done what Secretary

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:09.570
of State Clinton and
CIA Director Petraeus

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:12.020
advised, which was
to arm and train

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:14.297
and organize the moderate
elements of the opposition,

00:50:14.297 --> 00:50:15.880
which we're doing a
little bit of now,

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.510
but on a very small scale.

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:20.210
And I think given how
far the Assad regime has

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:24.370
gone in its atrocities
and how much support it's

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:26.514
received from Iran
and the Soviet-- I

00:50:26.514 --> 00:50:27.930
was going to say
the Soviet Union.

00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:29.555
I guess they call it
Russia these days.

00:50:29.555 --> 00:50:31.460
But it's acting often
like the old Soviet

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:34.980
Union-- how much support it's
gotten from Tehran and Moscow.

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:36.470
I think you have
to counterbalance

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:37.870
that a little bit in some way.

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:39.434
And I think the
obvious way to do

00:50:39.434 --> 00:50:41.850
it would be the way we did it
in Libya, by using air power

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:43.516
and not putting any
boots on the ground,

00:50:43.516 --> 00:50:46.454
but simply using air power
to take down the regime's Air

00:50:46.454 --> 00:50:48.370
Force, which has been
one of their chief tools

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:50.230
of staying in power.

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:54.420
But as we saw when President
Obama asked Congress

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.172
for support for air strikes,
there was no support.

00:50:57.172 --> 00:50:58.880
And so that doesn't
seem to be happening.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:01.630
And instead, we're going
to see this war continue,

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:04.630
raging unabated, which
could go on for years,

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:07.820
I think with terrible
humanitarian as well strategic

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.370
consequences.

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:10.870
AUDIENCE: Do we
know of any examples

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:16.160
in the past of guerrilla warfare
not in terms of insurgents,

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.130
but in terms of a
country knowingly using

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:21.240
this kind of warfare
against other countries,

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:23.400
like today's Iran and Lebanon.

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.754
And how did it end?

00:51:24.754 --> 00:51:26.170
MAX BOOT: It happens
all the time.

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:28.211
I mean, how did we got
our independence, in fact?

00:51:28.211 --> 00:51:30.590
It was largely
because the French

00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:32.400
decided to help
the American rebels

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.130
against their
adversaries the British.

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:38.760
The British returned the favor
in Spain in the Peninsula War

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:42.010
from 1808 to 1814
when they armed

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:43.610
and helped the Spanish rebels.

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:45.776
In fact, that's where the
word guerrilla comes from,

00:51:45.776 --> 00:51:46.500
a small war.

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.040
The Spanish battle
against Napoleon,

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.790
where the rebels had support
from the British empire

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:51.860
to fight the French.

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:55.820
It's been going on as long as
nation states have been around.

00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:59.590
They've been using supporting
proxy forces, in essence,

00:51:59.590 --> 00:52:01.110
against their enemies.

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:04.820
The Chinese and Soviets
did it to us in Vietnam.

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:07.870
We returned the favor against
the Soviet Union in Afghanistan

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:08.830
in the 1980s.

00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:12.525
It's a tried and
true tactic, which

00:52:12.525 --> 00:52:14.150
is why it's a little
bit puzzling to me

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:17.220
we're not trying to use that
tactic in the case of Syria,

00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:20.970
because there are people there
in the Free Syrian Army who

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:23.670
are happy to go shoot at
both Hezbollah and al Qaeda.

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:26.770
They're fighting both
sides in this civil war.

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:29.690
And that makes them, whatever
we may think of them otherwise,

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:31.480
in essence our allies
in this struggle.

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.938
But we're not really
providing them

00:52:32.938 --> 00:52:34.490
the support to go
out and do that.

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:36.760
And I think it would actually
be a smart thing to do,

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.885
because we wouldn't have
to put our troops at risk,

00:52:38.885 --> 00:52:41.240
but they would do some
of our fighting for us.

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:43.660
It's been a classic strategy.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.450
AUDIENCE: So this
prescription of trying

00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:49.290
to win over the civilian
population in the country

00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:53.380
that the insurgency is happening
seems to be a good strategy.

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:56.610
But how would you apply
this to a situation,

00:52:56.610 --> 00:52:59.975
like for instance, al Qaeda,
where the organization may

00:52:59.975 --> 00:53:01.620
be geographically distributed?

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:04.690
Or I'm even thinking of if you
might consider the hacker group

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:08.896
Anonymous like a guerrilla
warfare organization, where

00:53:08.896 --> 00:53:10.770
there isn't really a
central location for it.

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:12.660
It's completely distributed.

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.960
MAX BOOT: Well, you
make a good point

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.990
in that al Qaeda is much more
international in its operations

00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:19.940
than previous insurgent groups.

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:24.800
But although al Qaeda operates
in cyberspace on satellite TV

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.430
and stuff, guess what?

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:28.590
It's still run by
human beings who

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:30.690
have to live in actual
physical reality.

00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:32.925
They can't just be
living in cyberspace.

00:53:32.925 --> 00:53:34.050
They got to live somewhere.

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:35.720
They got to be able
to operate somewhere.

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.330
And where do they choose
to live and operate?

00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:38.600
Where do they make gains?

00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:45.350
In countries like Pakistan,
Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Mali.

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:47.340
In other words, all
places that don't

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.150
have effective governance, that
have insurgencies going on.

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:53.250
Al Qaeda basically piggy
backs and makes common cause

00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:54.980
with the local insurgency.

00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:57.860
And so the way to
ultimately defeat the group

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:01.080
is to deal with the conditions
in each country that

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.950
allow it to find
safe haven there.

00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:06.880
It's a very hard foe
to operate against,

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:10.300
because they are
basically like a disease.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:11.450
They're drawn by weakness.

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:15.050
Wherever there's ungoverned
or badly governed territory

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:17.260
and there is a Muslim
population there,

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:18.760
they will try to
make inroads there.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:22.070
And so the challenge for us is,
how do we improve governance

00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:24.920
in the Muslim world, which
right now is in upheaval?

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:27.400
But how do we create
effective institutions

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:31.660
in places like Afghanistan,
Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia,

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:32.947
Libya, all these places?

00:54:32.947 --> 00:54:35.280
Very, very hard to do, because
we're not going to go out

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.363
and sent hundreds of
thousands of US troops there.

00:54:37.363 --> 00:54:40.280
The challenge is, how do we
work with the local governments

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.320
to enable to better
stand up and to resist

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:45.320
the incursions of these radical
extremists, many of them

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.180
foreigners?

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:47.520
That's a tough, tough challenge.

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:51.100
But that's what we're going to
have to do to fight al Qaeda.

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:54.030
And that's why it's going to
be a decades-long struggle.

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:56.340
It's not going to
end any time soon.

00:54:56.340 --> 00:55:00.770
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that guerrilla warfare

00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:03.600
is often a response to
problems with the government

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.010
being inadequate.

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:07.930
So if these groups have some
sort of legitimate complaint

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:10.790
against the government,
isn't concentrating

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:15.280
on counterinsurgency putting
you on the wrong side of this?

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:19.040
The question is concentrating
on fixing legitimate problems.

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:21.540
And I was wondering also with
the hearts and minds strategy,

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:25.060
how much does that become a
PR battle, and how much of it

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:27.510
is actually addressing
the legitimate problems

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:29.214
that people have with
their government?

00:55:29.214 --> 00:55:31.130
MAX BOOT: Part of it is
certainly a PR battle,

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:33.140
but public relations
is not going

00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:36.030
to be effective unless you have
a good product to sell, right?

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:39.220
It's hard to put
lipstick on a pig

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:40.830
or whatever metaphor
you want to use.

00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:44.120
And so you've got
to have something

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:45.840
that addresses the
actual problems.

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:49.700
And I think when you wage a
successful counterinsurgency

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.720
campaign, it has
to be very complex.

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:54.380
Because you can't simply
ignore the security component.

00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:57.660
You can't ignore these hardcore
rebel fighters who are not

00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.370
going to be appeased by any
concessions you may make,

00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:02.740
because they may be
professional revolutionaries,

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:05.865
they may be jihadists
committed to death, whatever.

00:56:05.865 --> 00:56:07.490
There's always going
to be a hard core,

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:09.720
whether their Marxists,
jihadists, whatever,

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.330
who are going to be fighting.

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:14.190
And those guys you have to
deal with by military means.

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:15.590
Kill or capture them.

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:18.019
But the vast majority
of the population

00:56:18.019 --> 00:56:19.060
is going to be undecided.

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.435
They're going to
be saying, well,

00:56:20.435 --> 00:56:21.941
what side should we support?

00:56:21.941 --> 00:56:23.690
A lot of what governs
their considerations

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:25.040
is, which side is stronger?

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:27.610
But also, which side
more addresses our needs?

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:32.000
And so if the insurgents are
terrorizing the population,

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.917
are not addressing their
needs, the population

00:56:33.917 --> 00:56:35.166
is going to turn against them.

00:56:35.166 --> 00:56:37.280
That's what happened in
Iraq in Anbar province

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:41.610
in 2007, when the Sunnis turn
against al Qaeda in Iraq.

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:43.230
But conversely,
if the government

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:45.864
is terrorizing the population
and not addressing their needs,

00:56:45.864 --> 00:56:48.030
the people are going to
turn against the government.

00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:49.738
That's what's happening
in Anbar province

00:56:49.738 --> 00:56:52.350
right now in Iraq, where the
Sunnis are once again turning

00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:55.044
against the
Shiite-dominated government.

00:56:55.044 --> 00:56:56.460
So you have to
have a combination.

00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:02.020
You really have to address
some of their basic grievances.

00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:05.276
You don't necessarily have to
grant their hardcore demands,

00:57:05.276 --> 00:57:07.900
but you at least have to address
some of their basic grievances

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.932
that will peel off a
lot of their support.

00:57:09.932 --> 00:57:11.390
But at the same
time, you also have

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:14.330
to conduct military operations
against the hard core

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:16.379
of the insurgency,
which is why this

00:57:16.379 --> 00:57:17.670
is the hardest form of warfare.

00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:20.042
It's been called the
graduate level of warfare.

00:57:20.042 --> 00:57:21.250
It's very, very hard to wage.

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:24.480
It's much more difficult
than conventional conflict.

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:25.480
MALE SPEAKER: Wonderful.

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:26.994
Thanks so much for coming, Max.

00:57:26.994 --> 00:57:27.660
MAX BOOT: Great.

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:29.610
Thank you very much.
