00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.500
I met this hot girl but she totally put me
in the friend zone.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.380
Yesssss!

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.640
Hi friends, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.469
If you’ve been on the internet, and you
probably have, you’ve likely heard the term

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:16.469
the “Friend Zone.”

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:18.869
It’s what happens when a crush is unreciprocated.

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.050
And despite what the fedora wearing community
would have you believe, it doesn’t just

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.410
happen to nice guys.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.300
Girls get friend zoned too, and it exists
for people of all sexual orientations.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.539
So what good could possibly come of being
in the Friend Zone?

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.960
Well the first and most obvious thing I can
say is, hey, you have a friend.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.960
Isn’t that neat?

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.950
Sure, they may not want to date you and that
may feel terrible, but one friend is objectively

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.680
better than zero friends.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.150
And it’s way better than being in the “Mortal
Enemy Zone” with someone you have feelings

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.150
for.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.640
But a recent study from Northwestern University
may actually make the friendzone more of an

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.290
appealing place to be, or at least to start
out.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.300
And here’s why: according to the study people
who start out as friends and end up together

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.570
are more likely to have a disparity when it
comes to attractiveness.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.810
The study examined 67 dating pairs and 100
married couples who had been together anywhere

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.830
from 3 months to 53 years, with the mean relationship
at 8 years 8 months.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.010
Several people watched videos of the couples
and rated their attractiveness.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.180
That’s right, scientists basically played
a giant game of “Hot or Not,” and then

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.330
compared results.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.660
The ratings were pretty close among the scientists,
indicating that there was a general agreement

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.970
about how physically attractive all the subjects
were.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.800
I could have never been a part of this study,
because to me you’re all beautiful.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.030
Especially you (wink).

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.240
After rating them, researchers looked at how
long the partners had known each other before

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.030
they started dating, and found that if they
had hardly been acquainted, usually the couples

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.280
were similarly attractive; 8s got with 8s,
2s married 2s, et cetera.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.660
But the longer they had known each other,
the less likely the couples would be matched

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.660
physically.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.979
So it turns out the friend zone isn’t so
bad a place to be after all; it means you’re

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.700
actually more likely to date above your station,
even if you’re an uggo.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.270
Of course being friend zoned isn’t a guarantee
that your crush will realize you were their

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.130
one true love all along.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.680
Sometimes people will never be attracted to
you, no matter how close you are as friends.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.420
That’s life, sorry.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.130
Interestingly, escaping the friend zone also
doesn’t mean that despite your mismatched

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.770
appearance, you were soulmates.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.819
The couples from this study reported about
the same rates of relationship satisfaction,

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.170
regardless of whether they had been friends
for years of if they jumped into the romance

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.170
right away.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.810
So happiness wise it looks like there’s
no guaranteed benefit to becoming more than

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.560
friends with someone prettier than you.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.610
Sounds like that cliche that looks aren’t
important has some scientific foundation.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.140
The key to happiness post friend zone is work.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.680
Not surprising, but I have the details on
what the Gottman Institute says is crucial

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:42.240
to a strong 
marriage here.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.770
So this study brings up an interesting dilemma.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.750
Do you pursue someone more attractive than
you, spending time and effort with no guarantee

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.990
of a relationship and no guarantee of happiness
if you even do end up together?

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.520
Or do you skip it and ask out an acquaintance
closer to your level?

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.940
