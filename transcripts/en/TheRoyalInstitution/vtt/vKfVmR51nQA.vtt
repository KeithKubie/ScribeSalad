00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:08.059
Now, I wonder whether you've ever seen a tortoiseshell
cat.

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:09.160
Here we've got one.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.270
Binny is her name, isn't it? - Bonnie.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.350
Bonnie. Bonnie. Here we've got... and isn't
she lovely?

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.640
Isn't she lovely? And she's a very good cat.
She's been waiting all day for this.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.429
I don't think she's going to go away.

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.029
And you see that she's a patchwork. Isn't
she?

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.989
She's a patchwork of black and yellow.

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.859
And her parents were probably, I don't know,

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.830
maybe one of them was black and one was slightly
brownish.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.260
She's a really lovely cat, I'd better give
her back to you.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.860
She's getting a bit worried here.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.710
There's a patchwork there of both types of
colours of fur.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.690
And you can have patchwork mice too. Bill,
let's have a look at these patchwork mice.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:54.870
Look here, we've got some mice here. And here
you see the one of the parents is black.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.620
The other is white.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.710
And here we have the offspring. Look, you
see they are patchwork. Can you see that?

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.740
Both of them. Both of them are patchwork of
black and white fur.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.470
They are patchwork just like the cat.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.720
The tortoiseshell cat.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.700
The tortoiseshell cat's a female. And these
are females.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.610
They're always patchwork females, not patchwork
males.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.060
Now why do you think that is?

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.740
The reason for that is, in the sex chromosomes
again, the X and the Y.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.549
Remember, two X's in the female. One X and
a Y in the male.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.060
And you see the Y's a little chromosome.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.979
It only determines sex basically, whether
you're a male.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.880
There isn't, as there is for the other chromosomes,
which occur in pairs like that,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.420
a matching set of genes in the male for the
X's.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.570
There's only one set of X genes not too set
of X genes.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.680
Now, nature doesn't like that sort of imbalance.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.299
Nature tries to arrange it so that the number
of active X chromosomes,

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.549
the number that'll work in every cell, is
the same.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.049
There's only one in the males.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.410
What happens in the females is either one
is at work or the other.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.950
Never both chromosomes at work.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.270
So if one of those chromosomes determines
the black colour. The X chromosomes.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.690
And the other X chromosome determines the
white colour.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.250
You get this patchwork. Some have one of the
X's that work,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.610
and some have the other of the X chromosomes
at work.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.840
And that's why you get a patchwork in the
females and not in the males.
