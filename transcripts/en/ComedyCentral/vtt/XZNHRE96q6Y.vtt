00:00:01.834 --> 00:00:05.538
<i> Um, and so three guys
 go to confront Hamilton</i>

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:06.939
<i> on these charges.</i>

00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:10.410 line:0%
<i> One of the dudes was future
 president James Monroe.</i>

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:12.612 line:0%
<i> And they went, yo, Hamilton,</i>

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.181
<i> we know what you did,
 you know what you did.</i>

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:17.617
<i> Check out these checks
 to James Reynolds.</i>

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.585
<i> What's up?
 And they accuse him</i>

00:00:19.618 --> 00:00:21.187
<i> of embezzling funds.</i>

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.588 align:end position:100%
<i> And Hamilton goes,
 no, no, no.</i>

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:24.857
<i> I was just [bleep] this lady,</i>

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.060 align:end position:100%
<i> and her husband
 was hitting me up for money.</i>

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:28.461
<i> I didn't touch American money,</i>

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:30.196
<i> and I have all kinds of proof.</i>

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:34.567
And he, like, vomits information
all over them.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.470
<i> Oh, wow, that was more
 than we needed to hear.</i>

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:40.406
<i> And we're good, thanks.</i>

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:43.543
<i> The info about the affair
 gets somehow miraculously</i>

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.445
<i> printed in the paper.</i>

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:49.215
<i> Hamilton is not a great dude.</i>

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:51.884
<i> I know you think he's great
 'cause he's a war vet,</i>

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:53.653
<i> and he's
 the Treasury Secretary,</i>

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:57.557
<i> but you're gonna learn the
 truth real soon.</i>

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.728
<i> And Hamilton gets this
 and he goes to James Monroe,</i>

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:03.729 align:start position:0%
<i>[whispering]
what the [bleep]?</i>

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:05.164 align:start position:0%
<i>Like, I told you that in
secret.</i>

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:06.532
<i> And James Monroe's like,</i>

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:08.568 align:end position:100%
<i> it wasn't secret
 and it wasn't me.</i>

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.137 align:end position:100%
<i> Wasn't me who--who, uh,
 published it.</i>

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.238 align:start position:0%
<i>Mother[bleep]!</i>

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
<i>I told three people
about this</i>

00:01:14.673 --> 00:01:16.476 align:start position:0%
<i>and you're the one
who was taking notes,</i>

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.911 size:84% position:42%
<i>so I know it came from you.</i>

00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:21.481 align:start position:0%
<i>Like...fess up.</i>

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:22.882
<i> [bleep] you.
 [bleep] you.</i>

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:26.085
So Hamilton, over sharer,
writes the Reynolds Pamphlet.

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:28.154
The whole thing reads like
a Dear Penthouse letter.

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:30.523
Like, dear America,

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:32.959
<i> I never thought this would
 happen to me.</i>

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:36.863
<i> But one day,
 this ripped bodice woman</i>

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:39.165
<i> showed up at my door,
 saying,</i>

00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:41.467
<i> oh, my husband's beating me,
 left me alone</i>

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.903
<i> and I need money
 and I need help.</i>

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:46.606
<i> You are a man of honor.
 Can you help me?</i>

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.708
<i> Hamilton's like,
 I could give her money</i>

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:49.842
<i> or I could [bleep] her</i>

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.410
<i> and either one would be
 acceptable.</i>

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:54.080
<i> The--the Reynolds Pamphlet
 is like Dick 101.</i>

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:56.782
And, by the way,
he sent this to his friends.

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:59.385
<i> Being like, hey,
I think I'm gonna publish this.</i>

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:00.586
<i> And everyone was like,</i>

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.755 align:start position:0%
<i>hey, bro, I don't think
this is a good idea</i>

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:03.990 align:start position:0%
<i>to publish this.</i>

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
<i>Like, maybe your wife
and your seven children</i>

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:08.694 align:start position:0%
<i>would not love it
if you published this.</i>

00:02:08.727 --> 00:02:10.129
<i> And Hamilton's like,
 well, I mean, like,</i>

00:02:10.162 --> 00:02:11.731
<i> I got accused of embezzling.</i>

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:13.733
<i> And, like,
 I can't let that stand.</i>

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:17.370
<i> Maybe the, like,
marital infidelity trumps that?</i>

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:18.838 align:end position:100%
<i> I know it doesn't
 in your head,</i>

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:22.008 align:end position:100%
<i> but to everyone else
 in the world it does.</i>

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:25.511
<i> Um, and he's like, no,
 I can't let that shit stand.</i>

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:28.114
<i> And Hamilton goes back
 to James Monroe</i>

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.682
<i> and--and now Hamilton's like,</i>

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:31.284
<i>well, it's all out in the open.</i>

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.752 align:start position:0%
<i>um, and if you still wanna
settle this,</i>

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.787 align:start position:0%
<i>because I know you're the one
who leaked it.</i>

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.355 align:end position:100%
<i> Um, Monroe's like,
 well, I didn't leak it,</i>

00:02:36.388 --> 00:02:38.892 align:end position:100%
<i> but if you wanna, like, fight,
 like, let's do this.</i>
