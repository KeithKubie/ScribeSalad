00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.120
We can take these two images together,
these motion energy images and

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.110
this motion history image, and

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.360
together we refer to them as what
we call the temporal template.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.650
It was just the model
of how stuff moved.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.320
All right?

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.830
And then we tried it on
a dataset that we created.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.290
We had this person who was
way more fit than we were

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.910
do a whole bunch of different aerobics,
different moves.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.500
And we just said, okay,
can we now recognize if somebody

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.460
is actually doing a new routine,
which aerobics move she's doing.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.730
All right?

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.970
And one of the interesting
things that you can see here,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.020
what I'm showing you here are the MEIs,
all right.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.470
I'm just showing you the binary version.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.360
And you might say, that this shape,
looks an awful lot like that shape.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.240
But if I show you the motion history
image of the one on the top,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.280
you see that, and you can see,
that it's dark down here,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.590
and light up there, so that's an example
that the arms are moving upward.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.660
When you take a look at this one,
you can see that it's high up here,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.325
but high down there, so
it's actually going like this.

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:08.115
So the motion energy
image would be ambiguous.

00:01:08.115 --> 00:01:09.705
It shows you where the stuff is.

00:01:09.705 --> 00:01:12.315
But the motion history image
resolves that ambiguity.

00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:16.845
The motion energy image
captures the whole image

00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:20.742
motioned area and captures it nicely.

00:01:20.742 --> 00:01:25.472
So that's why it's not in some sense
redundant with the motion history image,

00:01:25.472 --> 00:01:29.312
which gives a lot more weight to
the more recently moving pixels.
