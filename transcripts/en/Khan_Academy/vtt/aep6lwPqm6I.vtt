00:00:00.547 --> 00:00:01.589
- [Instructor] So in the last two videos

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.576
we were talking about this
constrained optimization problem

00:00:04.576 --> 00:00:07.170
where we want to maximize
a certain function

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.820
on a certain set, the
set of all points x, y

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.152
where x squared plus y squared equals one.

00:00:12.152 --> 00:00:13.792
And we ended up working
out through some nice,

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:15.683
geometrical reasoning
that we need to solve

00:00:15.683 --> 00:00:17.360
this system of equations.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.533
So there's nothing left
to do but to just solve

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.021
this system of equations.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.524
I will start with this
first one at the top,

00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:23.927
see what we can simplify.

00:00:23.927 --> 00:00:26.311
We notice there's an x term in each one

00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:28.603
so we'll go ahead and cancel those out,

00:00:28.603 --> 00:00:30.333
which is basically a way
of saying we're assuming

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.014
that x is not zero, and we
can kind of return to that

00:00:33.014 --> 00:00:35.695
to see if x equals zero
could be as you wish.

00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:36.921
And so maybe we'll kind
of write that down.

00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:39.500
We're assuming x is not equal to zero

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.501
in order to cancel out.

00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:42.213
And we kind of can revisit whether that

00:00:42.213 --> 00:00:44.297
could give us another
possible solution later,

00:00:44.297 --> 00:00:48.399
but that will be two times y
is equal to lambda times two,

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.231
and from here, the twos can cancel out,

00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:53.732
no worries about two equaling zero,

00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:56.002
and we know that y equals lambda.

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:59.565
So that's a nice, simplified
form for this equation.

00:00:59.565 --> 00:01:01.446
And for this next
equation, though we can use

00:01:01.446 --> 00:01:03.821
what we just found, that
y is equal to lambda

00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:07.091
to replace the lambda
that we see, and instead,

00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:10.198
if I replace this with
a y, what I'm gonna get

00:01:10.198 --> 00:01:14.050
is that x squared is equal
to y times two times y.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.825
So that's two times y squared.

00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:19.106
And I'll leave it in
that form because I see

00:01:19.106 --> 00:01:20.849
that in the next equation,
I see an x squared,

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:22.251
I see a y squared, so it might be nice

00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:24.784
to be able to plug this guy right into it.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:27.455
So in that next equation, x squared,

00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:30.099
I'm gonna go ahead and
replace that with y squared,

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:32.016
so that's two y squared

00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:35.558
plus y squared equals one.

00:01:36.848 --> 00:01:41.015
And then from there, simplifies
to three times y squared

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.537
equals one, which in turn means y squared

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:49.400
is equal to one third,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.233
and so y is equal to plus or minus

00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:56.293
the square root of one third.

00:01:56.293 --> 00:01:57.126
Great.

00:01:57.126 --> 00:01:59.585
So this gives us y, and
I'll go ahead and put a box

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:03.513
around that, where we
have found what y must be.

00:02:03.513 --> 00:02:05.811
Now if y squared is equal to one third,

00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:07.375
then we look up here and say, mhm,

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:10.428
two times y squared, that's
gonna be the same thing

00:02:10.428 --> 00:02:14.345
as two times one third,
so two times one third,

00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:18.770
so if x squared is equal to two thirds,

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.208
what that implies is that x

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:24.625
is equal to plus or minus the square root

00:02:25.564 --> 00:02:26.731
of two thirds.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:31.329
And then there we go, that's another,

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.603
one of the solutions.

00:02:32.603 --> 00:02:34.371
And I could write down
what lambda is, right,

00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:37.279
I mean, in this case it's
easy, 'cause y equals lambda,

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:39.605
but all we really want in
their final form are x and y,

00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:40.991
since that's gonna give us the answer

00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:42.958
to the original constraint problem.

00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.728
So this, this gives us what we want,

00:02:44.728 --> 00:02:47.598
and we just have that
pesky, little possibility

00:02:47.598 --> 00:02:49.480
that x equals zero to address,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.999
and for that we can take a look and say,

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.007
if x equaled zero, you
know let's go through

00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:55.435
the possibility that
maybe that's one of the

00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:57.308
constrained solutions.

00:02:57.308 --> 00:02:59.572
Well, in this equation
that would make sense,

00:02:59.572 --> 00:03:01.690
since two times zero would equal zero.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.758
In this equation, that would
mean that we're setting zero

00:03:03.758 --> 00:03:06.888
equal to lambda times two times y.

00:03:06.888 --> 00:03:08.946
Well, since lambda
equals y, that would mean

00:03:08.946 --> 00:03:10.985
that for this side to equal zero,

00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:13.759
y would have to equal zero, so evidently,

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.463
you know, if it was the
case that x equals zero,

00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:17.790
that would have to imply,

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.535
from the second equation
that y equals zero,

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:22.160
but if x and y both equal zero,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.358
this constraint can't be satisfied.

00:03:24.358 --> 00:03:26.102
So none of this is
possible, so we never even

00:03:26.102 --> 00:03:27.828
had to worry about this to start with,

00:03:27.828 --> 00:03:29.238
but it's something you do need to check,

00:03:29.238 --> 00:03:31.249
just every time you're
dividing by a variable,

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:35.564
you're basically assuming
that it's not equal to zero.

00:03:35.564 --> 00:03:39.040
So, this right here gives
us four possible solutions,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.788
four possible values for x and y

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:45.385
that satisfy this constraint,
and which potentially

00:03:45.385 --> 00:03:47.199
maximize this, and remember, when I say

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.138
potentially maximize, the whole idea

00:03:49.138 --> 00:03:51.290
of this Lagrange Multiplier,
is that we were looking

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.897
for where there's a point of tangency

00:03:53.897 --> 00:03:56.353
between the contour lines.

00:03:56.353 --> 00:03:58.289
So just to make it
explicit, the four points

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:00.444
that we're dealing with, here
I'll right them all here.

00:04:00.444 --> 00:04:04.444
So, x could be the square
root of two thirds,

00:04:06.532 --> 00:04:07.444
square root of two thirds,

00:04:07.444 --> 00:04:11.949
and y could be the positive
square root of one third,

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:13.493
and then we can basically just toggle,

00:04:13.493 --> 00:04:17.535
you know maybe x is the negative
square root of two thirds

00:04:17.535 --> 00:04:21.146
and y is still the positive
square root of one third,

00:04:21.146 --> 00:04:25.046
or maybe x is the positive square root of

00:04:25.046 --> 00:04:30.019
two thirds, and y is the negative
square root of one third,

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:31.302
kind of monotonous, but just getting

00:04:31.302 --> 00:04:34.042
all of the different
possibilities on the table here.

00:04:34.042 --> 00:04:36.811
X is negative square root of two thirds,

00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:41.718
and then y is positive, no,
negative, that's the last one,

00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:43.805
square root of one third.

00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:46.640
So these are the four points
where the contour lines

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.286
are tangent, and to
find which one of these

00:04:49.286 --> 00:04:50.549
maximizes our function,

00:04:50.549 --> 00:04:52.316
here let's go ahead and write
down our function again,

00:04:52.316 --> 00:04:53.587
it gets easy to forget.

00:04:53.587 --> 00:04:55.338
So the whole thing we're
doing is maximizing

00:04:55.338 --> 00:04:58.347
f of x, y, equals x squared times y.

00:04:58.347 --> 00:05:01.006
So let me just put that down again,

00:05:01.006 --> 00:05:03.173
we're looking at f of x, y

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:07.579
is equal to x squared times y.

00:05:08.774 --> 00:05:11.327
So we could just plug these values in

00:05:11.327 --> 00:05:13.458
and see which one of them
is actually greatest.

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:14.845
And the first thing to observe is,

00:05:14.845 --> 00:05:16.903
x squared is always gonna be positive,

00:05:16.903 --> 00:05:19.048
so if I plug in a negative value for y,

00:05:19.048 --> 00:05:22.190
right, if I plug in either
this guy here or this guy here,

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.858
where the value for y is negative,

00:05:23.858 --> 00:05:25.924
the entire function would be negative.

00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:27.617
So I'm just gonna say
that neither of these

00:05:27.617 --> 00:05:30.453
can be the maximum because
it'll be some positive number,

00:05:30.453 --> 00:05:32.900
some x squared times a negative.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.459
Whereas I know that these
guys are gonna produce

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.352
a positive number, and specifically,

00:05:36.352 --> 00:05:39.252
now if we plug in, if we
plug in f of let's say

00:05:39.252 --> 00:05:42.585
this top one, square root of two thirds,

00:05:43.678 --> 00:05:46.261
square root of one third, well,

00:05:47.152 --> 00:05:49.616
x squared is gonna be two thirds,

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:53.172
and then y is square root of one third.

00:05:53.172 --> 00:05:54.416
And in fact that's gonna be the same

00:05:54.416 --> 00:05:56.396
as what we get plugging
in this other value.

00:05:56.396 --> 00:05:58.850
So either one of these
maximizes the function.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.977
It's got two different maximizing points

00:06:00.977 --> 00:06:03.898
and each one of them has a maximum value

00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:08.363
of two thirds times the
square root of one third.

00:06:08.363 --> 00:06:09.876
And that's the final answer.

00:06:09.876 --> 00:06:12.180
But I do want to emphasize,
that the takeaway here

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.449
is not the specific
algebra that you work out

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.882
going towards the end, but it's the whole,

00:06:16.882 --> 00:06:19.261
the whole idea of this
Lagrange Multiplier technique

00:06:19.261 --> 00:06:21.421
to find the gradient of one function,

00:06:21.421 --> 00:06:23.954
find the gradient of the
constraining function,

00:06:23.954 --> 00:06:25.762
and then set them
proportional to each other.

00:06:25.762 --> 00:06:28.862
That's the key takeaway, and
then the rest of it is just,

00:06:28.862 --> 00:06:30.875
you know making sure
that we check our work

00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:32.713
and go through the minute details,

00:06:32.713 --> 00:06:35.340
which is important, it has its place.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.125
And coming up, I'll go
through a few more examples.
