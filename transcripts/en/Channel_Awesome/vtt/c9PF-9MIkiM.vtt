00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.300
Narrator: Nostalgia Critic: critic of nostalgia.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.860
Searching for a movie to tap into the inner frustrations every movie nerd has.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.100
Then, a viewing of a fascinatingly misdirected movie alters his chemistry.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.000
And now, whenever he hears any mention of the movie Hulk, a startling metamorphosis occurs.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.700
NC: Malcolm.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.300
Tamara.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.800
Do not show me that movie.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.600
You wouldn't like me when you show me that movie.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.900
I exploded.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.600
Narrator: The Critic is wanted for property damage he didn't commit.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.400
Well, OK, he did, but it was just of a movie

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.500
and that movie sucked.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.100
The Critic's patience is believed to be dead.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.480
And he must let the world believe it is dead

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.600
until he can find a way to control the whiny
 bitch fits that dwells within him.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.700
NC: Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.900
You know, this should be the easiest guy to make interesting.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.400
The Incredible Hulk is a classic Jekyll and Hyde story about scientist Bruce Banner

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.700
whose experiment goes wrong and turns into a giant green monster whenever he gets angry.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.300
It has both the psychological AND physical elements that usually make for great classic storytelling.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.300
Yet his cinematic ventures have been so underwhelming that

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.400
despite him being many people's favorite parts in other movies

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.380
no solo movies are planned in the near future.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.000
And that all started with the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
"HNNGH!"

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.600
simply known as Hulk.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.100
How can a story about a giant green monster be boring?

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.600
That was the challenge presumably given to director Ang Lee.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.000
He just finished a winning streak with his martial arts opus, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.400
winning over box office, critics, and
too many awards to count.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.900
So producers immediately said, "That!"

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.400
"We want that for our action-packed Hulk movie!".

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.800
But what they were missing is that Ang Lee usually did social dramas.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.300
He did Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon because he always wanted to do a martial arts movie.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.600
One.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.700
One martial arts movie.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.500
He brushed up for YEARS on martial arts flicks so he could figure out how to do it right.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.700
With Hulk, very clearly, he was a director-for-hire.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.200
And saw this more as a means to experiment rather than bring a lifelong dream to life.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.900
And much like Bruce Banner, this experiment WOULD haunt him for the rest of his days.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.900
He certainly recovered and returned back to his comfort zone

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.700
but the mark this movie left on comic fans is probably the most uniquely bad since this:

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.300
"This is why Superman works alone."

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.100
But while that was bright and colorful and 
at least made little kids happy, this...

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.000
would only make that kid who stands in the corner saying "I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad." happy.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.100
Because he's gonna set someone on fire.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.400
So, why is this the most intriguing, and yet somehow, also most boring of missteps?

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.000
Well, let's make everybody angry with "Hulk."

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.760
Whoa, whoa! Tone down those expectations there!

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.900
This is not the movie you're going to get!

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.300
No, let's instead do those early 2000's credits of blurry closeups mixed with sped up and slowed down editing.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.680
I've always wanted to see an intro with my glasses off and a monkey playing with the remote.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.800
OK, Coco, push play. Push play.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.800
No, now you're fast-forwarding.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.000
No, no, now you're slowing it down.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.700
No, now you have it on extreme zoom.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.300
Extreme zoom.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.400
No, no, pull it back to normal.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.300
This is the best way to watch this movie!

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.000
Oh, and if you think this style is only done in the credits

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.200
your senses are in for a bludgeoning!

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.700
Because there's gimmicky editing techniques throughout the entire film.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.700
And I mean the ENTIRE film.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.800
Just look at this flashback of Bruce Banner's father.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.300
Edith:â€‹ I'm gonna have a baby.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.700
If you find this mildly annoying, then just add 2 hours of it and

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.100
that M will quickly turn upside-down.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.700
Like me, you might be wondering, "What's the point of all these transition tricks?".

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.400
Tricksitions as I like to call them.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.800
My best guess is Ang Lee wanted to create the closest thing he could to a comic book.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.500
Meaning the film literally has panels, speed lines, and elements of space and time overlapping each other.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.600
There's just one problem with that, though.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.700
If you're adapting a book

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.900
would you constantly put words all over the goddamn place?

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.500
This is way too friggin' literal!

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.700
Ross: Gamma decontamination will occur in 30 minutes.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.300
NC: Actually, I take it back.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.400
There's 2 problems with this technique.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.900
In a comic book, these are used to suck you more into the story.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.800
It leaps off the page and brings you into their reality.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.100
This is constantly taking you out of what's going on.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:25.700
You can't ever breathe in the world because the movie's too busy trying to physically show you the lines that they're supposed to be breathing in!

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.000
Ross: Gamma decontamination will occur in 30 minute-

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.700
NC: Actually, I take it back.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.200
There's 3 problems with this.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.400
I'm sorry to dwell on this so much, but this is literally throughout the whole goddamn film.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.200
It's best to tackle it in one "Unh!".

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.200
Other movies like "Spider-Man" and "Sin City" look like the comics they portrayed to create a stronger environment for their world.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.400
They're adventurous, they're action packed, they're totally over the top.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.900
You know what this film mostly consists of?

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.080
Bruce: Are we passing inspection?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.620
Harper: Safeties all going green...

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.300
NC: THAT!

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.300
A LOT OF SITTING AROUND AND TALKING!

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.500
So the style doesn't even match the tone!

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.700
It's like they realized there's no friggin' excitement in this flick

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.100
so to remind you it's even supposed to be a comic book film they're like:

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.700
"Umm..."

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.220
"Pffft"

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.920
"Throw some comic sans in there, put that frame there, that frame over there, and"

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.300
"make it look like The Brady Bunch."

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.300
Comics! We get this!

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.400
Little Bruce: RAWR!

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.200
*Growling and Grumbling*

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.000
NC: Uh, on second thought, maybe we don't.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.600
Where the hell was there a comic that had imagery like that?

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.000
Maybe if I read it while doing this.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.100
Also I don't think TREES are a big focus of comics.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.800
We're

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.400
...really putting the camera on this?

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.000
We're this bored this early?

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.700
Unless this is Treebeard's porn stache

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.000
WHY ARE YOU SHOOTING THAT!?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.600
So something happens in Bruce's past that he's repressed, and

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.200
with his dad taking his mother screaming into the back, you can probably guess what it is.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.400
Oh!  I mean

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.100
I'm gonna spend the whole entire film wondering what that

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.100
He kills his mom!

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.760
Come on!

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.000
It even cuts immediately to a foster home when he's a teen.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.360
You think we couldn't figure this out?

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.100
Though, to their credit, maybe his stepmom's disinterest is supposed to distract us from connecting the dots.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.800
Mrs. Krenzler: There's something inside you.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:08.880
So special.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.300
Some kind of greatness

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.400
...I'm sure. And some day you're gonna

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.100
...share it with the whole world.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.400
NC (as director): Okay, cut!

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.500
That was good, but, uh, let's try something a little different here this time.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.300
Let's try

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.940
trying.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.700
Though, don't worry, stepmother.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.100
The award for the least amount of effort clearly goes to Jennifer Connelly.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.500
I get the feeling, every day she showed up to the set and the crew was like

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.400
(as director): Okay, Connelly!

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.500
Uh, are we gonna act today or not act today?

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.260
Betty: There was some sort of explosion.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.400
They wouldn't let us into the building.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.900
I was worried about you.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.600
NC (as director): Not act today.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.100
Okay.  It's a not acting day everybody!

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.580
We just wanted to know how to shoot it to make you look

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.800
"...invested."

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.200
(himself) Hell, I think the most gripping performances of the movie probably come from these two.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.700
Stan Lee: Security ought to be beefed up a lot more, in a place like this.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.100
NC: I really believed he wanted tighter security.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.100
And I really believe that Lou Ferrigno was

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.300
...umm

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.000
...looking at him.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.100
Okay, I didn't even believe that

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.400
but he looked like THIS for years!

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.340
He gets a pass!

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.600
By the way, minus two points for even 
your credits not being consistent!

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.100
When even your font doesn't know what it wants to be, you're kind of in trouble.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:12.780
Harper: Bruce!

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.500
Big day.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.100
Did ya sleep?

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.100
NC: We find out that Bruce, played by Eric Bana

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.900
is working on ways to expose gamma rays to electro-energy gigawatts capacitor-

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.500
Sciencey shit where somehow superpowers are the wrong answer.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.100
They try their experiment on a frog and discover the results are a little too explosive.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.600
Somebody call Miss Piggy, there's been an

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.800
"...accident."

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:40.100
Bruce: You want to tell the review board that we've developed a brand-new method for exploding frogs?

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.200
Betty: Yeah.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.280
Think maybe there's a market for it.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.600
Frogs start falling from the sky

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.300
who do they come to?

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.200
NC: Oh HA HA HA HA HA!

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.200
No. Really.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.000
Suck of it while you can.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.200
That's the only joke in the entire movie.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.000
Oh! Excuse me.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.600
There's a bookmark of a man reading fighting for space.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.140
Okay, if you're really gonna draw this much attention to your transitions

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.680
I'm gonna draw even more attention to it by putting in the goofy sound effects they deserve!

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.800
[high pitch whistle]

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.700
[stretching metal]

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.900
[fast whistle]

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.500
Glenn: Betty!

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.000
[Squish?]

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.500

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.600
[crash]

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.900
NC: This dick-face McSmearSmirk is Glenn.  He's...

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.700
do exactly what you think he's gonna do:

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.200
try and steal Banner's girlfriend

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.500
get in the way of his experiment

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.400
and waste a LOT of time trying to explain every boring reason why.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.900
Glenn: So how's business?

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:29.900
Betty: What do you want?

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.000
Glenn: Your little molecular machines have some incredible implications.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.200
How'd you like to come work for Atheon?

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.700
Get paid ten times as much as you are now.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.100
NC: The HULK!

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.800
People calmly discussing things!

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.500
Staring at each other in silence!

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.120
But

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.300
...L-look!

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.500
Green walls!

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.340
It's...kind of like the Hulk is there!

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.800
Symbolically!

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.800
Oh you just don't get it!

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.120
You don't understand the layers of subtlety and conversation that need to be had with...

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.800
Ooh, look! It's the film's first big surprise!

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.200
They got a new janitor!

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.300
Betty: Hey what happened to Benny?

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.400
Is he not working the night shift anymore?

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.580
???: I'm the new guy.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.700
NC: That's exciting!

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.400
Betty: Good to meet you.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.100
???: Same.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:13.600
NC: Ah.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.700
The classic "mop" transition I see 'so' often in comics.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.100
Man, it's a good thing nobody takes a shit in this movie.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.500
So Bruce sits around staring at old pictures of Connelly as his girlfriend-

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.900
OH COME ON!!

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.900
Even the Kodak film has to run through the pretentious filter?!

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.700
I'm just waiting for the Prisoner of Azkaban to knock him out with a bottle of butterbeer!

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.800
This results in a flashback of when Bruce and her were still dating.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.400
Bruce: Tell me about your dream.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.700
Betty: Starts with a memory from when I was maybe two years old.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.040
[cartoon running]

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.300
I was living at a desert base with my father.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.800
Suddenly I'm alone.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.100
Talking about dreams!

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.400
Reoccurring dreams!

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.500
With your boyfriend being your father and trying to strangle you-

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.000
pkpikp

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.600
What?!

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.400
Bruce: That's terrible

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.300
You know I'd never hurt you.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.700
NC: Okay, um.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.600
Anyone that's new to the dating scene;

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.700
I don't know what Ang Lee is trying to tell you, but

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:23.300
if your date says they have a reoccurring dream about you as their father trying to kill them as a small child

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:23.800
Out.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.900
Just get out.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.900
Don't even make up an excuse.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:26.820
Just FLEE!

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.100
The only person you should flee faster from is Nick Nolte-

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.300
Of course he's in this movie!

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.300
Mr. Banner (played by Nolte): You may not want to believe it, but I can see it.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.200
Nolte plays Banner's real dad.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:41.000
I'm not sure if he went crazy then did the film or if he did the film then went crazy, but

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.100
there's regret to be had all around.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.700
I guess he's supposed to be intimidating, but

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:50.400
it doesn't really help when you're stalking a guy with three cuddly dogs by your side.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.500
No, seriously.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.800
This was supposed to be a threatening image!

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.400
I'm sorry!

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.100
The dogs goddamn ruin it!

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.200
Banner is so intimidated by this that he actually closes the blinds.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.000
Why?!

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.600
Even the most paranoid person wouldn't muster a sweat from this!

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.700
*snicker*

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.400
Tamara: What is that?

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.300
*laughing*

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.400
What is that?!

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.500
Hey buddy!

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.100
"Best in Show" is down the street!

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.100
*laughing*

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.000
When are you gonna break out a baton and have them bark "Ode to Joy?"

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
*more laughter*

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.700
Oh thank God they're gone.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.100
I thought I was gonna die of laughter.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:27.700
Whoo!

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.700
They really need to be in a Hulk movie.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.400
NC: Bruce walks in to find Smooth Suit McEeeeeeh

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.000
who wants to weaponize his ability to blow up frogs.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.600
Betty: About Glenn.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.200
I um...

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.500
Bruce: There's nothing to talk about.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.500
NC: Oh.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.200
Good.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.600
THEN DO SOMETHING!

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.800
Jesus!  We're a half hour in and not only has no action happened, but

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.300
Think about it.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.520
What do we really know about Bruce Banner?

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.000
He

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.500
...fondles babies in other people's dreams.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.240
Well that's the most I'm getting out of it!

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.700
Oh no!  Something's happening!

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.500
Stop!  Before it leads to the dangers of interest!

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.700
Bruce: Harper, get out!

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:12.200
The experiment seems to go wonky and Bruce sacrifices himself to a Photoshop filter.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.000
No, really.  It's this one. *snap*

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:14.500
See?

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.100
Finally leading him to transforming into

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.500
a guy in a hospital bed-

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.500
OH MY GOD!

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.300
Bruce: How's Harper?

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.120
Betty: He's alright.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.100
NC: "How's Harper?"

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.000
"He's alright."

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.900
"We're gonna sell so many toys!"

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.100
Mr. Banner: Your name is not Krenzler.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:35.300
NC: But hospital security is proving it's worth every penny as Nick Nolte and his

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.800
...presumably extended family, sneak in to see Bruce.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.740
Mr. Banner: You've had a terrible accident.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.600
Bruce: So perhaps you should leave now.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.060
Mr. Banner: We're gonna have to watch that "temper" of yours.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.900
NC: Yes, Lord knows, this really seems like a guy who flies off the handle!

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:51.800
Bruce: I'll be fine.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.900
NC: Whoa, hey! Watch it!

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.200
That faint whisper almost turned into a dull roar!

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.500
Connelly agrees to meet with her father, played by Sam Elliott-

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.700
WHOA! A CAR!!

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.620
Sorry, this movie's so dull, I confused that for an action sequence.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.580
Who is also interested in their scientific discoveries.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.200
Gen. Thunderbolt  Ross: Look I'm gonna

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.200
get right to it.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.900
This "Krinsler" you work with...

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.600
You know who he really is?

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.500
How much do you actually know about him?

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.600
NC: You ever notice how Sam Elliott talks like he has one last bite of steak in his mouth?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.500
(Gen. Ross mumbling) Well right now, I'm not at liberty to-

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.900
NC: Yeah, yeah. Chew.
(Gen. Ross mumbling)

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.600
Chew and swallow.
(Gen. Ross mumbling)

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.100
Chew and swallow!
(Gen. Ross mumbling)

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.700
It's rude to act with your mouth full!

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.700
Don't make Marvel waste you in another movie.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:32.300
Betty: Maybe this time you just honestly wanted to see me again?

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.700
Gen. Ross: I do want to see you.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.600
Betty: I really wish that I could believe you.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.100
The teaser that literally looked like this:

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.700
[CRASHING AND ROARING]

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.800
...was literally representing

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.500
THIS!

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.100
The funny thing is, we're about 45 minutes in.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.100
Well, okay.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:08.200
I guess they're doing the "Jaws" effect and trying to build up the green guy's appearance.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.400
But here's the thing.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.800
When he does finally change, it happens right the hell out of nowhere!

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.100
Yeah!  He's just sitting at his computer doing work and suddenly he's like:

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:17.800
(as Bruce): Shit, dammit!

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.900
I WANT THE HULK!

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.600
There's only so long we could pretend we know what we're talking about!

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.500
Deliver the Green M&amp;M on Shrek-oids!

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.300
(himself): Yeah. That's great. That's great.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.500
We waited 45 minutes to see this damn thing.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.900
Please focus on the beaker.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.700
That is clearly what we want to look at.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.900
You know when Jaws did show up,

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.800
they didn't focus on the life preserver!

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.600
Whoo! Okay. He's here.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.400
Christ.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.700
We finally got him.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.400
At friggin' long last, here is the Hulk.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.400
Get him the hell out of here!

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.900
We gotta change him back as fast as possible for more boring conversations!

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.000
Betty: Were you at the lab?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.100
Bruce: There was that man.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:53.800
Betty: Who?

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.900
Bruce: That new janitor.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.100
Bruce: The one with the dogs.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.400
NC: Christ, I can't take this anymore.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.200
I need a break.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.200
Here's some people that know how to sell something fun BETTER than this goddamn movie!

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.100
Commercial: Hey, kids!

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.820
You want something smashin'?

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.200
Kids: Yeeeaah!

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.800
Commercial: Well, crash your way to excitement with the Hulk!

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.800
Now that you have everyone's favorite crushing machine

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.900
what are you gonna do with him?

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.400
Malcolm (as Cliff): I'm think about the repressed memories that might be hiding in my psyche.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.860
Commercial: Um... okay.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.400
Hey, little girl!

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.700
What are you going to do with him?

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.500
Tamara (as Melody): I'm gonna use him as justification to finally confront my domineering father.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.200
Cliff: Melody, that's so brave of you.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.340
Melody: Thank you, Cliff.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.680
Commercial: Well, uh...

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.400
Doesn't anyone want to use him for smashing and stopping the forces of evil?

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.100
Melody: Shh!

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.800
Can't you see he's distraught!

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.200
Cliff: I can't believe we're losing the grant money.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.000
Melody: It's okay, Cliff. We'll think of something.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.900
Cliff: Will we?

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.500
Or will we be lost to the visual representation of our own sub-conscience?

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.800
Melody: Oh, Cliff!

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.340
Cliff: (crying) Melody.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:13.900
Commercial: The Hulk!

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.000
It's

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.760
...as much fun as it looks?

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.100
Cliff: We're done with childish things.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.100
Melody: Oh.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.900
NC: So as mentioned before, Connelly visits to explain what happened.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.500
Betty: What happened to you last night?

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.000
Bruce: It was like being born.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.200
It was like

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.000
Boom.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:43.940
Boom.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.600
NC (as Betty): Reacting by not reacting...

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.100
Done.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.460
(himself): But it looks like Elliott thinks Bruce might be behind the lab being destroyed.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.800
(as a bodyguard): We have no idea what your father is saying, ma'am.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.700
Can you help us?

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.840
Gen. Ross: Mitchell, escort my daughter outside.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.980
I'll join her shortly.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.780
NC: Chew and swallow!

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.000
Betty: And that's for the new guy on the night shift?
[aroused whistle?]

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.900
[boing]

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.700
NC: Connelly goes to Nick Nolte's house-

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.400
filmed presumably on location at Nick Nolte's house-

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.800
as she discovers he's Bruce's father, and they have a competition for who can speak the softest.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:13.800
Mr Banner: (whispering) Cure him.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:14.800
Change him.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.100
Betty: He seems to think he's involved in some kind of threat to national security.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.200
Mr. Banner: My son is...

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.800
unique.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.800
NC (as Mr. Banner): He was born without a personality.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.900
Actually, that's not very unique in this movie.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.500
Mr. Banner: And a very beautiful woman like you,

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.700
your intentions can be completely unwanted.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.500
NC (as Mr. Banner): You make the fleas in my beard go crazy.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.500
Mr. Banner: Besides...

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.200
he's made it clear he wants nothing to do with me.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.600
NC (as Betty): Yeah, I can clearly see that you took my scarf,

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.200
as displayed by this shot of me clearly seeing you taking my scarf.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.900
Mr. Banner: I have some work to do.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.000
NC (still as Betty): I'm...not asking for it back?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.600
Director?

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.100
I mean, you focused on it.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.100
You actually showed a scene of me seeing him take it.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.600
I'm...not retrieving what was touched by Nick Nolte's dirty, disease-filled hands-

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.760
You know what, he can keep it.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.000
(himself) He uses the scarf to give her scent to

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.100
...the beast from Sandlot?

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.100
...as cops surround Banner's house, keeping him under house arrest.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.400
Glenn: Asshole, I want to talk to you!

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.300
Doing a bang-up job as you can see.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.300
Oh no!  The cops should call the cops!

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.100
Bruce: Talbot.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:22.800
Glenn: Yeah?

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.800
Bruce: You're making me angry!

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.500
NC (as Bruce): How dare you make me feel an emotion in this film!

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.400
(as Glenn): Mr. Giant,

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.300
I swear I ate all my vegetables.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.000
AAAAH!!

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.700
(himself) He makes his way to Connelly's house, who's reaction is

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.600
(sigh) ...exactly how it is in the rest of the film.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.600
NC (as director): Cut! Okay Connelly, let's try something a little different here. Um

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.500
ACT!!!

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.100
(himself) God above!

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.060
I would have gone through at least the majority of the Three Stooges' reactions at this point!

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.000
Haphaphaphaphap!

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.300
Nyahnyahnyah!

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.580
A tarantula!

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.000
(himself) Oh, but for some reason you thought THAT didn't deserve a big reaction,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.660
how about this?

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.100
ZUUL, MOTHERFU-

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.800
Oh, my God? Are you serious?

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.760
That-that's not the final thing, is it? Oh, sorry.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.460
*clears throat*

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.100
ZUUL, MOTHERFU-

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.300
(laughing) What is this!?

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.000
Guys!

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.600
Guys, come on!

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.500
No!

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.700
(himself) Yup.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.100
This is the first action sequence in the movie,

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.200
One hour in,

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.000
and he's fighting mutant Pound Puppies.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.900
Isn't this always what you wanted?

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:40.220
When you saw the Incredible Hulk on TV and cartoons and in the comics

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:46.100
weren't you always wishing for the big screen adaptation where he fought the zombie cast of Lady and the Tramp?

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:50.200
You just know Stan Lee was watching the dailies of this and was like:

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.300
(as Stan Lee): Ang, I know you directed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Uh...

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:59.000
Is there any chance you can actually put in a crouching tiger or a hidden dragon?

00:20:59.100 --> 00:20:59.900
I'm just saying.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.400
I created Stripperella.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.500
And even I'm finding this pretty dumb.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.260
(himself): So the Hulk defeats the mutant poodle.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.500
...something that I didn't think I'd say while watching this,

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.700
...and changes back, because, by God, we haven't see enough of him as a normal guy yet, have we?

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.060
Betty: What were those animals?

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.200
NC: Well, I believe the scientific term is

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.100
"ridiculous."

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:25.200
But Elliott tranquilizes him and takes him to his base where he keeps him out cold

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.920
much to his daughter's dismay.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.300
Betty: He saved my life.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.600
Ross: Yeah, from a mutant French poodle.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.100
I'm indebted to him for that.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.700
NC: You know, Sam, you almost made that stupid line work.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.540
But you didn't.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.800
You still had to say the words "mutant French poodle."

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.000
But it was a good try.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.560
Nolte experiments on himself trying to continue Bruce's work, allowing him to physically adapt to his surroundings.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.300
This, in all honesty, leads to maybe the only cool scene in the movie.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:21:59.980
Goddammit!

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.400
Why'd that cool hand had to be attached to Nick Nolte?

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.800
And why'd that Nick Nolte had to be attached to this film?!

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.300
Don't worry, though.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.100
They give you more of exactly what you came here for:

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.300
friggin' talking!

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.900
Only this time, there's an army to stop any exciting development.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.300
So there's no fear of that pesky joy!

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.900
Hell, I think even the soldiers would be shouting at them to get some action about now.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.900
Betty: It's hard to believe we used to live here.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.800
Bruce: l must have seen you or known you.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.000
If only l could remember.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.600
NC (as Soldier): Oh, my God!

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.900
Make him angry!

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.400
(as Soldier 2): Tell him the movie's gonna bomb!

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.000
(as Soldier 3): Tell him he's gonna be replaced by two actors!

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.800
TWO!

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.400
Bruce: This is my old house, isn't it?

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:42.300
NC: You know, you see that unused playground equipment that's supposed to be fun for kids

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.500
but is in the middle of an empty, lifeless wasteland?

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.700
I can't help but wonder if that's Ang Lee's symbolic cry for help.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.500
The Huuuulk!!

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.000
Just

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.100
...have a good nap.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.200
*snoring*

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.000
Gen. Ross: *yell*

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.320
How dare you wake me up!

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.200
I was having the most wonderful dream where I wasn't watching you!

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.200
So Glenn takes over the operation so he can weaponize the Hulk's DNA.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:25.680
But while studying him, Bruce dives deep into his repressed memories and figures out the painful truth

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.000
...in that, it was

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.500
so painful how much we already knew the truth

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.820
...Bruce's dad kills his mom.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:37.700
Mr. Banner: You cannot imagine the unbearable finality of it.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.600
NC: Yeah, here's another big surprise:

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.600
(stage whispering) I think that's Wonder Woman!

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.900
He, of course, turns into the human Battletoad and he tries busting his way out.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.800
But they have foam to stop him.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.300
Because...

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.200
...if it makes bathtime fun, surely it can make the Hulk fun.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.400
[Woody Woodpecker laugh]

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.300
(chuckling) Okay.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:01.900
I think this scene only exists just to make a caption contest.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:02.400
Like:

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.700
Wow, even by this movie's standards, that was a new level of

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.300
"What?!"

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.500
(as an announcer): Coming summer of 1977:

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.700
a spin-off of Charlie's Angels entitled.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:37.200
Elliott does the sensible thing of releasing him unto the world

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.600
[OH, YEAH!]

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.280
And the military tries to take him down in the the desert.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.600
(as the Hulk): To hell with this interpretive dance bullshit!

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.240
I GOTTA SMASH SOMETHING!

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.300
(chuckling) Okay.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.900
I know the Hulk is supposed to be able to jump far, but

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.200
the way they do it, he looks like an unrendered Mario character!

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:55.900
[pixelated boing]

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.300
[pixelated boing]

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.540
[pixelated boing]

00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.600
[pixelated boing]

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:04.700
And we FINALLY get a little bit of Hulk actually fighting someone.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.080
(as the soldier): Oh, my God! THAT WAS AMAZIIIiiing!

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.500
I am still falling.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.200
We're just gonna hold on that shot

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.000
until you realize that looks like a penis.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.000
Got it? Good.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Back to the action!

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.000
(as the pilot): Come back, or we won't give you a pointless romance with Black Widow!

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:32.900
Okay, fine!

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.200
You get a subtext romance with Thor!

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.800
But he makes his way to San Francisco

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.200
presumably to stop more seasons of Fuller House.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.800
We then interrupt this thrilling action sequence to give you

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.600
shaving.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.300
Was every scene based on a bet?

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.500
"Hey, I bet you can't do a Hulk movie where he fights a poodle."

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.700
"Hey, I bet you can't do a Hulk movie where he's stopped by bath products."

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.600
"Hey, I bet you can't do a Hulk movie where he shaves in the middle of a fight sequence."

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.300
Whoa, whoa, Ang!

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.900
I meant just try ONE of those bets in the movie!

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.300
I didn't know you do all three!

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.200
Oh, my God. There should be a defuse manual for the bomb you're making!

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.500
He, of course, keeps going and makes it to the city.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:19.400
All right!

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.100
Now it's time to do some real damage.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.500
Go rampage before Rampage mucks it up!

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:28.300
Or, in keeping on track, stop before you get to the actual cool stuff.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.260
That works

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:30.780
...not at all.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.400
(whispers) Blow him to hell.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.400
(gunfire)

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:46.600
So Nolte is brought to his son, which obviously means the movie should focus on the conflict

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.200
between Nolte and Elliott.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.660
Maybe they had a competition for who could be understood the least.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:56.700
*imitating Elliot and Nolte with just "mer's" and "meh's."*

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.940
He's brought in to apparently take part in the stage play version of the film.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.900
(as Mr. Banner): Bruce, what's your favorite word?

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.700
Bruce: Saw her face.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.200
[boing]

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.100
Brown hair.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.720
[WW2 bomb whistle]

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.000
Brown eyes.
[WW2 bomb whistle]

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:13.500
[chomp]

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.400
NC: But, hey, let's have this two hours of suck go out on a high note!

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.300
As Nolte gives his best impression of Yosemite Sam swallowing a duck.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.900
Mr. Banner: INFECTED HUMANITY'S SOUL!

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.800
Of the kind that walked the Earth!

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.100
DISAPPEAR!

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.200
TO ME!

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.800
MEN OUT THERE IN THEIR UNIFORMS!

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.200
NC (as Mr. Banner): I Hulk your MILKSHAKE!

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.000
Mr. Banner: THINK OF ALL THE HARM THEY'VE DONE!!

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.600
Mr. Banner: NYAAAHH!

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.100
NC: (laughs) Wow.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:45.120
I don't think he could chew more scenery than if he literally picked up the set and started biting it-

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.800
Whoa! Whoa! I was just kidding!

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.300
Somebody should actually stop him before he eats himself!

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.700
He absorbs the electricity, making him super-powerful, and I'm

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.100
just gonna take a wild guess and say Connelly stares blankly at this.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.500
I never thought I'd say this, but

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.300
Can we have this performance back?

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.780
Connelly (as Sarah): Someone has been in my room again.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.000
I hate that.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.300
I HATE IT!

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.100
NC: I can't promise it won't lead to this:

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.600
But at least it's an attempt!

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:22.000
Banner turns into the Hulk, and Nolte flies them away, absorbing whatever he touches.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.700
It's the ultimate battle between father and son

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.700
even though there's

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:30.300
...surprisingly been very little time dedicated to them interacting as father and son.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.520
So much has not been building up to this!

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.100
(as the Hulk): Hey, hey! We may be bad

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.200
but we're not Fant4stic yet!

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.100
(himself): Oh, my God! It's the audience's patience!

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.300
IT'S ABOUT TO BLOW!!

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.600
But the Army nukes them, and they're both presumed dead.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.400
Connelly cares so little that she's lost her true love that she actually consoles her FATHER

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.940
rather than HER FATHER consoling HER!

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:59.080
(as Betty): When will I be more considerate about how my lack of feelings affects your feelings?

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.180
(himself) But, of course, they can't shake this feeling that Banner is still alive.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.400
[cartoon running]

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.400
Gen. Ross: Look, uh.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.000
If by some chance he

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:09.380
[boing]
did survive

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.000
[fart]
I'll try to contact you and, try to get in touch.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.400
NC (as Ross): I know he's still out there...

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.800
The Bruce.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.600
Taking it easy for us sinners.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:26.700
(himself): And it looks like he is still out there, using his research to help others until somebody tries to stop him.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:39.100
And roll those exciting-looking credits that in no way reflect the joyless mess that we just witnessed.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.500
This movie's terrible!

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.600
It's the perfect definition of misguided.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.960
It has some neat ideas, neat visuals,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.720
and I'll even argue that one or two of those transitions could be very effective, clever, and even beautiful at times.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.900
But there's just no thrill or investment.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.500
Banner is not made an interesting character.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.000
He's forgettable and bland.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.600
Just like the rest of the characters.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.600
And when you can't find them interesting, you can't find the film interesting

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.000
plain and simple.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.080
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, and

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.400
...I need to journey to find better movies to watch.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.620
Mr. Banner: NYAAAHH!

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.680
Hey! Doug Walker here doing the charity shoutout

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.780
and this week I'm doing a fan request.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.080
This is for the Rainforest Foundation.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:47.580
The Rainforest Foundation was founded on a new idea.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:53.800
What if the indigenous people of the rainforest had the legal right to protect the forests we all depend on?

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:58.160
For a long time, environmental organizations didn't focus on human rights,

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.400
In fact, people were usually seen as part of the problem.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:06.860
But this Foundation listened to the indigenous communities living deep in the Brazilian Amazon,

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:12.660
And decided to put their might behind fighting to protect their rainforest lands just as they always had.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:21.420
Today, we know that rainforests protected by indigenous communities have the lower rates of deforestation than any other forests in the world.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:26.740
Including national parks, national preserves, government land, and private sanctuaries.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:32.780
So yes, rainforests can also be the homes to many many people, and we want to keep it that way.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:40.240
If you look at their site and their Youtube channel, you can see all the people who benefit from the wonders of these incredible forests.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:44.680
You can see how they live, how they thrive, and how they want to continue to do so.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.460
Help protect these people and their homes.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:51.440
