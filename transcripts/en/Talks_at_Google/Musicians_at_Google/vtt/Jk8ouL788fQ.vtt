SAROD MAESTRO AMJAD ALI KHAN: So
today what we are going to play

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.440
is-- they would like to dedicate
this concert to the world

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.265
peace and harmony.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.805
And the opening first
piece-- the two songs

00:00:25.805 --> 00:00:29.480
which we are going to
play they are almost

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.310
like Indian national songs
and great favorites of Mahatma

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.900
Gandhi, the father of nation.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.420
[HINDI] and [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.320
They're both songs that
have beautiful message

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.670
and the melodic structure
is so appealing.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.750
So we would like to play that.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.170
And before that, I
would like to introduce

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.050
all the musicians
sitting on the stage.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.696

in the auditorium.

The next item is a song
written and composed

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.740
by Rabindranath Tagore.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:18.010
He in fact composed many songs
on different kind of ragas.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:21.369
As a tribute to him,
I made a CD that I

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:25.089
played ten songs of
Rabindranath Sangeet

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:31.670
with legendary Suchitra
Mitra, the singer from Bengal.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:37.430
This particular song is based
on folk music of Bengal.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.320
And it has a beautiful
message, [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.030

SAROD MAESTRO AMJAD ALI

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:31.270
is a traditional raga raag desh.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:35.790
All the great masters,

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:40.590
they all contributed and they
all express their thoughts,

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.110
beautiful thoughts of raag desh.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:48.000
We'll play this composition
in 10 beats time cycle,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.760
followed by a 16 beats
time cycle composition.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.470
Raag desh.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:01.890
After this, we will
be very happy to take

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:06.270
some certain questions
some all of you.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:11.040
And we are all so proud of
you, of this organization.

I'm sure if you Google,
you will find Sarod.

with raag desh.

to say on behalf of all of us,

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.620
is what Indian

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:40.890
That we don't plan
everything before.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:47.040
Everything happens one this

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.720
I just feel like sharing one
particular style of music.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.000
We have lots of songs
all over the world.

different kinds of messages.

00:27:00.495 --> 00:27:06.900

Hasan Amir Khusro who created

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:12.400
[HINDI] and also a singing
style called tarana.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.910
Tarana doesn't
deal with language.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.075
He created a language
of syllables.

you have any questions,

you can line up on the mics.

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.600
And I'll lead off with
the first question.

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:59.860
So Ustadji, it's such
a pleasure, privilege,

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:03.172
and honor to have you and your
sons perform here at Google.

00:44:03.172 --> 00:44:04.630
And at the beginning,
you mentioned

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:07.330
about the guru
[HINDI], the lineage

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:08.910
of learning from your guru.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:10.730
But in your case,
it was your father.

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:12.940
In your sons' case, the
parents were the gurus.

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.750
Can you talk a little bit
about having the guru live

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:19.170
in the house itself and be
your father or your parent?

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:26.170
SAROD MAESTRO AMJAD ALI KHAN:
It's the Indian realization

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:33.810
of guru was much more in India.

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:40.070
The surrendered-ness
towards God or guru

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:44.790
was more experienced in India.

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:49.310
And the guru demanded
complete attention,

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:52.250
complete
surrendered-ness And most

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:56.410
of the disciples,
the students, they

00:44:56.410 --> 00:45:02.260
worked like a domestic
help in the house.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:07.070
So a guru was
considered institution.

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:12.240
Now we look for a huge
concrete building,

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.630
they are called institutions.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:17.100
So that is the basic difference.

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:20.820
The lifestyle changed.

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:24.870
The requirements of
people who changed.

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:30.270
And everybody is trying to
reach to the moon and the sun.

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:33.680
But my father, my
guru, often said

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.510
that one should be
focused in life.

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:37.850
I can't do everything.

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:41.310
I can't be a Ph.D. and
also play good sarod.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:44.010
So one has to choose right
in the beginning what

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:46.110
you want to do with your life.

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:51.500
And similarly, I'm sure Amaan
would like to say something.

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.720
Ayaan would like
to say something.

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:57.810
So this commitment
and realization.

00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:59.920
So we are all humble
representative

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:04.340
of this ancient art Indian
classical music, sarod.

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:07.900
Sarod is a Persian
word which means music.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:11.600
And we had great
gurus in our country.

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:17.950
All over the world, we had great
sages, saints, philosophers.

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:21.530
But unfortunately, nobody
could [INAUDIBLE] us.

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:27.460
Today we have become such
a ferocious, unkind animal

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:32.900
that the whole world is
afraid of peace, of harmony.

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:37.190
There's a danger for world
peace and harmony in the world.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:39.980
So unfortunately, when
the education could not

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:43.300
create compassion and
kindness in the human being,

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.620
so we are going through
a very bad phase.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:53.750
And I hope people realize that
we have to share the kindness

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:56.020
and love with our children.

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:59.610
So we must have a-- in
our family-- as you know,

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:03.300
my wife is Subhalakshmi--
we feel connected

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.810
with every soul of the world.

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:08.570
And we feel that we
have a common god

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:10.850
and we are the common race.

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:15.000
So I hope people
get this message

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.560
and we are able to control
this violence and destruction

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:22.820
for what is happening
in the world.

MODERATOR: Thank you, Ustadji.

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:26.080
And very quickly, I wanted
to hear from Amaan and Ayaan

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:26.580
as well.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:29.270
What was it like to
grow up in a household

00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:31.860
where your parents were
both world class musicians.

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:33.889
What is the pressure like?

00:47:33.889 --> 00:47:35.180
AMAAN ALI KHAN: Good afternoon.

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:39.470
It's always, I say
it's a pleasure.

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:41.620
Now I feel it's an honor,
because when you're

00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:43.800
much younger, you don't
realize where you're born.

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:46.480
You just feel it's people
are looking at your parents.

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.630
And oh, they are popular.

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:48.910
You get that feeling.

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:52.270
But as you grow up, you
realize the responsibilities

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:53.560
that keep growing.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:59.120
My mother was a very eminent
Bharatanatyam dancer.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:02.230
She learned from Shrimati
Rukmini Devi Arundale

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:03.950
from Chennai.

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:07.740
And my father comes
from a lineage-- well,

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:13.100
I know where you come, but from
this heavy family of musicians.

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.570
So I think it's an honor.

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:19.210
And it is not very easy.

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:20.240
It is difficult.

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.620
But as they say, there
are no free lunches.

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:25.280
So you enjoy all the importance,
not [INAUDIBLE] thing.

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.708
So really working
hard towards that.

00:48:27.708 --> 00:48:28.583
MODERATOR: Thank you.

00:48:28.583 --> 00:48:30.489
AMAAN ALI KHAN: Ayaan.

00:48:30.489 --> 00:48:31.780
AYAAN ALI KHAN: Good afternoon.

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:35.280
I think my brother's pretty much
covered the emotion that even

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.230
I went through.

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:41.260
But of course it was a great
honor and a great privilege

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:46.050
also to just be born in a family
where the language spoken was

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:46.550
music.

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:49.110
The air we were
breathing was music.

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:52.890
And much as I say there was
no pressure, but perhaps

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:54.770
in a sense there always was.

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:58.010
Because as an eight year
old or a seven year old,

00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:00.660
even when I would just go
with my father at concerts,

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:02.162
you would meet
people who'd say, oh.

00:49:02.162 --> 00:49:04.100
We've heard your
grandfather or your father

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:06.010
and now we are
waiting to hear you.

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:10.610
So that, at some level, it
was all building up inside.

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:14.950
And, of course, my parents have
been made gracious people who

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:20.410
gave us the freedom to decide
as to whatever you want to do.

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:26.860
But then eventually I think
we heard what the heart said.

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.460
And I think it was the
right thing for us to do.

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.630
And I think then we got
passionate about what

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:35.264
we were doing.

00:49:35.264 --> 00:49:36.430
MODERATOR: Thank you, Ayaan.

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:40.050
And Ustadji said you'd like
to hear a little bit from Mrs.

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:45.270
Khan also, so-- you'll have
to have the argument with him.

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:50.399
SAROD MAESTRO AMJAD
ALI KHAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:50.399 --> 00:49:51.190
MODERATOR: Exactly.

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:52.700
Yeah.

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.850
The legendary sons and the
dad right in front of you

00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:59.250
performing like this.

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:03.530
SUBHALAKSHMI KHAN: Well, I
think it is not easy definitely,

00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:05.460
if I have to be very frank.

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:08.900
But at the same time,
it's an honor and pleasure

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:17.260
to be wife of such a legend and
mother of two very beautiful--

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:20.160
beautiful I don't
mean look-wise.

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.190
Beautiful souls.

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:25.990
And they're really
wonderful children.

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:30.780
And they're working very hard,
that much I can say, vouch for.

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:36.600
And I really wish they
are able to carry forth

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.925
the tradition of this
family, because they

00:50:38.925 --> 00:50:42.060
are in an unbroken chain
of the seventh generation

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:44.380
of continuing the sarod.

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:48.370
So I hope even the eighth
generation will continue,

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:50.930
but I can only wish
them all the very best,

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:53.910
and it has always been
an honor and a pleasure

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:56.130
to be associated
with this family.

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:56.855
Thank you.

00:50:56.855 --> 00:51:00.655
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:00.655 --> 00:51:01.780
MODERATOR: Congratulations.

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.600
You have done very well.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.390
Now we'll take some
audience questions,

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:08.760
and we'll have time for
a couple of questions.

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.710
But after that, Ustadji and his
sons and family will be here

00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:14.170
and they'll be signing
books and CDs at the back.

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:16.220
So you can have direct
conversation with them.

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.920
Go ahead.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.690
AUDIENCE: Thanks
again to be here.

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:22.000
We are very honored.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.970
And Mrs. Khan, I can
assure you, your sons

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:26.890
are beautiful look-wise too.

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:34.330
So this question is both
for you, Amaan and Ayaan.

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:39.610
As technology is improving and
YouTube is becoming pervasive,

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:42.020
what do think is
role of technology

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:45.410
in spreading sarod or Indian
classical music as such?

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:47.750
And what can a
company like Google

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:49.500
do to help you spread the word?

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.900
AYAAN ALI KHAN: No, I think
it's a wonderful time.

00:51:55.900 --> 00:52:01.430
That we all are a part
of social media today

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:05.250
and all the networks which
propagate and promote

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:07.180
arts and culture.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:10.890
So I think it's
wonderful that now

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:13.640
any musician or any
creative person--

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:18.620
or anyone for that matter--
can post what they are doing.

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:21.600
And I think we have
a lot of content now

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:25.530
which is very easily available,
especially for a younger artist

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:26.505
if he wants references.

00:52:26.505 --> 00:52:28.880
If he wants to hear
all the great masters.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.300
Everything is so
easily available.

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:35.150
And the beautiful part is
now even most artists now

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:39.297
have-- you can directly access
them because of this medium.

00:52:39.297 --> 00:52:40.380
So I think it's wonderful.

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:42.610
It's great.

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:47.030
Not many people extremely
savvy yet, but then one

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:49.740
is trying to keep up.

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:51.590
But I think it's
just a wonderful time

00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:55.419
for just reaching
out to people now.

00:52:55.419 --> 00:52:57.460
AMAAN ALI KHAN: Google
can help starting with us.

00:53:01.889 --> 00:53:02.430
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:03.990
Thank you for coming, again.

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:06.360
So my question was on
similar lines and technology.

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:08.587
So I see that [INAUDIBLE]
has a Twitter page,

00:53:08.587 --> 00:53:09.420
has a Facebook page.

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:10.530
He also updated today.

00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:13.040
He is coming to
Googleplex and stuff.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:16.850
But as the audience is changing,
like the generation shifts,

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:21.610
how do you see a change
in appreciation of music

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:24.175
from people, from
the audience you get?

00:53:24.175 --> 00:53:26.550
Like as the generations are
becoming younger and younger.

00:53:32.677 --> 00:53:34.510
SAROD MAESTRO AMJAD ALI
KHAN: It's very rare

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:38.690
to see people sitting
and performing nowadays.

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:41.390
Everybody's dancing
and standing.

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:43.980
So that is the basic difference.

00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:48.570
But we must protect
our tradition.

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:50.155
We must protect our identity.

00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:58.740
So we'll have to
collectively make

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:02.460
an effort to protect
our tradition.

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:05.085
Every country's tradition,
every country's identity.

00:54:05.085 --> 00:54:06.580
It's very important.

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:14.160
Because I feel that God
has given identity of music

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:18.330
to every country through
a line of melody.

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:20.550
In India, we have
so many states.

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:23.580
Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab.

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.540
Through a line of melody, you
can make out it's Gujarat.

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:32.500
It is Rajasthan, or-- so that
is great blessings of God.

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:36.600
And what music we have
this-- we don't read music.

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.380
We don't write music.

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:43.300
But we improvise and everything
is-- whatever we performed,

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.570
we can't repeat.

00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:48.080
Only Google can show to the
world what we did today.

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:51.120
But we can't give
identical concert.

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:54.570
So it was especially meant
for all of you today.

00:54:54.570 --> 00:55:06.160
And so we must carry and
we must provide and promote

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:07.910
our traditional art.

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:12.180
Because life is
not entertainment.

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:14.580
They are laughter
shows on the TVs.

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.530
It's fine for few moments.

00:55:17.530 --> 00:55:21.350
But life is not just
entertainment or laughing

00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:22.600
shows.

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.960
So a tradition, the
European music, the way

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:29.620
they have preserved
Beethoven, Bach, Mozart.

00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:32.560
And I am also now
enjoying composing

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:36.900
for orchestras and
Philharmonic orchestras.

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:41.860
My work with the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra, [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:44.120
So this is the way
that musically we

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:45.890
can talk to each other.

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:51.910
We can collectively
try to give the message

00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:55.090
that we are the same race.

00:55:55.090 --> 00:55:57.080
We love each other.

00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:58.710
If we can't help
each other, don't

00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:00.780
try to destroy each other.

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:05.490
So I think we must
preserve our identity.

00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:08.970
And there are so many talented
among Amaan's and Ayaan's

00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:10.180
generation.

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.320
There are so many
talented musicians

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.720
in south India and north India.

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.460
All over the world.

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:21.470
So I think music has played
a very important role

00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:23.070
to connect the world.

00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:26.340
And music will continue
to connect the world

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:32.061
through peaceful
music, appealing music.

00:56:32.061 --> 00:56:33.560
MODERATOR: In
closing, again, I want

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:36.510
to say a big thank you to
Subhalakshmi, Anubrata, Ayaan,

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:38.615
Amaan, and [INAUDIBLE]
Amjad Ali Khan.

00:56:38.615 --> 00:56:40.740
Googlers, please join me
in saying a big thank you.

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:47.990
