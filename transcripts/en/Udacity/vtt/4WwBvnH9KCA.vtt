00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.550
In the rest of this lesson we're going to look at eclipse and

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.290
try to get more familiar with eclipse in a hands on manner

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.550
through a demo. In the demo we will cover some of the

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.040
basic aspects of eclipse like how to run eclipse, how to select

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.400
their workspace, how to create a project, how to create the class

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.240
within the project and so on. I'll also cover some more advanced

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.610
aspects, like how to create builders, run your project within Eclipse, and

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.800
how to use their Eclipse debugger. So let's get to the demo.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.220
So let's start Eclipse. Eclipse is going to ask me

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.600
for the location of my workspace and in this

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.530
case, I selected a suitable directory and you can

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.480
also use that checkbox on the left to avoid Eclipse

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.640
for asking you again about where to put the

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.860
workspace. And the workspace is basically the place the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.310
directory. Where, Eclipse will place all of your projects.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.830
So, now when you start Eclipse, if it's the first

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.480
time you might get this Welcome screen. It's not going to happen

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.500
again on subsequent executions, but I just wanted to make sure

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.210
that I covered all the bases. And so, whatcha want to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.360
do here is to basically go to the java perspective

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.760
which you can do by clicking over there or you can

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.240
also use the menus. So in this case we will have

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.810
to go to Window, open Perspective, and if the Perspective is

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.660
not here, you'll have to click on Other. And at this point,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.030
that you can click on Java Perspective, then you

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.680
click okay. And the perspective is basically, the visual work

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.810
space where you will be operating. So, after we selected

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.350
perspective, we can actually close the welcome screen. And here,

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.000
you see that you have this different areas and on

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.930
the left You have the package explorer. This is the

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.650
area where your packages will be, you've got a task list,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.280
and an outline on the right which we'll cover later.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.870
And then you have underneath, the bottom, a problems, java

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.330
doc and declaration views and we will see some of

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.320
these views in actions later. And here in the center

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.290
you have the area. Which is called a code editor,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.360
which is where you'll be writing, editing, and modifying, basically,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.440
your code. This is where most of the action takes

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.140
place. So let's start by creating a Java project. And

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.950
to do that we can use either the context menu, or

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.560
you can just use the menu, select new Java project.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.390
You'll be greeted by this, wizard, and. And at this

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.500
point in the wizard, you can select the name of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.100
your project. I'm just going to call it a very simple way

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.990
my project. And I going to use the default location for

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.070
the project, as you can see it will be placed

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.440
in the work space that I selected before. I'm going to

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.080
also use the default. Java Runtime Environment, which is Java 1.7

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.250
in this case. I'm going to keep the selected default layout

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.120
and the, then I'm going to go to the next step. Here,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.380
we're first presented with the location of the source code for

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.840
our project. The default is a directory SRC in my project

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.320
and for the output file, the directory bin. So repeat, we're now

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.410
going to change that. Here in case you need other projects to

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.240
build your own, then you can specify them here. Here we

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.570
are building a simple project, so there's no need for that.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.890
And here we can specify which libraries our project requires. As

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.880
you can see, the Java library's already specified. And you can

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.840
also add other jars, which can even be External jars. And

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.840
finally this is the tab that allows you to specify which

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.300
part of you project. So how your project will be exported,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.760
so let's not worry about that for now. let's click finish.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.300
And as you can see here on the package explorer, my

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.920
project appeared. So now we can open the project by clicking

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.920
on the triangle right next to it, and as you can

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.250
see there is the SRC directory, where my source code will go,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.760
and there's also an indication that we're using the JRE, so that's

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.800
the Java system directory within our project. And this is just for people

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.860
who are interested in what happens you know, under the hood. So

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.840
if you don't care about that, you can just skip this part. So

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.200
basically here I'm showing you how we can go to the directory

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.250
where the project was created. We can see the bin and src directories.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.020
And there's also some other files here that you can

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.780
see these 'dot' files that you will not normally, see. And

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.870
those are kind of bookkeeping files. So these are files that

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.280
contain information about your project and that are created automatically by

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.860
Eclipse. And, for example, will have various indication about the

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.580
configuration of the project, some settings and the class path for

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.880
the project. And, as I said, you don't have to worry

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.490
about this if you just want to go Eclipse as you're never

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.551
going to mess with the command line.
