Narrator:
YES, THIS IS DAVID MAYMAN

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:07.306 line:0%
DEMONSTRATING HIS WILD SIDE

00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:11.377 line:0%
AND WOWING OVER 2 1/2
MILLION PEOPLE WITH THIS,

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:14.814 line:0%
THE ONLY FULLY FUNCTIONAL
JET PACK IN THE WORLD.

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:20.953
I NEED TO GET A JET PACK ASAP.

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:22.221
Narrator: YEAH. SORRY, HAKEEM.

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:24.991
THERE'S ONLY ONE
OF THESE BAD BOYS.

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.895
WE JETTED OFF TO CALIFORNIA

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:31.931
TO MEET CHIEF DESIGNER
NELSON TYLER

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:35.468
AND PILOT DAVID MAYMAN
TO FIND OUT WHAT DROVE THEM

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:39.205
TO BUILD
THE BEAST OF ALL CREATIONS.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.707
I WAS 10 YEARS OLD.

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:43.976
AND ON THE RADIO
WAS BUCK ROGERS.

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:47.614
AND HE CAME OUT OF A SPACESHIP,
PUT ON HIS JET PACK.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.748
AND I FIGURED,
"I'VE GOT TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE."

00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:52.218
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO FLY,
YOU KNOW, MYSELF.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.820
SO I GOT INTO
SKYDIVING TO DO THAT.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.388
THAT'S A LITTLE DANGEROUS,
I THOUGHT.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.890
SO, HEY, LET'S TAKE UP SOMETHING
SAFE LIKE JET-PACK FLYING.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.358
I MEAN, THE JET PACK IS --

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:01.560
IT'S SCIENCE FICTION
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.729
BUT IT IS -- IT'S TRUE.
IT'S HERE.

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.198
IT'S SITTING RIGHT THERE.

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:09.569
Narrator: BUT HOW DO THEY GET
THEIR JET PACK OFF THE GROUND?

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.438 line:0%
WE'VE SEEN JET PACKS BEFORE,
BUT THIS ONE IS SPECIAL.

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:14.474 line:0%
THIS ONE CAN ACHIEVE
A VERTICAL TAKEOFF

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.642
AND CAN FLY THOUSANDS OF FEET
IN THE AIR.

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:20.179 line:0%
THE JB-9 IS MADE USING
A CARBON-FIBER CORSET,

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:23.383
WHICH IS STRONG ENOUGH
TO TAKE THE WEIGHT OF THE ENGINE

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:25.351
BUT LIGHT ENOUGH TO BE WORN.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.920
THE TURBINE ENGINES IN THIS
JET PACK WORK THE SAME WAY

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.856
AS THE JET ENGINE
IN AN AIRCRAFT,

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.157
AND THE EXPLOSIVE FORCE

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.459
OF THE EXHAUST COMING OUT
OF THE BACK OF THE JET PACK

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:36.061
SENDS THE WEARER
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION --

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:39.465
UP.

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:42.468
AS THE FUEL BURNS OFF,
DAVID'S RIG GETS LIGHTER,

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:44.370
WHICH MEANS HE CAN GO FASTER --

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.605
UP TO SPEEDS OF
100 KILOMETERS AN HOUR,

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:47.807
OR 60 MILES AN HOUR.

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:54.614
IT'S FUNNY. WHEN PEOPLE
HAVE SEEN ME FLY ON VIDEO,

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.448
THEY GO,
"MM. THAT'S INTERESTING."

00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:59.251
WHEN THEY COME OUT
AND THEY FEEL THE VIBRATION

00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:00.420
AND THE NOISE

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.122
AND THEY SEE ME TAKE OFF
AND, LIKE, DISAPPEAR,

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:06.159
THEY'RE JUST LIKE,
"OH, WOW."

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.997
Narrator:
BUT HOW DOES DAVID MANEUVER
THIS MAGNIFICENT MACHINE?

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:14.600
DAVID CONTROLS THE JET PACK
USING TWO HANDHELD LEVERS.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.168
ON THE RIGHT IS THROTTLE,

00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:19.138
AND ON THE LEFT
IS A TWIST GRIP FOR DIRECTION.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:22.441 line:0%
IT MOVES TWO FINS,
WHICH ARE UNDER THE JET ENGINES.

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:23.943
THEY'RE CALLED YAW WINGS,

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:27.246
AND BY DEFLECTING THE EXHAUST
GASES IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS,

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:30.049
IT PUSHES DAVID DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.050
BY CONTROLLING THE ORIENTATION
OF THESE TWO FINS,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.687
DAVID CAN PERFORM SOME
IMPRESSIVE TRICKS IN THE AIR.

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:37.589
IF HE DIRECTS THE OUTPUT OF ONE
FORWARD AND THE OTHER BACKWARDS,

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:39.425
HE'LL SPIN IN PLACE LIKE A TOP.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:40.960
BUT TO GO SIDE TO SIDE,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.396
HE JUST HAS TO REPOSITION
HIS BODY

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:46.933
AND ADJUST HIS WEIGHT
TO INDUCE A TURN.

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:50.202
Wrigglesworth: DAVID CAN ALSO
PUSH FORWARD ON BOTH LEVERS.

00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:53.472
THIS PHYSICALLY MOVES
THE ANGLE OF THE ENGINES,

00:02:53.472 --> 00:02:56.242
TILTING THEM FORWARD
AND MAKING IT EASIER FOR DAVID

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.478
TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION.

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:01.714
TO BE THE JET-PACK GUY,
"A," IT WAS THE --

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:03.949
THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGE
OF ACHIEVING THIS

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.418
WHEN NOBODY ELSE HAD.

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.353
AND "B," IT'S A HELL
OF A LOT OF FUN TO DO.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:10.222
I MEAN, HONESTLY, IT'S A BLAST.

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:11.724
IT'S FINALLY HAPPENED.
YOU KNOW?

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.926
HERE IT IS. HEY, EVERYBODY.

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:15.294
COME GET YOUR JET PACK.

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:19.165
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT
ONLY A SUPERHUMAN COULD FLY.

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:23.369
FOR US, THIS IS THE FUTURE
OF PERSONAL TRANSPORT.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.772
Wrigglesworth: JET PACKS HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN THE STUFF OF DREAMS,

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:28.274
BUT NOW, THEY ARE A REALITY.

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:30.076
AND IT LOOKS BETTER
THAN I EVER IMAGINED.
