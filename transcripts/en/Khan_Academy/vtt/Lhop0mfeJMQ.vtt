00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.825
We're on problem 110.

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:07.830
Let me scroll this up.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.530
Whenever Martin has a restaurant
bill with an amount

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.440
between $10 and $99 he
calculates the dollar amount

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.500
of the tip as two times
the tens digit of the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.280
amount of his bill.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.210
Fair enough.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.720
So essentially, if there
is a ten digit, he just

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.090
multiplies it by 2.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.750
If the amount of Martin's most
recent restaurant bill was

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.490
between $10 and $99, was the
tip calculated by Martin on

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.080
his bill greater than 15% of
the amount of the bill?

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.010
That is the question.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.710
Statement 1 says, the amount
of the bill was

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.150
between $15 and $50.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.500
So 1 essentially is enough for
this problem, is sufficient,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.712
if for every bill, based on
his calculation where you

00:00:57.712 --> 00:01:00.650
double the tens digit, it's
going to be greater than 15.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.019
And I suspect, let's see if we
take the lower end of this, on

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.540
this he'll pay $2.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.480
He'll pay a $2 tip on $15.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.160
And what percentage is that?

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.190
15 goes into 2.00.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.760
1, 15, 50.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.630
15 goes into 50 3 times.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.160
3 times 50, 45 and it
just keeps going.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.890
So that's a 13% tip.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.770
Well, it's going to be even
lower than that at $16.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.990
Maybe the bill wasn't $15,
the bill was $16.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.835
So the tip is, at the lower
end it's 13%, 12%.

00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:47.970
And at the higher end, if the
bill is $40 exactly and he

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.390
pays $8 on that.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.990
If the bill is $40, then Martin
would pay $8, which

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.190
would be 20%.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.880
So I can pick different numbers
in this range, and

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:11.230
based on the way Martin
calculates his tip, he can

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.560
either pay less than 15%
or more than 15%.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.730
So statement 1 alone
is not sufficient.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.880
What does statement 2 tell us?

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.480
The tip calculated
by Martin was $8.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.500
Well this is going to be
2 times the tens digit.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.650
So that means that the bill
was equal to $40-- I don't

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.170
know, $40-something.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.860
So let's think about it.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.150
So the worst case is if the
bill-- if he paid $8 an a $40

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.270
bill, that's definitely
more than 15%.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.140
That's 20%.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.220
That's what I just actually
calculated.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.030
Let's see the worst case
is on a $49 bill.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.160
That the bill keeps going
up and he just pays $8.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.820
So is 8 bigger than 15% of 49?

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:58.230
Well yeah.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.110
Because 8/50 is equal to what?

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.140
That's equal to 16%.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.320
So if 8/50 is 16%, 8/49, if we
lower the denominator a little

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.860
bit, that's going to be
greater than 16%.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.830
So no matter what range in the
forties the bill was, whether

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.500
it's $40 or $49 or anything in
between, an $8 tip is going to

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.200
be more than-- it's actually
going to be more than 16%.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.330
Not to speak of even 15%.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.480
So statement number 2
alone is sufficient

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.640
to answer this question.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.680
And statement number 1
is fairly useless.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.060
Problem 111.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.730
The price per share of stock x
increased by 10% over the same

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.500
time period that the price
per share of stock y

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.010
decreased by 10%.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.280
The reduced price per share of
stock y was what percent of

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.090
the original price per
share of stock x?

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.100
Fascinating.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.920
So let's do initial and final.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:09.730
So x final is equal to an
increase by 10% from the

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.920
initial period.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.959
OK, so it equals 1.1
times x initial.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.040
Fair enough.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.670
And then, over the same time
period y decreased by 10%.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.660
So y final is equal to 10%
less than y initial.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.180
So that's 0.9 times y initial.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.660
And what they want to know is
the reduced price per share of

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:43.810
stock y-- so that's y f-- was
what percent of the original

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.660
price per share of stock x?

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.210
Of x initial?

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.770
So this is what they
want to figure out.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.090
This as a percentage.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.140
So let's see if the statements
help us out at all.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.520
The increased price per share
of stock x was equal to the

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.690
original price per
share of stock y.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.380
So the increased price
per share of stock

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.670
x, so that's x f.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.310
That's the final.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.950
That's the increased
share price.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.110
It increased from the initial
to the final.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.670
So the increased price per share
of stock x was equal to

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.150
the original price per
share of stock y.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.895
So that equals y initial.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.160
So this is interesting.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.150
I don't know if it
gets us anywhere.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.310
This deals with x final
and x initial.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:43.600
So I think we can-- so if we
could write all of it in terms

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.600
of y initial.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.620
So y final equals-- so
let's rewrite this.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.400
This is equal to-- y final
is 0.9 times y initial.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.960
That's just from
this equation.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.420
0.9 times y initial.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.190
And let's see if we could write
the initial x in terms

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.150
of the initial y.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.570
So x final is equal
to y initial.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.380
So that means that y initial
is equal to this.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.620
So that equals 1.1 x initial.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.515
And that means that we can
divide both sides of this

00:06:20.515 --> 00:06:22.740
equality by 1.1.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:32.300
And we get x initial is equal to
1 over 1.1 times y initial.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.830
So then we have this.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.180
1 over 1.1 times y initial.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.990
And then these two
would cancel out.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.350
And you would actually
have your answer.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.020
So statement 1 alone
is sufficient

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.270
to answer the question.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.370
It wasn't obvious to me at
first, but then you have to

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.440
realize that, the terminology is
confusing but that you can

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.030
actually write both of these
in terms of y initial given

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.770
that information.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.100
Given the fact that x final
is equal to y initial.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.180
Let's see what statement
2 does for us.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:10.690
The increase in the price per
share of stock x was 10/11 the

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.960
decrease in the price per
share of stock y.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.280
Let me think about that.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.470
The increase in the price
per share of stock x.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:27.700
So that means that x final minus
x initial-- that's the

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:36.800
increase-- that this was equal
to 10/11 times the decrease in

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.605
the price per share
of stock y.

00:07:38.605 --> 00:07:40.330
So what was the decrease?

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:45.935
This was y initial
minus y final.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.470
Because this was a larger
number and we wanted a

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.290
positive number here.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:53.490
Because we're just saying
the decrease.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.562
We're not saying the
negative increase.

00:07:55.562 --> 00:07:58.360
So let's see if we can
simplify this at all.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:11.320
So let's see, you get x final
minus x initial is equal to

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:22.300
10/11 y initial minus
10/11 y final.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.010
And remember, the whole time
we just want to figure out

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.940
what y final over
x initial is.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.309
So let's think about this.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:38.880
Let's write x final is equal
to 1.1 times x initial.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:47.450
Right So we have 1.1 times x
initial minus x initial is

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.450
equal to-- actually I should
have done that

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.490
in the first step.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.730
Let's just skip this
right now.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:57.740
Let's just write
the 10 over 11.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.660
What do we want?

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.690
We want y final.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.585
So we just want to substitute
for y initial.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.500
I am confusing myself.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.000
So y initial is going
to be equal to y

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.470
final divided by 0.9.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:20.280
So 1 over 0.9 y final.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.960
I know this is a little
confusing.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.490
Minus y final.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.870
I just did a substitution
for y initial.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.920
And then here, well this is
actually, we know that we can

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.650
solve this problem.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.090
Although it gets quite hairy.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.130
Because here, if you think about
it, you're going to get

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:39.720
some number, well you're going
to get 0.1 x initial is equal

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.860
to-- you're going to get some
constant after you do all this

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.140
math-- times y final.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.450
And so you can easily figure out
what y final divided by x

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.650
initial is, just by dividing
both sides by x initial and

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.560
then dividing both sides
by a and you would

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.740
have solved the problem.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.100
And I'm not going to do that
because it's actually kind of

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.860
hairy and I don't have-- 1
divided by 0.9 and then

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.380
multiplying it by 10/11
is a fairly convoluted

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.410
way of doing it.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:09.480
But hopefully, you see that
this is solvable.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.315
And let me just review that
again because I think I did it

00:10:12.315 --> 00:10:13.800
in my own head.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.340
So the statement itself said the
change, the gain in x-- x

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.710
final minus x initial-- was
10/11 times the loss in y.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:25.280
So y initial minus y final.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.860
Because y final is
the smaller one.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.160
x final we can rewrite in terms
of x initial just using

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.720
our initial, the fact that
it was 10% more.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.970
So I just did that here.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.285
And y initial, we can
rewrite as y final.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.670
You could say y initial
is equal to y

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.290
final divided by 0.9.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.590
And that's what we did there.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.930
And then you could see here,
this will simplify to some

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.170
constant times y final.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.740
And then you multiply
that times 10/11.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.450
So you get some constant
times y final.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.800
And then you have 0.1
times x initial.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.360
1.1 minus 1.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.170
And then you can just do some
simple algebra to figure out

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.200
what y final over
x initial is.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.780
So both statements,
independently, are sufficient

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.670
to solve this problem.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.080
I think that was the hardest
one we've done so far.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.950
See you in the next video.
