00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.180
- [Lecturer] We are told
that a conservation group

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.920
with a long-term goal
of preserving species

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.100
believes that all at-risk
species will disappear

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.910
when land, inhabited by
those species, is developed.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.190
It has an opportunity to
purchase land in an area

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.000
about to be developed.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.730
The group has a choice of
creating one large nature preserve

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.500
with an area of 45 square kilometers

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.146
and containing 70 at-risk species,

00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:29.783
or five small nature preserves,

00:00:29.783 --> 00:00:33.270
each with an area of
three square kilometers

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.480
and each containing 16 at-risk species

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.570
unique to that preserve.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.560
Which choice would you recommend and why?

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.395
There are some interesting data here.

00:00:44.395 --> 00:00:47.180
It looks like some data they have gathered

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.660
for different islands.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.786
We have their areas.

00:00:50.786 --> 00:00:54.407
This is the number of
species at risk in 1990.

00:00:54.407 --> 00:00:57.219
The species extinct by 2000.

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.360
We can see for these various islands,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.680
we can see their areas

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.150
and the proportion that got extinct.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.850
It looks like they're
plotted on this scatter plot.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.760
Now be very careful when you look at this

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.550
because look at the two axes.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.440
The vertical axis is the
proportion extinct in 2000.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.800
It's these numbers.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.080
But the horizontal axes isn't
just a straight-up area.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.809
It's the natural log of the area.

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:23.870
Why did they do this?

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.430
Notice, when you make the horizontal axis

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.720
the natural log of the area,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.210
it looks like there is
a linear relationship.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.530
But be clear, it's a linear relationship

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.820
between the natural log of the area

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.510
and proportion extinct in 2000.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.930
But the reason why it's valuable

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.070
to do this type of transformation

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.610
is now we can apply our
tools of linear regression

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.080
to think about what
would be the proportion

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.840
extinct for the 45 square kilometers

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.840
versus for the five small
three-kilometer islands.

00:01:56.111 --> 00:01:57.330
Pause this video

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.880
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.150
They gave us the regression data

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.903
for a line that fits this data.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.953
All right.

00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:04.786
Now let's work through it together.

00:02:04.786 --> 00:02:08.250
To make some space because
all of it is already plotted

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.990
right over here, and we
have our regression data.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.890
The regression line, we know
it's a slope in y-intercept.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.520
The y-intercept is right
over here, 0.28996.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.141
0.2, this is, let's see,
one, two, three, four, five.

00:02:23.141 --> 00:02:24.143
28996.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.030
It's almost 29.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.370
It's gonna be right over here

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.870
would be the y-intercept.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.870
Its slope is negative 0.05 approximately.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.943
I could eyeball.

00:02:35.943 --> 00:02:39.830
It probably is gonna
look something like this.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.193
That's the regression line.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.580
Or another way to think about it

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.592
is the regression line tell
us in general the proportion,

00:02:47.592 --> 00:02:50.110
proportion, obviously a proportion,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.010
shorthand for proportion extinct,

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.150
is going to be equal to
our y-intercept 0.28996

00:03:00.936 --> 00:03:01.769
minus 0.05323.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.390
We have to be careful here.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.370
You might be tempted
to say times the area,

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.710
but no, the horizontal axis here

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.830
is the natural log of the area.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.350
Times the natural log of the area.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.490
We can use this equation
for both scenarios

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.250
to think about what is
going to be the proportion

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.730
that we would expect to get
extinct in either situation,

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.660
and then how many actual
species will get extinct.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.290
The one that maybe has fewer
species that get extinct

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.320
might maybe the best one,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.930
or the one that the more
that we can preserve

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.264
is maybe the best one.

00:03:35.264 --> 00:03:38.180
Let's look at the two scenarios.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.180
The first scenario is the
45 square kilometer island.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.673
This is just one, so times one.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.810
What is gonna be the proportion,

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.550
proportion that we would
expect to go extinct?

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.900
Based on this regression,

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.900
it's going to be 0.28996 minus 0.05323

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.140
times the natural log of 45.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.150
If we want to know the actual
number that go extinct,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.150
so number extinct would be
equal to the proportion,

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.710
would be equal to the proportion

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.670
times how many, let's see,
the 45 square kilometers

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.290
and it contains 70 at-risk species,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.400
so times our 70 species.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.850
We can get our calculator
out to figure that out.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.030
This is the proportion we
would expect to go extinct

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.580
in the 45 square kilometer island

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.860
based on our linear regression.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.400
This would be equal to.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.170
It looks like almost 9%.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.610
If we want to figure out the actual number

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.720
we would expect to go extinct,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.030
we would just multiply that
times the number of species

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.030
on that island, so times 70, and we get

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.350
approximately about 6.11.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.743
Let me write that down.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.640
This is going to be approximately 6.11.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.150
We could say there would be approximately

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.280
if we, let's just say six extinct,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.480
and this is all very approximate.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.403
Extinct.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.710
Approximately 64 saved.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.850
Now let's think about the other scenario.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:22.950
Let's think about the scenario

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.370
where we have five small nature preserves.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.130
So it's going to be
three square kilometers

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.820
times five islands.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.690
We're gonna just do the same exercise.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.690
Our proportion that goes
extinct is gonna be 0.28996,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.800
that's just the y-intercept
for our regression line,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.800
minus 0.05323, and you
have a negative sign there

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.700
'cause we have a negative slope,

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.610
and this is not just times the area,

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.530
it's times the natural log of the area.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.950
It's going to be three square kilometers.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.363
Three square kilometers.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.980
Our number extinct,

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.330
Our number extinct

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.920
is going to be equal to our proportion

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.390
that we will calculate
in the line above times.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.223
Let's see.

00:06:14.223 --> 00:06:15.960
Five small nature preserves,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.680
each with an area of
three square kilometers

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.873
and each containing 16 at-risk species.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.010
Five times 16, if each island has 16

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.940
and there's five islands,
that's going to be,

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.834
five times 16 is 80.

00:06:27.834 --> 00:06:29.835
Times 80.

00:06:29.835 --> 00:06:31.700
Let's figure out what this is.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.150
Get the calculator out again.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.280
We are going to get.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.350
This is going to be the proportion.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.310
It's a much higher proportion.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.230
We'll multiply that times
our number of species,

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.110
so times 80 to figure out how
many species will go extinct.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.570
We have here it's approximately 18.52.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.580
This is approximately 18.52.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.690
Another way to think about it

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.310
is we're gonna have approximately.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.130
If we round let's just say
19 extinct, 19 extinct.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.700
And then if we have 19 extinct,

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.100
how many are we gonna save?

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.330
We're gonna have 61 saved.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.160
61 saved.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.670
Even if you said 18
1/2 here and 61.5 here,

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:22.670
on either measure, the 45
square, the big island is better.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.270
You're gonna have fewer
species that are extinct

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.350
and more that are saved.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.520
Which choice would you recommend and why?

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.150
I'd recommend the one large island

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.560
because you're gonna save,

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.600
you would expect to save more species,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.910
and you would expect that
fewer are going to get extinct

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.753
based on this linear regression.
