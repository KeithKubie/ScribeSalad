00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:00.949
[reading]

00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.039
'The museum is submitting proposals to several

00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:07.919
foundations in the hope to gain funds to

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.317
build a tropical butterfly conservatory.

00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:13.697
So we have either an error up here

00:00:13.697 --> 00:00:15.330
or we have no error.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.057
So the part that, as you can tell,

00:00:17.057 --> 00:00:19.287
even when I read it I had a little bit

00:00:19.287 --> 00:00:21.515
of trouble with, is when we read

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:23.065
'In the hope TO gain'.

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:25.195
Normally when you're talking about

00:00:25.205 --> 00:00:31.355
'hope' you would say 'in the hope OF'

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:34.405
whatever the hope is part of.

00:00:34.406 --> 00:00:40.016
So in this case 'in the hope of GAINING funds'.

00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:41.703
You wouldn't really say

00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:44.069
'In the hope TO gain funds'.

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:46.069
So this one I would change to

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:54.539
'In the hope of GAINING funds

00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:58.143
to build a tropical butterfly conservatory.'

00:00:58.143 --> 00:01:02.143
So I'd put the error here in D.

00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:05.943
'in the hope TO gain'

00:01:05.943 --> 00:01:08.200
You're 'in the hope OF' something

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.990
not 'in the hope TO' something.
