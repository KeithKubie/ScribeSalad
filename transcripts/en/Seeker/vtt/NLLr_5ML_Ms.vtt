00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.060
So the other day I found myself eating broccoli
and liking it, I had to stop and wonder where

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.790
did I go wrong in life?

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.419
What happened to my tastebuds?

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.119
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.730
Right now, there are thousands of tastebuds
on your tongue, some estimates say as many

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.199
as 10,000.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.770
And no you don’t have specific areas of
your tongue for certain flavors, the taste

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.949
buds are all kind of mixed together.

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.609
but what you’re seeing on your tongue, those
little bumps are little clumps of taste buds,

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.810
which each contain 50-100 taste cells, kind
of like a head of broccoli.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.539
One study got up close and personal with these
miniscule mysteries.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.110
Tastebuds look kind of like little bulbs,
little flowers, with receptor cells looking

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.289
like the petals surrounded by blood cells
which in turn is surrounded by collagen.

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.129
These taste cells take chemical signals from
the food you eat and send it to taste centers

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.129
in your brain.

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.859
Seriously, there’s a place in your brain
just for tasting called the Gustatory cortex.

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.280
Speaking of broccoli though, like when I was
little I hated broccoli, like hated it.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.280
Now I eat it raw just like potato chips, like
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.280
WHAT HAVE I BECOME?

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.280
Is this adulthood?

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.280
If it is, I don’t like it.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.280
So anyways, have my taste buds changed as
I grew up?

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.280
Well yeah, kind of.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.280
It’s no secret kids like sweet things.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.700
But maybe it’s biology.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.940
One study published in the journal Physiology
Behavior, found that growing bones release

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.860
hormones that cause children to crave the
sweets.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.650
That way their growing body get the energy
it needs.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.470
The researchers also found that that in people
whose bones stopped growing, they had less

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.680
of those hormones.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.310
So maybe that’s why adults find overly sweet
things sickening and prefer other flavors

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.530
like delicious bitter broccoli.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.830
As for your actual taste buds, well the cells
in your tastebuds don't last for long, they

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.030
change all the time.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.750
The average lifespan is anywhere from a few
days to a month.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.440
But a lot, I mean a lot of things can affect
your sense of taste.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.060
From, temperature, to altitude to music.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.210
That Gustatory cortex I mentioned takes in
information from a lot of different sources

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.210
from your other senses.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.210
Like sound, a study published in the Journal
of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.210
and Performance found that umami foods taste
better to us in loud environments, while we

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.210
can’t taste sweet things as well.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.210
And memory affects taste too.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.410
There’s a thing called conditioned taste
aversion or CTA.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.840
Most of us have experienced this, for example
my sister hates buffalo chicken dip, I mean

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.320
hates it, because a few years ago she ate
it around the same time she got a nasty stomach

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.320
flu.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.959
So now a circuit in her amygdala is like,
GIRL DO NOT EAT THAT DIP, YOU WILL GET SICK.

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.540
And a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience
found that that negative associate is particularly

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.060
strong if you’re in the same place as that
bad experience.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.130
Not to get all evolutionary psychology on
you, but that makes sense.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.549
If our ancestors wandering about savannah
came across some bad berries, they’d be

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.469
more likely to survive if their brain associated
that place and berry with throwing up or something

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:30.909
so they wouldn’t eat it again.

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.061
but on the other hand, good experiences might
make food taste better, so if you want to

00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:37.819
one day get your kid to like vegetables, make
it fun!

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.959
Like put broccoli on top of mashed potato
mountains so it looks like a little landscape..

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.459
okay yeah you know what…

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.050
I don’t think you can make vegetables fun.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.530
So no, that whole your taste buds change every
7 years is a bit of wives tale.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.400
Your taste buds change all the time, and a
lot of things affect the how something actually

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400
tastes.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.590
To learn more about how music can make you
taste things differently, check out this great

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.390
video from our friends over at BritLab, it’s
blew my mind, go watch it, i really recommend

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:28.069
it.
