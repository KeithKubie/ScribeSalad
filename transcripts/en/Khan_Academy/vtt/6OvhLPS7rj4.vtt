00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.200
In the next few videos I'm going
to embark on something

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.420
that will just result in
a formula that's pretty

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.870
straightforward to apply.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.260
And in most statistics classes,
you'll just see that

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.150
end product.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.870
But I actually want to show
how to get there.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.290
But I just want to warn
you right now.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.170
It's going to be a lot
of hairy math,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.890
most of it hairy algebra.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.290
And then we're actually going
have to do a little bit of

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.330
calculus near the end.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.970
We're going to have to do a
few partial derivatives.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.870
So if any of that sounds
daunting, or sounds like

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.290
something that will discourage
you in some way, you don't

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.950
have to watch it.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.619
You could skip to the end and
just get the formula that

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.810
we're going to derive.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.040
But I, at least, find it
pretty satisfying to

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.450
actually derive it.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.020
So what we're going to think
about here is, let's say we

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.870
have n points on a
coordinate plane.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.670
And they all don't have to
be in the first quadrant.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.420
But just for simplicity of
visualization, I'll draw them

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.740
all in the first quadarant.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.910
So let's say I have this
point right over here.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.160
Let me do them in different
colors.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.580
And that coordinate is x1, y1.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.820
And then let's say I have
another point over here.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.970
The coordinates there
are x2, y2.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.940
And then I can keep
adding points.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.710
And I could keep drawing them.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.130
We'd just have a
ton of points.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.990
There and there and there.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.090
And we go all the way
to the nth point.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.330
Maybe it's over here.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.180
And we're just going to
call that xn, yn.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.840
So we have n points here.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.120
I haven't drawn all of
the actual points.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.720
But what I want to do is find
a line that minimizes the

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.280
squared distances to these
different points.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.990
So let's think about it.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.610
Let's visualize that
line for a second.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.090
So there's going to
be some line.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.590
And I'm going to try to draw a
line that kind of approximates

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.590
what these points are doing.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.930
So let me draw this line here.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.710
So maybe the line might look
something like this.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.330
I'm going to try my best
to approximate it.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.500
Actually, let me draw it
little bit different.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.230
Maybe it looks something
like that.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.190
I don't even know what it
looks like right now.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.470
And what we want to do is
minimize this squared error

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.110
from each of these points
to the line.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.840
So let's think about
what that means.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.230
So if the equation of this line
right here is y is equal

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.760
to mx plus b.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.080
And this just comes straight
out of Algebra 1.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.800
This is the slope on the line,
and this is the y-intercept.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.120
This is actually
the point 0, b.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.780
What I want to do, and that's
what the the topic of the next

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.110
few videos are going to be, I
want to find an m and a b.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.750
So I want to find these two
things that define this line.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.060
So that it minimizes
the squared error.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.040
So let me define what
the error even is.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.050
So for each of these points, the
error between it and the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.470
line is the vertical distance.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.670
So this right here we
can call error one.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.670
And then this right here
would be error two.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.680
It would be the vertical
distance between that point

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.410
and the line.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.790
Or you can think of it as the y
value of this point and the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.500
y value of the line.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.560
And you just keep going all
the way to the endpoint

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.760
between the y value of
this point and the y

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.840
value of the line.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.060
So this error right here, error
one, if you think about

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.880
it, it is this value right
here, this y value.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.570
It's equal to y1 minus
this y value.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.830
Well what's this y value
going to be?

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.820
Well over here we have
x is equal to x1.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.970
And this point is the
point m x1 plus b.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.400
You take x1 into this equation
of the line and you're going

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.380
to get this point
right over here.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.190
So that's literally going to
be equal to m x1 plus b.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.340
That's that first error.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.450
And we can keep doing it
with all the points.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.450
This error right over here
is going to be y2

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.700
minus m x2 plus b.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.290
And then this point right
here is m x2 plus b.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.580
The value when you take
x2 into this line.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.940
And we keep going all the
way to our nth point.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:43.630
This error right here is going
to be yn minus m xn plus b.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.040
Now, so if we wanted to just
take the straight up sum of

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.460
the errors, we could just
some these things up.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.390
But what we want to do is a
minimize the square of the

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.520
error between each of these
points, each of these n points

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.040
on the line.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:07.040
So let me define the squared
error against this line as

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.030
being equal to the sum of
these squared errors.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.250
So this error right here, or
error one we could call it, is

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.110
y1 minus m x1 plus b.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.620
And we're going to square it.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.330
So this is the error
one squared.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.960
And we're going to go to
error two squared.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:36.580
Error two squared is y2
minus m x2 plus b.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.560
And then we're going to
square that error.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.100
And then we keep going, we're
going to go n spaces, or n

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.340
points I should say.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.290
We keep going all the way
to this nth error.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.690
The nth error is going to
be yn minus m xn plus b.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.705
And then we're going
to square it.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.480
So this is the squared
error of the line.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:13.870
And over the next few videos, is
I want to find the m and b

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:25.360
that minimizes the squared error
of this line right here.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.330
So if you viewed this as the
best metric for how good a fit

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.850
a line is, we're going to try to
find the best fitting line

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.220
for these points.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.610
And I'll continue in
the next video.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.120
Because I find that with these
very hairy math problems, it's

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.210
good to kind of just deliver
one concept at a time.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.750
And it also minimizes my

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.040
probability of making a mistake.
