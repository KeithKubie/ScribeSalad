Narrator: TO MAKE EACH
INLAID CABINET DOOR,

00:00:08.067 --> 00:00:10.968
A WOODWORKER GLUES THE PATTERN
ONTO THE WOOD,

00:00:10.968 --> 00:00:15.734
MAKING SURE THAT IT'S
PERFECTLY CENTERED.

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:19.567
THEN, USING A ROUTER, HE CUTS
ABOUT 3 MILLIMETERS DEEP,

00:00:19.567 --> 00:00:22.033
MAKING A GROOVE
ALONG THE PATTERN'S PERIMETER

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:23.400
AND CUTTING OUT THE PARTS

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.734
THAT WILL BE INLAID
WITH MOTHER-OF-PEARL.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:29.133
♪♪

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.367
MEANWHILE, USING ANOTHER COPY
OF THE PATTERN,

00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:35.267
A WORKER MAKES TEMPLATES
BY CUTTING OUT THE SAME PARTS

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:39.133
THE WOODWORKER ROUTED
OUT OF THE CABINET DOOR.

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:43.834
EACH TEMPLATE IS MARKED
EITHER PINK, WHITE, OR GREEN.

00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:46.400
SHE GLUES IT INTO
A 3-MILLIMETER-THICK PIECE

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.334
OF THE CORRESPONDING COLOR
OF MOTHER-OF-PEARL.

00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:54.534
THE NEXT CRAFTSPERSON
TAKES ONE PIECE AT A TIME

00:00:54.534 --> 00:00:56.934
AND, HOLDING IT STEADY
WITH PLIERS,

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:59.167
CAREFULLY SAWS
AROUND THE TEMPLATE

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:01.133
WITH A 1-MILLIMETER-WIDE BLADE.

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.634
ONCE SHE HAS CUT
ALL THE PIECES,

00:01:03.634 --> 00:01:05.834
SHE REASSEMBLES THE PATTERN.

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:09.367
THE NEXT CRAFTSPERSON
SPREADS ADHESIVE PASTE

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:11.601
INTO THE CUTOUTS
IN THE CABINET DOOR.

00:01:14.634 --> 00:01:16.567
THEN HE FILLS EACH CUTOUT

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:19.467
WITH ITS CORRESPONDING PIECE
OF MOTHER-OF-PEARL.

00:01:21.968 --> 00:01:25.734
FIVE HOURS FROM NOW,
ONCE THE ADHESIVE HAS DRIED,

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:28.234
HE RUNS A SANDER OVER THE DESIGN

00:01:28.234 --> 00:01:30.801
TO REMOVE THE PAPER
AND EXCESS ADHESIVE,

00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:34.200
SMOOTH THE WOOD,
AND POLISH THE MOTHER-OF-PEARL.

00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:41.634
THEN AN ARTIST ETCHES FINE
DETAIL INTO THE MOTHER-OF-PEARL.

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:48.801
THIS PROVIDES TEXTURE,
DIMENSION, AND EXPRESSION

00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:50.334
TO OBJECTS AND CHARACTERS

00:01:50.334 --> 00:01:55.133
WHICH, UNTIL NOW,
WERE MERELY BLANK SHAPES.
