RICK: Hey, what do we have here?

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.670
It's a, uh, antique
hand-crank key cutter.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.960
So, like, a Victorian era
James Bond would use this?

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.670
Right.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.040
[laughter]

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.670
MAN: I came to the
pawn shop today

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.880
with an antique hand-crank
key cutter looking sell it.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.460
Got the key cutter from,
uh, an estate sale.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.170
I did some research online.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.920
I wasn't able to really find
out what the key cutter was.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.210
So that's what led me to
bring it to the pawn shop

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.170
to see if I could sell it
and find out more about it.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.250
RICK: It's old.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.420
It's cool.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.080
And it's the duplicator.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.380
MAN: Correct.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.750
RICK: So do you know
anything about it?

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.750
Do you know who
manufactured it or anything?

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.540
MAN: I don't.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.250
RICK: OK.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.380
I don't think it's a key cutter.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.040
Oh, OK.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.420
RICK: Now, the reason I don't
think it's a key cutter--

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.080
MAN: Uh-huh.
RICK: --this is way too broad.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.080
This would just grind
half the key away.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.000
This was probably
designed to replicate

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.080
small parts of some kind.
- OK.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.210
RICK: Or maybe even
small wood pieces.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.330
What you do-- you put a little
piece of metal in here--

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.880
MAN: OK.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.710
RICK: --smaller than the
penny, actually, or longer.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.380
And you know, it's
plain and simple.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.790
I mean, it's just, as you're
turning this crank grinding

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.080
into your piece of
metal right here,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.620
you just follow that
piece right there.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.380
MAN: So this would
be, like, the guide.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.120
RICK: And that just guides you
over whatever you're doing.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.790
It's a cool little machine tool.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.750
You want to sell it?

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.580
MAN: I do.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.620
OK.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.620
And how much do you want for it?

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.620
Uh, I was looking for $1,000.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.710
Well, have a nice day.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.540
Even if it was a key cutter,
it wouldn't be worth that.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.710
MAN: OK.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.750
I mean, you can
get key cutters--

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.250
MAN: Sure.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.540
--with electric motors
for a lot, lot less money.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.080
But those aren't
antiques though.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.540
Just because
something's antique

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.580
doesn't make it worth money.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.250
I'm really old.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.290
My kids, you know, don't think
I'm worth a lot of dimes.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.830
It's not that rare and
it's not that desirable.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.500
You could probably put it online
and you might get 20 bucks.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.170
It's just not that special.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.330
OK, yeah, I'll keep it.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.920
I paid more than that for it.
So--

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.250
MAN: OK.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.250
Well, thanks for coming in.
- All right.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.460
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.750
- It was cool though.
- Thank you.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.330
- You can keep the penny.
- Thank you.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.330
[laughter]

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.670
MAN: I totally disagree.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.330
I think it's a cool piece.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
I think that there's definitely
a market out there for it.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
And I think it's worth a
whole lot more than $20.
