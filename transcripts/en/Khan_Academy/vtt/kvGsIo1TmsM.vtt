00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.860
A function-- and I'm
going to speak about it

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.350
in very abstract terms right
now-- is something that

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.134
will take an input, and
it'll munch on that input,

00:00:11.134 --> 00:00:13.050
it'll look at that input,
it will do something

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.010
to that input.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.230
And based on what that input is,
it will produce a given output.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.200
What is an example
of a function?

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.940
I could have something
like f of x-- and x

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.200
tends to be the variable
most used for an input

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.200
into the function.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.100
And the name of a
function, f tends

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.650
to be the most-used variable.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.680
But we'll see that you can
use others-- is equal to,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.360
let's say, x squared,
if x is even.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:59.680
And let's say it is equal
to x plus 5, if x is odd.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.960
What would happen if we
input 2 into this function?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.910
The way that we would
denote inputting 2

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.730
is that we would want
to evaluate f of 2.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.760
This is saying, let's input
2 into our function f.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.660
And everywhere we
see this x here,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.320
this variable-- you can kind
of use as a placeholder-- let's

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.390
replace it with our input.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.980
So let's see.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.810
If 2 is even, do 2 squared.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.870
If 2 is odd, do 2 plus 5.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.670
Well, 2 is even, so we're
going to do 2 squared.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.250
In this case, f of 2 is
going to be 2 squared, or 4.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.540
Now what would f of 3 be?

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.640
Well, once again, everywhere
we see this variable,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.135
we'll replace it with our input.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.950
So f of 3, 3 squared if 3 is
even, 3 plus 5 if 3 is odd.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.390
Well, 3 is odd, so it's
going to be 3 plus 5.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.670
It is going to be equal to 8.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.200
You might say, OK,
that's neat, Sal.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.790
This was kind of
an interesting way

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.139
to define a function, a way to
kind of munch on these numbers.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.217
But I could have done this
with traditional equations

00:02:12.217 --> 00:02:13.800
in some way, especially
if you allowed

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.140
me to use the squirrelly
bracket thing.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.710
What can a function do that
maybe my traditional toolkits

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.160
might have not been
as expressive about?

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.880
Well, you could even do
a function like this.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.790
Let me not use f
and x anymore, just

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.800
to show you that the notation
is more general than that.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:47.050
I could say h of a is equal to
the next largest number that

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:57.886
starts with the same
letter as variable a.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.330
And we're going to assume
that we're dealing in English.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.930
Given that, what is
h of 2 going to be?

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.890
Well, 2 starts with a T.
What's the next largest

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.210
number that starts with a T?

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.610
Well, it's going
to be equal to 3.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.210
Now what would h of-- I don't
know, let's think about this,

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.990
h of 8 be equal to?

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.570
Well, 8 starts with an E.
The next largest number

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.400
that starts with an E-- it's
not 9, 10-- it would be 11.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.100
And so now you see it's a
very, very, very general tool.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.630
This h function that we just
defined, we'll look at it.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.500
We'll look at the
letter that the number

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.869
starts with in English.

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:49.910
So it's doing this really,
really, really, really

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.990
wacky thing.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.070
Now not all functions
have to be this wacky.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.950
In fact, you have already
been dealing with functions.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.340
You have seen things like
y is equal to x plus 1.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.080
This can be viewed
as a function.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.520
We could write this
as y is a function

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.760
of x, which is
equal to x plus 1.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.390
If you give as an
input-- let me write

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:23.650
it this way-- for example,
when x is 0 we could say f of 0

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.710
is equal to, well, you take 0.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.830
You add 1.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.440
It's equal to 1.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.447
f of 2 is equal to 2.

00:04:30.447 --> 00:04:31.780
You've already done this before.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.760
You've done things
where you said, look,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.250
let me make a table of
x and put our y's there.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.230
When x is 0, y is 1.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.990
I'm sorry.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.150
I made a little mistake.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.660
Where f of 2 is equal to 3.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.920
And you've done this before
with tables where you say,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.470
look, x and y.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.650
When x is 0, y is 1.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.151
When x is 2, y is 3.

00:04:57.151 --> 00:04:59.400
You might say, well, what
was the whole point of using

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.310
the function
notation here to say

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.820
f of x is equal to x plus 1?

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.390
The whole point is to think
in these more general terms.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.140
For something like
this, you didn't really

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.417
have to introduce
function notations.

00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:14.000
But it doesn't hurt to introduce
function notations because it

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.820
makes it very clear that
the function takes an input,

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.520
takes my x-- in this
definition it munches on it.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.500
It says, OK, x plus 1.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.080
And then it produces
1 more than it.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.460
So here, whatever the input
is, the output is 1 more

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.100
than that original function.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.350
Now I know what you're asking.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.850
All right.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.210
Well, what is not
a function then?

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.750
Well, remember,
we said a function

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.850
is something that takes an
input and produces only one

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.130
possible output for
that given input.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.580
For example-- and let
me look at a visual way

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.100
of thinking about a function
this time, or a relationship,

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.190
I should say-- let's
say that's our y-axis,

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.463
and this right over
here is our x-axis.

00:05:58.241 --> 00:06:05.720
Let me draw a circle
here that has radius 2.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.950
So it's a circle of radius 2.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.300
This is negative 2.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.120
This is positive 2.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.730
This is negative 2.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.940
So my circle, it's
centered at the origin.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.330
It has radius 2.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.560
That's my best attempt
at drawing the circle.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.920
Let me fill it in.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.100
So this is a circle.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.070
The equation of
this circle is going

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.370
to be x squared plus y squared
is equal to the radius squared,

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.360
is equal to 2 squared,
or it's equal to 4.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.027
The question is, is this
relationship between x and y--

00:06:34.027 --> 00:06:35.610
here I've expressed
it as an equation.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.020
Here I've visually drawn all
of the x's and y's that satisfy

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.220
this equation-- is this
relationship between x

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.280
and y a function?

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.060
And we can see
visually that it's not

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.280
going to be a function.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.850
You pick a given x.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.820
Let's say x is equal to 1.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.150
There's two possible y's
that are associated with it,

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.237
this y up here and
this y down here.

00:07:00.237 --> 00:07:02.570
We could even solve for that
by looking at the equation.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.210
When x is equal to 1, we
get 1 squared plus y squared

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.073
is equal to 4.

00:07:07.073 --> 00:07:11.390
1 plus y squared is equal to 4.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.720
Or subtracting 1 from both
sides, y squared is equal to 3.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.830
Or y is equal to the positive or
the negative square root of 3.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.720
This right over here is the
positive square root of 3,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.700
and this right over here is
the negative square root of 3.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.810
So this situation,
this relationship

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:34.130
where I inputted a 1
into my little box here,

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.680
and associated with
the 1, I associate

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.510
both a positive square root of
3 and a negative square root

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:47.000
of 3, this is not a function.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.540
I cannot associate with my
input two different outputs.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:56.240
I can only have one
output for a given input.
