00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:04.666
(funky electronic music)

00:00:26.078 --> 00:00:27.930
- Welcome to a Conversation with History,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.990
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.530
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.590
Our guest today is the
distinguished anthropologist

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.250
Talal Asad, who is the 2008

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.280
Foerster Lecturer on the Berkeley campus.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.150
Professor Asad, welcome to Berkeley.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.120
- Thank you very much.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.040
- Where were you born and raised?

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.040
- Well, I was born in
Saudi Arabia, actually,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.800
because my mother comes from there

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.180
and my parents moved when
I was a couple of years old

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.160
to India, and then eventually to Pakistan.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.563
So, I was raised both in
India and in Pakistan.

00:01:01.517 --> 00:01:04.184
(missing audio)

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.530
Well, in very different ways.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.500
My mother was a very traditional woman.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.500
My father actually was an Austrian Jew

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.980
who had converted to Islam in his twenties

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.380
and was a correspondent,
a foreign correspondent

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.430
for the Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.453
and for the Neue Zurcher Zeitung as well.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.177
In the 30s, he had to
give up the first one,

00:01:38.177 --> 00:01:41.943
the Frankfurt one, because he
was not allowed to continue.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.790
And he was very interested
in the Middle East.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.830
And that was where he
eventually settled for six years

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.033
in Saudi Arabia, married my mother,

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.350
and moved on to India,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.570
partly for reasons, journalistic reasons,

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.630
but also because he had
friends who urged him to come.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.630
So, the question about what,
how they shaped my views,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.260
well, certainly my father
was much more aware of,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.880
as it were, a European heritage,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.880
as well as the heritage
of the Middle East,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.523
to which he was very attracted.

00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:31.540
And although he had
relatives, mother's relatives,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.480
in Palestine at the time, in
the 20s, he was born in 1900.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.720
- And he converted when?

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.780
- [Talal] And he converted
in his mid-twenties.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.850
- I see.
- And he died in 1992 in Spain

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.783
and he's buried there.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.150
But, he was always really
a strong anti-Zionist.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.110
He felt that this was a great mistake,

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.370
even before he became,
before he was converted.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.010
- So, what I'm hearing you say

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.090
is you must have gotten a real sense

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.280
of the diversity of the world

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.510
and the complexity of the world from them.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.280
- Absolutely, and I was a child,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.720
but my father was interned during the war,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.743
as an Austrian citizen,
even though he was a Jew,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.140
by the British, it was, of course,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.860
British India at the time.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.143
And I was a child,

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.740
but most of the people
there during those years

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.110
were, in fact, from Central Europe,

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.670
who'd been brought together.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.700
So, I have memories of them, as well.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.700
And then, shortly after the
war, we went to the Punjab,

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.263
which became Pakistan.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.030
And, you know, I was very much aware

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.740
of many of the things that were going on

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.810
politically there, as well.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.480
My father was quite active intellectually

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.090
in Pakistan, as well.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.880
- And were you raised in the Islamic?

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.023
- I was indeed, yes, very much so.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.175
My mother being a very pious woman

00:04:06.175 --> 00:04:09.453
who is not at all an intellectual,

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.550
but who, in some ways, looking back on it,

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.550
I can see that her
approach to her religion,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.180
in some ways, unconsciously made me aware

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.020
of different approaches

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.923
and that is of an unreflective,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.050
what people have called an
embodied approach to religion,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.760
rather than a highly intellectualized one.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.850
My mother was not an
intellectual, of course.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.190
- So, the religion is really
part of the way people live.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.023
Is that right?

00:04:44.023 --> 00:04:44.860
- That's right, exactly.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.108
That was certainly so.

00:04:47.108 --> 00:04:48.052
And it was certainly for, for my father,

00:04:48.052 --> 00:04:51.320
it was even more an
intellectual matter too.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.320
He thought of this as a kind
of an intellectual promise,

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.710
so to speak, of Islam as a way of living

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.453
within a community and
within a political community

00:05:05.453 --> 00:05:06.286
and so on.

00:05:06.286 --> 00:05:09.620
- I believe I read
somewhere that, as a Muslim,

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.610
you were actually, were you
educated among Christians

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.443
- in a school.
- That's right.

00:05:13.443 --> 00:05:15.558
- And that must have been a kind of

00:05:15.558 --> 00:05:20.558
another layer of a
sensitivity to diversity.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.593
- Very much so.

00:05:24.087 --> 00:05:26.060
It was a boarding school

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.013
and the teachers were
British missionaries there.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.627
And I can remember being
a very obstreperous boy

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.570
who was determined to, as it were,

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.070
hold on to his own religious identity

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.500
among others who were mostly Christians.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.411
But, you know,

00:05:48.411 --> 00:05:52.940
it wasn't a very conflictual
situation in school,

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.800
I don't want to suggest that.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.700
But certainly, difference
was, you're right,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.990
was very much a part
of my early experience.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.620
- And how did your education

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.170
beyond, you know, these first schools,

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.280
but more your advanced
education in England,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.163
impact your future scholarship?

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.350
- Well, I came to England at the age of 18

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.350
and I was, in fact, going
to become an architect.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.350
That was my father's choice.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.480
He decided for various reasons,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.223
because he was also perhaps
an architect manque.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.540
He thought a, it was
a wonderful profession

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.550
and b, he thought I needed a
certain amount of discipline

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.630
as well as an opportunity to be creative

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.640
and what could be better
than being an architect?

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.250
So, he chose for me the profession.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.240
I went to London and did architecture,

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.850
not very successfully,
because my heart wasn't in it,

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.960
for two years in the
Architectural Association

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.873
School of Architecture in London.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.283
But, I really wanted to
be an anthropologist.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.175
And then I went off to that,

00:07:11.175 --> 00:07:13.028
took my own decision

00:07:13.028 --> 00:07:16.023
and went and did
architecture at Edinburgh,

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.660
sorry, anthropology at Edinburgh.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.660
I left architecture.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.870
And after that I went to Oxford

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.020
where I did both my
first postgraduate degree

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.230
and my Dphil, the PhD, in Oxford.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.260
- And did you focus on religious studies

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.990
and what was your dissertation on?

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.453
- No, not at all.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.030
You know, I had to some degree,

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.380
although I was brought up

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.980
in a sort of a fairly
conventional religious way,

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.960
perhaps not quite so
conventional, obviously,

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.890
because given my parents' background.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:01.890
But, I had to some extent revolted

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.593
and felt myself to be,

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.870
to have lost my faith already

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.683
at the age of about 14 and so on.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.893
And I wanted very much to come to Europe,

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.300
which I regarded as a source
of all the wonderful things

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.109
that seemed somehow not to be present

00:08:28.109 --> 00:08:31.303
in Pakistan at the time.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:36.210
And I remember that my father
tried to, in his own way,

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:40.910
to disabuse me of some of my
ideas, which were rather naive.

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:45.910
But nevertheless, he
allowed me to go to Europe,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.380
which was interesting.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.730
And indeed he, you know,

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.460
he even encouraged me when I was a boy

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.860
to try and learn the piano
and things like that.

00:08:59.992 --> 00:09:03.447
And European music is something
which I'm extremely fond of

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.433
and still am deeply fond of.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:14.300
But, going to Europe was, for me,

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:21.610
both something which was
exciting to arrive at

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.320
and, at the same time,
as I've said to friends,

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.270
a kind of a slow disabusement,

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:35.270
because I sort of had clearly
had ideals, and so on,

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:41.100
which were very misplaced in
terms of what actually existed.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:48.870
But, my intention to do anthropology

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.020
was part of a, if you like,
a purely secular choice

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.860
and I eventually did fieldwork

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.310
in a pastoral nomadic society

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:04.310
in the deserts of
northern Sudan in the 60s.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.650
And it didn't deal with religion at all.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.900
It had to do with their economy

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.410
and their political system, primarily,

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.680
their local political system.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.610
- Were there any particular
political awakenings

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.120
that you had in the 60s?

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.420
I mean, coming from this background

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.910
where you must have sensed,
however young you were,

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.690
the turmoil in the Pakistan region

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:36.583
and then coming to your
mature years of education

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.800
in the 60s.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.350
What stands out?

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:49.063
- Well, I think one of the moments,

00:10:49.063 --> 00:10:54.063
a very important moment in my life

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.040
was the '67 war.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.040
And I've written about this elsewhere

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.210
or spoken about it, anyway.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.620
It was very traumatic for me

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.960
in the sense that I
couldn't quite understand

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.960
the reaction of so many people in Britain

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.080
to what had happened

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:21.930
and a kind of exaltation
on the part of the British,

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:27.633
which I thought was inexplicable to me.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.140
As I've said elsewhere,

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.440
I think I could understand

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.300
that the Israelis might
have felt, you know,

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:38.530
very pleased with the fact of the victory,

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:43.530
but why were the British so
enormously satisfied with it

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:50.460
and emotionally pleased?

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.640
So, and that had to do with, of course,

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.930
their earlier experiences.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.160
Particularly the '56 war

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.580
and their sense of
humiliation at that time,

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.423
when they were obliged,
you remember, to withdraw.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.530
And some of that came back

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.350
and that was very important for me

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:12.950
and it also made me
think much more seriously

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.410
about the entire colonial experience,

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:21.410
which British society still
somehow retained in part.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.860
- I wanna ask you about
being an anthropologist,

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.270
but what you just said is
maybe a lead-in to this,

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.695
because as an anthropologist,

00:12:32.695 --> 00:12:36.310
one thing that stands out in
the work of yours that I read

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.960
is your sensitivity to power

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.250
and the relationships of power

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:45.210
between the former colonial powers

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.280
and their former dependencies.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.023
And it strikes me that what you just said,

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.160
was that an entree
point into this insight?

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.730
That is, with your background,

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.960
sort of being surprised by the exaltation

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.090
and then, sort of thinking about that?

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.620
- Yeah, I think that's
a very good question.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:08.620
Because I was certainly aware of power

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.460
in a very general sense

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.530
and aware of the history of colonialism.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.750
But, the way in which it seemed to work

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.760
within the psyche, if you like,

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.760
of people both individually
and collectively,

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:29.010
was something that I felt
was much more important

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.440
than I had realized.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.440
And, you know, as I said,
when I came to Britain,

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.100
I was also enormously enamored

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:45.100
of what one might call an
enlightenment kind of culture,

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.160
which I thought I would find.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:52.160
And I was enormously anticipatory

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.620
with regard to ideas of equality

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.490
and justice and rationality and so on.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:03.052
You know, held rather naively, of course,

00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:07.290
as a boy in my late teens.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.350
But, nevertheless, very powerfully.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.920
And in some ways I think

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:17.450
what my engagement with or
my concern for power has been

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:24.250
is a kind of complexification
of those understandings.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.190
So, at first, I thought

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.290
my goodness, how can this be

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:36.640
that this is the culture which
believes in all these things

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.710
and compassion and so forth.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.463
And yet, it seems not to do that.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:44.940
But then, of course, as I've said,

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.780
I had to reinvent the wheel

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.560
by recognizing that, you
know, all sorts of cultures,

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.640
all cultures, in a sense,

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.640
are capable of bias of
different kinds, every culture.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:01.237
So, the idea that there
was one culture out there

00:15:01.237 --> 00:15:03.350
which would be without it

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.633
was, in my view, very naive.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.480
- A theme that runs through your work

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.590
is the power of concepts

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:18.320
and often, how they are
derived from power relations.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.320
And how those concepts
then obscure the realities

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.953
both of the conceiver and
the object of the conception,

00:15:28.544 --> 00:15:30.010
so to speak.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:35.010
Is that a fair, maybe simple, statement

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.640
about some of the things
that have interested you?

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.223
- Yes, I suppose it's
one way of putting it.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.810
But, I think of power, now certainly,

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:52.800
not simply as repressive and exploitative.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.440
I think of it also as something

00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.440
which is an opportunity to
create, to rebuild, and so on.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.115
And the relationship between
these two emotions of power,

00:16:07.115 --> 00:16:08.915
as it were, repressive and creative,

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.430
it is what fascinates me

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:15.820
and is certainly very involved.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:20.820
The ideas, the concepts
which interest me, therefore,

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:27.120
are both concepts that
obscure the possibility

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.370
of some kind of resistance

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:31.690
as well as the possibility

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:35.540
of some kind of creativity, as well.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:40.540
So, I do agree that that's
not an unreasonable way

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.250
of describing things,

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:47.970
of looking at the way in which

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.690
these concepts are put together,

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.310
in which we've received, in our culture,

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:57.310
and which in some ways are
not adequately and critically

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.893
and from a distance examined.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.520
- I'm curious, what, in
the kind of work you do,

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.170
what do you, what conclusions do you have

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.010
about the skills that are required

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:13.653
to do the kind of
anthropology that you do well?

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.404
One thing that strikes me
is sensitivity to culture,

00:17:19.404 --> 00:17:20.960
the different cultures.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.330
What else?
- Well, certainly

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:24.490
with languages.
- Yeah.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:25.830
- You have to have languages

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:30.350
which are necessary for
what, I mean, as a medium,

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:33.560
both in the field where you're working

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.560
but also, at the same,
of other perspectives,

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.310
even within the West, as it were,

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.239
you know, to recognize that

00:17:42.239 --> 00:17:45.133
there are different national
traditions, as well.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:51.650
I think the ability to
listen is very important.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:55.030
I don't know that that's the kind of skill

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:59.450
that can be very sort of
systematically or formally learned.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:04.450
But it's certainly has
become easier for me,

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.380
both through teaching,
particularly through teaching,

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.593
and through field work.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.450
And I think that that's absolutely crucial

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.220
for the anthropologist.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.081
To be able to listen, as it were,

00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:22.990
without too many presuppositions

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:29.610
and being open to arriving at conclusions

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.110
that might be quite startling, eventually,

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:34.690
when you arrive at them.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.920
But, not think that you have an answer.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.300
I'm giving you a really,

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.450
perhaps not quite the answer you want.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:41.560
- No.
- About skills, but.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.030
- Yeah, well, but that, this is, I should

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.040
maybe I should have phrased
the question better.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.624
But, that's the answer I wanted.

00:18:47.624 --> 00:18:48.457
- [Talal] I see.

00:18:48.457 --> 00:18:50.410
- Whether I gave you the right question.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:53.630
Now, how does the student and the scholar

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.940
transcend the biases that
come out of their own culture?

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.873
That would seem to be a big problem.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.110
- It is a big problem

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:05.890
and certainly, you know,
I don't think any of us

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.364
can completely overcome our biases

00:19:09.364 --> 00:19:14.364
and the formation that
has made us what we are.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.440
But, insofar as one can try

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.747
by encountering very different
kinds of cultural phenomena,

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:31.090
very different kinds of human
beings in different societies,

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:38.110
and demand of oneself that one listen,

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.230
as I said a moment ago,

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:45.680
and that one try and question

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.763
not only what one finds out there,

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:54.750
to question also oneself.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.950
I mean, I'm a great believer in criticism

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:02.530
and a criticism which I
think should not be confined

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.694
only to, as it were,

00:20:04.694 --> 00:20:08.060
the cultural phenomena that we encounter,

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:12.713
but also our own
criticism, self-criticism.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.550
I don't know, one can only try

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:21.030
and of course, we won't
completely succeed, I'm convinced.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.603
But, we can try and question ourselves.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.130
- If one looks at your works,

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.630
it's very clear

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.070
that they're steeped
in comparative studies,

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.993
comparative theory,
interdisciplinary work,

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:43.130
and combining that all with a sensitivity

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:48.130
to the complexity of a
particular setting and so on.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.730
Talk a little about that.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:54.590
I know you've worked on
reform in Egypt and religion

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:58.810
and what emerges is a
much more complex picture

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:02.680
of what the interface between modernity

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.270
and what the West would call
modernity versus tradition.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.520
- Right, well you know,

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.410
one of the things I've been very struck by

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:16.260
and I'll come back to, more
directly, to your question

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.093
in a minute,

00:21:17.093 --> 00:21:21.720
but is, as I put it,

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.270
that within the West

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:30.270
there is much more argument,
much more difference

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.710
about what modernity means.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.740
And what it entails, how one gets to it,

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.713
or what its problems,
its primary problems are.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:48.630
Too often, partly because it's
a presentation of Westerners

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.193
who have, as it were,

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:57.130
directed their words to
the non-Western world

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.200
and also, as a consequence,

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.470
people in the non-Western world.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:05.423
There seems to be what I call
a single face to modernity.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:08.750
I mean, this is no
longer entirely the case.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.650
I know that there are all
sorts of developments going on,

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:15.970
especially in East Asia
and South Asia, and so on.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.270
But, there is a lingering sense here

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:23.930
of, you know, we know what
modernity is, modernity

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.330
and we know how to get there

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.873
and it's quite different
from our tradition.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.360
I think in the West,
one doesn't think that.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.643
One recognizes how
important traditions are,

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:43.610
all intellectual traditions
are traditions, first of all,

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.670
we work through and we rethink them,

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:47.810
but they're still traditions

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.120
and we think of them in

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.080
or we try to think of them in a modern,

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.483
i.e. contemporary way.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:23:01.210
So, I would say that the
question of, you know,

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:08.830
the very different kinds
of approaches to modernity,

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:13.830
for me requires an exploration
of kinds of knowledge

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.610
from very different disciplines,

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:23.610
both Western disciplines,
if one might call them that.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:26.050
I'm not very happy with that,

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.780
but still, you know roughly what I mean.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:33.780
And the more traditional
disciplines in the Middle East,

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:39.190
theology, law, say Islamic
law, Islamic theology and so on

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:45.370
are I think very important to get into.

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:49.290
As well as the different
opportunities in the disciplines

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:53.163
that we have in our liberal institutions.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:58.630
- I'm looking here at the
definition in your book

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.640
and I'll show the book, the
Formations of the Secular.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.530
And just as an autobiographical note,

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:07.517
you say, "Modernity is a project

00:24:07.517 --> 00:24:10.407
"or rather, a series
of interlinked projects

00:24:10.407 --> 00:24:13.007
"that certain people in
power seek to achieve.

00:24:13.007 --> 00:24:16.170
"The project aims at,"
and then you list the

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.750
and what just sort of struck me was

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:22.390
many of these things must
have been in your mind's eye

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.160
when you came to England,

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.274
thinking that you had
found a secular Mecca.

00:24:27.274 --> 00:24:28.107
- [Talal] And a modern, yes.

00:24:28.107 --> 00:24:30.290
- Yes, yeah, so.
- Absolutely, yes.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:31.610
- And in another place,

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:33.720
and I can't unfortunately
find the quote right now,

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:38.720
you mentioned that we forget
that the notion of modernity

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.450
that the West has come up with

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:47.450
really emerges out of a
particular time in our history

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.240
when we made a transformation

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.200
and we forget that

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:56.200
and then want to apply the
concept that emerged from that

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.920
to other peoples who come from

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.000
different practices and
different histories.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.300
- Exactly, I think that that's very true

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.360
and that is, of course,

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:11.360
part of the reason why
we find so many problems,

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.580
both social and political,

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.963
in that part of the world.

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.203
Indeed, we sometimes, you might say,

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:25.620
some of these problems
arise here too in the West,

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.443
whether it's the United States or Europe.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.750
For some people,

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:34.580
the idea of modernity
is quite straightforward

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.640
and certain things must be rejected

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.333
if one is to be truly modern.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.350
And then, for other people, not so.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.840
You know, one has seen arguments

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.980
about the British political system.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.440
No doubt you're familiar
with these arguments,

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.270
which say, well of
course, the British system

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.570
is not completely modern yet

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.800
because, you know, the Church of England

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.330
still has a certain important place

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:05.190
in the British government and
you can't call that modern.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.520
Because in a modern state,

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.003
and here we think of either
the United States or France,

00:26:11.003 --> 00:26:13.883
both very different kinds
of secular arrangements,

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.513
in which, in some ways,

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.630
the religion is at least
politically intended

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.190
to be kept out.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:24.930
So, but I'm not sure that
it's a good description, say,

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:26.560
of the British system

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.080
to say it's not modern.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:33.080
This presupposes a single model.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:38.480
The question is, is it the
kind of society that is,

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:43.820
that produces obstacles in the
path of various developments

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.280
which we think of as valuable or not?

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.980
Rather than, is it modern or not?

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.550
I mean, that's why I'm a little leery

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:58.400
of the idea of modernity as well.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.501
- And you go on to point out in this book

00:27:02.501 --> 00:27:07.501
that the theory makes the assumption

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:11.630
that it's a binary choice,
that it's one or the other.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:16.430
And you're trying to help us understand

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.924
that there's much greater complexity

00:27:18.924 --> 00:27:23.320
and in a way, I think you're suggesting

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.560
that you can't actually understand

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.210
what's going on in a place like Egypt

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:33.800
and how it reformed itself
in religious matters

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:38.800
and how this interface between
what came from the outside,

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:43.030
interface with kind of living practices

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.513
and a living religion.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:50.470
- Yeah, this is absolutely
true as far as, you know,

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.560
my work on Egypt is concerned.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.780
This is what I've tried to do

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:01.340
and I think of this as an anthropology

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:05.020
which is, I think,
appropriate for our time.

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.610
By which I don't mean it's
the only thing that one can do

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.480
as an anthropologist,

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.070
but I think it's very
important to be able to

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:19.000
somehow tackle the question
of various interconnections,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.850
as well as distinctions.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.710
But in ways that are not binary,

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:28.090
as you've just rightly quoted.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:31.670
Because I think that the
language that we use,

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:33.230
that everybody uses,

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:37.850
makes for very different possibilities

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:41.090
of interpretation and of living

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:48.350
and therefore, binaries are a rigid way

00:28:48.667 --> 00:28:51.770
of approaching these problems.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:56.093
I think it's a mistake to
even think of, you know,

00:28:56.093 --> 00:29:00.580
the secular and the religious
in strictly binary terms.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.610
I think that there are all
sorts of interpenetrations,

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.820
especially if you look at it historically,

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.580
as well as cross-culturally.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:11.360
That you see that there
are various connections,

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:16.360
various transmutations of
concepts, of modes of behavior,

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.500
of organizations, and so on.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.977
- Mmmhmm, you write, "In
an interdependent world,

00:29:23.977 --> 00:29:27.657
"traditional cultures do not
spontaneously grow or develop

00:29:27.657 --> 00:29:29.087
"into modern cultures.

00:29:29.087 --> 00:29:32.307
"People are pushed, seduced,
coerced, and persuaded

00:29:32.307 --> 00:29:34.367
"into trying to change themselves

00:29:34.367 --> 00:29:36.537
"into something else, something new

00:29:36.537 --> 00:29:39.020
"that allows them to be redeemed."

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:42.760
I'm curious because, of
course, this is an insight

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.850
into what's going on in
the developing world,

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:49.280
but one could almost apply this
to the United States itself

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:54.280
and the way our secular modern
elites have been shocked

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.170
by the revival of religion in this country

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:00.170
and the way it seeks to
intrude into politics.

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:05.170
- Right, yeah, I'm still
learning about the United States

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.640
and the problem, or the problems,

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.283
that people see of
secularity and religion,

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:21.010
but certainly, I think
there is a greater awareness

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:23.520
among various people

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.350
of a complexity which we have overlooked.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:32.350
So that one can try to work
out ways of accommodating

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:38.270
a certain kind of multiplicity
and of interconnection,

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:43.270
without allowing this to be repressive

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.775
of individuals or of traditions and so on.

00:30:46.775 --> 00:30:50.390
And this is very difficult
in any culture, certainly.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.330
In the Middle East, as well.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.720
You have forces which are repressive

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.533
and you have forces which are opening up.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.840
And it's not always easy

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.250
and I say this not as a
criticism, but as a fact,

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.530
not easy for people to know,

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.470
certainly in the Middle East,

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:10.903
where they should be going.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.720
And what, as it were,

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.720
a more adequate and reasonable
and just development

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.600
of a tradition

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.360
in moments of change might be.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.713
So, and I think that
this is true here too.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.570
You know, people are on the one hand

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:38.210
worried by certain developments

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:43.210
in the demand for the intrusion
of religion into politics.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.600
But in other ways,

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.370
they do recognize that
there are some aspects

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:51.020
of what we call religion

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:56.020
which somehow could have
a place, as it were,

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:57.523
in the public square.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:59.423
But how to do-

00:31:59.423 --> 00:32:00.870
- And the important thing here,

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:02.630
which we should say for our audience,

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:07.630
is that secularity, being secular,

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:09.260
defines a world

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:13.210
in which religion is separated
from the public space

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:18.210
and the two, although
side by side, do not meet.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.950
And what we are encountering in the world

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:24.120
and here at home is

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.900
the concept doesn't work completely.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.710
- Right, right and I think on this

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:34.710
one finds ways in which one
can address that difficulty.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:42.163
You know, the outcome will
often be rather unpleasant.

00:32:43.067 --> 00:32:45.540
And I do think that it's necessary

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.990
not just to keep insisting on
a straightforward separation

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:53.550
of two things, which are
themselves very ambiguous,

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:58.210
religion on the one side
and secularity on the other,

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:03.210
but to recognize that there have to be,

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:09.560
one must analyze out what
the implications of each are,

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.480
to what extent elements of each

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:16.813
can be changed,
accommodated, made to answer

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:23.530
for its own claims.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:24.960
And I think that this can apply

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.110
to both secularity and religion.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:34.110
- And a place where this
problem emerges very strongly

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:38.930
is in Europe today as it deals
with its Muslim communities.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:43.740
- Absolutely, yes, it's a matter of both

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.970
of great interest to me,

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:49.340
as to what's happening in Europe,

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.540
and at the same time
of considerable dismay

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:57.540
that Europe has become
so rigid in many respects

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:00.720
and so fearful, really,

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.623
of a population that is, on the whole,

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:06.710
initially not at all,

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:08.733
should not be seen as threatening.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.740
While elements might be,

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:13.520
but I don't think that the majority

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.023
should be seen in this way.

00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:18.327
And there are ways of
accommodating and some are more,

00:34:18.327 --> 00:34:22.500
and some states and some national
traditions are very rigid.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:27.500
The French one, of course,
is famously, extremely rigid

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:33.393
about accommodating certain
kinds of religious differences.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.750
- For example, the
veiling, the hijab, yes.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:37.890
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:41.080
But you know, many people often forget

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:46.080
that the French who are
supposed to be so fiercely laic

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.530
are also able to accommodate

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:52.510
religious schools, Catholic schools,

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.963
which have a place within the
government educational system.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.950
And it's possible for people
to do whatever they like,

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:04.520
including cover their head and
so on, in religious schools.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.890
But, not in government schools.

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:08.040
I mean, there's a degree of, you know,

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.110
a contradiction and incoherence

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:14.160
in our approaches to secularism,

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.690
in Europe as well as,
perhaps, in the United States.

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:22.690
- You write that when
Europe or the West errs

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:29.250
in its overemphasis or
overstatement of its own modernity

00:35:29.377 --> 00:35:32.484
that you write, "The
belief that human beings

00:35:32.484 --> 00:35:37.480
"can be separated from their
histories and traditions

00:35:40.257 --> 00:35:43.807
"makes it possible to
urge a Europeanization

00:35:43.807 --> 00:35:45.070
"of the Islamic world."

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:50.070
And you're really suggesting
that is gonna create problems?

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:51.700
Are you suggesting that?

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:56.440
Or what are the implications
beyond an insensitivity

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.760
to the reality of people

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.523
that one presumably
would want to integrate?

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.610
- Well, in the first place, yeah,

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:07.730
I think that there are
problems that will arise

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:09.333
and have already arisen.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.050
The problems are partly also the result

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:17.550
of certain claims, historical claims

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:22.550
that liberal Europe has
about degrees of autonomy,

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:27.320
degrees of, as it were,
self-determination,

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.840
which are not simply political,

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.610
but also social, cultural,
and psychological, and so on.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:38.940
How is it that these ideas

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:43.940
which were regarded as basic
to Europe's inheritance

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:47.240
have now suddenly become
difficult to apply

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.090
and you have to have one model?

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:52.260
I think that integration, in other words,

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.810
is something that requires

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.390
a certain amount of give and take.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:02.423
The nations of Europe,
as in the United States,

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:07.210
have never been stable, stationary.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:08.680
They have evolved over time.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.583
We know this.

00:37:10.583 --> 00:37:14.120
But, this very banal fact
tends to be forgotten,

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.470
time and again.

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:18.540
That, you know, if we are changing

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:23.540
then we can't rigidly say
there is just our way of life,

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:27.830
which must stand forever and unchanged.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:30.880
But, also something in
which one can give and take

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.793
and at a reasonable level.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:39.003
And that should apply, I
think, to immigrants as well.

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:44.630
- As a social scientist

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:48.420
one has to analyze the factors

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:53.420
that provide the social or
political base for this blindness

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.150
to both the inadequacy of the concept

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:01.970
and the reality of one's
own history and evolution

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:06.220
and the reality, history,
and evolution of the other,

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.100
in this case.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:10.200
- Right, well, you know,

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.970
there are clearly elements,
if you like, on both sides

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:16.860
so it's not just a question

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.400
of a straightforward
blindness on one side.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:24.400
But, I think in some ways
there's a greater responsibility

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:29.260
on the part of the party
which is much stronger

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.680
and the party which is more secure

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.540
in dealing with groups
that are less secure

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:41.540
that are expected to transform themselves.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.230
What are the origins of these?

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:46.860
I think they are largely historic.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.670
In the case of Europe,

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:52.380
the entire colonial experience

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.650
has been very strong I think.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.670
That there's no question in my mind,

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.930
both for Britain and
for France, certainly.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.593
In Germany, it's a
little more complicated,

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:05.750
because the immigrants there are not from,

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:09.720
I mean, the Germans have
never had that kind of empire

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.900
as the French and the British did.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.860
But, that's one part of it.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:19.807
And I think, if you like, that
the modern nations in Europe

00:39:22.107 --> 00:39:27.060
are not sufficiently liberal,
not sufficiently modern

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.610
one might even say, provocatively,

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:33.360
although I've criticized
that idea as a simple idea,

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.883
in not taking their own
values seriously enough.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.350
But, there are all sorts of incentives.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:47.920
For political, economic reasons,

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:52.920
it's easier to find scapegoats and so on.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.233
I often think that, in the case of Europe,

00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:01.440
I've said again, provocatively,
that it's almost as though

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.770
the Europeans now,

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:07.770
no longer able to publicly
denounce Jews and persecute them,

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:16.310
however sub rosa sort of
anti-Semitic some of them might be,

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:19.680
but, it's no longer possible
for a person in Europe

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:24.680
to be taken seriously as a
respectable public figure

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.420
and be anti-Semitic.

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:29.710
This is no longer true.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.940
This is not true, of course,
in relation to immigrants.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.000
So, there's a kind of shift, almost.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.440
It's almost, one might suggest,

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.883
because they can't any longer, as it were,

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:47.460
choose one outsider or define
one group as an outsider

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:50.830
which they did and then,
right up through the 30s,

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:52.580
which was the most terrible period,

00:40:53.906 --> 00:40:56.130
and now they have to find somebody else.

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:59.803
I mean, I'm making a
provocative formula out of it.

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:02.830
- And you're not saying
that having lost the one,

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:03.960
you have to do the other,

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.840
it just tends in that direction, right?

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.990
- In that direction.

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:10.100
Because, of course, many
people don't do that.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.550
I mean, there are lots of
very responsible people

00:41:13.616 --> 00:41:15.716
and lots of people who are warning against

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:19.680
precisely the attitude
which I've been describing

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.893
with some dismay.

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:26.020
Lots of Europeans who
have made the very points

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:27.540
that I'm making already

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.100
about it being in conflict

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:35.100
with liberal ideas, with
democratic ideas, and so on.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.560
- Let's talk now about
9/11 and look at the way

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:45.380
we've looked at this
problem of suicide bombing.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.860
And let me show you, the audience,

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.890
your book on suicide bombing,

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:53.540
which is a series of lectures you gave

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:57.380
at the University of
California, Irvine, I believe.

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:05.370
After 9/11 we were in a situation

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:10.590
of having to reconceptualize
our adversary,

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:14.400
so a lot of these themes
that we've been talking about

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:19.400
come into play in the way
the West sees the other.

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:23.260
What do you see as,

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:28.260
what insights do you bring
to that definitional issue

00:42:31.331 --> 00:42:35.510
that, you know, follows up on

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:37.313
what we've just been talking about?

00:42:40.116 --> 00:42:42.870
- Well, I think that, in some ways,

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:46.390
this connects up with some of
the things we've already said.

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:51.000
And that is, the need to look critically

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
at many of our received
categories and received notions.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:02.517
In other words, not just
to criticize the others

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:08.220
or the perpetrators of
that terrorist attack,

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.210
but to go deeper.

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:12.210
And again, there were people
who already suggested this

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:13.770
at one time.

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:15.982
At the time, it was a bit difficult

00:43:15.982 --> 00:43:20.280
to make this point forcefully.

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.190
- [Harry] After 9/11.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:22.310
- After 9/11.
- Yeah.

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:23.830
- Nevertheless, there were some people

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:25.920
and since then, there have been more

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.290
who have urged that, you know,

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:33.290
what we also need is an
examination of the relationships

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.344
between, say, the United States,

00:43:37.344 --> 00:43:40.010
in this case, it was the United States,

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:41.770
and the rest of the world,

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:45.373
but particularly, of course,
in this case, the Middle East.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.760
Instead of just blaming,

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.630
just as it's, I think, quite
wrong for Middle Easterners

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:58.630
to blame everything that happens
in Middle Eastern countries

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:01.800
on the outside, which I think is not true,

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.400
I'm extremely critical of
the political situation

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.700
in the Middle East,

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:11.520
but it should be so too,
in the United States,

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.410
so that one can look critically

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:19.410
at our relationship, as
I put it, to violence.

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:25.890
In what way, historically as
well as within the country,

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:28.700
as well as between the United States

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.700
and other parts of the world,

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:34.730
what has been the relationship to violence

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:38.990
and how has it been
invoked at certain points

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:43.530
and denied at other points

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:48.160
and what are the consequences
of what we've done?

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.140
I say we,

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:52.320
'cause I'm already now an
American citizen, of course.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:57.243
So, I became an American
citizen in summer of 2001.

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:01.320
Rather, sort of symbolically.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.660
Anyway, so that's what I
would say in answer to,

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:08.110
I don't know whether I've
really adequately, probably not.

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:10.040
- Yes, you had, but let's explore,

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.780
but at least in terms
of looking at the other,

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.120
you say, or you suggest,

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.530
the way you see, define, explain terrorism

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:23.130
gives a justification for
the actions of the state.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:24.740
That's my reading of what you're saying.

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:25.573
In other words,

00:45:25.573 --> 00:45:30.350
that in going down one
road of interpretation,

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:37.070
it then makes it easier for the state

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:40.496
to practice all kinds of violence

00:45:40.496 --> 00:45:44.440
and come up with a moral
justification for that.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.200
- And a violence not only on
the outside world, but within.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.070
- [Harry] Yeah, right, right.

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:52.155
- Exactly, and you know, so
many people have complained

00:45:52.155 --> 00:45:57.155
a restriction of liberties
and all sorts of things.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.190
We're going over very familiar ground

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:00.930
which, nevertheless needs, I think,

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:02.480
to be stressed again and again.

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:08.730
I think that the whole
question of war and terrorism

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:11.130
has fascinated me.

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.670
When I wrote this book
and gave the lectures,

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:17.480
I showed it to a friend

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:21.793
who said yes, he liked it very much.

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:27.173
And he could see, he was
an American born and bred,

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:31.760
he could see that I was rightly saying

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.220
that in some certain instances,

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:35.800
terrorism might be justified.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.770
And I said no, this is not
what this book is about.

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:42.890
I am not trying to justify terrorism.

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:47.110
I'm just trying to shake this
sort of binary categorization

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:51.310
which gives rise to
certain kinds of policies.

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:53.020
So, I had to actually spell this out.

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.580
You may have seen this
in my short introduction

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.410
that's saying this is not intended

00:46:58.410 --> 00:46:59.963
as a justification for it.

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:05.670
I've, as I've mentioned to you,

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:08.790
I've become particularly interested also

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:13.790
in the whole idea of just
war and the reasons for it.

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:19.340
And I'm working at the
moment on that very category

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:25.610
and the way in which it is a
kind of moralization of war,

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.130
which I think should
not be moralized at all.

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:35.500
I'm not a pacifist, but I
don't for one moment think

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:40.500
that just war is a
coherent and valid notion.

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:48.620
And the way in which this justifies

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:51.360
certain kinds of violences,

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:55.710
which are often of a
enormously greater scale

00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:02.730
than anything that the
wretched terrorists can do.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:04.260
There are so many things,

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.260
not only in the way in which we have used

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:09.913
air power in war, for example,

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:13.191
but also in this very ambiguous business

00:48:13.191 --> 00:48:17.903
of when one transgresses the law of war.

00:48:19.769 --> 00:48:24.353
And the law of war is,
for me, fascinatingly,

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.910
much more ambiguous than I thought it was.

00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:33.903
There's a very fine and
insightful writer on this,

00:48:34.776 --> 00:48:39.660
a law specialist, David
Kennedy, who's written,

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.100
I've quoted him in my book,

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:45.873
but since then he's written
another one on the law of war,

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.780
which has, I think,
extremely good insights

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:56.550
about the law of war being
not a series of rules

00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:59.340
which cannot be transgressed

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:03.480
and which are supposed
to justify just war,

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:04.730
but really a language,

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:06.783
what he calls a language for argument.

00:49:08.047 --> 00:49:09.747
And that's what the law of war is.

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:14.210
There are others who've
also developed this.

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:17.660
Again, an international law
specialist in City University

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:22.263
who has written a number of
wonderful articles called,

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:25.360
I keep trying to remember rightly,

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:28.423
was it Jonathan Berman?

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:34.460
Oh, Nathaniel Berman, who's
written on this subject as well,

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:39.000
very much about the question
of the construction in war

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.400
of various categories,

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.720
including that which
has allowed, you know,

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.553
the proportionality business,

00:49:43.553 --> 00:49:45.593
the question of necessity, and so on.

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:51.200
So, what I tried to do in
this book, first of all,

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.640
is to shake those categories

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.100
so that we could think for ourselves.

00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:00.233
I mean, I don't provide any
answers, as you know very well.

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:04.320
But, I want, I hope that some readers

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.646
will begin to question for themselves

00:50:06.646 --> 00:50:09.830
and find answers for themselves.

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:11.680
And then, in the final part, of course,

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:16.680
I was still fascinated
by the reasons for horror

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:21.310
at suicide bombing.

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:24.820
And there were all sorts of
reasons, it seemed to me,

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:26.510
one could draw on

00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:30.350
to try and explain what
that sense of horror was.

00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:35.350
Which could be looked at without
being moralistic about it,

00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:37.360
because as an anthropologist, I was

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:38.193
and here I was

00:50:38.193 --> 00:50:41.673
much more thinking about
it anthropologically.

00:50:43.551 --> 00:50:46.130
And also reminding
ourselves that, you know,

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:48.380
in modern society,

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:52.650
we are committed to
all sorts of conditions

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:57.650
that would otherwise be considered
terroristic and horrific.

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.233
And one of those,

00:51:00.233 --> 00:51:02.410
which I do mention in the
book, you may remember,

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:06.323
has to do with nuclear weapons.

00:51:07.557 --> 00:51:10.290
- Go on, go ahead, please, no
you know, finish, go ahead.

00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:12.190
- Well, I just wanted
to say that, you know,

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:14.410
in a number of official definitions

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:17.380
terrorism is defined as not only an act,

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:21.700
but also as a threat,
the threat of terrorism.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:25.730
I mean, a particular kind of
threat makes it terrorism.

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:27.720
Now, it has seemed to me,

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:31.120
as well as to legions of other people,

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:33.750
that possessing nuclear weapons,

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:37.327
which you say you're
going to use if necessary

00:51:37.327 --> 00:51:39.830
and you will destroy not only the enemy,

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:42.680
but in the process, yourself,
you're prepared to do that,

00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:46.270
seems to me, logically,

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:50.260
you have the logical
structure of terrorism.

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:52.370
And yet, we don't see that

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:55.120
and we don't address
it quite in those terms

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.220
and I think we should.

00:51:57.858 --> 00:51:59.730
- This part of the conversation

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:00.867
is raising an interesting point

00:52:00.867 --> 00:52:04.440
and that is, as a social scientist,

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:08.340
as you try to disentangle

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:13.700
the complexity of our own development

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.720
in thinking about an issue,

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:19.863
violence and war, violence
between combatants, and so on,

00:52:20.798 --> 00:52:25.798
we basically get some new
insights about ourselves,

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:34.460
we see different things
about the adversary.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.590
Now, what's interesting
is the point you made

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:40.760
about what your friend said,

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.580
because when you begin to do that,

00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:46.130
what you're saying becomes politicized

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:49.800
and people say, oh,
you're defending suicide.

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:51.010
Talk a little about that,

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:53.250
because it really is an important issue

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:57.170
of where the academy can have insights,

00:52:57.170 --> 00:53:02.170
but in those insights becoming
part of the political debate,

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.330
there is a politicization

00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:07.320
in which people are
accused of saying things

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.153
they didn't say.

00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:10.083
- Yes, of course,

00:53:10.083 --> 00:53:13.653
this is very difficult to
control, to some extent.

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.340
Let me approach this indirectly

00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:22.340
by referring a review
that was made of this book

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:27.820
in the Times supplement,
the Sunday supplement.

00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:32.670
A book review by Samantha Power,

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:34.680
which, in fact, was about three books,

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:38.040
including one of Petraeus,
and this book, and one other,

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.560
I forget which.

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.300
And when she turned to that,

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:42.420
she said among other things,

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.340
well, she said a couple of nice things,

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:47.030
but she disagreed, of course,
fundamentally with it.

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:50.730
But, she described it as an angry book

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:55.710
and she said in the
end, rage overcomes him.

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:58.060
And I've been saying to my friends,

00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:00.360
you know, did she read
the book or didn't she?

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:04.973
Well, the point is, you can't
control how people read you.

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:10.040
And I think that, you know,
this is simply a rediscovery

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.800
of a fairly obvious thing.

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:16.800
It's no use by saying
no, no, I wasn't angry

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:18.923
and I certainly wasn't enraged.

00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:22.590
But, people will read you in odd ways

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:23.530
and to some extent,

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:27.730
you can control that by at
least explaining yourself,

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:28.563
but in the end,

00:54:28.563 --> 00:54:30.800
there are things that you can't, I think,

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:35.800
totally control how people will
take up what you're saying.

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:42.450
My hope is that the, insofar
as the politicization,

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:47.250
it can be seen as an indirect one.

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:52.250
I mean, I think of, if you like,
of democratic politics also

00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:54.373
as a kind of personal,

00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:01.800
interpersonal kind of ethical
encounter in which one can,

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:08.973
one should be able to treat
others with whom one is engaging

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:16.667
on equal terms, critically,
but also listening carefully

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:23.403
instead of jumping to the
conclusion that, you know,

00:55:23.403 --> 00:55:26.080
that they belong to a certain category.

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:27.040
What they've said,

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:30.820
aha, we already know
what he or she is saying

00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:34.643
and we really will not
tolerate that sort of thing.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.090
And asking oneself why

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:43.090
one has these feelings of
rejection, as well, as we proceed.

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:47.770
You know, for me, in a sense,

00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:51.230
democracy is not just about,
you know, voting and so on,

00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:52.623
which is, in some ways,

00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:58.980
the least problematic aspect of democracy.

00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:03.080
There is that other aspect

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:06.490
which I think is very
important and very neglected,

00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:10.343
including the readiness
to be self-critical.

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.660
- Professor Asad, on that
note I wanna thank you

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:16.360
for coming to the campus

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.610
to be the Foerster lecturer

00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:20.690
and also for appearing on our program.

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:22.600
- Thank you.
- And thank you very much

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:25.743
for joining us for this
Conversation with History.
