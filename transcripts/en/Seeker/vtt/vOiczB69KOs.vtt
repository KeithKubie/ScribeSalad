00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.540
WHY WON'T THAT BABY STOP CRYING?!

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.970
Girl, he don't want you gettin' it!

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.769
Hey babies, Trace here for DNews!

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.030
Thanks for watching!

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.540
Part of being a new parent is dealing with
a wailing infant, sacrificing sleep and sanity

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.990
to keep the new creature calm, warm, quiet,
and fed.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.530
A new study in the journal Evolution, Medicine
and Public Health is bringing the reality

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.620
of your little bundle of selfishness to light!

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.980
Babies don't want siblings!

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.050
Think about it, if your baby is screaming
and crying, that's not exactly the sexiest

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.990
environment for making ANOTHER baby.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.380
If you're taking care of your baby you're
not in the bedroom gettin' freaky.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.380
It's genius!

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.700
BABIES ARE TINY GENIUSES!

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.850
Which explains their big heads, I guess...

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.450
Newborns want to EAT every 2-3 hours.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.610
Evolutionarily, newborn eating means breast-feeding.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.350
There have been numerous studies showing the
hormones, antibodies and nutrients passing

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.610
from the mother to the child during breast-feeding.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.330
Breast-feeding has also been connected to
hormonal changes responsible for a lack of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.360
motherly ovulation.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.630
No eggs, no new babies!

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.290
Turns out, over the first year of life, the
newborn's crying habits can change, depending

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.000
on the genes it inherited from the parents.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.420
Certain genes from dad would cause the baby
to cry MORE and keep the mother awake longer,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.140
because when living in the wild, it's not
in the father's best interest to have the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.530
mother ovulate again, because she could be
impregnated by a competing male!

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.020
We've talked about the effect of birth order
on DNews, so you might recall, the firstborn

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.090
gets 100 percent of the parent's resources!

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.760
That monopoly has huge developmental advances,
so it's not just in the best interest of a

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.869
dad to keep the mom from breeding again, but
the kid too!

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.509
As humans moved away from our ancient, natural,
existence into this modern one we stopped

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.860
breeding as much as possible and hoping some
survive, and instead ensure the survival of

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.240
every kid we birth!

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.240
Who does that?

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.110
That is a very different evolutionary imperative.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.030
This conversation inevitably finds its way
to a simple evolutionary question: Why would

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.370
we evolve super loud babies if we're hiding
from predators in the wild?!

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.260
Chimpanzee babies wail too, bird babies are
noisy, even insect babies have learned attention-getting

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.260
behavior.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.580
It might attract predators, but rather more
importantly, it gets the parents attention

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.440
to feed, protect, warm, or comfort it.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.500
Some scientists feel wailing sends evolutionary
signals to parents the baby is fighting for

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.540
survival -- and is vigorous.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.170
I couldn't find any science explaining some
predatory disadvantage to wailing, but considering

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.570
the number of species that DO IT, it's probably
no thang.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.770
We'll have to see.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.930
In the end, hunger and sexual discouragement
is just one of many reasons babies will wail

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.620
through the night, they'll also cry to announce
their pain, anger, or fear.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.150
A study in the Spanish Journal of Psychology
looked at infant's subtle body language to

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.739
find which.

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.950
For example, open-eye crying means fear or
anger, closed-eye crying is pain.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.290
Babies are pretty smart little buggers, messing
with their parents sexual cycles, sleep cycles

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.290
and food cycles.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.490
Many parents debate the best way to respond
to crying, and I'm not here to settle THAT,

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.599
but over time primates respond less and less
to their babe's wailing, and the kid learns

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.940
to do things on their own.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.769
You humans will just have to decide for yourself.

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.090
Babies are weird, and they're gross and they're
something else...

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.090
Beautiful maybe?
