[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:10.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.227
SPEAKER 1: So welcome
again to Google.

00:00:12.227 --> 00:00:14.560
We're going to get started
today by just having the cast

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.100
members introduce themselves
and talk a little bit about how

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.566
you got involved with the show.

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.042
DANNY BURGOS: Want to start?

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:23.810
CLAUDIA YANEZ: Hi, guys.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.760
I'm Claudia.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.477
I play Rebecca and I cover
Gloria Estefan in the show.

00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:29.185
DANNY BURGOS: How'd
you get [INAUDIBLE]??

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:31.720
CLAUDIA YANEZ: How'd
I get involved?

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.520
So I lived in New York.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.230
Just, I heard about the show.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.270
Actually, I used to
sing background vocals

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.200
for an artist called Jon
Secada, and he actually

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.790
got his career
started by singing

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.320
background vocals for Gloria.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.110
And so the Secadas and the
Estefans have a relationship.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.680
And I remember Jon's wife
called me on the phone

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.320
while I was doing summer stock
in Vermont, and she was like,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.680
OK, so they're making Gloria's
life into a musical and,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.830
like, you have to try and
get seen, blah blah blah.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.660
But I was not in New York, so I
couldn't audition for the show,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.819
and I moved there, and the
show was already on Broadway.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.970
And I remember I would
literally call my agent

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.350
like every other
day, being like,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.030
so when are you going to get
me in for "On Your Feet?"

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.200
When are you going to get
me in for "On Your Feet?"

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.470
And they're like, Claudia,
they are not looking.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.130
And one day, like he emailed me.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.094
He's like, OK, please
stop calling me.

00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:18.760
Here is your audition,
blah, blah, blah.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.810
And I was like, thank you, God.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.040
And I went in a ton of times.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.360
And yeah, one day,
I got the call.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.960
My agent was like, OK, you
can finally leave me alone.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.720
Like, here you go, you're
doing the show, blah blah blah,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.715
have fun.

00:01:32.715 --> 00:01:33.340
Leave me alone.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.952
I was like, thank you.

00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:37.660
DANNY BURGOS: Hi.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.860
I'm Danny Burgos.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.430
I am in the ensemble, and I
understudy Emilio Estefan.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.750
And let me see, my
process with the show

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.720
was, I was doing a production
of "In the Heights,"

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.910
and I had been asking
my agent over and over

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.077
and over again, please
submit me for "On Your Feet!"

00:01:54.077 --> 00:01:55.618
And she was like,
I just don't really

00:01:55.618 --> 00:01:57.079
think it's the
right show for you.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.870
And I was like, I'm a
Cuban guy from Miami,

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.470
how could it not be?

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.057
And so yeah, she finally got
me that audition, and I mean,

00:02:06.057 --> 00:02:06.890
the rest is history.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.759
I went in for Clay
a bunch of times.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.030
I, like, remember his face
very vividly from my auditions.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.320
And eventually, my
agent called me,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.320
and I was just like,
hi, what's happening?

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.653
And she just goes, how would
you like to be on Broadway?

00:02:19.653 --> 00:02:21.130
And I was like, what?

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.750
And yeah, they
needed me literally

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.290
for a month on Broadway to
learn the role of Emilio.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.445
And then while I was
there, they were like, hey,

00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:28.570
you're going to go on tour.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.400
I was like, yes I am.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.150
And so yeah, here I am.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.520
MIKE SCAGLIONE: OK.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.130
I'm from Gloria's old band.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.039
I started with her March of
'88, and I didn't do Broadway.

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.580
I almost did.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.370
I was still a musical director
touring with Julio Iglesias

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.986
year-round.

00:02:45.986 --> 00:02:47.360
So I didn't do
Broadway, but then

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.470
when the road tour started up, I
was like, yes, I want to do it,

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.940
because he stopped touring.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.950
So here I am, and
it's a lot of fun.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.450
We have five guys
from the old band,

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.191
and it's like going out and
doing a Gloria show every night

00:02:58.191 --> 00:03:00.190
with the energy and these
wonderful people we're

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.180
working with.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.180
So it's a blast.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.610
CLAY OSTWALD: So my
involvement with the show

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.280
started when the show started.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.530
I was involved with
the very first reading

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.290
in New York City in 2014.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.140
I was very fortunate to
have Gloria and Emilio ask

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.830
me to represent the music in
the development of the story,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.370
in the development of the show.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.470
So I was involved with
every process along the way.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.800
So I've really learned
a tremendous amount

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.600
about how Broadway
works because I'd never

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.340
worked on Broadway before.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.220
I kind of got to work
with the best people

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.231
right away, right off the bat.

00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:39.730
And I never had any
experience at it

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.740
before, so it was really
a fortunate thing.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.800
I kind of like equate it to
being on LeBron James' team

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.080
but never having even played
basketball ever before,

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.580
you know?

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.700
So I really learned a lot on
Broadway in the production.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.814
We toured with
Gloria for 32 years.

00:03:54.814 --> 00:03:56.230
I've worked with
Gloria and Emilio

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.990
as a songwriter, keyboard
player, producer,

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.720
and orchestrator and arranger.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.300
So my quick
experience in New York

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.730
taught me a lot about
the entire production

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.980
and the entire process.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.980
And the musical director
chair, as the tour,

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.230
has been a complete joy for me.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.550
I enjoy it very much.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.970
We have a beautiful
band, beautiful cast,

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.877
and we really enjoy
doing the show.

00:04:23.877 --> 00:04:25.010
SPEAKER 1: That's awesome.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.480
Thank you for sharing.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.980
So Clay, you're from Colorado.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.880
Can you talk a
little bit about what

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.770
it's like to bring the show
and music to your home state?

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.850
CLAY OSTWALD: Well,
I'm from Boulder.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.810
I was born in Denver.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.410
I grew up in Boulder, and
went to Boulder High School,

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.900
and had a great experience
in Miami at college.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.580
But whenever we come
back and do our music

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.600
in Boulder, or in Denver, it's
a great experience for me,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.060
because I get my two
worlds to collide--

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.590
my youth, my childhood, my
family, and the music of Gloria

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.330
and our music from Miami and the
Caribbean in the South America

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.970
and all the types of
music that we play.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.170
So it's a real
adrenaline rush for me

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.430
to come back home and have
this show, again, represent

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.835
and entertain people
here in Denver for sure.

00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:20.050
SPEAKER 1: That's awesome.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.110
And so you and Mike have
known Gloria and Emilio

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.770
for a long time, correct?

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.430
Can you talk about what it's
like to work with them so

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.740
closely?

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.194
CLAY OSTWALD: You want to start?

00:05:31.194 --> 00:05:33.480
So I'll start.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.570
So when I first
met Gloria in 1986,

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.350
I had no ambitions of being
in the Latin pop salsa

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.510
world of music.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.310
We had a band in
Miami out of college,

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.780
and Jon Secada was our singer.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.620
And we had a bunch of great
musicians in the band.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.670
Gloria and Emilio were
just really starting

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.080
to make it big in
their industry.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.800
So they came to hear our
band, and they really

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.750
liked what they saw, and
they hired five of us

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.770
from that band to be Miami
Sound Machine in 1986.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.470
And at that moment, we
were all kind of into jazz,

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.156
and we were playing
all kinds of music.

00:06:07.156 --> 00:06:09.780
And we thought, oh, this will be
kind of a fun gig for a while.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.080
We'll work for the
Estefans, you know?

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.910
And 32 years later,
we're still here.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.080
So through the career of
Gloria and our careers,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.400
there's been so many different
types of genres and types

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.130
of music and styles that have
led us in different directions.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.430
So it's also led her
into different directions

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.150
as a person.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.240
And she's been so
adaptable and so

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.270
wonderful to like take on
these new challenges for us,

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.300
and same with Emilio.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.320
And it always gives
us new challenges

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.460
and new opportunities to
produce, write, go do concerts,

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.820
and have our careers
grow in a similar way.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.420
And now a Broadway show
is an entirely other--

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.600
another opportunity for
us that's been fantastic.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.620
Did I miss anything?

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.578
MIKE SCAGLIONE: No, you
pretty much covered it.

00:06:58.578 --> 00:07:00.219
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:02.260
SPEAKER 1: And so, Danny
and Claudia, what was it

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.020
like for you guys to bring
the story of Gloria and Emilio

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.130
to life on stage?

00:07:08.758 --> 00:07:11.440
CLAUDIA YANEZ: Well, we
both grew up in Miami.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.350
I was born in Venezuela and
then was raised in Miami.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.190
And so for me, like I grew
up my entire life hearing

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.660
about Gloria and
Emilio and, like,

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.910
being surrounded by their
music everywhere you go.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.770
Like, you can't walk
into a restaurant

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.270
without hearing "Conga."

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:32.750
I mean, it's literally a
part of just life in Miami,

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.200
especially because they're
immigrants just like me.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.520
I emigrated from Venezuela
when I was seven.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.920
And so to get to tell
this story in this caliber

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.130
and to kind of travel around the
country representing immigrants

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.340
and representing this
music that I grew up

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.380
hearing is literally
a dream come true.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.580
Like, people always ask me
like, what's your dream show?

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.190
What's your dream
role after this?

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.560
And literally, this is it.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.024
SPEAKER 1: Aw!

00:07:58.024 --> 00:07:59.440
CLAUDIA YANEZ:
Honestly, I'm like,

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.090
I really hope something
else comes along

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.006
that I love as much as
this, because like this

00:08:03.006 --> 00:08:04.120
would be a really--

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.434
you know, you hit your peak at
the beginning of your career,

00:08:07.434 --> 00:08:09.725
and then you're like, everything
is downhill from here.

00:08:09.725 --> 00:08:11.308
CLAY OSTWALD: I'm
not sure they knew--

00:08:11.308 --> 00:08:13.860
maybe it was announced,
but I missed it--

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.344
that Claudia understudies
the role of Gloria and Danny

00:08:16.344 --> 00:08:18.010
understudies the role
of Emilio, so they

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.777
go on as Gloria
and Emilio as well.

00:08:19.777 --> 00:08:20.610
CLAUDIA YANEZ: Yeah.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:21.280
CLAY OSTWALD: Yeah.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:21.790
CLAUDIA YANEZ: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.580
And so, I mean, getting to
do that is just ridiculous.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.850
Like especially, I grew up
singing a lot of pop music.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:33.760
And Jon, who I sang for, helped
write "Coming Out of the Dark"

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.840
with Gloria.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.000
And so I remember
being in Brazil

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.730
and like singing that song,
singing backgrounds for him,

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.390
and then getting to be in
that blue gown at the AMAs

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.550
at the end of the show
and, like, lead that song

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.420
and lead our company
of incredible actors.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.670
And having the Miami
Sound Machine backing you,

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:52.400
it's a joke.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.240
Like, it doesn't get
better than that.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.940
DANNY BURGOS: I think
my favorite part

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.000
of what we do in "On Your
Feet!" every single night is

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.310
the fact that we have the
incredible opportunity

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.350
as musical theater
actors, singers, dancers

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.710
to be playing Latin
American people.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.080
We're not playing a Latin
American stereotype.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.950
We're not playing a Latin
American, like, thing.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:22.150
We're playing these two
pop icons who are Cuban,

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.610
and it's just they
happen to be Cuban,

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.200
and we happen to be Latin.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.110
And we get to relay this
story around the country.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.300
We're telling people a
little bit about our culture.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.590
And I think that's so
important to educate

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.440
the country on what we are.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.350
You know, this is Cuban
culture at its finest,

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.730
and it's awesome.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.790
We're representing
people who made it.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.490
They made it, and they're
just Latin people who made it,

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.560
and it's awesome.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.500
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.560
The show definitely
had a lot of like

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.210
move-your-shoulders-in-your-seat
kind of songs.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.710
Can you talk a
little bit about what

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.070
it was like to bring these
kind of international hits,

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.840
like the "Conga" and
"Rhythm is Gonna Get You"

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.880
and "On Your Feet" to stage?

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.840
CLAY OSTWALD: Well,
for me, again, it's

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.600
just a really special
feeling to know

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.720
that the music that
we wrote, performed,

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.710
did so many thousands of times
and did so long ago, still

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.370
is being used for something
meaningful and effective and

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.880
significant and that matters
to the audience and to the band

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.380
and to the cast.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.080
That's really an incredible
thing, that our music--

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.720
we thought it was pretty cool
when we wrote it or did it.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:41.030
And some of it is very straight
ahead kind of dance pop music,

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:45.640
and some of it is folkloric
culturally and significantly

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:52.550
in Cuban, Peruvian, South
American, Caribbean things.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:57.080
So to have that matter, again,
and be part of a story, for me,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.090
is really fun.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:03.080
And it really justifies so much
of what we did in our career,

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.200
I think.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.868
It's kind of selfish, but it
feels good to say that, yeah.

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:11.850
CLAUDIA YANEZ: It's also
super cool to be onstage.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.190
And as soon as--

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.832
for example, when
"1-2-3" starts,

00:11:14.832 --> 00:11:16.790
you see like people light
up, and they're like,

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.140
I love that song!

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.900
But then it also
is kind of a part

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.280
of moving our story forward.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.410
Our writer did a
brilliant job and the team

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.740
who assembled the musical
did such a great job of using

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.070
the music to move
the story forward.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.710
And that is rare in
jukebox musicals, which

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.860
is what you call
like a musical that

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.230
uses a catalog of music
that already existed.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.730
It's rare to kind of have all
the songs kind of move you

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.040
along, but they do, and so yeah.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.460
No, it's so cool to get to see--
especially, the top of Act Two

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.585
starts with a medley
of all the hits.

00:11:51.585 --> 00:11:53.960
And when you come out of there
and you start singing "Get

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.760
On Your Feet" and
people are literally

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.030
having to restrain themselves
in their chairs, it's awesome.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.910
SPEAKER 1: What
inspired all of you

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.500
to be involved in
performing arts?

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.792
Anyone can answer.

00:12:08.792 --> 00:12:11.310
MIKE SCAGLIONE: I was a
shy, introverted little kid.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.470
I loved public
speaking, passed out

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.720
in my fifth grade class
trying to do a book report.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.330
Horrified of audiences.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.530
But I just clicked
with a saxophone.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.602
And I did my first
professional gig at 13.

00:12:24.602 --> 00:12:26.310
And immediately, I
was like, oh, well, it

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.350
seems like all the
band guys are friends.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.120
So I just went into
band in seventh grade.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.494
And by the end of
eighth grade, I

00:12:31.494 --> 00:12:33.660
was a professional musician
gigging up to four gigs

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.590
a weekend.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:39.570
And I've been that way
ever since May of 1977.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.200
I'm really old.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.466
CLAY OSTWALD: You came
out of your shell.

00:12:41.466 --> 00:12:42.690
MIKE SCAGLIONE: I
came out of the shell.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.195
I just immediately went into
music and just loved it.

00:12:45.195 --> 00:12:48.330
CLAUDIA YANEZ: Now look at
you, the life of the party.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:48.960
Seriously.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.740
I mean, I wasn't shy ever.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.450
Yeah, I've just always
loved performing.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.700
And when I was a little girl,
I would force my parents

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.270
to sit and hear me sing.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.920
I was a monster.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.420
But yeah, and as I got
older, I fell in love

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.130
with theater, just
the idea of being

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:13.825
able to tell a story
and just kind of connect

00:13:13.825 --> 00:13:16.200
with the humanity of the people
that are in the audience.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.080
And I think the theater is
such a beautiful vehicle

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.130
to get people to kind of let
down their walls for two hours

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.610
or however long the show
is and allow themselves

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.070
to see themselves onstage
and to feel something, maybe

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.980
learn something hopefully.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.460
So yeah, the idea that we get
to tell stories for a living

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.060
is just--

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.221
I mean, I don't want to do
anything other than that.

00:13:40.221 --> 00:13:41.220
DANNY BURGOS: Let's see.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.860
In seventh grade, I
auditioned for the drama club,

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.150
and the teacher told me
I wasn't drama material.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.460
And then in eighth grade,
because I'm stubborn,

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.932
I auditioned for the school
musical, which was "Annie,"

00:13:53.932 --> 00:13:57.060
and literally four boys
auditioned so I got a part.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.850
And I was Rooster in "Annie."

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.630
And Rooster's
first thing that he

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.880
has to do when he comes
onstage is crow like a rooster.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.817
And I was so shy
and so introverted

00:14:07.817 --> 00:14:09.650
that I was like
[IMITATES WEAK ROOSTER CROW]

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.310
and I was terrified.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.250
So I never did
anything musical again.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.760
And when I was 13, I got a
job at Cold Stone Creamery,

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.800
and they sing for their tips.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:26.520
So I got $1 from some guy,
and I sang an ice cream

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.590
version of "My Girl."

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:32.670
And the guy turns
back around and goes,

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.770
do you want to be in a musical?

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:38.224
And I was like, uh, sure?

00:14:38.224 --> 00:14:40.140
And I showed up to the
first day of rehearsal,

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.860
and I was cast as the little
newspaper delivery boy

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.970
in "She Loves Me."

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:51.966
And the lead didn't show up
for the first day of rehearsal.

00:14:51.966 --> 00:14:54.090
So he was like, hey, how'd
you like to be the lead?

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:59.470
And I was like, OK, and that
was my first lead in a musical.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.470
CLAUDIA YANEZ: Can we
please hear the ice cream

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.174
version of "My Girl?"

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:06.590
CLAY OSTWALD: So I'd like to
say a quick story about that.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.600
It's kind of fun.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.910
Our family was very
musical, and everyone

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.150
was required to at least
learn some music, especially

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.670
the piano and some
other music instruments.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:22.700
And I was always kind of like
surrounded by music in the home

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.626
and in the family.

00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:26.000
And when I was
growing up, we all

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.458
listened to a
certain kind of music

00:15:27.458 --> 00:15:31.610
that would just click and kind
of inspire us and get chills

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.800
up and down your spine
from some kind of music.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.130
And that feeling about music
was always kind of around me.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:41.000
And I just want to say a
couple of quick little stories.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.100
One of the first albums
my dad got me for birthday

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.415
was Herbie Hancock.

00:15:44.415 --> 00:15:46.790
And one of the first songbooks
I ever had, my sister had,

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.670
was Stevie Wonder "Songs
in the Key of Life."

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.740
And those songbooks
are still in our house,

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:58.550
in my parent's house
where we grew up.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.440
And last week, I
shook hands and talked

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.010
to Stevie Wonder for a little
while at our opening in LA

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.010
and told him how much his
music meant to me as a kid.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:11.540
And about two months ago,
I talked to Herbie Hancock

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.800
at the honors awards
in DC a few months ago,

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.780
and had a chance to
talk to him and tell him

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.760
how much his music meant to me.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.640
So I think that inspiration
that you get and the chills you

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.900
get from music that matters
is what really motivated me,

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.260
and that I still am fascinated
by every night, when we do

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.060
the show and we hit something.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.340
And it makes us charged.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.230
And then it immediately
goes out to people

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.570
and they let us know how
it makes them charged.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.668
I think that's really important
in the world, that performance.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:43.876
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, I love that.

00:16:43.876 --> 00:16:44.750
That's awesome.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.490
So switching gears
a little bit, we

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.810
have a couple of more
culturally-centric questions.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.400
The first of which is, although
we still have a long way

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.420
to go with the recent releases
of movies like "Coco" and songs

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.249
like "Despacito" at the top
of the entertainment charts,

00:16:59.249 --> 00:17:01.790
it feels like there's definitely
been a resurgence of Latinos

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.200
in film and music.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.480
Have you seen this change
represented in the Broadway

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.280
industry as well?

00:17:09.142 --> 00:17:10.579
CLAUDIA YANEZ: Definitely.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:14.660
I think with shows like
"Hamilton" and "On Your Feet!"

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.619
it's definitely like torn
down a few of the walls that

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.310
were up and now you're seeing
more and more diversity

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:21.950
onstage.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.970
We definitely have
a long way to go,

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.390
but it's kind of been
a beautiful thing

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:32.000
to see my peers and my
fellow Latin community

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.570
and African-American community
getting roles that have nothing

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:39.200
to do with who you are and
where your background and what

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.790
language you grew up speaking.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:43.340
And it has to do with like
your ability to tell a story

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.490
and sing or whatever it is.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:47.580
So it's beautiful.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.080
Yeah.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:48.663
It's starting.

00:17:48.663 --> 00:17:51.152
Like right now, in
"Waitress" in New York,

00:17:51.152 --> 00:17:53.360
there's going to be an
African-American actress who's

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.780
going to play Jenna, which
probably two years ago, that

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.939
would have never happened,
and so it's exciting.

00:17:59.939 --> 00:18:00.980
We have a long way to go.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.620
And definitely, we have to
be super grateful for all

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.250
of the actors and the
older singers who kind

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.520
of trail-blazed, like Rita
Moreno and all of these actors

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.420
who kind of paved
the way for us,

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.750
because it's not just
someone writes "Hamilton"

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.580
and then all of a
sudden there's-- no,

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.950
there's people who like
have been fighting for this

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:19.580
for years.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.890
And so yeah, but
it's definitely--

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:25.145
we're getting there,
slowly but surely.

00:18:25.145 --> 00:18:28.880
DANNY BURGOS: I
have such a place

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.280
of reverence in my life
for Lin-Manuel Miranda,

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.980
because he does
things with theater

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.990
that open up these doors.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.052
Like, "In the
Heights" was when I

00:18:39.052 --> 00:18:40.760
knew that I wanted to
do musical theater.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.750
I watched those Tony Awards and
I was like, wow, Latin people

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.160
on stage doing a show just about
one day in Washington Heights.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.740
"In the Heights" is about
nothing more than just one day

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.390
in Washington Heights.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.270
And I used to love things
like "The Addams Family"

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.920
where you have like
Gomez Addams which

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.480
is a hysterical
character, but he

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.350
plays at a stereotype of
what it is to be a Latin man.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.980
And so what I love about
stuff like "On Your Feet!"

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.070
we're just Latin people.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.740
"In the Heights," it's just a
bunch of Latin people on stage.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.860
You have "Hamilton," where
you have Angelica, Eliza,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.060
and Peggy, which is a black
woman, a Filipino woman,

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.090
and a Latina and they're
sisters because they

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.370
say they're sisters.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:22.970
Yeah, like that's it.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.090
You know?

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:28.790
So what I'm loving about the
way that Broadway is moving

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:29.866
into it's--

00:19:29.866 --> 00:19:31.490
I don't like saying
colorblind casting,

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.760
because I think that we should
be very proud of who we are

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.200
as people, whatever that be.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.180
I think it's more color
conscious casting.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.430
It's like awesome, we're
looking at the fact

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:44.270
that these three women, no,
they wouldn't be related maybe

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.839
in real life, but they say
that they're sisters on stage.

00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:49.880
They say it every single
time they come on stage,

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.415
so let's just suspend
disbelief for a little bit

00:19:52.415 --> 00:19:54.650
and for two hours,
they are sisters.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:55.250
You know?

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.010
It's beautiful.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:57.590
It's really incredible
what we can do when we just

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:58.760
allow things to happen.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.426
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:19:59.426 --> 00:20:00.070
I love that.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.580
CLAY OSTWALD: Can I add
something really quick?

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:01.850
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.183
CLAY OSTWALD: Because I have to.

00:20:03.183 --> 00:20:04.690
I can't help myself.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.760
So having the opportunity
to have people

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.320
from all kinds of cultures
and all kinds of backgrounds

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.110
is only really
possible in my view

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.720
when there is arts
in the schools.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.940
Because without art
programs in the schools

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.010
and the ability
to learn about it

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:29.000
and be motivated and inspired
by arts in the community,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.020
it's nearly
impossible for people

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.190
to want to go into it, to have
the avenue to get into it,

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.480
and have any kind of
training to get into it.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.630
So I think it's really
important to know

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.200
that when our arts are taken
away from school systems,

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.159
we're diminishing that.

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:46.533
We're not headed in the right
direction with that at all.

00:20:46.533 --> 00:20:48.510
And the only way to
increase that direction

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:52.930
is to provide that understanding
in the schools at every level.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:57.469
And I think that's something
that needs to be remembered.

00:20:57.469 --> 00:20:59.760
CLAUDIA YANEZ: I would like
to add to that, because I'm

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.630
a product of an
arts high school,

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.750
and growing up in Miami,
it's super diverse.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.300
But at the same
time, my first time

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:14.670
meeting a white blond person
was in high school in Miami.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.230
And I moved there
when I was seven.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:20.112
And also, it's just
being able to kind of--

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:21.570
I feel like that's
what made me get

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.470
into the arts is because I went
to school with people who were

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.210
so different from
me, people who were

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.700
from the clusters
of communities that

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.050
were like mostly Haitian or
African-American and stuff

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:32.550
like that.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.770
And when we were
in the classroom,

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.450
we were all the
same, and we were

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.810
able to create work
together no matter

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.200
what you're like socioeconomic
background was and all

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:43.810
that stuff.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.260
And so yeah, arts in
schools, very important.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.510
CLAY OSTWALD: We like to talk.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.247
SPEAKER 1: Arts
in schools, yeah.

00:21:50.247 --> 00:21:52.830
So we actually have a couple of
minutes for audience questions

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.820
now, so we can open
it up to the floor

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.360
if anyone has any questions.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:01.320
AUDIENCE: If you happened to
find yourselves in a technology

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.340
environment, what
technology advancement do

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.230
you think would make the most
difference for the theater,

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:09.792
have the most impact?

00:22:09.792 --> 00:22:12.000
DANNY BURGOS: I only say
this because I was literally

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.890
thinking about it in
the wing last night.

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.210
So I was a spot op.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.440
I was like a spot op
when I was in college,

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.710
because we had to do
like technical whatever,

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:27.300
and I was always thinking
about like how jarry I was

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.130
when I like moved the light.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.630
And I was like, how
awesome would it

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.540
be if you could just
have a screen where

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.970
you put your finger on
whoever you're focusing on

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:40.020
and the spotlight just follows
them and it's so smooth?

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.460
And I was literally thinking
about that in the wing

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.243
while Gloria Estefan was singing
"Coming Out of the Dark."

00:22:45.243 --> 00:22:47.558
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:47.558 --> 00:22:49.920
CLAUDIA YANEZ: That
would be something.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.160
CLAY OSTWALD: I
think that we all

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.790
have learned the importance of
technology in the arts world,

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:59.170
and some of us get
really into it.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.980
I do as far as recording
and a little bit in video,

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.010
but mostly recording.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.170
And we all understand the
importance of technology

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:12.270
in the media side of it,
but I think a lot of us

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:19.460
really focus 99% on the
creation of the expression

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.340
and not on the
technical side of it.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.410
So that's, I think,
where our priorities are.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:29.796
I don't know if that answers
you or hurts the question, but--

00:23:29.796 --> 00:23:31.800
CLAUDIA YANEZ: I mean, just to--

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.222
I would think like
maybe a device

00:23:34.222 --> 00:23:36.055
that would silence cell
phones automatically

00:23:36.055 --> 00:23:36.900
in the whole theater.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.100
CLAY OSTWALD: Ah,
there's a good one.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.975
CLAUDIA YANEZ: Honestly,
it would be amazing.

00:23:39.975 --> 00:23:41.630
Because sometimes,
like you're on stage

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.430
and you're in a dramatic
scene and it's like a silence,

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.099
and then you just hear like--

00:23:46.099 --> 00:23:48.390
I don't know why "La Cucaracha"
is the first thing that

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:49.920
came to my mind.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.830
That is horrible.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:54.606
Anyway, but you just hear a
ring tone and you're like, eh,

00:23:54.606 --> 00:23:55.980
and then you have
to block it out

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.855
and then it just takes
you out of the moment.

00:23:57.855 --> 00:24:00.230
And so that would be beautiful
if there was like a device

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.771
that you could
install in the theater

00:24:01.771 --> 00:24:04.050
and it just like automatically
silences the phones.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:05.992
CLAY OSTWALD: That's a good one.

00:24:05.992 --> 00:24:08.200
SPEAKER 1: I feel like that'd
be helpful at work too.

00:24:11.105 --> 00:24:12.480
AUDIENCE: Do you
have any stories

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.090
about onstage or backstage
mishaps that have happened?

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.800
CLAY OSTWALD: Oh,
there are so many.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.780
CLAUDIA YANEZ: I mean, yeah.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.810
We were just talking
about this in the car.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:26.240
So one day, I think we were in
Philly, and I was on for Gloria

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:31.890
and I had like 11 or 12 friends
and family members who drove

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:33.600
in or flew in to see the show.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.794
And our opening
number, "Tradition,"

00:24:36.794 --> 00:24:38.460
at the end of the
song there's a button,

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.010
you go ba-da-da-da-da-da-da,
que siga!

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:45.250
And one of our cast members
tripped me by accident,

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.150
and so it went
ba-da-da-da-da-da-da, fall,

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.130
que siga!

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.951
And Danny was like, how
did you hit the pose?

00:24:50.951 --> 00:24:51.450
I was like--

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:52.380
DANNY BURGOS: She
hit the button.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.330
CLAUDIA YANEZ: I had 11
people in the audience and not

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:55.750
to mention like 2,000 people.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.860
I was like, there's no way that
I'm just going to be like--

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:58.690
DANNY BURGOS: If that was me, I
would've been like, stay down,

00:24:58.690 --> 00:24:58.860
you're so embarrassed.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.000
CLAUDIA YANEZ: Stay down.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.650
It was not my
fault. I was like--

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:03.490
honestly, I didn't even
remember how I fell.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:04.960
But that was one.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.920
And then another time
we were in Chicago,

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.010
and I was on for Gloria.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.057
And I was singing
"Anything for You,"

00:25:11.057 --> 00:25:12.890
which is right at the
beginning of the show.

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.700
And at first, Gloria and
her sister sing it together

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.800
and they do harmonies, and
it's beautiful, whatever.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.460
And then there's a part
where everyone kind of like

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.260
disappears into the
wings, and it's just

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.970
Gloria and her keyboard.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.340
And she sings the whole song
and Emilio's like walking

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.485
around her being like, wow,
like she's so talented,

00:25:29.485 --> 00:25:30.580
blah blah blah.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.340
And so I'm playing, and
everyone is walking out.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.310
And all of a sudden, the
whole music in the theater

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:41.890
just like cuts out, literally
no sound coming from the keys.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:43.480
I can't hear the band.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.880
I'm like, oh my God.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.380
We're in Chicago, of course,
which is a huge theater town.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:48.310
And I'm like, OK.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:49.670
OK, this is great.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:53.590
So I'm playing and I'm
kind of vamping, waiting

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.680
to see if they're going to stop
the show, because sometimes it

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.071
happens where a stage manager
will be like, guys, we're

00:25:59.071 --> 00:26:00.820
stopping the show,
technical difficulties.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.310
And the actors will leave,
then they fix it, we come back.

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.220
So I'm waiting because like
music, it's a Gloria Estefan

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.010
musical, it's important.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.050
And then I realized,
I'm like, come on, guys.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:11.890
Come on, come on.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.289
And I kind of look
and I'm like, they

00:26:14.289 --> 00:26:15.580
weren't going to stop the show.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:19.510
So I had to do the rest of
the song a capella, which

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:23.380
was terrifying at the
moment, but also there

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.400
was a moment where I was
like, this is the best.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.815
And it ended up being really
cool because when do you

00:26:28.815 --> 00:26:29.440
get to do that?

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.290
Like kind of be in a theater
setting and just like--

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.210
and thankfully, like
towards the end,

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:37.090
I could hear like a little
bit of keys, but yeah.

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:38.050
It was crazy.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.420
CLAY OSTWALD: OK, so I'll be
really quick with this one.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.470
What you don't know is that the
entire time that was going on,

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.140
we have our earpieces
on and stuff.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.040
We're playing along just fine.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.900
We hear our
instruments just fine.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.620
We don't know why she's
not singing with us.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.620
We're like going,
what's wrong with her?

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.410
What is going on?

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:58.130
Why can't she hear us?

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.859
So it was a problem
with the house sound.

00:27:00.859 --> 00:27:02.650
But we were like, why
is she so out of key?

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:04.831
Why does she sound so bad?

00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:06.580
CLAUDIA YANEZ: No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:07.914
I was singing in the right key.

00:27:07.914 --> 00:27:08.830
CLAY OSTWALD: Not bad.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:09.460
She sounded fine
to the audience.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.590
CLAUDIA YANEZ: I was on a
different part of the song.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:13.548
CLAY OSTWALD: She sounded
fine to the audience,

00:27:13.548 --> 00:27:14.650
but she wasn't with us.

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:17.440
But the backstage
show, if you ever

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.560
want a really, really,
really entertaining night,

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.866
pay somebody to
sneak you in and sit

00:27:23.866 --> 00:27:25.240
on the side of
the backstage area

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.860
and watch what
goes on backstage.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.570
It's an entirely
entertaining show

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:31.380
like you'll never
see something before.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.470
But one night in New York,
none of our moving automation

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:36.490
was working.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.890
The entire computer system
was down, nothing was working.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.410
We did the entire
first half of the show

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:43.510
with only hand props
and things that

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:45.610
could be carried on the
stage by the actors.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:47.950
And they pretended like
the entire props were there

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.650
for the entire Act One.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.540
SPEAKER 1: Oh my god.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.873
CLAY OSTWALD: It was incredible.

00:27:51.873 --> 00:27:53.500
It was unbelievable.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.640
CLAUDIA YANEZ: Was
the kitchen automated?

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.470
CLAY OSTWALD: No, they
did the whole thing

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:57.303
without the kitchen.

00:27:57.303 --> 00:27:58.836
They pretended
like it was there.

00:27:58.836 --> 00:27:59.820
CLAUDIA YANEZ: Everything
was [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.280
CLAY OSTWALD: It was automated.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.490
Yeah, nothing was there.

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:02.800
The bed never came out.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.820
She just acted like
her father was there.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.530
Yeah, it was the
whole first act.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:10.300
And it was old
school theater, you

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.950
pretended like it
was all happening

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.320
and the audience kind of got it.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.403
SPEAKER 1: That's awesome.

00:28:14.403 --> 00:28:16.719
CLAY OSTWALD: And then for
Act Two, it all got fixed.

00:28:16.719 --> 00:28:18.760
SPEAKER 1: So the question
was, what song did you

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.050
sing for your audition song?

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:25.180
DANNY BURGOS: So I actually
came in with the Emilio packet,

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:28.810
so the first song that they
have us sing is "See Your Smile.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:33.730
And I was dying of fright,
because you're singing

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:35.020
for the Miami Sound Machine.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.880
You're just like,
hey, here's your song.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.160
Hope you like it.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.841
And then the director asked
me to sing one of the songs

00:28:41.841 --> 00:28:43.840
from my book, and I sang
a song from the musical

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.270
called "The Last Five Years."

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:48.550
It was "Shiksa Goddess."

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.610
But yeah, and then after
that, they had me sing

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:52.750
"Don't Wanna Lose You."

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.030
And yeah, it's
just intimidating.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:57.220
You are singing
their music for them,

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.032
and it's like
[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY]..

00:29:00.032 --> 00:29:00.865
CLAUDIA YANEZ: Yeah.

00:29:00.865 --> 00:29:03.580
I also had the Gloria
packet, which is--

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.920
the audition packet
for the show for Gloria

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.710
is like 60-something pages.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:11.020
It's so many songs
and so many scenes,

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:15.070
and I remember I had like
a week to learn everything.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.870
But really, you know
that I knew this stuff

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.572
like two years in advance,
because I was like, put me in,

00:29:18.572 --> 00:29:19.072
coach!

00:29:19.072 --> 00:29:20.732
Put me in!

00:29:20.732 --> 00:29:22.015
But yeah, it was scary.

00:29:22.015 --> 00:29:23.395
CLAY OSTWALD: She did OK.

00:29:23.395 --> 00:29:25.990
CLAUDIA YANEZ: OK, Clay.

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:30.130
Actually, I never sang for
Clay in any of my auditions.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.624
No, I never sang for
you, because I auditioned

00:29:32.624 --> 00:29:35.290
for New York for the most part,
so I only sang for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:36.430
CLAY OSTWALD: They sent us
a note saying we've already

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:37.862
approved her for her role.

00:29:37.862 --> 00:29:39.070
We'll go on to the next ones.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.840
Yeah, that's true.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.256
CLAUDIA YANEZ: Literally, I
remember walking in and seeing

00:29:42.256 --> 00:29:43.990
Clay the last time
they called me in,

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:46.600
and I was so excited to
sing for him because we

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.480
had mutual friends and
blah blah blah from Miami.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.520
And I walk in and
I'm like, hey guys.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.740
So they had me do this
scene that was literally

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.547
like three and a half seconds.

00:29:55.547 --> 00:29:56.630
CLAY OSTWALD: That's true.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.000
CLAUDIA YANEZ: I took
more time getting

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.700
ready for the audition than
what the audition actually was.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.710
I walk in and I do the
scene, and I'm like, OK,

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:03.360
do you guys want
to hear me sing?

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.068
They're like, no.

00:30:04.068 --> 00:30:05.394
I was like [SHRUGS SHOULDERS]

00:30:05.394 --> 00:30:06.810
CLAY OSTWALD: Yeah,
we had a note.

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:08.390
She's already approved.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.140
It was a formality.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:10.760
It really was.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.956
It was just a formality.

00:30:12.956 --> 00:30:13.800
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.829
So that's all the time
that we have today,

00:30:15.829 --> 00:30:17.370
so thank you so much
for stopping by.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:18.750
And if you haven't
checked out the show,

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.480
I highly recommend
you go check it out.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.646
They'll be performing at
the Buell Theatre in Denver

00:30:22.646 --> 00:30:24.420
until August 19 and
then heading off

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.015
to Costa Mesa in California.

00:30:26.015 --> 00:30:26.890
Thank you for coming.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.451
CLAY OSTWALD: Thank
you for having us.

00:30:29.451 --> 00:30:30.450
Thank you for having us.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.800
[APPLAUSE]
