00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.200
I want to introduce you
to my badass friends.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.680
Meet Thelma and Louise.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.135
(Laughter)

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.016
I'm passionate about cows.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.616
And although they've been
getting a lot of crap lately

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.016
due to methane emissions
and climate change,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.816
I hope that I can redeem
their reputation in part

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.096
by showing you how
incredibly important they are

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.216
in solving one of the world's
biggest problems: food security.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.416
But more importantly, for Africa --

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.480
it's resultant childhood stunting.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.336
Nutritional stunting manifests itself

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.216
in a reduction of growth rate
in human development.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.176
And according to UNICEF,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.816
stunting doesn't come easy.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.456
It doesn't come quickly.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.296
It happens over a long period of time

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.800
during which a child endures painful
and debilitating cycles of illness,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.336
depressed appetite,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.936
insufficient nutrition

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.560
and inadequate care.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.000
And most kids simply
can't endure such rigors.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.360
But those that do survive,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.976
they carry forward
long-term cognitive problems

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.120
as well as losses of stature.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.856
The numbers of stunted children
under the age of five,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.336
in most regions of the world,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.896
has been declining.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.936
And I really hate to say this,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.856
but the only place where
they haven't been declining is here,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.080
in Africa.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.560
Here, 59 million children,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.656
three in 10 in that age group,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.536
struggle to meet
their genetic potential --

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.120
their full genetic potential.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.736
Protein is one of our most important
dietary requirements,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.776
and evidence shows
that lack of essential amino acids,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.576
the building blocks of proteins,
in young children's diets,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.840
can result in stunting.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.576
Essential amino acids are called essential

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.136
because we can't
synthesize them in our bodies.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.840
We have to get them from our foods

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.616
and the best sources are animal-derived:

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.960
milk, meat and eggs.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.016
Most protein consumed
on the African continent is crop-based.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.920
And although we have millions
of smallholder farmers rearing animals,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.160
livestock production
is not as easy as we think.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.896
The big livestock gaps between
rich countries and poor countries

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.440
are due to poor animal health.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.136
Endemic livestock diseases,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.536
some of them transmissible to humans,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.560
threaten not only livestock producers
in those poor countries,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.520
but all human health across all countries.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.576
This is a global pathogens network.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.096
It shows the pathogens
found across the world

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.496
according to the Enhanced
Infectious Diseases database.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.256
And it shows those pathogens
that share hosts.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.576
In a nutshell,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.056
we share pathogens, and thus diseases,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.496
with the species we live closest to:

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.776
our livestock.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.056
And we call these zoonotic diseases.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.856
Recent reports show

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.936
that the deadly dozen zoonotic
diseases kill 2.2 million people

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.960
and sicken 2.4 billion people annually.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.856
And Jimmy says,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.336
"The greatest burden of zoonoses

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.920
falls on one billion
poor livestock keepers."

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.600
We totally underestimate
the importance of our smallholder farmers.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.616
We're beginning to recognize
how important they are

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.136
and how they influence our medical health,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.896
our biosafety

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.120
and more recently,
our cognitive and our physical health.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.680
They stand at the frontline
of zoonotic epidemics.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.760
They pretty much underpin our existence.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.816
And they need to know so much,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.256
yet most lack knowledge

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.016
on livestock disease
prevention and treatment.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.176
So how do they learn?

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.976
Apart from shared experiences,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.256
trial and error,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.400
conventional farming extension services
are boots on the ground and radio --

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.800
expensive and hard to scale
in the face of population growth.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.480
Sounds pretty gloomy, doesn't it?

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.496
But we're at an interesting
point in Africa.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.856
We're changing that narrative
using innovative solutions,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.320
riding across scalable technologies.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.640
Knowledge doesn't have to be expensive.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.896
My company developed
an agricultural platform called iCow.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.976
We teach farmers
best livestock practices using SMS

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.336
over simple, low-end phones.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.616
Farmers receive three SMSs a week
on best livestock practices,

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.776
and those that execute the messages
go on to see increases in productivity

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.960
within as short a time as three months.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.840
The first increases in productivity,
of course, are improved animal health.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.336
We use SMS because it is retentive.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.136
Farmers store their messages,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.696
they write them down in books,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.976
and in effect,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.760
we're drip-feeding
agricultural manuals into the fields.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.896
We recognize that we are all
part of the global food network:

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.736
producers and consumers,

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.880
you and me, and every farmer.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.400
We're focusing now on trying
to bring together producers and consumers

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.576
to take action and take responsibility
for not only food security,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.040
but for food safety.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.216
This beautiful animal is an African-Asian
Sahiwal crossed with a Dutch Fleckvieh.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.656
She's milkier than her Sahiwal mom,

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.000
and she's sturdier and more resistant
to disease than her Fleckvieh father.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.096
In Ethiopia and Tanzania,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.056
the African Dairy Genetic Gains program
is using SMS and cutting-edge genomics

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.536
and pioneering Africa's first
tropically adapted dairy breeding centers

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.760
and dairy performance recording centers.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.816
Farmers contribute
their production data --

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.096
milking records,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.016
breeding records and feeding records --

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.776
to the ADGG platform.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.936
This stage is synthesized
through algorithms

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.496
from some of the top
livestock institutions in the world

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.296
before it lands back in the farmers' hands

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.440
in actionable SMSs.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.736
Customized data,

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.336
customized responses

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.016
all aimed at increasing productivity

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.960
based on the potential on the ground.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.160
We're at a very interesting place
in agriculture in Africa.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.176
By the end of this year,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.440
we'll have almost one billion
mobile phone subscriptions.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.616
We have the power in our hands

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.896
to ensure that livestock production
systems are not only healthy,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.920
productive and profitable,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.936
but that farmers are knowledgeable,

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.776
and more importantly,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.680
that our farmers are safe.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.016
Working with smallholder farmers

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.040
is one of the best ways
to guarantee food security.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.816
Working with smallholder farmers
is one of the best ways

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.816
to guarantee each and every child
their full opportunity

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.200
and ability to reach
their full genetic potential.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.776
And harnessing the power
of millions of smallholder farmers

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.000
and their badass cows like mine,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.440
we should be able to bring
a halt to stunting in Africa.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.376
Thank you.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.080
(Applause)

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.000
Thank you.
