00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.120
 
I think that we're in the middle of the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130
I think that we're in the middle of the
 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.710
I think that we're in the middle of the
age of genetics I don't think that we're

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:12.720
age of genetics I don't think that we're
 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.930
age of genetics I don't think that we're
on the on the cusp of a revolution I

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940
on the on the cusp of a revolution I
 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.730
on the on the cusp of a revolution I
mean I think with the the sequencing of

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740
mean I think with the the sequencing of
 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.310
mean I think with the the sequencing of
the human genome and now sequencing of

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320
the human genome and now sequencing of
 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.170
the human genome and now sequencing of
many many different genomes from a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
many many different genomes from a
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.420
many many different genomes from a
variety of organisms have given

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430
variety of organisms have given
 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.840
variety of organisms have given
researchers such powerful tools to find

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850
researchers such powerful tools to find
 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.380
researchers such powerful tools to find
out new associations being able to

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390
out new associations being able to
 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.590
out new associations being able to
compare whole genome sequences from many

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
compare whole genome sequences from many
 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.570
compare whole genome sequences from many
many different organisms one can see

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580
many different organisms one can see
 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.689
many different organisms one can see
what is conserved and therefore what is

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699
what is conserved and therefore what is
 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.139
what is conserved and therefore what is
very important so I think that the tools

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
very important so I think that the tools
 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.880
very important so I think that the tools
that we've been given just in the last

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
that we've been given just in the last
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.520
that we've been given just in the last
ten years are tremendous and people are

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530
ten years are tremendous and people are
 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.090
ten years are tremendous and people are
just now learning to be able to take

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
just now learning to be able to take
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.910
just now learning to be able to take
advantage of those and yes there are of

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
advantage of those and yes there are of
 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.520
advantage of those and yes there are of
course ethical implications of in terms

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
course ethical implications of in terms
 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.369
course ethical implications of in terms
of issues having to do with insurance

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379
of issues having to do with insurance
 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.369
of issues having to do with insurance
and genetic privacy issues if whole

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379
and genetic privacy issues if whole
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.100
and genetic privacy issues if whole
genomes are going to be sequenced who

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
genomes are going to be sequenced who
 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.260
genomes are going to be sequenced who
will have that information and I think

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270
will have that information and I think
 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.740
will have that information and I think
that there are a lot of processes going

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
that there are a lot of processes going
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.020
that there are a lot of processes going
on there's a bill that was passed a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
on there's a bill that was passed a
 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.310
on there's a bill that was passed a
number of years ago the genetic

the use that can be made of some of this

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
the use that can be made of some of this
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.080
the use that can be made of some of this
but I think it's an ongoing process that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
but I think it's an ongoing process that
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.899
but I think it's an ongoing process that
people need to be discussing more widely

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909
people need to be discussing more widely
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.950
people need to be discussing more widely
that the the more people in general in

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960
that the the more people in general in
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.050
that the the more people in general in
the population understand about genetics

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060
the population understand about genetics
 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.910
the population understand about genetics
the more they'll be able to have an

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920
the more they'll be able to have an
 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.950
the more they'll be able to have an
informed discussion about these issues

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
informed discussion about these issues
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960
informed discussion about these issues
when they come up so I think that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
when they come up so I think that
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.210
when they come up so I think that
scientific literacy is going to be

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
scientific literacy is going to be
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.880
scientific literacy is going to be
really important as these things are

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
really important as these things are
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.710
really important as these things are
disseminated more into the public in

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
disseminated more into the public in
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.810
disseminated more into the public in
terms of the possibility of people

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
terms of the possibility of people
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.789
terms of the possibility of people
having their own DNA sequence and what

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
having their own DNA sequence and what
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.859
having their own DNA sequence and what
does it mean and what does it mean to

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
does it mean and what does it mean to
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.359
does it mean and what does it mean to
them and what does it mean for franta

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
them and what does it mean for franta
 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.889
them and what does it mean for franta
family members who might not want to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
family members who might not want to
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.109
family members who might not want to
know that those are privacy issues and

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119
know that those are privacy issues and
 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.789
know that those are privacy issues and
the only way to move forward with that

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
the only way to move forward with that
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.230
the only way to move forward with that
is to really have an informed discussion

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240
is to really have an informed discussion
 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.469
is to really have an informed discussion
and to talk about it so that's why i

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479
and to talk about it so that's why i
 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.660
and to talk about it so that's why i
think that the general education in

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670
think that the general education in
 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.180
think that the general education in
terms of genetics is really essential

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
 
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.980
 
I'm excited about what's to come but i

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990
I'm excited about what's to come but i
 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.750
I'm excited about what's to come but i
think that along with the actual

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
think that along with the actual
 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.090
think that along with the actual
scientific changes there's a certain

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100
scientific changes there's a certain
 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.110
scientific changes there's a certain
responsibility of scientists and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120
responsibility of scientists and
 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.420
responsibility of scientists and
educated people in general to talk about

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
educated people in general to talk about
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.180
educated people in general to talk about
these things because i think that with

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190
these things because i think that with
 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.850
these things because i think that with
with knowledge comes power and so the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860
with knowledge comes power and so the
 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.610
with knowledge comes power and so the
more that the lay public understands

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620
more that the lay public understands
 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.620
more that the lay public understands
about what we're learning in genetics

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630
about what we're learning in genetics
 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.410
about what we're learning in genetics
the more they can then understand how it

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420
the more they can then understand how it
 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.930
the more they can then understand how it
would be useful to them so i think it's

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940
would be useful to them so i think it's
 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.790
would be useful to them so i think it's
a very very exciting time but i think

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800
a very very exciting time but i think
 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.310
a very very exciting time but i think
that there's also a responsibility to be

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320
that there's also a responsibility to be
 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.310
that there's also a responsibility to be
able to discuss things in a very open

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320
able to discuss things in a very open
 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.760
able to discuss things in a very open
way that makes clear what implications

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770
way that makes clear what implications
 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.390
way that makes clear what implications
are and what the implications aren't

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400
 
 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.130
 
depends on what you mean by genetic

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140
depends on what you mean by genetic
 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.039
depends on what you mean by genetic
manipulation and sense of we do genetic

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049
manipulation and sense of we do genetic
 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.030
manipulation and sense of we do genetic
manipulation in the laboratory all the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040
manipulation in the laboratory all the
 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.960
manipulation in the laboratory all the
time to try and test ideas about how

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970
time to try and test ideas about how
 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.350
time to try and test ideas about how
genes work so we will take cells and we

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360
genes work so we will take cells and we
 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.289
genes work so we will take cells and we
will change the the genes in those cells

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299
will change the the genes in those cells
 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.539
will change the the genes in those cells
and then be able to ask what is the

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549
and then be able to ask what is the
 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:11.979
and then be able to ask what is the
consequence of that change that's

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989
consequence of that change that's
 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.929
consequence of that change that's
basically doing an experiment we do that

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939
basically doing an experiment we do that
 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.490
basically doing an experiment we do that
with mice as well if we want to

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500
with mice as well if we want to
 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.170
with mice as well if we want to
understand for instance we wanted to

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180
understand for instance we wanted to
 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.630
understand for instance we wanted to
understand what would happen if a cancer

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640
understand what would happen if a cancer
 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.250
understand what would happen if a cancer
cell didn't have telomerase could it

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260
cell didn't have telomerase could it
 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.530
cell didn't have telomerase could it
still grow so we generated a mouse the

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540
still grow so we generated a mouse the
 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.660
still grow so we generated a mouse the
whole mouse doesn't have telomerase so

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670
whole mouse doesn't have telomerase so
 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.069
whole mouse doesn't have telomerase so
that's a genetic manipulation of the

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079
that's a genetic manipulation of the
 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.589
that's a genetic manipulation of the
mice but it was an important question to

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599
mice but it was an important question to
 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.649
mice but it was an important question to
know the answer what would happen if you

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659
know the answer what would happen if you
 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.629
know the answer what would happen if you
can completely get rid of telomerase so

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639
can completely get rid of telomerase so
 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.149
can completely get rid of telomerase so
i think that in that sense those kinds

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159
i think that in that sense those kinds
 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.559
i think that in that sense those kinds
of genetic manipulations are very

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569
of genetic manipulations are very
 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.800
of genetic manipulations are very
powerful tools that scientists have now

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810
powerful tools that scientists have now
 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.649
powerful tools that scientists have now
if you're talking about things like

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659
if you're talking about things like
 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.780
if you're talking about things like
human genetic engineering and those

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790
human genetic engineering and those
 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.149
human genetic engineering and those
kinds of things there are certainly

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159
kinds of things there are certainly
 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.610
kinds of things there are certainly
ideas about gene therapy that people

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620
ideas about gene therapy that people
 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.589
ideas about gene therapy that people
have put out there to solve various

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599
have put out there to solve various
 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.629
have put out there to solve various
diseases and some of the ones that

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639
diseases and some of the ones that
 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.759
diseases and some of the ones that

that are in the blood because blood
 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.150
that are in the blood because blood
cells are very accessible to changes and

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160
cells are very accessible to changes and
 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.439

those kinds of things don't worry me so
 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.699

back into cells people have found that

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000
back into cells people have found that
 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.509
back into cells people have found that
then those those genes can cause other

then those those genes can cause other
 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.879
then those those genes can cause other
changes which in some cases can lead to

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889
changes which in some cases can lead to
 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.189
changes which in some cases can lead to
cancer so there are clear technical

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199
cancer so there are clear technical
 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.469
cancer so there are clear technical

and shouldn't really be on the table I
don't think that anybody is really

of a single gene in the blood put that
 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.189
of a single gene in the blood put that
back in and know that the correction is

back in and know that the correction is
 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.010

we are very very far technically from
 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.520
we are very very far technically from
