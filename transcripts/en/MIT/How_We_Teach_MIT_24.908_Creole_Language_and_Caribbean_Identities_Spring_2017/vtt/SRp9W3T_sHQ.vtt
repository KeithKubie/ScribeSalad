MICHEL DEGRAFF: So one good
thing about this course

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.550
is that the students
who take it,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.510
they seem to already be
aware that there's something

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.770
that they need to, I would say,
unlearn about Creole languages.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.740
So because you can see
that in the answers

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.390
to the first
questionnaire I give,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.220
because I start the
course by asking them

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.690
some basic questions
to know where

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.070
they are in terms of what they
know about Creole languages.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.630
And I think most of
them, the answers

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.640
reflect what they
would have learned

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.040
in the typical linguistic
textbooks, which

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.760
I've been myself critiquing.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.370
So the idea that Creole
languages are mixed languages,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.400
and that makes them
special languages,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.210
exceptional
languages, or the idea

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.850
that Creole languages are
somehow oversimplified,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.012
they are reduced languages
that are lesser than others.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.720
So that came up in
some of their answers.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.440
But at the same time, many of
them, from the very beginning,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.700
they would share
very, I would say,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.349
fine answers in terms
of understanding

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.500
that Creole languages emerged
in the context of very

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.230
drastic power imbalance.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.810
And as such,
attitudes towards them

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.490
reflect this power imbalance.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.280
And so they came
ready to critique

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.190
what they had learned in the
linguistic textbooks, which

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.570
to me was very heartening
to start the course with.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.530
So one way that we start by
unpacking these misconceptions

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.910
is by comparing attitudes
towards languages

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.210
with attitudes towards
race and ethnicity.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.940
And what they get
to see very quickly

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.850
is that, in fact,
there is perhaps

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.770
as much misconceptions
about language

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.950
as there is about race.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.410
So they get to see very
early in the course

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.655
that language can be
used as a proxy for race.

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:57.090
Though now it's impolite to
say certain things about, say,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.510
black people or Asian
people, yet it's

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.560
still polite to say pretty
negative things about language.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.240
And then at that
point what we do,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.780
we introduce some basic
linguistic analysis

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.930
tools for them to be
able to see that in terms

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.730
of linguistic
structure, there is

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.120
nothing at all that's inferior
about Creole languages.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.120
In fact, what we do from the
very beginning is to show that,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.010
structurally,
there are patterns,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.970
both in the syntax or
morphology of Creole languages,

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.430
that are quite
similar to patterns

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.730
in the syntax and history
of English or French,

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.060
of Mandarin Chinese.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.010
And so they quickly get
a sense that empirically

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.210
and theoretically, one cannot
argue that Creole languages are

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.900
any way lesser than
non-Creole languages,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.080
the same way that there are no
biological measures that would

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.200
deem black people to be
inferior to white people.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.330
So they get very
quick to understand

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.990
the power of this myth
that, often, they themselves

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.190
have brought along
in terms of how

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.920
they view different languages--
in some cases Creole languages,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.170
and in other cases just
even dialects of English,

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.360
say, Southern English
or black English.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.440
They are attitudes that
are very demeaning to us

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.570
as varieties that have no basis
in science, that are rooted

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.270
in hierarchies of power.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.589
And they get to see
that very quickly.
