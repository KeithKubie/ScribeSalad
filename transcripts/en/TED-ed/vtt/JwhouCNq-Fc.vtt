00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:11.069
Muhammad Ali spent years training
to become the greatest boxer

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:13.520
the world had ever seen,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.149
but only moments to create
the shortest poem.

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:21.250
Ali captivated Harvard's 
graduating class in 1975

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.680
with his message of unity and friendship.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.371
When he finished, 
the audience wanted more.

00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:29.060
They wanted a poem.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.962
Ali delivered what is considered
the shortest poem ever.

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:35.661
"Me, we."

00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:38.271
Or is it "me, weeee"?

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:39.481
No one's really sure.

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:45.471
Regardless, if these two words are a poem,
then what exactly makes a poem a poem?

00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:48.101
Poets themselves have struggled
with this question,

00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:51.605
often using metaphors to approximate
a definition.

00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:53.680
Is a poem a little machine?

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.765
A firework?

00:00:54.765 --> 00:00:55.821
An echo?

00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:57.010
A dream?

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.352
Poetry generally has certain
recognizable characteristics.

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:05.551
One - poems emphasize language's
musical qualities.

00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:08.481
This can be achieved through
rhyme, rhythm, and meter,

00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:09.979
from the sonnets of Shakepeare,

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.542
to the odes of Confucius,

00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:13.852
to the Sanskrit Vedas.

00:01:13.852 --> 00:01:16.556
Two - poems use condensed language,

00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:20.492
like literature with all the water
wrung out of it.

00:01:20.492 --> 00:01:23.872
Three - poems often feature
intense feelings,

00:01:23.872 --> 00:01:25.875
from Rumi's spiritual poetry

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:29.312
to Pablo Neruda's "Ode to an Onion."

00:01:29.312 --> 00:01:33.883
Poetry, like art itself, has a way
of challenging simple definitions.

00:01:33.883 --> 00:01:36.303
While the rhythmic patterns 
of the earliest poems

00:01:36.303 --> 00:01:40.163
were a way to remember stories
even before the advent of writing,

00:01:40.163 --> 00:01:42.703
a poem doesn't need to be lyrical.

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:44.251
Reinhard Döhl's “Apfel”

00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:46.649
and Eugen Gomringer's "silencio"

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.160
toe the line between visual art
and poetry.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.556
Meanwhile, E.E. Cummings wrote poems
whose shapes were as important

00:01:53.556 --> 00:01:55.420
as the words themselves,

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.909
in this case amplifying the sad loneliness
of a single leaf falling through space.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.569
If the visual nature of poetry
faded into the background,

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.989
perhaps we'd be left with music,

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:10.600
and that's an area that people
love to debate.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.669
Are songs poems?

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:16.189
Many don't regard songwriters as poets
in a literary sense,

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.689
but lyrics from artists like Paul Simon,

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:19.788
Bob Dylan,

00:02:19.788 --> 00:02:21.159
and Tupac Shakur

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.829
often hold up even without the music.

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.049
In rap, poet elements like rhyme,
rhythm, and imagery

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.529
are inseparable from the form.

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.359
Take this lyric from the Notorious B.I.G.

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.727
"I can hear sweat trickling 
down your cheek

00:02:34.727 --> 00:02:37.019
Your heartbeat sound 
like Sasquatch feet

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.801
Thundering, shaking the concrete."

00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:43.298
So far, all the examples we've seen
have had line breaks.

00:02:43.298 --> 00:02:48.045
We can even imagine the two words
of Ali's poem organizing in the air -

00:02:48.045 --> 00:02:50.258
Me, We.

00:02:50.258 --> 00:02:53.304
Poetry has a shape 
that we can usually recognize.

00:02:53.304 --> 00:02:57.209
Its line breaks help readers navigate
the rhythms of a poem.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.628
But what if those line breaks disappeared?

00:02:59.628 --> 00:03:02.118
Would it lose its essence as a poem?

00:03:02.118 --> 00:03:03.433
Maybe not.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.237
Enter the prose poem.

00:03:05.237 --> 00:03:07.989
Prose poems use vivid images
and wordplay

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.271
but are formatted like paragraphs.

00:03:11.271 --> 00:03:15.343
When we look at poetry less as a form
and more as a concept,

00:03:15.343 --> 00:03:18.149
we can see the poetic all around us:

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:19.378
spiritual hymns,

00:03:19.378 --> 00:03:22.249
the speeches of orators like
Martin Luther King, Jr.,

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:23.179
JFK,

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:24.590
and Winston Churchill,

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.429
and surprising places like social media.

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:33.140
In 2010, journalist Joanna Smith tweeted
updates from the earthquake in Haiti.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.091
"Was in b-room getting dressed
when heard my name.

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:38.811
Tremor. Ran outside through sliding door.

00:03:38.811 --> 00:03:42.531
All still now. Safe. Roosters crowing."

00:03:42.531 --> 00:03:46.061
Smith uses language in a way
that is powerful, direct,

00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:48.261
and filled with vivid images.

00:03:48.273 --> 00:03:50.723
Compare her language to a haiku,

00:03:50.723 --> 00:03:55.823
the ancient Japanese poetic form 
that emphasizes bursts of brief intensity

00:03:55.823 --> 00:04:00.684
with just three lines of five, 
seven, and five syllables.

00:04:00.684 --> 00:04:03.632
The waters of poetry run wide and deep.

00:04:03.632 --> 00:04:05.504
Poetry has evolved over time,

00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:07.193
and perhaps now more than ever,

00:04:07.193 --> 00:04:12.854
the line between poetry, 
prose, song, and visual art has blurred.

00:04:12.854 --> 00:04:15.234
However, one thing has not changed.

00:04:15.234 --> 00:04:18.664
The word poetry actually began
in verb form,

00:04:18.664 --> 00:04:23.604
coming from the ancient Greek poiesis,
which means to create.

00:04:23.604 --> 00:04:28.144
Poets, like craftsman, still work with
the raw materials of the world

00:04:28.144 --> 00:04:29.992
to forge new understandings

00:04:29.992 --> 00:04:36.075
and comment on what it is to be human
in a way only humans can.

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:41.525
Dartmouth researchers tested this idea
by asking robots to pen poetry.

00:04:41.525 --> 00:04:45.024
A panel of judges sorted 
through stacks of sonnets

00:04:45.024 --> 00:04:49.054
to see if they could distinguish those
made by man and machine.

00:04:49.054 --> 00:04:53.012
You may be happy to know that while
scientists have successfully

00:04:53.012 --> 00:04:56.035
used artificial intelligence 
in manufacturing,

00:04:56.035 --> 00:04:57.035
medicine,

00:04:57.035 --> 00:04:58.575
and even journalism,

00:04:58.575 --> 00:05:01.255
poetry is a different story.

00:05:01.255 --> 00:05:04.805
The robots were caught red-handed
100% of the time.
