00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.910
So both of these mutations are nonsense mutations meaning they

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.180
both introduce stop codons. But one happens much sooner than the

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.390
other one does. So it's most likely to be more

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.730
severe. Think about it for a second. The earlier the mutation,

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.760
the nonsense mutation that comes in the sequence, the shorter

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.360
the overall protein's going to be. Which means if this nonsense

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.910
mutation happens at the very end of the sequence, okay

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.370
well we're not going to lose very much of our protein.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.150
But if it happens way up front, towards the beginning

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.700
of the sequence, then yeah we're going to lose a lot

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.520
of the proteins and it's probably going to have a major

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.080
effect because we're missing far more amino acids. Again while this

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.300
is a general rule, it is possible that sometimes there's

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.000
not as big of a difference, because you could imagine there's

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.060
certain parts of proteins that are more important than others. And

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.950
so even when you delete big stretches not too much happens.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.290
Still, in general, the sooner or the earlier a stop codon happens, a nonsense

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.750
mutation, the worse effect it's going to

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.720
have on the function of the overall protein.
