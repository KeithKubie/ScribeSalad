there are a lot of different ways to

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900
there are a lot of different ways to
 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.290
there are a lot of different ways to
think about what that means and what

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300
think about what that means and what
 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.390
think about what that means and what
that's about it could be that women were

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400
that's about it could be that women were
 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.670
that's about it could be that women were
to locked into being good women than to

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680
to locked into being good women than to
 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.350
to locked into being good women than to
say that they were unhappy I mean that

know greater honesty on women's part but
I think that if you look at what's

I think that if you look at what's
 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.149
I think that if you look at what's
happened over the last almost 40 years

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159
happened over the last almost 40 years
 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.070

hope that the women's roles will be

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920
hope that the women's roles will be
 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.679
hope that the women's roles will be
valued more but those traditional rules

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689
valued more but those traditional rules
 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.209
valued more but those traditional rules
still have not been are still not seen

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219
still have not been are still not seen
 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.179
still have not been are still not seen
as the most valuable part of culture and

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189
as the most valuable part of culture and
 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.779
as the most valuable part of culture and
so it's like the thing by which we've

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789
so it's like the thing by which we've
 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.499
so it's like the thing by which we've
we've known ourselves and that we have

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509
we've known ourselves and that we have
 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.090
we've known ourselves and that we have
you know by which we've understood how

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100
you know by which we've understood how
 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.660
you know by which we've understood how
to be in the world has been made not so

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670
to be in the world has been made not so
 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.179
to be in the world has been made not so
necessary and and yet the world of work

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189
necessary and and yet the world of work
 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.039
necessary and and yet the world of work
the workplace is still very much

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049
the workplace is still very much
 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.330
the workplace is still very much
structured as if it's for you know men

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340
structured as if it's for you know men
 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.219
structured as if it's for you know men
who have wives at home who are taking

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229
who have wives at home who are taking
 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.849
who have wives at home who are taking
care of the kids so we're in a very very

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859
care of the kids so we're in a very very
 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.899
care of the kids so we're in a very very
funny place we're kind of you know at a

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909
funny place we're kind of you know at a
 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.209
funny place we're kind of you know at a
point of a real transition in the

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219
point of a real transition in the
 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.060
point of a real transition in the
culture and I think that a large part of

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070
culture and I think that a large part of
 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.510
culture and I think that a large part of
women's unhappiness has to do with not

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520
women's unhappiness has to do with not
 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.720
women's unhappiness has to do with not
feeling where they're supposed to be and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730
feeling where they're supposed to be and
 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.510
feeling where they're supposed to be and
and I think the thing is that there that

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520
and I think the thing is that there that
 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.400
and I think the thing is that there that
there isn't a supposed to be any more

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410
there isn't a supposed to be any more
 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.830
there isn't a supposed to be any more
you know that there isn't a you know a

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840
you know that there isn't a you know a
 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.840
you know that there isn't a you know a
place that that is going to be safe for

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850
place that that is going to be safe for
 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.580
place that that is going to be safe for
women you know that that we can fall

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590
women you know that that we can fall
 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.920
women you know that that we can fall
lined and you know that week where we

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930
lined and you know that week where we
 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.290
lined and you know that week where we
can be secure I think that if you think

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300
can be secure I think that if you think
 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.930
can be secure I think that if you think
about what makes a lot of women around

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940
about what makes a lot of women around
 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.030
about what makes a lot of women around
the world happy or would make them happy

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040
the world happy or would make them happy
 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.050
the world happy or would make them happy
would be safety security in many ways

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060
would be safety security in many ways
 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.630
would be safety security in many ways
that world is gone particularly for post

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640
that world is gone particularly for post
 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.070
that world is gone particularly for post
modern women in the West and so what

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080
modern women in the West and so what
 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.280
modern women in the West and so what
what new do we do we have that would be

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290
what new do we do we have that would be
 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.770
what new do we do we have that would be
as as fulfilling and and and you know be

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780
as as fulfilling and and and you know be
 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.630
as as fulfilling and and and you know be
able to tap something very deep in us

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640
able to tap something very deep in us
 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.720
able to tap something very deep in us
that allows us to make a contribution

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730
that allows us to make a contribution
 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.979
that allows us to make a contribution
that question really hasn't been

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989
that question really hasn't been
 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.100
that question really hasn't been
answered yet and I think because of that

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110
answered yet and I think because of that
 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.569
answered yet and I think because of that
that at a deep level women because what

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579
that at a deep level women because what
 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.309
that at a deep level women because what
this study pointed to is that it's

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319
this study pointed to is that it's
 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.140
this study pointed to is that it's
actually women all over the globe it's

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150
actually women all over the globe it's
 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.940
actually women all over the globe it's
not just post modern Western women but

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950
not just post modern Western women but
 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.039
not just post modern Western women but
women all over the globe or reporting

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049
women all over the globe or reporting
 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.650
women all over the globe or reporting
less happiness and I think that that's

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660
less happiness and I think that that's
 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.229
less happiness and I think that that's
because women around the world can can

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239
because women around the world can can
 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.300
because women around the world can can
look and see options when they don't

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310
look and see options when they don't
 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.059
look and see options when they don't
have any and that that is a source of

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069
have any and that that is a source of
 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.979
have any and that that is a source of
unhappiness and those of us who do have

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989
unhappiness and those of us who do have
 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.559
unhappiness and those of us who do have
options say say but I don't know what to

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569
options say say but I don't know what to
 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.270
options say say but I don't know what to
do I don't know really what it what it

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280
do I don't know really what it what it
 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.400
do I don't know really what it what it
what I can do that will really make my

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410
what I can do that will really make my
 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.470
what I can do that will really make my
life meaningful and give me a deeper

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480
