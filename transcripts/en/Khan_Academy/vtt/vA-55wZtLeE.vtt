00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.210
Let's explore a few
more methods for

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.410
solving systems of equations.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.370
Let's say I have the equation,
3x plus 4y is equal to 2.5.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:24.080
And I have another equation, 5x
minus 4y is equal to 25.5.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.150
And we want to find an x and y
value that satisfies both of

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.220
these equations.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.260
If you think of it graphically,
this would be the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.850
intersection of the lines that
represent the solution sets to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.080
both of these equations.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.930
So how can we proceed?

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.520
We saw in substitution,
we like to

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.350
eliminate one of the variables.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.030
We did it through substitution
last time.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.720
But is there anything we can add
or subtract-- let's focus

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.690
on this yellow, on this top
equation right here-- is there

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.200
anything that we can add
or subtract to both

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.330
sides of this equation?

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.290
Remember, any time you deal with
an equation you have to

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.240
add or subtract the same
thing to both sides.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.590
But is there anything that we
could add or subtract to both

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.410
sides of this equation
that might

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.069
eliminate one of the variables?

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.170
And then we would have one
equation in one variable, and

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.610
we can solve for it.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.460
And it's probably not obvious,
even though it's sitting right

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.050
in front of your face.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.620
Well, what if we
just added this

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.190
equation to that equation?

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.860
What I mean by that is, what if
we were to add 5x minus 4y

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.140
to the left-hand side, and add
25.5 to the right-hand side?

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.030
So if I were to literally add
this to the left-hand side,

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.830
and add that to the
right-hand side.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.340
And you're probably saying, Sal,
hold on, how can you just

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.870
add two equations like that?

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.830
And remember, when you're doing
any equation, if I have

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.400
any equation of the form-- well,
really, any equation--

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.650
Ax plus By is equal to C, if I
want to do something to this

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.460
equation, I just have to add the
same thing to both sides

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.470
of the equation.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.570
So I could, for example, I could
add D to both sides of

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.090
the equation.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.310
Because D is equal to
D, so I won't be

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.970
changing the equation.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.270
You would get Ax plus By, plus
D is equal to C plus D.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.170
And we've seen that multiple,
multiple times.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.500
Anything you do to one side of
the equation, you have to do

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.760
to the other side.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.350
But you're saying, hey, Sal,
wait, on the left-hand side,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.180
you're adding 5x minus
4y to the equation.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.090
On the right-hand side, you're
adding 25.5 to the equation.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.976
Aren't you adding two different
things to both sides

00:02:27.976 --> 00:02:28.840
of the equation?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.740
And my answer would be no.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.450
We know that 5x minus
4y is 25.5.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.160
This quantity and this quantity
are the same.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.630
They're both 25.5.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.660
This second equation is telling
me that explicitly.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.710
So I can add this to
the left-hand side.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.170
I'm essentially adding
25.5 to it.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.150
And I could add 25.5 to
the right-hand side.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.340
So let's do that.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.910
If we were to add the
left-hand side,

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.580
3x plus 5x is 8x.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.590
And then what is 4y minus 4y?

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.660
And this was the whole point.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.080
When I looked at these two
equations, I said, oh, I have

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.860
a 4y, I have a negative 4y.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.490
If you just add these two
together, they are going to

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.180
cancel out.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.670
They're going to be plus 0y.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.780
Or that whole term is just
going to go away.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:25.540
And that's going to be equal
to 2.5 plus 25.5 is 28.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.800
So you divide both sides.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.530
So you get 8x is equal to 28.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:38.600
And you divide both sides by 8,
and we get x is equal to 28

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.760
over 8, or you divide the
numerator and the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.200
denominator by 4.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.900
That's equal to 7 over 2.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.070
That's our x value.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.050
Now we want to solve
for our y value.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.930
And we could substitute
this back into either

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.550
of these two equations.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.820
Let's use the top one.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.830
You could do it with the
bottom one as well.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:08.280
So we know that 3 times x, 3
times 7 over 2-- I'm just

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.510
substituting the x value we
figured out into this top

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.130
equation-- 3 times 7 over 2,
plus 4y is equal to 2.5.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.589
Let me just write that as 5/2.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.410
We're going to stay in
the fraction world.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.670
So this is going to be 21 over
2 plus 4y is equal to 5/2.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.510
Subtract 21 over 2
from both sides.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.310
So minus 21 over 2,
minus 21 over 2.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.700
The left-hand side-- you're just
left with a 4y, because

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.930
these two guys cancel out--
is equal to-- this is 5

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.220
minus 21 over 2.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.060
That's negative 16 over 2.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.730
So that's negative 16 over 2,
which is the same thing--

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.550
well, I'll write it out
as negative 16 over 2.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.030
Or we could write that-- let's
continue up here-- 4y-- I'm

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.340
just continuing this train of
thought up here-- 4y is equal

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.400
to negative 8.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.550
Divide both sides by
4, and you get y is

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.010
equal to negative 2.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.150
So the solution to this equation
is x is equal to 7/2,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.510
y is equal to negative 2.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.650
This would be the coordinate
of their intersection.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.180
And you could try it out
on both of these

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.130
equations right here.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.500
So let's verify that it also

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.330
satisfies this bottom equation.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:42.930
5 times 7/2 is 35 over 2 minus
4 times negative 2, so minus

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.170
negative 8.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:52.620
That's equivalent to-- let's
see, this is 17.5 plus 8.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.070
And that indeed does
equal 25.5.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.970
So this satisfies
both equations.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.400
Now let's see if we can use
our newly found skills to

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.580
tackle a word problem, our
newly found skills in

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.440
elimination.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.460
So here it says, Nadia and Peter
visit the candy store.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.970
Nadia buys 3 candy bars and 4
Fruit Roll-Ups for $2.84.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.700
Peter also buys 3 candy bars,
but can only afford 1

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.430
additional Fruit Roll-Up.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.950
His purchase costs $1.79.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.030
What is the cost of each candy
bar and each Fruit Roll-Up?

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.310
So let's define some
variables.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.650
Let's just use x and y.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:40.720
Let's let x equal cost of candy
bar-- I was going to do

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.830
a c and a f for Fruit Roll-Up,
but I'll just stick with x and

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.290
y-- cost of candy bar.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:53.020
And let y equal the cost
of a Fruit Roll-Up.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.260
All right.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.310
So what does this first
statement tell us?

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.060
Nadia buys 3 candy bars, so the
cost of 3 candy bars is

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.310
going to be 3x.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.950
And 4 Fruit Roll-Ups.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.570
Plus 4 times y, the cost
of a Fruit Roll-Up.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.340
This is how much Nadia spends.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.480
3 candy bars, 4 Fruit
Roll-Ups.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.960
And it's going to cost $2.84.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.980
That's what this first
statement tells us.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.210
It translates into
that equation.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.390
The second statement.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:35.750
Peter also buys 3 candy bars,
but could only afford 1

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.550
additional Fruit Roll-Up.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.300
So plus 1 additional
Fruit Roll-Up.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.250
His purchase cost is
equal to $1.79.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.210
What is the cost of each candy
bar and each Fruit Roll-Up?

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.040
And we're going to solve
this using elimination.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.270
You could solve this using any
of the techniques we've seen

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.390
so far-- substitution,
elimination, even graphing,

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.650
although it's kind of
hard to eyeball

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.020
things with the graphing.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.570
So how can we do this?

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.200
Remember, with elimination,
you're going to add-- let's

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.990
focus on this top equation
right here.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.380
Is there something we could
add to both sides of this

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.910
equation that'll help us

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.170
eliminate one of the variables?

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.240
Or let me put it this way, is
there something we could add

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.100
or subtract to both sides of
this equation that will help

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.550
us eliminate one of
the variables?

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.950
Well, like in the problem we
did a little bit earlier in

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.860
the video, what if we were to
subtract this equation, or

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.500
what if we were to subtract 3x
plus y from 3x plus 4y on the

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.799
left-hand side, and subtract
$1.79 from

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.030
the right-hand side?

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.590
And remember, by doing that, I
would be subtracting the same

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.909
thing from both sides
of the equation.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.059
This is $1.79.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:44.830
How do I know?

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.170
Because it says this
is equal to $1.79.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.810
So if we did that we would be
subtracting the same thing

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.760
from both sides of
the equation.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.320
So let's subtract 3x
plus y from the

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.620
left-hand side of the equation.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.550
And let me just do this
over on the right.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:08.550
If I subtract 3x plus y, that is
the same thing as negative

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.680
3x minus y, if you just
distribute the negative sign.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.750
So let's subtract it.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:20.820
So you get negative 3x minus
y-- maybe I should make it

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.750
very clear this is not a plus
sign; you could imagine I'm

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.560
multiplying the second equation
by negative 1-- is

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.460
equal to negative $1.79.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.000
I'm just taking the
second equation.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.090
You could imagine I'm
multiplying it by negative 1,

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.440
and now I'm going to add the
left-hand side to the

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.310
left-hand side of this equation,
and the right-hand

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.160
side to the right-hand side
of that equation.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.450
And what do we get?

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.010
When you add 3x plus 4y,
minus 3x, minus y,

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.540
the 3x's cancel out.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.730
3x minus 3x is 0x.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.080
I won't even write it down.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.650
You get 4x minus-- sorry,
4y minus y.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.630
That is 3y.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:06.940
And that is going to be equal
to $2.84 minus $1.79.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.930
What is that?

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:12.980
That's $1.05.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.100
So 3y is equal to $1.05.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.903
Divide both sides by 3.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.700
y is equal to-- what's
$1.05 divided by 3?

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.980
So 3 goes into $1.05.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.340
It goes into 1 zero times.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.290
0 times 3 is 0.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.190
1 minus 0 is 1.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.620
Bring down a 0.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.800
3 goes into 10 three times.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.220
3 times 3 is 9.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.380
Subtract.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.170
10 minus 9 is 1.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.360
Bring down the 5.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.170
3 goes into 15 five times.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.740
5 times 3 is 15.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.630
Subtract.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.150
We have no remainder.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.910
So y is equal to $0.35.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:01.020
So the cost of a Fruit
Roll-Up is $0.35.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.930
Now we can substitute back into
either of these equations

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.720
to figure out the cost
of a candy bar.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.470
So let's use this bottom
equation right here.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.680
Which was originally, if you
remember before I multiplied

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:22.840
it by negative 1, it was 3x
plus y is equal to $1.79.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:29.590
So that means that 3x plus the
cost of a Fruit Roll-Up, 0.35

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.090
is equal to $1.79.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:39.470
If we subtract 0.35 from both
sides, what do we get?

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.110
The left-hand side-- you're just
left with the 3x; these

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.530
cancel out-- is equal
to-- let's see, this

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.750
is $1.79 minus $0.35.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.000
That's $1.44.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.670
And 3 goes into $1.44, I think
it goes-- well, 3 goes into

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:03.250
$1.44, it goes into
1 zero times.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.280
1 times 3 is 0.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.540
Bring down the 1.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.190
Subtract.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.380
Bring down the 4.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.970
3 goes into 14 four times.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.130
4 times 3 is 12.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.360
I'm making this messy.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.260
14 minus 12 is 2.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.750
Bring down the 4.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.440
3 goes into 24 eight times.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.820
8 times 3 is 24.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.250
No remainder.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.740
So x is equal to 0.48.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.660
So there you have it.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.760
We figured out, using
elimination, that the cost of

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.030
a candy bar is equal to $0.48,
and that the cost of a Fruit

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.800
Roll-Up is equal to $0.35.
