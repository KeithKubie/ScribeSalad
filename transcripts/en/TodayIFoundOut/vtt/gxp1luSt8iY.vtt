00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.639
Hello I’m Simon Whistler, you’re watching
the Today I Found Out YouTube channel and

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.330
in the video today we’re looking at why
beans give you gas.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.200
It’s the job of your digestive system to
break down the foods you take in, allowing

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.610
the nutrients to “cross-over” into the
different body systems and organs for use

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.610
as fuel.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.350
Each different part breaks these foods down
differently.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.789
For example, the mouth chews it up into smaller
parts, and the stomach uses enzymes and acids

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.300
to further break it down.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.920
The food then goes to the small intestine
where most of the nutrients that come from

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.670
our food (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates)
get absorbed into the bloodstream by a process

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.160
called diffusion.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.970
What is left over is then passed to the large
intestine whose main job is the absorption

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.010
of water that remains in the indigestible
residue of food.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.050
A smaller role of the large intestine is also
to break down polysaccharides (fiber) that

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.309
gets passed into it.

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.079
One type of fiber prevalent in beans is oligosaccharides.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.170
Oligosaccharides are basically sugar molecules
that are made up of several different types

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.329
of monosaccharides (usually 2-10) to form
a polymer.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.700
An enzyme that would break these molecules
down does not exist anywhere inside the human

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.700
body.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.060
Therefore, when they pass into the large intestine,
they serve as food for the countless microbes

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.060
present.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.990
While the microbes are processing these substances,
they release several different types of gases,

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.779
mainly hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:25.469
Don’t be concerned about these particular
gases, they are stench-free!

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.950
Your fetid flatulence affliction is from a
different source.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.130
Specifically, about one-third of the microbes
end up producing methane as a result of breaking

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.520
down these sugars.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.350
Once the methane builds up to the point that
it begins to produce pressure on your anal

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.350
sphincter…

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.279
That’s when the smelly magic happens…

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:48.739
Microbes breaking down these otherwise indigestible
substances is important for our health as

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:52.869
one of the by-products of this is the creation
of various vitamins that get absorbed into

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.989
the body, as well as for the production of
antibodies that help fight off certain types

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:58.139
of infections.

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:02.989
The downside is that the gaseous side effect
of these bacterial processes tends to clear

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.119
rooms everywhere.

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.720
You might have resigned yourself to the fact
you can never eat beans before going on a

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.459
first date, but fret not!

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.129
There are some methods to prevent your noxious
abdominal expulsions.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.110
For instance, there is a type of mold called
Aspergillus niger that contains an enzyme

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.150
(Alpha-Galactosidase) that will break down
oligosaccharides, preventing your large intestinal

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.319
bacteria from creating gas.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.420
You can buy it at stores everywhere under
the auspicious name “Beano.”

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.659
If you don’t want to be seen sprinkling
your beans with this product, you can always

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.120
try soaking your beans in water for several
hours before you make your food.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.000
This softens the beans and allows them to
ferment.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.989
The yeast produced can consume the offending
oligosaccharides and help leave your dinner

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:45.970
date vapor-free!
