&gt;&gt; NO.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.148 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:40.206 align:start position:0% line:91%
NERDY ASPIRATIONS THAT GOT THEM

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:18.644 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO.

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:19.278 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ZERO.

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.514 size:84% position:42% line:85%

BECAUSE YOU CAN MAKE A REAL
DIFFERENCE IN THE LIFE OF A

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:30.623 size:84% position:42% line:85%
FORMER AARON SCHOCK INTERN.

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:34.360 align:start position:0% line:91%
I STARTED A  TRIPSTARTER
CAMPAIGN TO SEND THE INTERNS

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:37.897 size:81% position:41% line:91%
TO ALL THE EXCURSIONS THEY
WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TO GO ON

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.365 size:81% position:41% line:85%
IF SCHOCK HADN'T RESIGNED.

&gt;&gt; IT IS, IT IS. IT IS!

00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:55.348 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: EVEN WHEN IT'S HOT
OUT AND THEY'RE STILL

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.349 align:start position:0% line:85%
WEARING THE SWEATERS.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:57.417 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
