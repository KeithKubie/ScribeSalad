into that causes this and I think that
there's again this tacit agreement about

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440

that this pushback that we have to give

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
that this pushback that we have to give

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.289
this public perception that we disagree
with someone engaging in the same

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299
with someone engaging in the same
 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.280
with someone engaging in the same
behavior that I to engage

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290
 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.930
i-i think because

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940
i-i think because
 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.030
i-i think because
getting back to the point that I'm not

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040
getting back to the point that I'm not
 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.260

what the variable comes into play I
think that again there is this cultural

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410
think that again there is this cultural
 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.630
think that again there is this cultural
expectation and this cultural standard

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640
expectation and this cultural standard
 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.490
expectation and this cultural standard
that there are certain things a woman

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500
